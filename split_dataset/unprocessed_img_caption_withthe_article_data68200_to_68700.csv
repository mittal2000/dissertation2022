But where do these patches come from? Scientists previously thought that piebald patterns form when pigment-producing cells move too slowly to cover the entire body of a mammal while it's still growing in the womb, resulting in white patches on the skin and fur.A new study published Wednesday contradicts that theory. Piebald patches may actually result from a failure of pigment-producing cells to multiply, Dr. Ian Jackson, professor of genetics at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post.""These cells originate from alongside the developing spinal cord and move through the developing skin so that they cover the whole body,"" he said. ""The piebald patches on animals, including humans, are almost always caused by a failure of these cells to fully populate the whole skin.""For the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers took a close look at how pigment-producing cells behave in mouse embryos that have a mutated gene called Kit, since such gene mutations are linked to piebald patches. Then, the researchers created a math model based on their observations.“In addition to Kit, there are many other genes that can create piebald patterns,"" Dr. Christian Yates, a mathematical biologist at the University of Bath in England and a co-author of the study, told The Telegraph. ""The mathematical model can explain piebald patterns regardless of the genes involved.""The model showed that although there were not enough pigment-producing cells to cover a mouse's whole body, they efficiently moved at random and spread though the whole skin.

""See that thing you’re feeling right now? That pain in your chest,"" Noah said after airing the clip of Obama on his show Wednesday night. ""That comes from watching someone weep on national television, because he knows that society can do better than to file the shooting of children under ‘shit happens.’ That feeling is how you know that you are human.”Some conservatives, however, were outraged by the president's behavior. Numerous commentators on Fox News, like Melissa Francis and Meghan McCain, said they were infuriated that Obama didn't cry publicly after the recent San Bernardino and Paris attacks. Fox News' Andrea Tantaros said on Tuesday she would ""check the podium for a raw onion"" because she felt Obama's reaction was ""not really believable.""The incredulous Noah showed the clip of Tantaros' commentary and delivered a furious response.“Are you f**king kidding me? Shedding tears when you think of murdered children is not really believable? You know what, there is something here that’s not really believable: the fact that the rest of us have to share the title of human being with you.”We're not sure when Tantaros last cried, but we have one thing to say to Obama: thanks.Also on HuffPost:"
3,TECH,'Pebble Seizure Detect' Is A Brilliant Use For Smartwatches That Could Save Lives,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pebble-seizure-detect_us_568d24c2e4b0a2b6fb6e065d,Wearables can detect seizures and notify friends and family.,2016-01-07,A look at the Pebble Seizure Detect app on the original Pebble smartwatch.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568d93b61f0000b201e9d271.jpeg?ops=crop_0_420_2448_2024%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Forget the Apple Watch -- that's what the man behind a potentially lifesaving app for people with epilepsy did.Ryan Clark, a video game developer, has created an app for the popular Pebble smartwatch that can detect when a user is experiencing an epileptic seizure and can notify selected contacts. The basic idea, as noted by New Scientist on Tuesday, is to use the watch's built-in accelerometer to identify movement patterns consistent with a seizure and send a text message to friends or family members who could help.While other wearables like the Apple Watch also contain accelerometers, the Pebble provides a unique opportunity for app developers.""The main goals of this app are to improve the safety of people with seizure disorders, to give back a measure of independence and to give family and friends a way to help in times of need,"" Clark told The Huffington Post in an email Wednesday.It is estimated that 50,000 people die in the U.S. each year as a result of seizures or seizure-related causes.There are a few good reasons why ""Pebble Seizure Detect"" only works on Pebble watches.""I have various concerns with non-Pebble devices such as the Apple Watch,"" Clark told HuffPost. ""First is the price -- people with disabilities often have financial challenges to deal with, and the Apple Watch is far more expensive than a Pebble.""The Pebble starts at $99.99, while the Apple Watch starts at $349.Another issue: Rival smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Moto 360 won't let you load just any program. The Pebble, meanwhile, has simple development tools for app makers and allows device owners to download and install open-source programs -- you don't need to rely on approved software from the Apple's App Store, in other words.Angela Ostrom, the chief operating officer of the Epilepsy Foundation, told HuffPost that monitoring devices can be a huge help for those who experience seizures.""While no device yet can prevent [Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy] and not all seizures can be detected by devices, many families and individuals can benefit from devices that help detect certain seizure activity or alert people of a possible seizure,"" Ostrom said.""This peace of mind can allow a caregiver to monitor a seizure, help reposition an individual to ensure they are breathing, and seek medical attention if required,"" she added.Pebble Seizure Detect isn't perfect, though. There's a liability concern, for example. The app isn't approved by the Food and Drug Administration, so it can't be certified as a ""medical device,"" Clark says. Since it's not on an app store, users actually have to download a few different parts and put the app together themselves, so responsibility rests on their shoulders. (There are clear instructions online.)There are physical limitations, too. Pebble Seizure Detect isn't scientifically proven. The app won't really work if the wearer's arm becomes trapped under their body during a seizure. It can give false positives, though there's a way to temporarily disable it. And while Pebble has a clear appeal as a relatively cheap and open gadget, its hardware isn't the most powerful.Clark concedes that souped-up smartwatches with heart rate sensors -- like the Apple Watch -- would be ideal, if only they'd support open-source apps.""A seizure-detecting app could do a much better job of detecting seizures (and avoiding false positives) if it could look for the heart rate fluctuations that often accompany the onset of a seizure,"" Clark told HuffPost.Still, this works well enough for Clark and his family. His wife Kathryn lives with epilepsy and told New Scientist that the app gives her peace of mind.""Once you get over the shock that you have seizures, you do have to get down to, OK, how am I going to live with them? This has been the answer in a lot of ways for us,"" she said. Clark isn't sure that his app will bring more attention to epilepsy, per se, but he does hope more people choose to learn about it.""Most people have a very rudimentary understanding of epilepsy, and they likely do not know how to provide first aid for a person having a seizure,"" Clark told HuffPost. He recommends refrencing Purple Day and the BC Epilepsy Society for further information."
4,ENTERTAINMENT,What Gets Lost When A Real Murder Becomes An Entertainment Craze,Jillian Capewell,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/middlebrow-making-a-murderer-true-crime_us_568d4530e4b0c8beacf5295d,When does our fascination with true crime go too far?,2016-01-07,"The media surround Steven Avery after his release from prison after serving 18 years, having been convicted of rape. DNA evidence cleared Avery of guilt.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568d46171f0000c000e9d14f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you had a few days off and an Internet connection toward the end of 2015, I wouldn't be surprised if you spent your time watching ""Making a Murderer.""Netflix's 10-part documentary series follows the story of Steven Avery, a Wisconsin man who was released from prison after 18 years serving time for a rape he didn't commit before being accused of the murder of Auto Trader photographer Teresa Halbach just a few years later.The show has attracted the same kind of frenzied discussion and national attention as the audio-only ""Serial"" did just about a year earlier with the murky case of Adnan Syed. It's fascinating to watch people go through the stages of consuming true crime, as I did myself: first, tentative interest, then a voracious need to watch without stopping, then the confused aftershock of realizing this kind of story, for all its engaging, salacious details (Rape and murder! Corrupt cops! Coerced confessions!), rarely ever ends tied in a neat bow.What was my role, we wonder after watching the Netflix series, in logging 10 hours observing this specific man's precarious situation? We pore over the details, analyze the outcome, deal with the ensuing rage ... but to what avail?I couldn't even wait until the end of the series to start looking for a prologue to the narrative presented by filmmakers Moira Demos and Laura Ricciardi. I hopped online and scrolled through passionate Reddit feeds debating whether or not Avery and his nephew Brendan Dassey did it. I found a Facebook group offering support for the convicted. From there, I reached the Change.org petition calling for President Obama to release Avery and Dassey. I had a brief thought to add my name to the list -- here was something I could do to reverse the miscarriage of justice! Here's where the true crime fascination turns uncomfortable: when it moves from an educational, illuminating case study of how the justice system can fail average citizens to a wave of outcry -- both for and against our protagonist -- from viewers-turned-detectives. The hours logged with this case in mind gives us a sense of agency over it, in some weird way, creating the desire to speculate and gush over it the same way we do any other TV show. When given the chance to read whodunit ""fan theories,"" I feel both the tug of ""oooh, let's investigate,"" and the sobering reminder that fellow humans, and not easily drawn fictional heroes and villains, are at the heart of this. There's a reason we don't turn to comment sections or Twitter polls to determine whether a man is guilty of a crime. Plus, it feels a little disingenuous: what percentage of listeners who cried foul at Syed's grating lawyer and unexamined alibis is still following his story today? How many names on that Change.org petition merely needed a place to put the indignation earned from watching the series?The same shrugging, well-I-don't-really-know feeling came again when reports started popping up in backlash to ""Making a Murderer."" Recent critiques have taken issue with the fact that the series appeared to want viewers to walk away thinking Avery and Dassey were unjustly imprisoned.Everyone's least favorite prosecutor, Ken Kratz, was quick to claim to reporters that Demos and Ricciardi intentionally left out evidence that made Avery look culpable (claims that Avery's defense lawyers have discredited). A relatively unknown entertainment site, Pajiba, posted a lengthy list of possible omissions viewers weren't privy to in the docuseries that paints Avery in a darker light.With unending Internet arguments on both sides, the only clear answer is: it's complicated. I'm not going to weigh evidence for and against here. I can only conclude with certainty that there is so much we don't know about Halbach's disappearance and death, and we likely never will, as much as we crave a resolution to this deeply sad tale.This isn't to say the discussion and possible corruption raised and unearthed by journalistic investigations isn't valid, nor welcomed; only that we should add in a few grains of salt to our media consumption cocktail. Even the most balanced storytelling gets shades of bias from its authors, who need to turn the sometimes-bland truth of what happened into a compelling narrative. That narrative creation plays a part in why jury duty is widely known as a soul-deadening burden of citizenship while ""Serial"" broke podcast downloading records.""Making a Murderer"" wouldn't be the hit it is today if it simply showed hundreds of hours of dry court testimony. It's easy to get swept up in the mystery of true crime until we remember the events on screen, well, truly did happen.There's a sobering moment in the middle of the series where a reporter explains how TV audiences love a grisly crime, a moment when you, the viewer, realize you're just as intrusive as the microphone-wielding pantsuits that pester Avery's mother when it's clear she doesn't want to talk to them. It's a difficult place to stand as a viewer: craving more information, more drama, and remembering that when the cameras are turned off, what's left are two actual, broken families and a flawed justice system, and questions we don't have any easy answers to.You can be highbrow.

5,POLITICS,11 Million Sign Up For Obamacare With Weeks To Go Before Deadline,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/11-million-obamacare_us_568ea495e4b0a2b6fb6f0fb5,The open enrollment period ends on Jan. 31.,2016-01-07,"Martha Lucia sits with an insurance agent as she picks a health plan at the Mall of the Americas in Miami on Nov. 2, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568ea4d7190000c90178b504.jpeg?cache=r1ClfWm5hx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Obamacare growth continues to outpace last year's sign-ups, with almost 11.3 million people enrolling into private health insurance plans via the exchange marketplaces through the last week of December, the Department of Health and Human Services disclosed Thursday.The open enrollment period on the exchanges lasts until Jan. 31, and the tally of enrollees has already exceeded the department's projection of 10 million for the full year. Although this total likely will come down in the coming months as some consumers drop their coverage or fail to pay their premiums, these findings suggest these marketplaces are performing above expectations so far. During the comparable period a year ago, 9.5 million had enrolled nationwide.Expanding the exchanges is key not only to covering more of the uninsured, but to stabilizing the new marketplaces for the future. More than sheer numbers, the makeup of the exchange customer base is crucial, especially after health insurance companies reported losses during the marketplaces' first two years because enrollees proved sicker and costlier than expected. That resulted in higher premium increases for this year compared to 2015, and raised concerns about the affordability of coverage on the exchanges.President Barack Obama's administration sees promising indicators in the first national report on sign-ups under the Affordable Care Act in 2016. So far, 3 million of the enrollees are new to the exchanges.In addition to a faster rise in enrollments since Nov. 1, 2015, than during the same period a year earlier, the Department of Health and Human Services touted the share of younger customers, who are vital to the financial success of the exchanges because they typically have fewer medical needs than older enrollees and because low-risk insurance customers are needed to cover the expenses for higher-risk ones. Thirty-five percent of enrollees so far are younger than 35, and 26 percent are between ages 18 and 34, the report says. In the states where residents use HealthCare.gov, more than 40 percent of those 35 years old or younger are new to the exchanges. These percentages are similar to those at the end of the 2015 sign-up period last March, but higher than those at the same stage of the enrollment push at the end of 2014, said Richard Frank, assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services, during a conference call with reporters. At the end of 2014, 29 percent of HealthCare.gov enrollees were under 35, and 23 percent were between 18 and 34, the department reported at the time.""What we are seeing is an uptick in new young consumers. We expect that to sort of accelerate as we hit the deadline,"" Frank said, which is what happened during the 2014 and 2015 enrollment periods.“We’re encouraged that marketplace consumers are increasingly young, engaged and shopping for the best plan. We have more work to do before the next deadlines and our focus continues to be the consumer experience and educating consumers about available financial assistance and their choices,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a press release.Of the 11.3 million people signed up through late December, 8.5 million used the federal HealthCare.gov system in place for residents of 38 states, while 2.7 million enrolled via the marketplaces operated by 12 states and the District of Columbia. Eighty-three percent of enrollees qualified for tax credit subsidies to reduce their monthly premiums, and the average value of the subsidies is $294. Mid-level ""silver"" insurance policies again proved the most popular, with 68 percent of enrollees choosing these options over bronze, gold, platinum or the very-high-deductible ""catastrophic"" plans available mainly to people younger than 30.During the past two enrollment periods, exchange officials stressed that enrollees should return to the marketplaces to shop for better deals rather than allow themselves to be automatically renewed into their policies. Volatile premiums -- including huge increases for some consumers -- are the main reason officials urged comparing plans and prices, and consumers have responded.Just over half of the 8.2 million 2015 enrollees seeking coverage for this year actively shopped before choosing a plan, and 6 in 10 of those people selected a new policy. That's higher than during the previous sign-up campaign, and higher than the rate in other segments of the insurance market, said Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, during the conference call. In addition, the closure of a dozen health insurers and enrollment freezes at others forced hundreds of thousands of consumers to seek new coverage this year.One factor that could encourage more people to sign up this year -- and larger numbers of young adults, in particular -- is that the tax penalty for not having health insurance is set to increase substantially, to a minimum of $695 per adult and $347.50 per child and to a maximum that could be thousands of dollars, depending on family size and household income.Also on HuffPost:"

If they think animals should have the right of copyright they're free ... under the Constitution to do that.""",2016-01-07,Who owns the copyright to this monkey-snapped selfie? The question has sparked a heated debate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568e3164190000190178b45c.jpeg?cache=7K2ZsqUN5r&ops=crop_0_95_800_759%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"It was the selfie seen around the world; a toothy snap taken inadvertently by a grinning macaque monkey.As the selfie went viral, a question arose: Just who owned the copyright to this extraordinary photograph -- the monkey, the photographer whose camera was left unattended or the public?On Wednesday, a federal judge in San Francisco added a voice of authority to the heated debate, ruling that the monkey does not have ownership of the selfie. U.S. District Judge William Orrick said in a tentative opinion that “while Congress and the president can extend the protection of law to animals as well as humans, there is no indication that they did so in the Copyright Act,” The Associated Press reported.“I’m not the person to weigh into this,"" Orrick said, per Ars Technica. “This is an issue for Congress and the president. If they think animals should have the right of copyright they're free, I think, under the Constitution, to do that.""The story of the monkey selfie began in 2011 when British nature photographer David Slater was in Sulawesi, Indonesia, taking photographs of endangered crested macaques.The photographer left his camera unattended on a tripod for a few moments, and the curious animals snatched the device and began playing with it. It was then that a macaque named Naruto snapped the famous selfie of himself.Since then, a battle for the copyright of the photo has raged.Slater contends that the copyright of the image belongs to him. He has taken issue with people freely distributing the photo, saying he's suffered financial losses since no one's paying him royalties. When Slater asked Wikimedia Commons to remove the photograph from its online collection, Wikimedia refused, claiming the photo belonged to the public domain as it was taken by an animal and not a human.Last year, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) upped the stakes in the debate when it filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Naruto seeking copyright ownership of the selfie.“While the claim of authorship by species other than homo sapiens may be novel, ‘authorship’ under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., is sufficiently broad so as to permit the protections of the law to extend to any original work, including those created by Naruto,” PETA said in the suit.Last September, Slater said he was “angry as well as sad” by PETA’s actions. “This makes animal welfare charities look bad which saddens me, deflecting away from the animals and onto stunts like this,” he wrote on Facebook.On Wednesday, Orrick said he would dismiss PETA's suit in an upcoming order, calling the group's argument a “stretch,” per Ars Technica.PETA said it plans to continue fighting for Naruto’s rights.“Despite this setback, legal history was made today because we argued to a federal court why Naruto should be the owner of the copyright rather than been seen as a piece of property himself,” said Jeff Kerr, a PETA attorney. “This case is also exposing the hypocrisy of those who exploit animals for their own gain.”In 2014, the U.S. Copyright Office said works “produced by nature, animals or plants” cannot be granted copyright protection, and are thus in the public domain. However, PETA argued that the copyright office policy “is only an opinion,” saying the U.S. Copyright Act itself does not contain language barring non-humans from owning copyrights.“The act grants copyright to authors of original works, with no limit on species,” said Kerr last year, per AP. “Copyright law is clear: It's not the person who owns the camera, it's the being who took the photograph.” Earlier on HuffPost:"

Cole, a major abortion case the court will hear in March that is widely seen as a threat to the landmark Roe v. Wade.The case involves a Texas law that imposes requirements on abortion clinics that, if implemented, would shutter all but about 10 of them -- and which critics say have little or nothing to do with advancing women's health.The document -- one of 45 ""friend of the court"" briefs rallying behind the clinics opposing the law -- is filled with personal stories from lawyers who ""believe that they could not have been the attorneys they have been or done the fine work that they have, were it not for their access to reproductive choice.""Signatories to the brief include former and current public defenders, government officials, judges, corporate attorneys, law professors, judicial clerks and others considered ""credits to the legal profession.""The narratives came from ""attorneys who care deeply about the Constitution and its protections, as women who have exercised their rights -- recognized and reaffirmed by this Court -- to liberty, dignity, and autonomy over their bodies and destinies, and on behalf of future generations of women lawyers,"" the brief said.""I often tell people -- and I believe it to be true -- that access to a safe, legal abortion saved my life,"" wrote one public defender from Oregon who underwent the procedure at 16 and later went on to graduate from an elite law school. She said access to abortion ""broke the familial cycle of teenage parenthood"" in her life.This focus on the personal -- and the emphasis on words such as ""liberty"" and ""dignity"" -- appears to be squarely aimed at Justice Anthony Kennedy, the high court's perennial swing vote in major constitutional cases, including last June's decision legalizing gay marriage. Some have theorized that personal connections in the justice's life form the impetus for his historic support for gay rights.But Kennedy's record on abortion rights is less certain, and personal stories may indeed play a role in convincing him that they matter.In 2007, the last time the Supreme Court decided an abortion case, he wrote the lead opinion upholding a federal ban on certain later-term abortion procedures. As Reuters' Joan Biskupic observed, Kennedy cited a brief in that case from women who had obtained abortions and later came to regret them.""While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon,"" Kennedy wrote in the case, ""it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained.""But maybe the Texas law is different, and these lawyer stories -- plus many others from women of all walks that have been submitted to the court -- may influence Kennedy's views and help him reaffirm a woman's right to choose as a matter of constitutional principle.One clue he may be headed in that direction: When lawyers for the Texas clinics asked the Supreme Court to provisionally block the Texas law last June, Kennedy voted with the liberal wing of the court and prevented it from going into effect.A decision in Whole Woman's Health v. Cole is expected by the end of June."

Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Real estate mogul Donald Trump and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have also come under attack, but neither their campaigns nor supportive outside groups have spent money to return fire yet. (Trump's case is complicated by the fact that he receives so much free media time that he doesn't really need to run ads.)Bush's Right to Rise super PAC is the busiest combatant at this juncture with ads criticizing Trump, Rubio, Cruz, Kasich and Christie. Once a frontrunner in the polls with the establishment's blessing, Bush is now stuck in the single digits in national and early-voting state averages. He's no longer even the leading establishment candidate in the race. This is particularly bad news for his hopes in New Hampshire, where Republican candidates closer to the center have historically performed well.Right to Rise began its attacks in mid-December with a spot that looked negatively on Trump, Rubio and Cruz. The ad ran in the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, with smaller buys elsewhere. Additional spots in December hit Rubio, Kasich and Christie in Iowa and New Hampshire -- and then Trump as well. The new year brought attacks on Rubio in Iowa and South Carolina and then Kasich and Christie in New Hampshire. (See one such ad below.)Rubio's super PAC, Conservative Solutions PAC, responded with an ad hitting Bush in Iowa. But the billionaire-backed group has begun to put most of its weight behind attacks on Christie, with a large ad buy in New Hampshire to begin 2016.The ads appear aimed to stall Christie's rise in the New Hampshire polls and protect Rubio's very precarious hold on second place. Currently, Rubio, Cruz and Christie are closely clustered in second, third and fourth in the HuffPost Pollster average, with Christie having the recent momentum. Trump has led by 10 or more points in New Hampshire since the end of August.Even Kasich is ahead of Bush in New Hampshire -- fifth versus sixth place -- though the Ohio governor is dawdling near the back of the pack in national polls. The pro-Kasich New Day for America has spent most of its time drumming up free media for its anti-Trump ads, but it has also run a spot in New Hampshire contrasting the governor with Trump, Rubio and Christie. The ad never mentions those candidates by name; it simply shows them in a split image alongside Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton while a narrator says, ""Unlike some, he's proven he can do the job.""Additionally, the pro-Kasich group has distributed anti-Christie flyers to New Hampshire voters.Neither Christie's campaign nor his America Leads super PAC has responded to these hits with their own paid ads yet. Instead, the campaign came out with an online video attacking the attacks -- specifically the ones from Rubio's super PAC. ""Significant division in the Republican Party leads to the same awful result: Hillary Rodham Clinton,"" Christie says in the video, which was posted Wednesday.Among all the candidates with good poll position in early-voting states, Cruz has been notably quiet on the airwaves. His outside armada has spent little on television advertising, sometimes to the chagrin of his other supporters. Keep the Promise I (not to be confused with Keep the Promise II and III) is the first pro-Cruz super PAC to launch attacks on another candidate.The group ran an ad in Iowa mocking a Rubio video in which he discusses fantasy football and suggesting that the Florida senator lacks the gravitas to defeat terrorist threats like the self-described Islamic State.Cruz's rise to first place in Iowa has even sparked reactions from the campaigns and supporters of the last two winners of that state's caucus -- although neither of those gentlemen looks likely to challenge in the actual voting.This month, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, winner of the 2012 Iowa caucus, released an ad that featured Cruz reading from Dr. Seuss' Green Eggs and Ham from the Senate floor. (In further grim news for Santorum, that probably violates rules prohibiting the use of congressional floor video in campaign advertising.)A super PAC supporting former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, the 2008 Iowa caucus winner, financed ads attacking Cruz in November and December. Pursuing America's Greatness also hit Rubio in November.Then there are the anti-Cruz ads run by two nonprofits with ties to the head of Huckabee's super PAC, Nick Ryan. Both the Iowa Progress Project and America's Renewable Future, an ethanol lobby group, have attacked Cruz in television and radio spots for his opposition to subsidies for renewable fuel like ethanol -- which is made from Iowa's cash crop: corn. All of the ads from these two groups are framed as issue advertising (they stop short of calling on voters to oppose Cruz), but they are clearly negative. And they have all been posted to the YouTube page of Ryan's Concordia Group.Missing from this back-and-forth are some once-notable candidates: retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. The lack of venom directed their way indicates how little competitive threat they now pose in the GOP race, at least in the other candidates' eyes.The recent ad launches are slightly ahead of the timeline set in the previous presidential election. At this point in the 2012 Republican presidential cycle -- 26 days prior to the Iowa caucus -- the biggest super PAC attacks were just beginning.Restore Our Future, the pro-Mitt Romney super PAC, began its advertising assault on Newt Gingrich with 25 days left before Iowa. The group wound up pouring $3.4 million into a scorched-earth campaign against Gingrich in that one state. It marked the first demonstration of what a single-candidate super PAC with close connections to a presidential candidate could accomplish: Romney just barely lost first to Santorum, while Gingrich had to settle for fourth.Gingrich's fall in Iowa led to his supporters starting their own super PAC, Winning Our Future. The group raised millions from billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson to fund an assault in South Carolina on Romney's record as a corporate raider closing down businesses and firing workers. That helped Gingrich win the South Carolina primary and paved the way for the Democratic narrative of Romney as avatar of the 1 percent.If 2012 is instructive, the residents of Iowa and New Hampshire should brace for a month of brutal attack ads.Also on HuffPost:"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568d7a9f1f0000c000e9d21c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Las Vegas Review Journal has named senior editorial writer Glenn Cook as interim editor, a move that could help steady the newsroom after a tumultuous four weeks. During a Wednesday afternoon meeting, Cook told staff he was not a candidate for the job on a permanent basis and tried to assure staffers that his conservative views, evident on the opinion page, would not influence news coverage, according to staff tweets.""Some of you might be concerned that, after being purchased by a family with right-of-center politics, the Review-Journal would tap a right-of-center opinion writer to lead the newsroom for a month or two,"" Cook told staff, referring to new owner, casino magnate and Republican donor Sheldon Adelson. ""But the tenacity and independence of this newsroom, proved time and again throughout our coverage of the Adelsons’ purchase,"" he continued, ""is proof that even if it were my intention to inappropriately influence content, none of you would allow me to get away with it.""Though Cook resides on the opinion side of the operation, he is well-respected among Review-Journal reporters and wrote the paper's Dec. 20 front-page editorial promising transparency after the paper's murky transaction. Cook told staff that he wouldn't have accepted the position if he believed ownership wanted to wield political influence through the Review-Journal's news pages, and referenced last month's editorial, which vowed to ""disclose, disclose, disclose"" when covering conflicts of interest involving the Adelson family. The Review-Journal, and several smaller Nevada papers, were sold on Dec. 10 to an undisclosed buyer for $140 million, sparking a mystery that quickly spread from Nevada to the national media. The paper's staff publicly criticized the new owner's lack of transparency and also reported out the story. Despite obstacles from management, the Review-Journal revealed on Dec. 16 that the sale was arranged by Adelson's son-in-law.“Obviously we wanted to report this first,” deputy editor James Wright told The Huffington Post the next day. “It was our paper and our story. When you don’t know who your owner is, there are questions about your ability to do your job, be objective. We felt like we had to have that first to maintain our credibility.""But the newsroom drama didn't end, as editor-in-chief Michael Hengel abruptly resigned the following week. Hengel later said that he'd read a Review-Journal editorial claiming he'd accepted a ""voluntary buyout"" before he'd even been formally offered one. Earlier this week, New Media Investment Group, which previously owned the Review-Journal and will continue operating it under the Adelson family's ownership, tried setting limits on how the paper covers its owner's interests -- much to the staff's dismay. (For the full monthlong saga inside the newsroom, see NYU professor Jay Rosen's timeline.)""We are excited that Glenn has agreed to assume this role and we know he will do a great job for the readers of the Review-Journal,"" New Media Investment Group CEO Mike Reed said in an email to HuffPost. Publisher Jason Taylor told staff Wednesday that management has had some internal interest for the editor's job on a permanent basis, according to Review-Journal features editor Stephanie Grimes. Taylor also said the Adelson family has so far had no involvement with the paper “beyond offering resources to recruit a new editor.”After the meeting, Cook emailed staff a new set of guidelines for covering the paper's ownership and its business interests. This story has been updated to include comment from Cook.Also on HuffPost:"

The number was not unusual, city officials said.""We are already carrying out the requirements of the executive order,"" De Blasio spokeswoman Karen Hinton said. The order ""merely requires all New York state localities follow many of the same requirements as New York City.""Cuomo's office did not respond to requests for comment.The city already provides emergency shelter to homeless people during freezing nights as part of its long-running Code Blue program, Hinton said, adding that the facilities are required to stay open all day and night regardless of the temperature.Homeless advocates agreed that the order, which applies to the whole state, appeared to change little for New York City.""There was no wave of folks coming in from the cold. It was another night of services in New York City,” said Alexander Horwitz, a spokesman for Doe Fund, which operates three shelters for adult men in the city.Giselle Routhier, policy director for advocacy group Coalition for the Homeless, said Cuomo should direct funds to creating more affordable units to house the homeless, including those suffering from mental illness.Forcing people off the streets temporarily would do little to help the city's rising homeless population, she said.The city, which counts about 58,000 homeless people sleeping in shelters on any given night and between 3,000 to 4,000 people living on the streets, last month doubled the number of its homeless outreach workers.

The number was not unusual, city officials said.""We are already carrying out the requirements of the executive order,"" De Blasio spokeswoman Karen Hinton said. The order ""merely requires all New York state localities follow many of the same requirements as New York City.""Cuomo's office did not respond to requests for comment.The city already provides emergency shelter to homeless people during freezing nights as part of its long-running Code Blue program, Hinton said, adding that the facilities are required to stay open all day and night regardless of the temperature.Homeless advocates agreed that the order, which applies to the whole state, appeared to change little for New York City.""There was no wave of folks coming in from the cold. It was another night of services in New York City,” said Alexander Horwitz, a spokesman for Doe Fund, which operates three shelters for adult men in the city.Giselle Routhier, policy director for advocacy group Coalition for the Homeless, said Cuomo should direct funds to creating more affordable units to house the homeless, including those suffering from mental illness.Forcing people off the streets temporarily would do little to help the city's rising homeless population, she said.The city, which counts about 58,000 homeless people sleeping in shelters on any given night and between 3,000 to 4,000 people living on the streets, last month doubled the number of its homeless outreach workers.

Chris Christie (R) may have cost his state’s taxpayers more than $1 million for travel mostly done to campaign for president, according to a WNYC analysis.A Wall Street Journal calculation of Christie administration figures found that the GOP contender spent all or part of 261 days out of the state in 2015 -- mostly on trips campaigning for the 2016 presidential nomination.WNYC estimates that if Christie’s per diem travel expenses were the same as in 2014 -- a year in which Christie’s less arduous travel schedule cost taxpayers $492,420 according to documents obtained by NJ Watchdog -- then his trips cost taxpayers over $1 million.Campaign trips for a sitting governor like Christie are especially costly, WNYC notes, because they require the use of state troopers to protect Christie for extended periods of time in the field, which presumably requires the incursion of overtime rates.The governor’s office did not confirm the use of overtime for state troopers accompanying Christie on campaign trips or respond to additional requests for comment from WNYC on how taxpayer funds are being used for the governor's campaign-related travel. An aide said he could not comment due to a forthcoming lawsuit from liberal groups accusing Christie of financial wrongdoing.WNYC also cited a Monmouth University poll that found that just 1 percent of New Jersey residents approve of using taxpayer dollars for campaign purposes.The issue of Christie’s absence from the state has prompted criticism from Democratic lawmakers and local newspaper editorial boards, the Wall Street Journal notes.Christie’s use of taxpayer dollars has drawn controversy in the past. A May report by NJ Watchdog found that he had used his expense account to spend $300,000 on food and alcohol during his time as governor, including over $82,000 on concessions at Giants and Jets games alone.It is unclear whether the news will affect Christie’s rising standing in the Republican presidential primary polls.Christie’s obsessive focus on New Hampshire appears to be yielding results. The governor now enjoys the support of 11 percent of Republicans in the Granite State, according to a polling average by HuffPost Pollster.Christie’s rise in the polls advances him to fourth place in New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary, behind Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. The last poll gauging Christie’s numbers, however, is from Dec. 22, 2015.Also on HuffPost:"

24,POLITICS,Militants In Oregon Are Pretty Sure They Won't Be Punished,Dana Liebelson and Ryan J.

But on a chilly Tuesday, the occupiers hanging around the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge said they weren't worried about getting into trouble with the law.“Absolutely not, because there’s been no laws broken,” said Grant, a young rancher from central Oregon who declined to give his last name. Grant said he might have to go home on Tuesday night to feed cows, but planned to return this weekend. “There’s been no trespassing signs, plus, anybody is allowed here -- this is public land,” he added.“We’re beyond that,” said a man standing outside a residential and maintenance building in a camouflage coat. He also declined to give his name, and claimed to have quit his job, and driven 24 hours to get here. “This land is Harney County citizens’ land and the state of Oregon’s land, and people who’d be concerned about that is the federal BLM [Bureau of Land Management], which we say has no claim upon this.” He added: “We think everything is just scare tactics.” For now, federal authorities seem determined to resolve the conflict peacefully, and avoid unnecessary confrontations with the armed protesters, who are led by the sons of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy. The occupiers want two local ranchers freed from federal prison, and federal land given to county residents. But even if the situation is resolved without violence, federal law and regulations provide a variety of ways for the federal government to go after the occupiers, legal experts told The Huffington Post.Although a lack of “no trespassing” signs won’t save those who’ve taken over the facility from potential charges, the measured law enforcement response does provide a slight potential complication for serious charges: With no law enforcement officials on location, there’s no one to give the militants a lawful order that they could disobey.Arizona rancher LaVoy Finicum said he’s already past the point of no return. In 2014, when he participated in the Nevada confrontation with Cliven Bundy, he said the feds were pointing guns at him. “Then, when I got out of that, our illustrious leader, Harry Reid, says I’m a domestic terrorist. Under that statute as a domestic terrorist, I think they could do whatever they want to me,” he said. “I think I’ve already crossed that bridge, don’t you?” he added. The 2014 Bundy standoff set a bad precedent, Heidi Beirich, the director of intelligence for the Southern Poverty Law Center, told The New York Times. “A year and half later, there have been no prosecutions whatsoever,” she said. None of the Oregon group's reported conduct thus far would appear to trigger any federal terrorism statute. Instead, the most aggressive approach that federal prosecutors in Oregon could reasonably take would be to accuse them of essentially stealing federal property. Federal law makes it a felony, with a sentence of up to 10 years, for anyone who “converts to his use” government property worth over $1,000 without authorization. The government buildings and off-road vehicles reportedly being used by the protesters without authorization would certainly be valuable enough to trigger the potential felony charge. But experts said they anticipated a less aggressive approach from the federal government, expecting misdemeanor charges or so-called petty offenses that are used to enforce regulations on federal land. That’s the same type of charge Black Lives Matter protesters faced outside a federal court building in St. Louis in August. Such charges could carry up to six months in prison, but typically result in probation.“It’s a fine balance for federal authorities, in that they want to deter conduct like this but they don’t want to make these people into martyrs or heroes,” said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor at Loyola Law School. Potential petty offenses may include trespassing, obstruction, disorderly conduct, littering or destruction of property. (Occupiers denied that they’ve damaged the property, and nothing on the exterior of the buildings suggested otherwise.) On Monday, at a press conference in Burns, Harney County Sheriff David Ward told reporters he had a message for the militants: ""It's time for you to leave our community, go home to your families, and end this peacefully.” But he didn’t explain what, if any, charges the occupiers might face if they took him up on the offer. Ward told Oregon Public Broadcasting on Tuesday that the FBI, ""has assured me that those at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge will at some point face charges."" He added: ""They have an opportunity right now to work towards a better solution, and not face further charges."" “I’m not going to do anything that is other than a peaceful, non-violent occupation,” said Michael Stettler, from Christmas Valley, Oregon, who said people didn't seem to be concerned about any legal ramifications. “When they turn the power off and people start shooting I will be leaving,” he added.This article has been updated to include the sheriff's comments to Oregon Public Broadcasting.Dana Liebelson reported from Oregon.

Shannon's IMDb page lists 11 films on his 2016 slate, proceeding memorable supporting work in four movies from 2015: He played a hoggish real-estate tyrant in ""99 Homes"" (which netted him Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations), an eccentric drug dealer in dude-pal comedy ""The Night Before,"" a gay-rights convert in ""Freeheld"" and a Macy's security guard in a ""She's Funny That Way"" cameo. When Shannon called up The Huffington Post right before Christmas, he had just finished a play in Chicago and was taking a deserved breather in New York, hanging out with his family before heading to this month's Sundance Film Festival to promote two movies. It sounds exhausting, but Shannon was in good spirits while we discussed his recent roles, including a forthcoming stint as Elvis Presley and an appearance in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.""You wrapped ""99 Homes"" in early 2014, and you're still talking about it as 2016 begins. That's par for the course with a lot of indie movies, especially ones that play the festival circuit. Does this feel like just another average year in the life of Michael Shannon?Well, I was very excited for “99 Homes” to come out. It’s a movie that I care deeply about and am proud to be associated with. I was very excited for it to be seen by the general public. Showing it at festivals is one thing, but particularly with a movie about this, which is about real people, getting it out to the said real people is very satisfying. Not that real people don’t go to festivals, but it’s a little bit more of a cloistered environment. But I don’t know -- I worked a lot both last year and this year. I’ve made a lot of, I guess what you would call indie films, that had very quick schedules, like five weeks or so. I was able to accumulate quite a long list of them. You make them so quickly. I rattled off like six in a row at one point, so now it’s just a question of when they’re all going to come out.A lot of cinephiles know you for smaller films like ""Take Shelter"" and ""Mud."" When you do so many little movies, how attached can you get to their shelf life?Yeah, you can’t have big expectations, really. I’ve done some pictures that no one has ever really seen or heard of. I think every actor or actress probably has similar stories. It’s something you hooked onto and then you feel like maybe five people saw it, if you’re lucky. But you just have to enjoy the fact that you’re there working, regardless of what the final end product is. It’s what I love to do, so as long as I get to do it. The only thing is, if you’re in films that don’t make a lot of money, then sometimes it makes it harder to get your films financed. That’s the one thing I get kind of paranoid about sometimes.Is there a movie you look back on that didn’t find an audience that you hoped would catch on?Oh yeah, there’s a couple, for sure. I made this movie with Jake Paltrow recently, “Young Ones,” that I thought was really lovely. And another movie I made a few years ago, “The Missing Person” -- I really like that movie a lot. But there’s a lot of movies out there, and people have a limited amount of time to watch them. Plus, TV’s so popular nowadays, it seems like most people would rather watch a TV show than a movie. Do you feel like people know you best for “Boardwalk Empire,” then?Oh, definitely. That’s what I seem to be most commonly associated with, if someone stops me on the street or whatever.You’re often affiliated with dark, menacing characters, from General Zod to the guys in ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""99 Homes."" It's not quite typecasting since every role has its own spark, but it's certainly part of your image. Where do you think that comes from?Hmm, I don’t really know. I guess I just seem to project a certain kind of gravity. I can’t account for it personally. I know I’m drawn to stories that are complicated and tend to have a lot of conflict in them, but that’s kind of the name of the game, really. You look at Greek drama and it’s pretty full of conflict. And I’m willing to take those parts on. I’m not afraid of some of the darker elements of humanity. I’m not judgmental about it -- I just try and understand why people do the things they do.In ""99 Homes,"" your character, Rick, capitalizes from evicting people who are trapped in deceitful loans after the housing-bubble burst. He's pretty relentless. Does it matter to you whether you can sympathize with someone like that before playing him?Well, I don’t think I necessarily need to have sympathy for him, but particularly in the case of “99 Homes,” a fellow like Rick Carver, as much as every other character in that story, is trying to figure out what to do. There’s a situation and a system, and you have to figure out what you’re going to do with that system. Dennis, the character that Andrew Garfield plays, is just trying to figure out how to deal with it, and Rick’s come up with his method of dealing with it. But at the end of the day, it’s the solution that makes sense to him.""The Night Before"" plays on that dark image, too. It's a broad Seth Rogen comedy, but your character is still this edgy stoner guy, and that was fun to watch. What was the pitch you received for that movie?Well, it wasn’t a huge commitment -- just a few days. They were like, “Oh, this would be something fun to do.” I enjoy comedy as much as anybody. It seemed like it would be a fun thing to do. It didn’t take a lot of time. I’ve spent a lot of time in Chicago and I actually did some improv, so I have some history in that area and it was nice to get to use it. I’ve never made a movie like that before, really.The stoner-burnout adult can be a cliché, but you bring something very casual and fresh to it. Did you have a particular approach in mind in terms of Mr. Green's mannerisms and persona, or, since you’re on the set for only a few days, does it just come to you when “action” is called? I didn’t think about it too much going into it. I just got there, and you put on the costume and come up with the look, and a lot of it is from my imagination, really. I see what you mean -- it can definitely be a cliché. But part of having fun with something, I think, is not over-analyzing it. It’s about just going off the cuff.Did you watch the “Dawn of Justice” trailer?No, I haven’t seen it. People say I’m in it. Am I in it? There’s some trailer or clip or something that has me in it. I’ve got people asking me about it, anyway. I haven’t seen anything to do with it. Does it look good? It does. I wanted to know if it captures the essence of the movie. The movie seems big, for lack of a better word. It’s a very big trailer.Yeah, well, I’m sure they’re coming up with something because they’re trying to build up this whole Justice League thing and they’re going up against the Avengers, so it’s pretty stiff competition.How long were you on the set?I wasn’t around it very much. It focuses a lot more on Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and, of course, Lex Luther.Is there a chance we'll see General Zod outside of “Batman v Superman”? Ha. Well, we’ll see how this one goes. Zod is, for all intents and purposes, dead, but I guess maybe some Frankenstein version of him could come back to life. I don’t know. Before I let you go, I have to ask about Elvis Presley. You're playing him in ""Elvis & Nixon"" this year. How did you prepare?To get into it, it was a real process of immersion. I went down to Memphis and hit all the spots that people go through, like Graceland and Sun Studio and the Lauderdale Courts -- where he lived as a teenager -- and downtown Memphis. It was just walking around, trying to soak that up, and watching his movies and listening to his music. I did a lot of reading and spent time with Jerry Schilling, who was one of Elvis’ closest friends. I spent a lot of time talking to Jerry.What advice did he offer?His primary concern was that a lot of the time the way Elvis is represented is very flamboyant, very over-the-top and almost kind of goofy. He was interested in taking a more sophisticated approach and thinking about the psychology of it, rather than getting the moves down or whatever. It was less about the external and more about the inner workings of the guy. We wanted to take a respectful approach and not just make him seem like a silly person.Will there be musical numbers?No, there are no musical numbers in the film. It’s a very contained film. It’s really about this trip that Elvis took to D.C., and it’s contained in a two-day period. Sometimes I feel like that can be more revealing than a giant biopic that tries to encapsulate someone’s whole life. It’s kind of hard to tell someone’s life story in 90 minutes, but sometimes if you really just focus on one particular incident, it gives you more time to get into the specifics. And Kevin Spacey does a bang-up job as Nixon, too.Snapshots are almost always better than cradle-to-grave biopics. Did you catch “The End of the Tour”? What you’re describing reminds me of Jason Segel in that movie.Oh, I loved “The End of the Tour.” I thought Jason was phenomenal in that. I saw that at Sundance last year and it really knocked my socks off. I really like that director, too, James Ponsoldt; I think he’s really great.This interview has been edited and condensed.

26,SPORTS,Here’s The Smart Thing The NFL Is Doing To Fix Its Dumb Catch Rule,Justin Block,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nfl-catch-rule-wide-receiver_us_568d4134e4b0c8beacf52463,"Finally, the NFL is asking wide receivers how to define a catch.",2016-01-06,"Dez Bryant hauls in a pass against the Packers, but the play ultimately didn't count as a catch. What?!",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568d552d190000c90178b33d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Another NFL regular season has flown by, and as the playoffs approach, there's more league-wide confusion over what constitutes a catch than ever. Because of a series of recent NFL catch rule changes, one of the most basic, commonplace plays in football has become a weekly puzzle for officials, players and coaches alike.The problem undoubtedly hit a tipping point this season, as players and coaches avidly spoke out against seemingly weekly controversial catch calls. In October, Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson told the Detroit Free Press he thought no one in the league even understood the catch rules. In December, recently fired Philadelphia Eagles head coach Chip Kelly flat-out admitted to local radio station 94WIP: “I don’t know what a catch is.""The speed of the game does no favor to the officials, but neither does their employer's rulebook: Halfway through the 2015 season, there were more coaches' challenges to a pass completion ruling than any other play, and more than half of those calls were overturned upon review -- the highest rate of any challenged play, according to ESPN. No catch is safe, upon review. With their ears to the streets, the NFL decided in December to convene a ""Catch Rule Committee"" to study the ongoing issue before March's Competition Committee meeting, where rule changes can be implemented. On Tuesday, the Catch Rule Committee held its first meeting, and a group of additional, warmly welcomed experts attended as well. While Johnson and Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant were not included in the first meeting despite expressing their desires to help the NFL clarify the rule, many people involved closely in the game were, including Green Bay Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson and legendary receivers like Randy Moss, Cris Carter, Steve Largent, Fred Biletnikoff and Tim Brown. Speaking to the NFL Network on Tuesday, vice president of officiating Dean Blandino acknowledged the problematic subjectivity of the rule before patting himself on the back for doing what the league should've done years ago: ask the people who have actually played the game at the professional level what the rule should be. ""What better way and what better people than former receivers? We had several former receivers to look at some plays, get some feedback,"" Blandino said.Yes, what a novel idea! Actually asking wide receivers -- you know, the guys doing the catching and whatnot -- what they think a catch is, and then creating a simple rule around their lived experiences would probably bring an end to the ""catch crisis."" Inclusion breeds trust, and given what's transpired between receivers and the league rule book this season, it's wholly necessary for effective change. Critically using wide receiver input to evaluate the catch rule is a welcome change for the NFL. Presumably, previous changes to the catch rule were forged behind giant steel doors atop of the NFL's ivory tower on Madison Ave. Tangibly, the NFL's catch rule changes have only served to invalidate amazing feats of football athleticism. The prime example: This infamous Bryant ""incomplete pass"" against the Packers last January. Bryant's subsequent outrage over the call (""It was a catch and they took it away"") caused enough of an uproar for the NFL to change the catch rule in July 2015. But instead of rewriting the rule so that Bryant's play would have been a game-changing catch, the league doubled down and wrote new rules to clarify that it wasn’t.Removed was the vague language about a player having to make a ""football move"" to rubber stamp a would-be catch -- the most subjective and heavily criticized part of the catch rule. In its place came equally confusing and subjective phrasing: ""clearly establish himself as a runner"" replaced ""football move,"" and nothing's made damn sense since. All of that was horrible. But in fall 2016, we should all expect a clear and simple catch rule in place. After all, NFL wide receivers are formally being heard out by a transparent NFL committee for the betterment of the league. The NFL is trying to do a good thing. What could go wrong? (Everything, of course.) To help everyone along this arduous process, let's put it this way: If it looks like a catch, walks like a catch and talks like a catch, it's probably a catch.

Although there's a larger debate over the wisdom of any and all mandatory minimum sentences (see more below), the five-year term that each man was ordered to serve is perfectly legal.The two ranchers reported to federal prison on Monday, and no haphazard insurgency will get them out.Federal and local authorities are responding in kind: They don't seem very impressed by the occupation so far.Which isn't to say there isn't something legitimate about the occupiers' grievances as they speak to the broader ills of the American system of punishment.The Hammonds' troubles began in June 2012, when a jury convicted them of ""maliciously"" setting fire to large swaths of federal land in 2001 and 2006 -- a federal crime carrying a mandatory minimum penalty of five years in prison. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which reviewed the Hammonds' sentences in 2014, explained that the jurors relied in part on testimony that during the 2001 fire, Steven Hammond told a teenaged relative to drop lit matches on the ground so as to ""light up the whole country on fire."" The blaze consumed 139 acres of public land, and apparently endangered the teen.The case would have been over had the trial court imposed the five years of imprisonment that the law mandates.

He proceeded to sentence Dwight Hammond to three months and his son to a year and one day in prison. Federal prosecutors appealed, arguing what they often argue when mandatory minimum sentences are at stake: that the law is the law and that judges have no discretion to deviate from it.The 9th Circuit agreed and essentially ruled the Hammonds' lesser sentences to be illegal. ""Given the seriousness of arson, a five-year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the offense,"" the appeals court said, before offering a lengthy list of ""far tougher sentences"" that the Supreme Court has upheld for arguably less-serious crimes, like stealing golf clubs and possessing small amounts of marijuana.The Hammonds, in turn, looked to the Supreme Court. In March of last year, the high court declined to hear their appeal. By then, the men had already served their shorter sentences and were under supervised release.Without any recourse left, the two ranchers had to accept their fate: five years behind bars, minus any time they had already served. Or as the 9th Circuit wrote when it threw out the original punishment, they had to be resentenced ""in compliance with the law.""That happened in October, and the Hammonds surrendered themselves on Monday as they were directed, bringing their personal battle with the federal government to an end. It is not wholly irrational, in view of all this tussling, to sympathize with the Hammonds and maybe even with their supporters, some of whom view the sentencing controversy as symptomatic of government overreach. But in the grand scheme of efforts to reform mandatory minimums, their case is only one of thousands -- and many end up with longer sentences.The Hammonds' case is ""fairly run-of-the-mill,"" said Ohio State law professor Douglas Berman, a sentencing expert. ""The ugliness you identify here is an ugliness in the way our federal justice system operates.""What Berman means is that federal prosecutors often seize on language in a statute -- here, malicious destruction by fire of property belonging to the United States -- and apply it to seemingly petty examples of such conduct. Later, they seek the stiffest punishment allowed, no matter how unfair the end result. And if the law calls for a mandatory minimum, the work is pretty much done for them.""I do think Congress did not have in mind the Hammonds for these mandatory minimums,"" Berman said, adding that ""prosecutors can always convince themselves"" that a particular misdeed is really serious and therefore a harsh penalty is what legislators intended all along.Here's where the broader debate over mandatory minimum sentences goes -- and why any fury over what happened to the Hammonds and others like them should be aimed at Congress, which writes the laws that tie judges' hands and forbid them from showing leniency.""The Hammonds join ... countless other individuals who were denied the opportunity for a judge to exercise appropriate judgment in imposing a rational sentence,"" said Rep.

The occupiers claim the federal land rightfully belongs to the mostly white population of eastern Oregon, but Harney County was largely Paiute territory prior to white settlement.On a foggy Wednesday morning, some of the tribe's nearly 420 members gathered at the top of a snow-packed hill on the Paiute reservation to discuss their concerns about the outsiders. The doors of the meeting center were plastered with signs warning people not to bring firearms inside. ""As a Native, if we were to go out there and fight back like they are, we would have been dead by now,"" said Carla Teeman, a social services assistant at the tribe. ""They are desecrating one of our sacred traditional cultural properties,"" said Charlotte Rodrique, the tribal chair. ""They are endangering our children and the safety of our community."" The Paiute people inhabit areas of southeast Oregon, Idaho, California and Nevada. The reservation in Burns is about 35 miles from the headquarters of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, which was taken over by the sons of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and their followers on Saturday. The tribe uses the refuge for religious and cultural ceremonies.The occupiers want federal land ""returned"" to the people of Harney County. But the tribe says its ancestral territory includes the refuge, as well as other federal lands in southeast Oregon. ""Settler pressure and violence eroded the tribe’s claim to land that was nominally reserved to it,"" Jedediah Purdy wrote in the New Yorker. In 1878, the federal government discontinued the Malheur Indian Reservation and exiled the residents of the reservation to territory in Washington, according to the tribe. Today, the Burns Paiute Reservation is about 1,000 acres, and the tribe owns additional ranch land and grazing allotments. So far, law enforcement has sought to reach a peaceful solution with the occupiers, and there have been no visible cops at the site. But when her community has family barbecues in the local parks, police circle the block, Teeman said.Local ranchers claim the federal government is stingy with grazing leases and permits, which hurts their businesses. But, Teeman said, ""Our natives suffer, and these people get to come in and live off our land that we should get back."" The Burns Paiute strongly value protecting fish and wildlife resources, Rodrique told HuffPost. ""We don't have big 30-person hunting parties coming in and camping and killing all the elk,"" she said. ""We're losing our tradition, our cultural way of life ... because of the infringement of these ranchers."" She'd like to see the occupiers ""just pack up and go and get arrested,"" she added. Paiute Tribal Sergeant-at-Arms Jarvis Kennedy was even blunter. ""They just need to get the hell out of here,"" he said at the press conference. Diana Dick, whose husband is on the Paiute council, said that although the militants claim the land has been stolen from the ranchers, ""all lands have been stolen from the Indian tribes."" She said when she listened to the occupiers speak on the news, ""they never mentioned one thing about Indians. I don't even know if they knew Indians live here."" On Wednesday, a reporter asked protester Ammon Bundy about the Paiute claims. ""They have a right to be free like everyone else,"" he said.

The occupiers claim the federal land rightfully belongs to the mostly white population of eastern Oregon, but Harney County was largely Paiute territory prior to white settlement.On a foggy Wednesday morning, some of the tribe's nearly 420 members gathered at the top of a snow-packed hill on the Paiute reservation to discuss their concerns about the outsiders. The doors of the meeting center were plastered with signs warning people not to bring firearms inside. ""As a Native, if we were to go out there and fight back like they are, we would have been dead by now,"" said Carla Teeman, a social services assistant at the tribe. ""They are desecrating one of our sacred traditional cultural properties,"" said Charlotte Rodrique, the tribal chair. ""They are endangering our children and the safety of our community."" The Paiute people inhabit areas of southeast Oregon, Idaho, California and Nevada. The reservation in Burns is about 35 miles from the headquarters of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, which was taken over by the sons of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and their followers on Saturday. The tribe uses the refuge for religious and cultural ceremonies.The occupiers want federal land ""returned"" to the people of Harney County. But the tribe says its ancestral territory includes the refuge, as well as other federal lands in southeast Oregon. ""Settler pressure and violence eroded the tribe’s claim to land that was nominally reserved to it,"" Jedediah Purdy wrote in the New Yorker. In 1878, the federal government discontinued the Malheur Indian Reservation and exiled the residents of the reservation to territory in Washington, according to the tribe. Today, the Burns Paiute Reservation is about 1,000 acres, and the tribe owns additional ranch land and grazing allotments. So far, law enforcement has sought to reach a peaceful solution with the occupiers, and there have been no visible cops at the site. But when her community has family barbecues in the local parks, police circle the block, Teeman said.Local ranchers claim the federal government is stingy with grazing leases and permits, which hurts their businesses. But, Teeman said, ""Our natives suffer, and these people get to come in and live off our land that we should get back."" The Burns Paiute strongly value protecting fish and wildlife resources, Rodrique told HuffPost. ""We don't have big 30-person hunting parties coming in and camping and killing all the elk,"" she said. ""We're losing our tradition, our cultural way of life ... because of the infringement of these ranchers."" She'd like to see the occupiers ""just pack up and go and get arrested,"" she added. Paiute Tribal Sergeant-at-Arms Jarvis Kennedy was even blunter. ""They just need to get the hell out of here,"" he said at the press conference. Diana Dick, whose husband is on the Paiute council, said that although the militants claim the land has been stolen from the ranchers, ""all lands have been stolen from the Indian tribes."" She said when she listened to the occupiers speak on the news, ""they never mentioned one thing about Indians. I don't even know if they knew Indians live here."" On Wednesday, a reporter asked protester Ammon Bundy about the Paiute claims. ""They have a right to be free like everyone else,"" he said. But, he acknowledged, ""I really don't know much about that.""Related on HuffPost:"
