""I kept telling my mom what my dreams were, and kind of hoping she’d tell me good news about my dreams.""On Friday, that dream became real when Sky Blue FC made Rodriguez the second overall pick in the National Women's Soccer League's college draft (Virginia's Emily Sonnett went first overall to Portland).

According to a report published by FIFA last year, for instance, countries in the top 20 of the world rankings invest on average nearly four times more in their women's teams each year than those ranked between 21st and 40th (Costa Rica is currently ranked 34th). Just a quarter of the world's national federations, the report found, had staff devoted to the women's teams.Costa Rica has in some ways tried to buck that trend over the last two decades, as its national soccer federation increased its efforts to develop women's soccer and build its women's national team into a contender to qualify for the 2015 Women's World Cup, which it reached by finishing second to the United States in regional qualifiers in 2014.Las Ticas failed to advance out of the World Cup's group stage but secured two draws in three matches, driving excitement into the sport that Rodriguez says she noticed even during her final year at Penn State.

""By that time we should have spread out into space, and to other stars, so a disaster on Earth would not mean the end of the human race,"" he said.Hawking says that we will not establish colonies away from Earth for at least the next 100 years, making this period especially critical, according to The Guardian.""We are not going to stop making progress, or reverse it, so we have to recognize the dangers and control them,"" Hawking added. ""I'm an optimist, and I believe we can.""Hawking made his comments in advance of this year's Reith Lectures at the BBC, which he will deliver on Jan. 26 and Feb. 2. Those talks will focus on black holes.Last February, Hawking cautioned against the threat of aggression, stating that: “It may have had survival advantage in caveman days, to get more food, territory or a partner with whom to reproduce, but now it threatens to destroy us all.” Hawking is also one of 1,000 individuals to recently sign an open letter warning against the danger of building autonomous weapons.Also on HuffPost:"

The law also calls for ""fines and criminal penalties"" for those who violate its statutes.News organizations and free speech advocates would surely oppose any legislation proposing requirements on who can or cannot be considered a journalist. It's not clear in the legislation what criteria the government would use to decide who's a journalist, or what exactly constitutes noncompliance with the law.Pitts did not respond to calls for comment from The Huffington Post. It appears that Pitts proposed the bill in an attempt to call attention to what he perceives as unfair coverage of guns. The lawmaker told The Post and Courier Monday that he is ""not a press hater,"" but wanted to spark discussion about how print and TV news outlets cover Second Amendment rights. “It strikes me as ironic that the first question is constitutionality from a press that has no problem demonizing firearms,” Pitts told the Charleston paper. “With this statement I’m talking primarily about printed press and TV. The TV stations, the six o’clock news and the printed press has no qualms demonizing gun owners and gun ownership.”Jennifer Dunham, director of research for Freedom House’s annual “Freedom of the Press” study, said her organization considers journalist registries to be a detriment to press freedom. ""Two of the worst media freedom violators in the world, China and Iran, also have requirements for journalists to register or have government-issued press cards to be considered legitimate,” Dunham told HuffPost. “These are issued by the government and can be revoked at any time.""“I don’t think we really want to be put in the same category as those countries,” she added.

7,POLITICS,Supreme Court Trashes Latest Legal Attack On Obamacare,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-obamacare_us_569e765ce4b0cd99679b7e00,The justices already ruled the law constitutional. They're done for now.,2016-01-19,"Yes, the Affordable Care Act is still constitutional.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Supreme Court has snubbed yet another Obamacare case.The justices on Tuesday declined to take up the latest legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act -- a quirky lawsuit that sought to invalidate the law on the grounds that it violates the origination clause of the U.S. Constitution.Under the clause, ""all bills for raising revenue"" -- read: taxes -- must ""originate"" in the House of Representatives. But Matt Sissel, the man behind the case, argued that must mean the health care law is unconstitutional because, in his view, the legislation originated in the Senate.""The reason the Constitution requires all bills for raising revenue to originate in the House is to keep the taxing power -- of which the founders were justly suspicious -- in the hands of the most democratic branch of the federal government,"" said Sissel's appeal to the Supreme Court.That argument was a response to the court's decision in NFIB v. Sebelius, which in 2012 upheld the law on the basis that its so-called individual mandate -- the requirement that every American carries health insurance, or else pay a penalty -- constitutes a ""tax on going without health insurance.""But Sissel, an artist, challenged that requirement, noting in court papers he'd much rather ""devote his resources to building up his art business rather than buying health insurance."" Even though two lower courts rejected his arguments, he nonetheless pressed on with his appeal to the Supreme Court. What may have prompted Sissel to take his case all the way to the top was a lengthy rejection issued by an appeals court last summer -- essentially telling him that his constitutional argument was meritless, but in which four conservative judges said that the case underscored ""the importance of this issue to our constitutional structure and to the individual liberty protected by that structure.""But even those judges, in the end, couldn't bring themselves to rule that the challenger had a winning case, and concluded that the Affordable Care Act properly originated in the House of Representatives.""To read my opinion so far, you might wonder whether I think the world will end not in fire, or in ice, or in a bankruptcy court, but in an Origination Clause violation,"" wrote U.S. Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh for himself and the three other judges. ""This case is not Marbury v. Madison redux. But the case is still quite important.""Apparently not important enough for the Supreme Court to get involved."

Leon Botstein is the president of Bard, located in Annandale-On-Hudson, New York. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56992ee82a00002c000309b3.jpeg?cache=iCMPtkzBKn&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two federal complaints alleging Bard College violated gender equity law Title IX were filed against the school last month, shortly before the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights began investigating the private institution for potentially mishandling a separate case of sexual violence on campus. Activist group End Rape On Campus helped recent alumnae file two of the three complaints, claiming the school didn't follow its own policy when disciplining students accused of sexual assault and did not adequately relay all available resources to victims. The other complaint was from current students who say Bard President Leon Botstein made comments that undercut the trust of having a proper response to a sexual assault report at the college.The Education Department opened an investigation into Bard on Dec. 30, looking into a case in which the college initially prescribed counseling and ""social probation"" as a punishment for sexual assault. The institution later increased the penalties after the accused student was charged criminally.EROC helped a woman who graduated last year, and requested anonymity, file a complaint last month over how Bard handled her campus judicial proceeding. She says she filed a complaint with the school over an incident of sexual and intimate partner violence at the hands of a male student in November 2014. But she claims that when she previously disclosed her assault to a college employee in 2011, Bard failed to tell her for months that she could get a no-contact order between her and the alleged assailant. Later, when Bard disclosed what allegations they were specifically investigating from the November 2014 complaint, it labeled one as ""Choking (erotic asphyxiation) without consent,"" according to the woman's attorney.""The charge misrepresents [her] report,"" her attorney, Cari Simon of the Fierberg National Law Group, wrote to Bard's Title IX office in February 2015. ""When she was choked it was not part of any erotic asphyxiation. It was simply choking, a form of severe physical violence, common among victims of domestic violence."" The man accused in the case was not found responsible for ""rape,"" but Bard decided in March that he had committed ""other violations"" of the college's sexual assault policy, according to documents reviewed by The Huffington Post. He was placed on mandatory leave, according to a letter Botstein wrote to the woman. The woman said administrators told her this meant the man would be allowed to finish his coursework and graduate, but not to come onto campus. However, Bard's policy at the time explicitly stated that suspension should be the minimum sanction for any sexual assault violation. The school has since changed its policy to remove any minimum sanction and instead outline a range of possible punishments. The woman tried to get more information, like what ""other"" violations Bard said the accused student was responsible for committing. But despite multiple requests, she has not been given that information, according to her attorney. ""I'd like the investigation to put pressure on Bard to make its policies more consistent and transparent,"" the woman told HuffPost.

10,SPORTS,Rajon Rondo Is Quietly Back To Being Rajon Rondo,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rajon-rondo-kings_us_567df9c4e4b014efe0d847aa,"The 29-year-old point guard certainly has more work to do, but he's enjoying an unlikely resurgence in Sacramento.",2016-01-19,"Rajon Rondo's guidance -- he leads the league in assists -- has helped the Kings secure recent wins over the Thunder, Pacers and red hot Clippers.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5686a26b1f00000601e9cccc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There was once a time, not so long ago, when Rajon Rondo was one of the best point guards in the NBA and a crucial component of a championship run with the Boston Celtics. Nobody in the league was better at controlling tempo, and nobody excelled more in the transition game. But somewhere along the way, Rondo lost his spark, becoming more well-known for his petulant behavior than basketball prowess.At first, it seemed like an aberration, merely a trend. But it persisted. Boston eventually dealt him to Dallas, where he feuded with Head Coach Rick Carlisle and infamously tanked during last year's playoffs against Houston. As a free agent last summer, interest in a cancerous locker room lead guard without a jump shot was noticeably missing. But Sacramento needed a point to run pick-and-roll with its highly gifted power forward, DeMarcus Cousins. The acquisition, not surprisingly, was hardly celebrated -- Rondo seemed indifferent to winning basketball, and at 29 years old had perhaps lost a step as well.Motivated by his sinking reputation, Rondo entered camp in top shape, ready to reassume full distribution duties and his trademark bursts to the basket. The Kings' roster, while young, unproven and a tad bare, isn't exactly devoid of talent. Rondo, meanwhile, has seized his makeshift opportunity. ""We knew he was a guy who could pass the ball so well and orchestrate an offense,"" Kings Associate Head Coach Chad Iske tells The Huffington Post. ""The good thing is he's always in the gym for us. He comes back most nights to work on his shot, work on his game. Whenever there's been other players around, he tries to get them involved.""Rondo now leads the NBA in assists, with a sterling 11.6 average per game (two more than Russell Westbrook, who's next on the list). The former Kentucky standout is also enjoying the best shooting clip he's had in five years, which lets him keep defenses honest enough for his devastating driving ability to remain effective. And, always an elite guard rebounder who fuels his own fast break, Rondo's 6.4 boards per game slot him second among all point guards -- behind only Westbrook -- a glowing clip for a 6-foot-1 floor general.At his best and when he's really focused -- which he has been this year -- Rondo is a dynamic blend of quickness, speed and precise passing. He thrives in the open floor, employing court vision that doesn't seem fair, using his mammoth hands to toy with helpless defenders. More impressive with the Kings has been his eagerness to constantly attack and probe for everyone else on the floor -- and not merely Cousins.""He's got such leadership qualities,"" Iske adds. ""He sees the angles. He sees the shots that are going to open up ahead of time, because he knows whats going to open up.""The truth is that even during Rondo's finest days in Boston -- he was a four-time All-Star, one-time All-NBA selection and four-time All-Defensive team selection who also won a ring -- he remained an enigmatic personality. He publicly disrespected then-teammate Ray Allen, a future Hall of Famer, forcing his then-coach Doc Rivers -- who once called Rondo ""the most intelligent player I've ever coached"" -- to have to explain why his teammates couldn't stand his peculiar and petulant antics.And of course, he was suspended this season for a game for derogatory language, after reportedly using a slur to verbally harass referee Bill Kennedy, who came out as gay just days later. So he clearly has some growing to do when it comes to emotional maturity.In terms of physical play, however, Rondo has reassumed his role as one of the league's elite point guards -- or at least he's back in the conversation. Keep in mind that he's the only point guard in the league to be averaging a double-double. The 17-23 Kings, meanwhile, are a shocking playoff contender, having become respectable in the rugged Western Conference and boasting more far more efficient offensive play with Rondo at the helm. Recent wins over playoff-bound squads like the Thunder, Pacers and red hot Clippers validate the improvement, and the team is a sure bet to best last season's 29 wins.In fact, Sacramento ranks fourth in field goal percentage, up nine slots from last year. It's also jumped to third in points scored, up from 14th. Naturally, pace of play has increased because of Rondo's hounding two-way style, but these improvements validate his individual statistics as well.Where Rondo goes from here is arguably just as intriguing as where he's been. A career 27 percent 3-point shooter and 60 percent free-throw shooter, he's not suddenly morphing into a knockdown guy, and that's OK. He makes up for it in other areas. Rondo's four triple-doubles this year trail only Westbrook and Golden State's Swiss army knife, Draymond Green. More importantly, he is a completely different player than during his final two seasons in Boston, along with his 46-game stretch spent wavering in Dallas. His trademark burst is back, and he's finally comfortable again on the floor.Rondo's one-year, $9.5 million deal with the Kings has proven to be a bargain, and his relationship with veteran Head Coach George Karl is a vital reason as to why. Throughout a highly successful career, Karl has guided some of the game's premier players, including Hall of Fame point guard Gary Payton.""He realized early on that coach Karl was going to give him a lot of freedom in the half-court and in the open court,"" Iske says.

12,POLITICS,Flint Water Response Perfectly Captures The Difference Between Bernie Sanders And Hillary Clinton,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-flint_us_569e66c3e4b04c8137617f05,Flint's mayor endorsed Clinton on Tuesday.,2016-01-19,Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have taken different approaches to addressing the Flint water crisis.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_0_94_2778_1333%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On Saturday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called on Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) to resign over the lead poisoning crisis in Flint. Three days later, Snyder remains in office, and Sanders has moved on after generating a fair amount of media attention.On Thursday, Hillary Clinton went on national television and chastised Snyder for refusing to ask for federal assistance in order to help the affected residents. Two hours after that interview aired on ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" on MSNBC, the governor did just that. Clinton had also already dispatched two of her top aides -- including one with years of experience working for a Michigan senator -- to the state to assist Flint Mayor Karen Weaver (D) with whatever she needed. The different approaches are emblematic of the ways the two Democratic presidential candidates respond to problems -- and would perhaps continue to do so if they win the presidency. Sanders goes big, not always worrying about whether what he's proposing is politically realistic. Clinton, meanwhile, focuses on the pragmatic instead of the aspirational, using her experience as a guide to what can get done. Their approaches on health care have exposed this rift as well. Sanders has continued to push for a single-payer health care system -- a dream for many Democrats -- while Clinton has slammed his proposal as too vague and politically unrealistic.Since October, officials have told Flint residents not to drink the brown stuff coming out of their taps, which they had previously been assured was safe even though it caused rashes. The state admitted it made a mistake when a local pediatrician reported unusually high lead levels in Flint children's blood.The former secretary of state's approach has won over Weaver, who came out and endorsed Clinton during a conference call with reporters Tuesday morning.""As far as what Hillary Clinton has done, she has actually been the only -- the only -- candidate, whether we're talking Democratic or Republican, to reach out and talk with us about, 'What can I do? What kind of help do you need?'"" Weaver said. Amanda Renteria is the Clinton campaign's national political director and one of the staffers who went to Flint last week to talk with the mayor. She has experience in the state, having previously served as chief of staff to Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D- Mich.). ""When this came about and [Clinton] read about it, her immediate response has been, 'Let's see what's going on, and what can we do to help?'"" Renteria told reporters during Tuesday's conference call. Snyder, for his part, has denied that Clinton and her appearance on Maddow had anything to do with his decision to ask for federal funds. ""Gov. Snyder announced the state was coordinating with FEMA days before and [was] dealing with the crisis on Thursday, not watching political talk shows,"" Snyder spokesman Dave Murray told the Washington Examiner. Last week, the Clinton campaign also called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency to conduct an ""expedited review"" of Flint's water infrastructure and said the Obama administration should immediately set up a ""health monitoring and surveillance system"" to test residents for lead poisoning. It's less exciting and headline-grabbing than getting Snyder to resign, but also more likely to happen.Clinton was also the first candidate to bring up the Flint water crisis during a presidential debate. On Sunday night in South Carolina, Clinton said the crisis had its roots in race and class issues. ""We've had a city in the United States of America where the population, which is poor in many ways and majority African-American, has been drinking and bathing in lead-contaminated water,"" she said, adding, ""I'll tell you what -- if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it there would've been action.""In his statement Saturday, Sanders did go further in trying to hold Snyder accountable. ""There are no excuses,"" he said. ""The governor long ago knew about the lead in Flint’s water. He did nothing. As a result, hundreds of children were poisoned. Thousands may have been exposed to potential brain damage from lead. Gov. Snyder should resign.""Erin Brockovich, the legendary environmental activist and lawyer, endorsed Sanders' approach Saturday, saying she hadn't yet called for the governor's resignation because she believed ""we need to focus all of our energy on helping the people of Flint."" But she changed her position after seeing the seriousness of the situation. ""I will be speaking with the campaign over the next few days to help him understand just exactly how this is truly a National crisis beyond Flint,"" Brockovich said in a statement.Weaver didn't seem particularly impressed with Sanders' comments Tuesday, telling reporters, ""A lot of people said the governor should step down.""The Sanders campaign did not return a request for comment on what else the senator has done on Flint. This piece has been updated with comments from Erin Brockovich and Snyder's office.Also on HuffPost:"

Who gets the money is an issue, and people of color are last on the list.""Galapagos Art Space is the most notable newcomer, announcing in late 2014 that it was moving out of Brooklyn after nearly 20 years because New York had become unaffordable for artists. Galapagos' executive director, Robert Elmes, bought eight buildings -- including two former schools, a power plant and a hospital -- in Highland Park, a small city surrounded by Detroit that faces similar struggles. He bought another building on the outskirts of Corktown, one of Detroit's most desirable neighborhoods. Elmes described his development plan as a new funding model for the arts and has since received an abundance of praise and press. A mile from the Galapagos complex, another Highland Park arts space is preparing for its summer opening. So far, Liquid Flow Media Arts Center has received little media attention, grants or large investors. It's instead relied on community support through fundraisers like the Penny for the Inner City Arts campaign, which involved Liquid Flow founder Stacy’e Jones giving organizations and businesses jars so they could collect change to donate to the arts center.“When I saw that [Galapagos was] coming to Highland Park, I felt like I was in a race to complete what we’ve been working on for so long, just so we don’t get overshadowed and hidden when Galapagos actually opens up,” Jones said.Galapagos is still developing its venue, which is expected to include performance space, studios, a gallery and a massive indoor lake.But the organization came under scrutiny earlier this month when it put its Detroit property up for sale for $6.25 million -- more than 12 times what it paid for the property in 2013, Crain’s Detroit Business reported. Critics saw the proposed sale as a case of real estate speculation that contradicted Galapagos’ stated intentions and could fuel gentrification in Corktown. Elmes said allowing another group to redevelop the building “will have a large impact on the idea of Detroit coming back” and could stimulate economic activity in the neighborhood. He and his wife are selling the property to scale back while they focus on caring for their son, who was diagnosed with leukemia last year.""If we can indeed move the equity that the Corktown building has gained out into one of the neighborhoods, which haven’t shared as fairly in Detroit’s comeback as they should, then we can have an impact where it’s needed more and do it faster,"" Elmes told The Huffington Post in an email. Liquid Flow is small compared to Galapagos' 460,000 square feet in Highland Park, but Jones, a DJ, has a grand vision for her arts and education space. She hopes it will eventually include a recording studio in the attic, a public computer lab, a venue for art events, and classes in subjects such as computer literacy and music production.A few years ago, Jones was running an online radio station when teenagers slowly started showing up, asking for career guidance or advice on how to use a camera. Word spread, and one day she arrived at work to find two dozen kids crammed into the recording studio, all there to learn.She realized she wanted to bring that kind of environment to the youth in her own neighborhood, where the public high school and library have both been shuttered. Jones said she hopes Galapagos, which has taken over the former school, will get feedback from neighbors about what they want in the community.Elmes has been working with a variety of local groups, like the Highland Park High School Alumni Association, and he agreed to donate space in the former school building to store the group's archives and display its memorabilia. Glenda McDonald, a board member and city council member who is a resident of Highland Park, said she's excited to see how Galapagos will enrich the city. A few blocks from Galapagos, a third Highland Park venue is quietly celebrating its 10th year in business.

Reports show that the Environmental Protection Agency knew well-beforehand about the lack of corrosion controls in the city’s water supply, but was either unwilling or unable to address the issue.""The EPA was closely involved in last year's government response to the water crisis, which had been caused by switching the city's water source to the Flint River while Flint was under the control of an emergency manager appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder (R). In December, Snyder appointed a task force to investigate the crisis, which determined the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality was mostly to blame for the city's poisonous water, prompting the quick resignations of several officials. But Carson didn't mention the Snyder administration or other state leaders, and claimed the current situation in Flint is proof of the broader ineffectiveness of government regulations.""This is yet another sad demonstration that, even in the face of a clear public health crisis, our regulations aren’t effective in protecting our citizens,"" he said. ""Our government leaders must place 'We the People' first and foremost in every decision they make. That’s why I remain committed to real, meaningful regulatory reform. The residents of Flint have sadly borne the burden of this government failure, and will continue to do so for years to come. They deserve better -- from both their local and federal officials.""The number of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels doubled after the water switch, prompting the Snyder administration to admit its mistakes and switch the water back. Carson cited his medical background in his statement, saying that he was ""all too familiar with the tragic and debilitating effects of lead poisoning,"" which can cause abdominal pain, hearing loss and cognitive dysfunction, as well as stunted growth and brain damage in children. He went on to thank the National Guard for its service during the current state of emergency, and offered ""thoughts and prayers"" to those affected by the crisis.Flint's toxic water has become a presidential campaign issue over the last week, with Democratic candidates putting it front and center at their most recent debate on Sunday. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Synder had ""acted as though he didn't really care"" about Flint's poor, largely black population. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has made calls for the governor's resignation, which he reiterated during the debate.Republican candidates have, meanwhile, had very little to say about the lead poisoning in Flint. At a campaign stop on Monday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) responded to a question about the city's water crisis by saying he hadn't been ""fully briefed"" on the issue. Front-runner Donald Trump called the situation a ""shame,"" but declined to elaborate. HuffPost has reached out to the rest of the GOP field for comment, but Carson's campaign is the only that has responded so far.As for the EPA, the agency knew Michigan wasn't following federal protocols to reduce the corrosiveness of Flint's water, but wasn't successful in prodding the state to take action. ""Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the state of Michigan was responsible for implementing the regulations to protect their residents’ drinking water,"" EPA spokeswoman Monica Lee said in an email. ""While EPA worked within the framework of the law to repeatedly and urgently communicate the steps the state needed to take to properly treat its water, those necessary actions were not taken as quickly as they should have been.""Also on HuffPost:"

17,POLITICS,Sanders Releases Universal Healthcare Plan Before Democratic Debate,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-universal-healthcare_us_569c343be4b0ce496424df13,The senator from Vermont said his program would save $6 trillion over the next 10 years when compared with the current system.,2016-01-18,Bernie Sanders is going big and bold with his health care plan.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569c3e372a00002c00030aa2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bernie Sanders on Sunday released his plan to reform the American health insurance system -- or, more accurately, to reinvent it from scratch.It's a plan to create a single-payer health care system, which means the government would provide everybody with insurance directly. Sanders is calling it ""Medicare for All,"" because Medicare, which provides government-financed insurance to the elderly, is the closest thing to a single-payer system in the U.S. But that term actually understates the ambition of what he is proposing.Sanders wouldn’t just replace existing private insurance plans. He would also replace existing public plans -- including Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Plan and the private plans available through the Affordable Care Act. He'd even upgrade the coverage that Medicare provides. To pay for this plan, Sanders would replace existing insurance premiums with taxes and put a huge squeeze on the drug industry -- the kind that would be extremely difficult to push through the political system.And while Obamacare has produced a historic decline in the number of uninsured Americans, the Sanders plan would reach many, if not most, of the remaining uninsured (roughly 10 percent of the population, according to recent estimates) through automatic enrollment.“Universal health care is an idea that has been supported in the United States by Democratic presidents going back to Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman,” Sanders said. “It is time for our country to join every other major industrialized nation on earth and guarantee health care to all citizens as a right, not a privilege.”Sanders introduced his plan just hours before a nationally televised Democratic presidential debate, and after days of back and forth with Hillary Clinton, front-runner for the nomination. Clinton, who like Sanders is a longtime champion of improving access to health care, has said she prefers to proceed incrementally -- mainly, by bolstering the coverage that Obamacare guarantees and putting more pressure on the drug industry to lower prices.Sanders would go far beyond that. In place of existing arrangements, Sanders would offer coverage that, on paper, looks a lot more comprehensive than any other coverage widely available in America today. The insurance that Sanders proposes would basically eliminate copayments and deductibles, except for cosmetic surgery and other elective procedures that a board of medical experts determined to be medically unnecessary. (People could still pay for those services on their own.) Coverage for Medicare, the one program Sanders would leave in place, would become more generous, since today it does not offer such extensive benefits.According to an independent analysis by Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, the Sanders proposal -- if enacted -- would pay for 98 percent of the typical person’s medical bills. “This is a very generous plan,” Friedman told The Huffington Post. “Doing away with copays and deductibles is a big idea.”Sanders says that his proposal would actually save the country money -- first, by eliminating all the money that the private insurance industry spends marketing and managing its plans, and generating profits, and then by reducing the money doctors and hospitals must spend on billing. The plan would also seek deep discounts from the drug industry. Overall, according to Friedman’s analysis, the Sanders proposal would reduce health care spending in the U.S. by $6 trillion over the next 10 years.Because Sanders is eliminating all existing insurance, he’d also wipe out the premiums that people now pay to finance these plans. In their place, he’d impose a new “income-related premium” of 2.2 percent, a payroll tax on employers equal to 6.2 percent of wages, and then a series of new tax hikes on the wealthy. These taxes would be in addition to the payroll taxes that people already pay for Medicare, a Sanders spokesman confirmed.In the end, Friedman found, a family with income of $50,000 would end up saving more than $5,000 a year relative to what they would spend in the current health care system.Whether other independent analyses come to the same conclusion remains to be seen. But the challenge of single-payer has never been whether, on paper, such a plan could deliver comprehensive benefits to all Americans at a low price. It’s whether such a plan could survive the political process -- and how its implementation would play with the public. For example, Sanders envisions huge savings from lower drug prices, but efforts to extract far more modest savings from the industry have failed repeatedly in the past. And while programs like the Veterans Affairs health system get steep drug discounts, they also operate strict formularies limiting access to drugs -- something that many Americans would probably find objectionable.“One can certainly design a single-payer plan on paper that saves money for the middle class by reducing payments to doctors and hospitals significantly and shifting the financing of health care from premiums to a very progressive tax structure,” Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, said on Sunday evening. “Whether such a plan could ever pass and be signed into law in that form is a very different question.”That political difficulty, along with the daunting challenge of blowing up the current system and creating something new in its place, is a big reason Clinton has not endorsed anything as ambitious as Sanders -- and has been critical of him lately.“After weeks of denying the legitimacy of the questions Hillary Clinton raised about flaws in the health care legislation he’s introduced 9 times over 20 years, he proposed a new plan two hours before the debate,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement Sunday evening. ""When you’re running for President and you’re serious about getting results for the American people, details matter -- and Senator Sanders is making them up as he goes along.”"

""I've got some tricks up my sleeves,"" the rapper said. ""I'm gonna try to bring the members of N.W.A together. Give everybody a little history lesson on Ice Cube and N.W.A, West Side Connection, everything I've been doing over the years.""Yes, you read that right -- an N.W.A reunion may very well be in the works.

Watch the whole interview below.If the reunion happens, the timing really couldn't get any better. Just a week before Coachella, N.W.A is set to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 8 in Brooklyn. ""This means that the group's mark is solidified. We got some of the most creative, talented people in N.W.A that's ever been compiled in one group,"" Ice Cube told the Rolling Stone about the news last December. ""It's just exciting that the group as a whole gets recognized by the whole industry as Hall of Fame-worthy.""Aside from N.W.A, there are two other groups with confirmed reunions for the festival: Guns N' Roses and LCD Soundsystem. Guns N' Roses' set will include founding members Slash, Duff McKagan and Axl Rose, who haven't performed onstage together since 1993.The festival will also mark LCD Soundsystem's first performance together since 2011, when they played a farewell show at Madison Square Garden in New York. In December, the band gave fans an early Christmas gift when they released their first new song in five years, ""Christmas Will Break Your Heart,"" building even more anticipation for their spring reunion.This year's Coachella will definitely be one to remember.

Nearly all of its users are millennials, ages 18 to 34, according to Comscore. While it's not a scientific survey, posts on the app can provide a snapshot of how some college students and young people feel about the Democratic candidates. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had the most mentions on Yik Yak during Sunday's debate, and there were almost twice as many approving posts about him as disapproving ones, according to an analysis Yik Yak shared with The Huffington Post. YouTube star Connor Franta, 23, noted that Sanders was ""pretty popular among my peers,"" during the debate.Meanwhile, just 7.6 percent of Yik Yak comments about Clinton were approving, while 52.5 percent were disapproving. Most mentions of former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley on the app were neutral. Clinton is also facing some bad news from Yik Yak users in Iowa and New Hampshire.""Looking at just the earliest voting states, Iowa and New Hampshire, Clinton's disapproval levels matched or surpassed what she received country-wide: she had greater than 50% disapproval among young voters in both Iowa and New Hampshire along with low-single-digit approval,"" Yik Yak wrote in its analysis. ""Sanders fared better country-wide than he did in these states, earning 42% approval in Iowa but just 15% in New Hampshire.""Overall, Sanders has enjoyed significant support from young voters. Two polls of millennials released in roughly the past month -- from Harvard University's Institute of Politics and from Rock The Vote/USA Today -- both found Sanders enjoyed a healthy lead over Clinton in the youth vote. His success has prompted comparisons to the way then-Sen. Barack Obama mobilized college students to help propel him to victory over Clinton in the 2008 Iowa caucus. Clinton made a pitch during Sunday's debate that she would carry on Obama's legacy if elected. Pressed by the debate moderator to explain why she was losing 2-to-1 to Sanders in the youth vote, she responded, ""I'm going to keep working as hard as I can to reach as many people of all ages about what I will do, about the experience and ideas that I have that I will bring to the White House, and I hope to have their support when I’m the Democratic nominee.""Yik Yak provided some examples of what users were saying about the debate. Yik Yakkers also definitely had opinions about the debate schedule. "

The debate, which was moderated by ""Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt and NBC News' chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell, was also viewed by just over 500,000 people on MSNBC.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in early voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, which has resulted in Clinton going on the attack against Sanders by pointing out their differences on health care and gun control.The last two debates were also held on Saturdays, which typically see lower ratings than Sundays. DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-Fla.) has been criticized in the past for scheduling a number of the debates on weekends, which typically see lower ratings than debates held on weekdays.

Last week, BuzzFeed published a video of two police officers in Eufaula, Alabama, shooting 26-year-old Cameron Massey five times in October 2013. He died. Jackie Massey said she can't bring herself to watch the video. When one of her other sons saw it for the first time, he was rendered speechless, she said.What she's heard from those who have watched the video -- including family members, local activists and her lawyer, Mario Williams -- is that the cops had absolutely no reason to open fire on her son. She misses her son, whom she remembers as a ""very loving"" and ""very respectful"" person.""It's a pain you can't rub,"" she said. ""You can't soothe it."" But what she can do, Jackie Massey said, is fight for some justice. On Monday, she marched in Eufaula's Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade with members of a local activist group called The Ordinary People Society. She walked behind a giant white banner that read, ""Justice for Cam.""""If [MLK] were alive today, he would've stood for justice for my baby,"" she said.She and her supporters are calling on the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the case and to do what a special prosecutor in Eufaula didn't: indict the police officers who killed her son.On Oct. 15, 2013, Eufaula police officer John Phillips pulled over a black Infinity with an obscured Georgia Disabled Veterans tag. The vehicle had made an illegal lane change, Phillips later told the Alabama Bureau of Investigation, according to BuzzFeed. A confidential informant had also allegedly told cops that a vehicle fitting that description was carrying a shipment of marijuana. After the car pulled into the gravel parking lot of an auto-body shop, the driver, 30-year-old Joshua Kelly, stepped out of the vehicle, according to Phillips' account. The officer told him to get back in. After Phillips called for backup, Kelly stepped out of the car again, this time demanding to know why he'd been stopped. Kelly became ""loud, boisterous, and aggressive,"" Phillips later told Alabama investigators, so he put him in handcuffs.Massey, meanwhile, was in the car's passenger seat. That's when Eufaula Police Chief Ralph Conner arrived on the scene. He was wearing a body camera. The body camera footage shows Conner walking along the driver's side of the Infinity, while telling Massey to put his hands on the dashboard. As Conner passed in front of the car, he started yelling at Massey. ""On the dashboard!"" Conner shouted. He later alleged he saw Massey reaching for the driver's side door, maybe in an attempt to escape. ""On the dashboard! Put your hands on the dashboard!""""Watch this guy -- he's getting out!"" Conner, gun drawn, yelled to Phillips. ""He's getting out!"" Phillips said later that he went to the driver's side door, reached inside the car and grabbed Massey, who allegedly put the car into drive and pressed the gas pedal with his hand. As the car slowly moves forward, the video shows Conner firing once. As the car moves out of frame, the sound of Phillips firing four more shots is heard. The car then slowly crashed into another vehicle in the parking lot. ""Everything was so quick, so instantaneous,"" Phillips later told investigators, according to BuzzFeed. ""At that time, I didn't know if [Massey] had shot and he’s trying to stay down to keep from us returning fire.""Both Conner and Phillips said they acted in self-defense, according to a city press statement reported in the Eufaula Tribune in April 2014. They were allegedly concerned that Massey either might have had a gun or could have dragged Phillips underneath the car as it moved. But Massey didn't have a gun, and a court declaration from eyewitness Garick Hall, who worked at the auto-body shop, states that ""Phillips had control of his body the entire time as the car was moving forward. At no time did I see Officer John Phillips fall to the ground or appear as if he was falling to the ground.""""You have a situation where two officers beside the vehicle, which was blocked in, there was just no danger to the officers or anyone there,"" Williams, the lawyer for the Massey family, told the New York Daily News.""I believe officers' safety is a real issue, but you can’t justify lethal force if you have no facts that you were in danger,"" Williams added. Alabama Bureau of Investigations agents later said they found seven pounds of marijuana in the car -- although Williams has raised questions about that.The Huffington Post was not able to reach either Phillips or Conner directly.After Massey's death, it emerged that Chief Conner had shot another unarmed black man before. In 1983, when he was an officer in Montgomery, Alabama, Conner shot 22-year-old Bobby Joe Sales in the back while Sales was fleeing a police stop. Sales survived and Conner was re-assigned. Donald Watkins, a prominent Alabama attorney who was a Montgomery city councilman in 1983, was assigned to investigate Sales' shooting at the time. ""My investigation of the shooting revealed the following: (a) the victim, Bobby Joe Sales, had committed no crime; (b) he was unarmed at the time of the shooting; (c) he was not threatening Connor [sic] in any way; and (d) he was shot in the back,"" Watkins said in a statement provided to HuffPost this weekend. ""I reported to the City Council that Connor was a danger to himself and the citizens of Montgomery.""When Jackie Massey, who works as a nurse and has three other children, applied for state funding for her son's funeral, she was rejected. She said the state told her that her son wasn't a victim of a crime and therefore was ineligible for the aid. ""They said he 'contributed to his own death,'"" Massey recalled. Massey said the Barbour County district attorney, Ben Reeves, told her that the officers' use of deadly force against her son appeared to be unjustified.But citing a conflict of interest, Reeves removed himself from the case and turned it over to a special prosecutor named Boyd Whigham. Under Whigham's supervision -- and as with so many other police shootings across the U.S. -- the grand jury declined to indict the officers. Neither Reeves nor Whigham replied to a request for comment on this story. The Massey family has since filed a federal lawsuit against Conner, Phillips and the city of Eufaula seeking unspecified damages. Both police officers were placed on temporary administrative leave after the shooting, and Conner has since retired.Kenneth Glasgow, who acts as spokesman for the Massey family, said the Department of Justice needs to step in. ""We definitely want an investigation by the DOJ and for them to look at Eufaula and their police department,"" Glasgow said. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Alabama, which includes Eufaula, didn't respond to a request for comment on Monday. Cameron Massey's family is organizing another protest for March 3, on what would have been his 29th birthday. For now, his mother said she has hope. ""I believe in God,"" she said, ""and God's gonna show 'em up."" "

At no time did I see Officer John Phillips fall to the ground or appear as if he was falling to the ground.""""You have a situation where two officers beside the vehicle, which was blocked in, there was just no danger to the officers or anyone there,"" Williams, the lawyer for the Massey family, told the New York Daily News.""I believe officers' safety is a real issue, but you can’t justify lethal force if you have no facts that you were in danger,"" Williams added. Alabama Bureau of Investigations agents later said they found seven pounds of marijuana in the car -- although Williams has raised questions about that.The Huffington Post was not able to reach either Phillips or Conner directly.After Massey's death, it emerged that Chief Conner had shot another unarmed black man before. In 1983, when he was an officer in Montgomery, Alabama, Conner shot 22-year-old Bobby Joe Sales in the back while Sales was fleeing a police stop. Sales survived and Conner was re-assigned. Donald Watkins, a prominent Alabama attorney who was a Montgomery city councilman in 1983, was assigned to investigate Sales' shooting at the time. ""My investigation of the shooting revealed the following: (a) the victim, Bobby Joe Sales, had committed no crime; (b) he was unarmed at the time of the shooting; (c) he was not threatening Connor [sic] in any way; and (d) he was shot in the back,"" Watkins said in a statement provided to HuffPost this weekend. ""I reported to the City Council that Connor was a danger to himself and the citizens of Montgomery.""When Jackie Massey, who works as a nurse and has three other children, applied for state funding for her son's funeral, she was rejected. She said the state told her that her son wasn't a victim of a crime and therefore was ineligible for the aid. ""They said he 'contributed to his own death,'"" Massey recalled. Massey said the Barbour County district attorney, Ben Reeves, told her that the officers' use of deadly force against her son appeared to be unjustified.But citing a conflict of interest, Reeves removed himself from the case and turned it over to a special prosecutor named Boyd Whigham. Under Whigham's supervision -- and as with so many other police shootings across the U.S. -- the grand jury declined to indict the officers. Neither Reeves nor Whigham replied to a request for comment on this story. The Massey family has since filed a federal lawsuit against Conner, Phillips and the city of Eufaula seeking unspecified damages. Both police officers were placed on temporary administrative leave after the shooting, and Conner has since retired.Kenneth Glasgow, who acts as spokesman for the Massey family, said the Department of Justice needs to step in. ""We definitely want an investigation by the DOJ and for them to look at Eufaula and their police department,"" Glasgow said. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Alabama, which includes Eufaula, didn't respond to a request for comment on Monday. Cameron Massey's family is organizing another protest for March 3, on what would have been his 29th birthday. For now, his mother said she has hope. ""I believe in God,"" she said, ""and God's gonna show 'em up."" "

It's not clear why James had any children in her car in the first place. Reached by WKRN Monday, James denied that she ever had kids in her trunk, but said the children were in her car because she was removing them from an unsafe situation.The children’s parents were reportedly called to pick them up from the scene while James was booked into the Rutherford County jail. She’s since bonded out, online jailhouse records show.A La Vergne police spokesman told the Journal that the children in the car may have been James' students.The Rutherford County Sheriff's Department did not respond to requests for comment Monday.

26,POLITICS,Bizarre Contract Dispute Putting Thousands Of Migrant Children At Risk,Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/migrant-children-legal-representation_us_569cf991e4b0778f46f9ff3c,The revolving door doesn't swing only at the Pentagon.,2016-01-18,"In this file photo from April 30, 2015, immigrant families, many of them mothers with children, board a bus headed to the downtown bus station in McAllen, Texas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Thousands of unaccompanied minors who came across the U.S. border as part of the migrant crisis are at risk of being deported without due process, the archbishop of Miami has warned the Obama administration.Although the law dictates that these children must be given legal services, recent moves by the Office of Refugee Resettlement have thrown that into doubt. ORR, which is an agency under the umbrella of Health and Human Services, awarded the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants a contract to represent the children. USCRI in turn planned to subcontract with a social services firm that employed zero attorneys at the time.""Many of these cases are time sensitive, and if they do not receive immediate attention, the affected children face imminent deportation,"" Archbishop Thomas Wenski warned HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell in a letter sent in October, and which The Huffington Post obtained last week. Judges in Miami have privately warned that the move could jam up the court dockets for as long as a year.Wenski acknowledged in his letter to Burwell that the very act of his writing to weigh in on a contract dispute was ""a bit unusual,"" but added, ""this is an unusual circumstance.""The setback comes as the administration is increasing its efforts to keep Central Americans from entering the U.S. without authorization, as larger numbers of families and unaccompanied children are apprehended at the southwest border and Democrats fight back against deportation efforts of those already here. Border agents picked up nearly 17,400 minors traveling without their parents in October, November and December. Most of them were from Honduras, El Salvador or Guatemala, meaning they must go before a judge before they can be deported. Many face rampant violence, much of it with U.S. roots, if they have to return home.The U.S. announced plans recently to work with the United Nations to screen Central American refugees for resettlement while still in their home countries, to discourage them from making the trip to the border.But the ones already here are entitled due process. The organizations Americans for Immigrant Justice and Catholic Legal Services have represented migrant children for years, but both will be tossed aside for the new subcontractor, a social services firm called Youth-Coop. Shortly after the bid was announced, the outfit's website listed openings for 17 staff attorneys.USCRI bid against the Vera Institute for contracts to represent the children. The contractors were required to have groups on the ground they were ready to work with. Vera, which was bidding with AIJ and Catholic Legal Services as its subcontractors, has run a similar program for roughly a decade and won contracts everywhere but in a division that runs from Memphis, Tennessee, to Miami. Children in the system, though, regularly move throughout the country, meaning the chaos in the Southeast region could affect the rest of the system. Vera declined to comment for this story. Bernard Perlmutter, who runs the University of Miami Law School Clinic that works with unaccompanied children, said he had no idea what drove ORR to drop the nonprofit law firms that had been working with the children, but that speculation of a scandal was rampant.""There may be some insider trading going on in terms of people rubbing each others backs, people who like each other and know each other,"" he said.Lavinia Limón, the head of USCRI, said the suggestion that her organization used its connections to pull strings was off base.""I wish I had that kind of clout,"" she said. ""If we had that kind of clout, we would have received grants for the three regions we applied for. We didn't. We only got one.""From the perspective of those who did win, the reason was clear: USCRI, in the other regions it lost, lacked sufficient legal resources.Yet USCRI has been on a contract-winning streak since President Barack Obama was elected. The administration offered the top ORR job to Limón, who had run the office during the Clinton administration. She turned it down, but recommended her deputy, Eskinder Negash. Under Negash, money flowed heavily to USCRI. In 2011, when the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops lost a major contract to do human trafficking work, the bulk of the money went to USCRI instead. It didn't go unnoticed. ""ORR earmarked most of the money for USCRI,"" Sister Mary Ann Walsh wrote at the time. ""Eskinder Negash, current director of the ORR, had been vice-president and chief operating officer at USCRI before joining ORR in 2009.""Negash left the government last year, landing back at USCRI. His closeness to USCRI was so well known that the new head of ORR, Bob Carey, joked about it at a meeting with advocates shortly after taking over.""Eskinder's gone back to USCRI to run all the contracts he sent there,"" he quipped, according to a source who was in the meeting. Before Negash left, though, he created a new position within ORR for Patricia Swartz, who he brought in from USCRI to oversee the handling of migrant children.(Swartz is not on the panel that decides on the awarding of the current contract, according to HHS. After this story was published, HHS denied that Carey had made such a remark.)The contracts kept coming after Negash went back to USCRI, including the one to represent the unaccompanied minors in Miami. With the legal community in South Florida worried that the lawyerless outfit could bring the judicial process to a halt, the archbishop called a meeting of all the groups involved in early October. He proposed a compromise that would allow USCRI to keep the contract if it would subcontract with all three organizations. When USCRI worried there wouldn't be enough money to go around, the director of Catholic Legal Services said the organization would pull out, so that AIJ and Youth-Coop would work together. The compromise was rejected.Limón said the compromise couldn't be accepted at the meeting because Vera had already protested. The protest came after the meeting, however.After Vera protested to the Government Accountability Office, the contract was canceled, an acknowledgment something was amiss.Instead of doing the same contract competition over again, ORR put out a new request for bids -- but this one differed in a significant way. The first request for proposal, known as an RFP, said the contract would be awarded largely on merit. Ask any defendant: That's a smart way to pick a lawyer. The new RFP bases the award largely on cost. Ask any lawyer: That's a great way to pick your adversary's lawyer. And an outfit that employs zero lawyers is going to have lower costs than one that employs a few dozen. (An HHS spokesperson said the new RFP focuses on costs so as to expedite the situation, not to tilt the scales toward USCRI. The faster process is needed, the agency said, since thousands of children are in limbo as the result of the first one going awry. The new contract award is expected in February.)There are currently two main shelters in the Miami area that receive the incoming children, with another massive one scheduled to be opened in Homestead in the next few months. All three are funded by ORR. Elizabeth Anon, the top lawyer at one of the shelters, His House Children's Home, said she hadn't expected the decision.""It came as a surprise because AIJ has been working for a long time with the children and it was going smoothly as far as our interaction with them,"" Anon said, adding that AIJ ""has a specialty with this group of children and the work. It's kind of like a sub-specialization and they seem to be very caring. ... As to the politics or what happened, I can't really comment.""After the first contract was canceled, ORR stopped USCRI and Youth-Coop from spending money connected to it. But shortly before Christmas, the agency abruptly allowed it to begin spending money again. Youth-Coop has now formed a legal services entity and hired Arno Lemus as its legal director, and he has begun visiting the shelters. A spokeswoman for HHS passed along a statement from ORR that insisted it was within its legal authority to send the money to Youth-Coop even though the contract had been canceled, although HuffPost had never asked if the move was legal. The permission came either just before or on the day that the new RFPs were due.The Government Accountability Office (GAO) lifted the stay on the contract and while the contract is being recompeted, the Agency is striving to ensure that as many children as possible are provided representation. The only mechanism we have to do that for this region of the country is through the contract awarded in September to the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI). This approach is entirely consistent with the law. Because there is a need for continuing services, the precedent established by the GAO provides for the Agency to continue performance of an award made, even under a potentially defective solicitation, pending the outcome of a new competition.The part of the statement claiming this is ""the only mechanism we have"" is wildly inaccurate. In fact, these children are currently getting legal services from AIJ, paid for by money that originates with ORR. So not only is there another legal mechanism, ORR is currently employing it, while saying there isn't one.Perlmutter, who runs the legal clinic, said the community is worried about the fate of the children. In the archbishop's letter to Burwell, he said immigration court judges were angry at the decision, an assertion Perlmutter confirmed. ""These are lawyers they've known and referred cases to for years and years and years,"" he said.Perlmutter said Lemus, Youth-Coop's new legal director, sent him a letter recently introducing himself, but that Perlmutter didn't feel comfortable referring cases to somebody without experience in this very specialized field. Youth-Coop did not return calls requesting comment.When Youth-Coop put up its posting for the 17 staff attorney openings, it required applicants be merely ""proficient"" in Spanish -- which could make representing a 5-year-old from Honduras rather difficult, and suggested to Perlmutter and others that the group's inexperience was already showing.""Proficient doesn't cut it,"" Perlmutter said. ""You can't get it done. You've got to be fluent in Spanish, you need to know legal Spanish. These cases turn on how well the facts are elicited from the clients and how they're presented to the tribunal or the court.""Lemus, Perlmutter noted, doesn't have the right legal background and has only two years as a barred lawyer. His LinkedIn page lists his specialties as family law, administrative law, bankruptcy, licensing, criminal defense, immigration, personal injury, civil litigation, arbitration and class actions -- a clear sign that he is just starting out in his career, yet he's being tasked with running a massive, extremely complex project linked with the fates of thousands of young, vulnerable children. None of those areas of specialty, Perlmutter said, applies to the law that impacts these children. ""Conventional immigration law is irrelevant. This is a very specialized, unique body of immigration and juvenile-dependency law and to some degree domestic violence law and a little bit of law that involves victims of trafficking and victims of crime,"" he said. ""Literally, he's a two-year lawyer.""This story has been updated with a comment from the HHS on Bob Carey's statement about Eskinder Negash.Sign up to get an email when reporter Ryan Grim publishes a new story."
