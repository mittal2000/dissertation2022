On Friday, Civil District Judge Kern Reese placed Landrieu in contempt, saying he failed to present a reasonable payment plan in response to the city firefighters' case for backpay. Reese set next Friday as the deadline by which the mayor must propose a better plan or face house arrest. The firefighters, who are seeking $75 million in backpay plus $67 million in interest and about $55 million in payments to their pension system, have triumphed over the Landrieu administration in every round of court. The two sides have been in mediation for about a month. In a press conference following the ruling Friday, Landrieu said he was ""extremely disappointed"" in the ruling.""This ruling undermines the very fundamental principle of our Constitution and it disrupts the separation of powers, which goes back 200 years in the United States of America,"" Landrieu told reporters. ""This city has in good faith gone above and beyond the call of duty to resolve both of the issues with the firefighters union and the pension fund."" The mayor said he is willing to work from home because he doesn't want to divert funds from other important items in the budget.""I am prepared to stay under house arrest for the next two years of my term because this is too important and too much is at stake for the city of New Orleans,"" Landrieu added. ""My wife is really happy about it. She called me and said she's been trying to get me to stay home on weekends for the past 23 years."" Friday's escalation came after the city publicly disclosed its proposed plan to pay the firefighters $15 million upfront and the other $60 million of backpay over the next 30 years, as long as the firefighters waive their rights to the interest and pension payments. The proposal was much more generous than the city's previous offer of $42 million. However, the extended payment period and loss of interest and pensions make it a ""ridiculous"" offer in the eyes of the firefighters.The long-term payments stretch out well beyond what is likely to be the natural lives of many of the firefighters, Louis Robein, the firefighters' attorney, told The Times-Picayune. Many have died without seeing a dime.The judge agreed, calling the deal ""absurd."" Though this is a big win for the firefighters, Reese implied he expects the firefighters to give some ground in negotiating a deal. ""Everyone needs to be responsible,"" he added. "

Kind of like New England Patriots fans celebrating Tom Brady as he skated past a four-game suspension on a technicality.

Mia Love (R-Utah) will pay back taxpayers for weekend plane tickets she bought to attend the White House Correspondents' Dinner earlier this year. Love said she would repay the more than $1,000 in tickets after The Hill reported on Thursday that the Republican, considered a rising star within the party, purchased them on the taxpayer's dime.The tickets, which totaled $1,160, were for a weekend trip from Salt Lake City to Washington, D.C., for Love and her husband. Members of Congress are not allowed to use their congressional allowance to pay for activities that are mainly social. Richard Piatt, Love's spokesman, told The Hill in a statement that a staff member booked the flight, not the congresswoman herself. While the trip included official business, Piatt said, Love plans to write a check to the U.S. Treasury.“Rep. Love takes the use of taxpayer money very seriously,"" Piatt said, ""and in order to ensure there is never a question about the proper use of funds, Rep. Love will reimburse the government for those flights.”"
5,POLITICS,Americans Overwhelmingly Support A Vacation Mandate,Dave Jamieson and Janie Velencia,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americans-paid-vacation-mandate_us_55e89cd7e4b0c818f61b3ff2,Fifty-four percent of those surveyed say they haven't taken a vacation in the last 12 months.,2015-09-04,"<p>Beachgoers at Germany's Rostock-Warnemuende resort. Unlike Europeans, slightly more than half of Americans surveyed say they haven't taken a vacation in the last year.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There is no law guaranteeing U.S. workers paid vacation, but the vast majority of Americans think there should be one, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll.In the poll conducted just before Labor Day, 78 percent of respondents say large employers should be required to provide workers at least some paid vacation time, a result virtually unchanged from the three-quarters who said the same thing last year. Just over 60 percent say businesses should give their employees two weeks or more of time off.The U.S. is an outlier among advanced economies when it comes to guaranteeing vacation time for workers. Although most private sector employers do offer at least some paid time off, there is no federal mandate requiring that workers be offered paid vacation as part of their jobs. European countries, by contrast, provide at least 20 vacation days per year for employees.With vacation time left at the discretion of employers, how much paid time off you receive in the U.S. typically depends on where you fall along the income scale. High-income earners are significantly more likely to enjoy paid vacation than low-income earners. For instance, among the highest 10 percent of wage earners, 92 percent have access to vacation days, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics; among the lowest 10 percent, only 40 percent do.In the survey, of those employed at least part time, 58 percent say they receive paid vacation time from their employer, while 42 percent say they don't receive any paid vacation time. Fifty-four percent say they haven't taken a vacation in the last 12 months.Most Americans think employers should provide at least two weeks of paid vacation, according to the survey. Thirty-eight percent say two weeks should be guaranteed. Another 13 percent think three weeks is appropriate, and 18 percent say four weeks.  Liberals in Congress have proposed vacation mandates in the past without any success. A 2013 bill introduced by Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) would have guaranteed workers at large businesses at least one week of paid vacation, but the legislation picked up no traction with either Republicans or Democrats. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who's running to be the Democratic nominee for president, introduced a bill in June that would provide most workers with at least 10 vacation days per year. That bill is unlikely to ever make it out of committee in the Republican-led Senate.Many Americans who do receive paid vacation days don't necessarily take them. In a July HuffPost/YouGov poll, 37 percent of Americans who work part time or full time said they'd delayed taking a vacation this year in order to save money, and 45 percent said their ability to take time off from work had been at least somewhat of a factor in their summer plans.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 2-3 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population."

To make matters worse, a few of the hikers were climbing a waterfall at the time -- putting them in the worst possible place to face the onslaught of water.Watch as the water quickly overtakes one of the hikers, forcing him over the edge of the waterfall and into the pool below: ""There was no other option in my mind,"" Renee Lusano, one of the hikers, later wrote on her blog, ""than that I had just seen our friend disappear and be killed, and there was nothing we could do about it."" Thankfully, Lusano's initial impression was wrong. Everyone in the group made it out safely -- and Lusano's drone happened to catch the entire experience on film from a bird's-eye view.""I wasn’t aware of whether it was recording or what it was recording,"" Lusano wrote on her blog. ""I was only concerned that it was hovering high enough to be out of danger while I climbed to higher ground.""The group was hiking a popular trail near the beginning of Maui's famed Road to Hana. They were unaware of the potential for flooding in that area. ""Without warning there was an enormous rush of water coming over the waterfall,"" Lusano wrote. ""It had to have been instantly 50 times as much water rushing over.""Once the group escaped to higher ground, they were able to call 911 and were soon airlifted out of the area by an emergency search and rescue team.""My five friends and I learned firsthand that flash flooding in Maui streams is a very serious danger,"" Lusano wrote of the experience. ""I hope that our story and video spreads awareness and prevents similar rescues from having to take place in the future.""Hawaii, with its volatile weather patterns, can be a dangerous place for visitors who see it as a tropical playground. On that day alone, 16 people, including Lusano and her friends, were rescued due to flooding in East Maui.Watch the whole video below to see how a relatively calm stream quickly turns into a torrent of murky water, and how the hikers scramble to find higher ground.

9,SCIENCE,Scientists Use DNA 'Velcro' To Print Human Tissue In The Lab,Joe Satran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dna-velcro-human-tissue-lab_us_55e64209e4b0c818f619b136,A new technique could one day solve the intractable problem of organ shortages.,2015-09-04,<p>An illustration of one of the two types of biological structures -- a vascular network -- created using a new technique developed by a team at UCSF.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e745ff1d0000d101146a29.png?cache=4yNT2enLt6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We need more organs. At any given moment, more than 123,000 Americans are waiting for an organ transplant. Each year, 6,500 of them die for want of a donor. Moreover, between 15 and 50 percent of patients lucky enough to receive a transplant from a donor -- depending on the organ -- suffer from acute organ rejection within five years.For that reason, scientists across the country are racing to develop a way to grow organs in the lab. The dream is to eventually use a patient's own cells to construct new kidneys, livers, hearts and lungs that would be impervious to rejection by their immune systems -- in other words, a way to let patients be their own organ donors. What makes this hard is that the techniques humans use for manufacturing most things don't work for organs. A car ""has lots of pieces, and they fit together very nicely, and they're guided to the correct position by a human hand or a robot, and then welded together into this complex machine,"" said Dr. Zev Gartner, an associate professor of pharmaceutical chemistry at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Tissues and organs, on the other hand, self-assemble in a process that's guided by rules that are quite distinct from the way that we as humans think about building stuff.""One key challenge is getting blood vessels to the right place. It's essential, because blood vessels deliver life-sustaining oxygen and nutrients to the cells, but the tiny vessels travel circuitous paths through organs -- surrounded at all times by other types of cells. This week, researchers from Gartner's lab unveiled a technique that could help overcome this obstacle. The team developed a method for assembling living cells (from both mice and humans) into tiny ""organoids"" with a simplified version of the deeply complex structures of actual organs. The technique, written up in Nature Methods, is essentially a form of 3D printing -- but it doesn't involve a 3D printer. Instead, it's not totally unlike glitter painting, where little kids draw a pattern in glue, pour a bunch of glitter over it, then shake away the excess to reveal a glittery shape. Except instead of glitter, the scientists used cells -- and instead of glue, they used DNA to make a kind of biological Velcro that affixed the cells in the right place. This video, courtesy of The Gartner Lab and Nature Methods, demonstrates the principles of the technique. All those little circles are cells:What makes this technique unusual, though, is that the scientists assigned differently coded strands of DNA to different types of cells. So they were able to specify the location of different types of cells precisely, much as the human body does naturally.""The DNA has this remarkably ability to only stick to the complementary sequence, and when it finds that complementary sequence, it sticks very, very quickly and specifically,"" Gartner said. ""So what we've done is turn this molecule, which is normally a genetic information carrier, into [...] a multi-flavor Velcro."" To return to the glitter painting analogy, it's as if you could assign different types of glue to different colors of glitter -- so that if you drew concentric arcs using glues for the seven major colors, poured multicolored glitter over it and shook off the extra, you would be left with a rainbow. But the group was working in three dimensions, not two. They built up the organoids atop a piece of glass, layer by layer. Depending on the pattern they started with, that left them with either a cluster of several different types of cells around half the size of a human thumb or a complex branching structure of cells that resembled a vascular system. Gartner's team built these structures using just three or four types of cells, but the technique could, in principle, accommodate any number of cell types. In the short term, Gartner said, their goal is to use this method to study the development of tissues and the interactions between the cells that make up those tissues. But Gartner hopes to eventually refine the technique enough to use it to build working human organs. Such organs could be used first to test new experimental drugs; they would give researchers a better idea of some drugs' effects on our bodies than today's lab mice do. The hope is that eventually they can act as personalized transplant organs for people whose own organs are failing. ""That's a very long-term goal,"" Gartner said. ""Being able to build an organ is the dream, but it's at least a decade away, if not multiple decades away."""

Milken has since attempted to rehabilitate his image through philanthropy.After serving as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, Rubin made over $120 million working at Citigroup, which he left shortly before the faltering megabank was bailed out by taxpayers. Rubin spent 26 years at Goldman Sachs, and ran the firm for his final two before joining the Treasury. Paulson made about $500 million working at Goldman before serving as Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush. Geithner, sadly, had to settle for making $411,200 a year when he served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Geithner and Paulson coordinated the bailouts that saved Citi and other banks in 2008. Geithner succeeded Paulson as Treasury secretary under President Barack Obama and took a high-paying job at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus in 2013.Sandberg, whose question prompted the moment of levity, is worth almost $1.2 billion. She worked for Treasury Secretary Larry Summers during the Clinton years and has been a staunch advocate for women's equality in the workplace.While in office, all three men advocated Wall Street-friendly policies that helped bolster pay for top bankers. Overall worker wages have been stagnant for decades and falling for most workers since 2007.Hilarious!"
11,ENTERTAINMENT,"One Year Later, Joan Rivers' Absence Is Just Now Setting In",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joan-rivers-death-anniversary_us_55e45a0ee4b0b7a963397ae3,"With awards season approaching, we're mourning her death all over again.",2015-09-04,"<p>Elton John, Cher and Paul Reubens appear on the inaugural 1986 episode of ""The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers.""</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Joan Rivers left this world one year ago today, but it still feels like we'll see her next resurgence any day now. Surely she's about to make another return to ""The Tonight Show,"" where she'll unleash barbs about Donald Trump's campaign and North West's soon-to-be baby brother. Obviously Stephen Colbert will invite her onto ""The Late Show"" in lieu of her frequent quips with David Letterman. It's about time for new episodes of ""In Bed with Joan"" and another tour, right? And, of course, any day now I'll glimpse her fur coat prancing through the halls of HuffPost Live, where she was a regular guest. For anyone else who pretended Rivers would spring back to life after last August's botched throat surgery, her absence is just now setting in. As much as I'd like to think she's on an extended vacation, anyone familiar with Rivers' career knows that she takes no breaks. (After all, she was still winning Grammys after her death.) But things are happening in the world that demand commentary from the first female comic to headline Carnegie Hall. This is the first presidential election she won't commentate in who knows how long. Instead of lambasting the Emmy red carpet's fashion choices in a few weeks, she'll presumably be part of the show's In Memoriam segment. And who will tell us what to think when Oscar season boots up and there are umpteen award-show faux pas to parse through? When beloved actors or musicians die unexpectedly, we find a shred of consolation in whatever fresh material will be released posthumously. Many argued that Paul Walker's death, for example, is part of what made ""Furious 7"" the most lucrative installment in that behemoth franchise. Twenty-one years after Kurt Cobain's suicide, fans still eat up any of his lost music that surfaces. But the ever-transparent Rivers, whose insightful 2010 documentary showcases the elaborate filing system she used to catalog every joke she wrote, isn't someone who'd keep a secret comedy album buried within her Marie Antoinette-inspired Manhattan penthouse. There is nothing to keep Rivers alive but the remains of her cultural impact. That leaves the rest of us to endure 17 Republican nominees sparring about anchor babies without the respite of Rivers' quick-witted scorn. What's suffered the most without Rivers is undoubtably ""Fashion Police,"" the E! snark-fest that Rivers was the face of since its launch in 2010. The show underwent a brief hiatus until Kathy Griffin -- long considered Rivers' comedic heir thanks to her likeminded infatuation with celebrity culture -- took over hosting duties. The show saw one implosion after the next: Griffin, who reportedly angled for the job while Rivers was on her death bed, lasted a mere seven episodes before calling it quits. Kelly Osbourne, one of the program's original moderators, dropped out shortly thereafter. Rumors of feuds swirled. ""This never would have happened if my mother was alive,"" Melissa Rivers, the show's executive producer and new co-host, said in June.This is all a distended way of saying that life is no fun without Joan Rivers' biting, business-savvy persona around to hand us things to argue about. For better or worse, I wonder whether she'd land in hot water over Caitlyn Jenner zingers, having called Michelle Obama a ""tranny"" last year. Would she ease up on her pal Trump, having won ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" in 2009, or would she go all in on, say, his recent interview with Sarah Palin, whom she called ""stupid"" in 2011? And oh, the things she could have said about Miley Cyrus' wardrobe at Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards. (""Every time this girl twerks in public, an angel gets knocked up,"" Rivers scoffed after the singer's VMA performance with Robin Thicke.)I read a great deal about Rivers in the wake of her death, but one sentence that Phillip Maciak wrote for Slate struck me in particular: ""The central irony of Rivers’ face, as it’s evolved over the years, is that the more artificial and mask-like her appearance became, the fewer and fewer shits she seemed to give about what anybody thought of her."" She lived to the ripe age of 81, but she deserved another decade to bathe in the heyday she hadn't experienced since before Johnny Carson blacklisted her in 1986. She deserved to let her already sparse boundaries lend her even more brashness and more relevance. In a way, Amy Schumer is carrying some of Rivers' torch. Either way, it won't burn out. She is our dearly departed guardian angel of truth.""That's what's so wonderful about life -- you must always have something else you want to do,"" Rivers said on HuffPost Live in 2013. Her list included a return to Broadway, her own late-night show (again) and getting laid. Whether those things were feasible doesn't matter. Rivers was always one of our most aspirational celebrities, constantly seeking a new trail to blaze. If only we could see what the next one had looked like.

12,BUSINESS,This Could Be The Biggest Boost For Work-Life Balance Since …,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/overtime-pay-middle-class_us_55e9ea61e4b002d5c075fbb4,"... Well, it's been a while.",2015-09-04,<p>President Franklin Roosevelt signed the federal overtime law in 1938.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e9f0001d0000ea01146db2.jpeg?ops=crop_51_420_2669_2143%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Millions of overworked middle-class Americans are on the verge of getting some relief, and possibly a raise, because of a proposed federal rule that you may not have heard about.Under the rule, workers who make less than $50,400 a year would be eligible for overtime pay (i.e., time and a half) when they work more than 40 hours a week.Friday is the last day for Americans to comment on the rule, which was proposed by President Barack Obama in June and is under consideration at the Labor Department. The White House hopes to implement the rule in 2016. ""Trust me on this: you'd be very hard pressed to come up with [another] rule change or executive order to lift the pay of this many middle-wage workers,"" former White House economist Jared Bernstein wrote in The Washington Post this summer. He published an influential paper on the subject after leaving the administration in 2011. The new rule could also go a long way toward returning some much needed work-life balance to middle-class employees -- from store and hotel managers to cooks to bookkeepers to reporters and editors -- who might see their real hours on the job reduced. Some may wind up getting a raise. Here's a video explainer from the administration:Raising the pay threshold would make at least 5 million people newly eligible for time and a half, according to the Obama administration. It would also make overtime pay available to as many as 8.5 million other workers who were likely misclassified as not eligible under the current rules, according to an analysis from the Economic Policy Institute.The new rule could push employers to create 117,000 new jobs, the institute estimates.Though its impact wouldn't be as broad as, say, raising the minimum wage, it would be a very big deal for the middle class, said Ross Eisenbrey, a vice president at the Economic Policy Institute who's been studying the issue for years (he co-authored that paper with Bernstein).""The government can do something to make their [middle-class] lives better. To give them back the time they need to spend with their families. Not to make them sick at work,"" Eisenbrey said.People who work more than 55 hours a week have a higher risk of stroke and heart disease, according to a recent study. The federal overtime law was passed during the Great Depression. The idea was to protect workers from toiling away at jobs for excessive hours without compensation. Overtime pay was also seen as a way to create more jobs. Instead of paying someone time and a half, it would cheaper to hire a new person to pick up the extra hours.The workers exempt from overtime coverage were supposed to be executives, managers and white-collar employees who were fairly well-compensated. Exempt workers used to constitute a much smaller slice of the total workforce. In 1975, 62 percent of full-time salaried workers qualified for overtime pay, including a majority of college graduates. Today, only 8 percent of workers qualify for overtime.The main reason for that is the very low threshold for overtime pay. The threshold was last raised in 2004, but even then the Bush administration didn't shift it much, said Eisenbrey. The new limit of $23,660 was just over the poverty line for a family of four, he said.That the government was treating people who made so little as if they needed no more protection than executives ""makes me angry still,"" he said.What’s happened, thanks to that low threshold, is that a lot of salaried workers are putting in extra-long hours for what turns out to be very low hourly rates. When you add up the time they're putting in, sometimes these people make less than the minimum wage. Some are labeled managers, but they have none of the flexibility or creative freedom that you'd think would come with that title.There are cases in which people who are doing things like running a gas station are paid less than the people they supervise. A CVS night manager making $34,000 a year told The American Prospect about working extremely long hours, pitching in for hourly employees who had to be sent home because the company didn't want to pay overtime. She isn't necessarily looking for time-and-a-half pay, she told the magazine. She just wants to spend more time with her family.Predictably, most businesses oppose raising the overtime threshold. The National Retail Federation claims that it will cost jobs and discourage its member companies from promoting hourly workers into management. The retailers say it will drive employers to limit worker hours, reduce base pay and hire more part-timers. It will also cause payrolls to rise. The administration estimates the proposed rule could cost employers around $1.2 billion a year.In response to the rule, employers could do a few things to avoid paying overtime: hand out raises to lift workers over the $50,400 threshold, cut worker hours and hire more employees to make up the difference.Many companies are waiting to see what the final rule looks like before making any changes, said Nancy Hammer, senior policy counsel at the Society for Human Resource Management. The trade group opposes the new threshold and thinks it should take into account the fact that the cost of living varies around the country.""A lot of companies have tried to do a preliminary count and see how many employees would be affected,"" Hammer said. The Wall Street Journal reported that businesses are ""scrambling"" to figure out what to do.As of Friday afternoon, about 194,735 individuals, businesses and industry groups had commented over the past 60 days. That alone tells you how big a deal this is. The last time the rule changed, it drew only 75,028 comments over 90 days, according to The Washington Post."

The only factor, he said, was his and his family’s commitment.“Can my family undertake what is an arduous commitment?” he said.“Unless I can go to my party and the American people and say I am able to devote my whole heart and soul to this endeavor, it would not be appropriate.”Biden has stepped up his public schedule, and will travel to Pittsburgh on Monday for Labor Day celebrations and New York later in the week to appear on Stephen Colbert’s talk show.But he said he did not know when he would make a decision.“There is no way to put a timetable on it,” he said.

""We have no further comment at this time.” Al Jazeera America, the 3-year-old channel launched by the Qatar-based Al Jazeera Media Network, has been the site of newsroom turmoil. The network's CEO left in May amid employees' claims of a ""culture of a fear"" in the New York newsroom. Several high-ranking women executives have also left, with a couple former employees filing lawsuits claiming discrimination.

This week, however, the former governor of Florida was forced to change tactics and attack the real estate mogul head-on -- calling into question his record as a true conservative and asserting that Trump is attempting to ""insult his way into the presidency.""But all the tough talk wouldn't preclude Bush from eventually supporting Trump if he won the Republican presidential nomination.In an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" the presidential hopeful said he would ""of course"" support the man he has argued isn't worthy -- at least for the time being -- of the nation's highest office.“We need to be unified, we need to win and I think Mr. Trump ought to figure out a way maybe to lessen the divisive language, the hurtful language and talk about the aspirations of the American people rather than trying to prey on their fears,” he said.After Bush criticized Trump in Spanish on Tuesday, the businessman asserted that the governor ""should really set the example by speaking English while in the United States."" Bush is fluent in Spanish, and his wife, Columba, was born in Mexico.When he heard Trump's comments about sticking to English, Bush said in the ABC interview, he couldn't help but laugh.""I mean, this is a joke,” he said, adding that speaking in more than one language is the “reality of America.”Trump is slated to meet with Republican National Committee officials on Thursday, where he is, according to CNN, likely to sign a pledge circulated to all candidates promising to support whoever wins the Republican nomination. At the first GOP debate last month, Trump was the only candidate who raised his hand when asked whether anyone might not rule out an independent bid.Asked about the feud on Fox News, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), a candidate himself, shrugged off both his fellow rivals. He critiqued Bush for “wasting everybody’s time harping about” Trump and his latest controversial comments, asking, ""Who cares? Who cares?""Tim Miller, Bush's communications director, on Thursday fired back on Twitter.Also on HuffPost:"

The neighborhood certainly has its struggles -- it is home to one of the nation’s 100 poorest zip codes -- but many other positive stories were going untold. As reported this week by Jackie Spinner in the Columbia Journalism Review, the Gatehouse Media-owned paper moved to address the disparity in coverage by creating a reader advisory group earlier this year.The group meets once a month to discuss ideas for future stories based in the South Side in addition to looking at how the paper has done in its coverage of the neighborhood the previous month.According to CJR, between 12 and 25 people attend the meetings, including reporters and editors from the paper. The meetings are hosted by community organizations who have become involved with the group. Journal Star executive editor Dennis Anderson referenced an example of coverage stemming from the advisory group -- a front page story on a neighborhood cleanup project that attracted more than 250 volunteers in July -- in a piece published last month. The story was the result of Anderson’s correspondence with Robin Berry, the housing development director for a local organization and a member of the paper’s advisory group. Anderson is quick to note the paper is still covering the community’s problems with crime and poverty, but is now working to present a picture that also pays tribute to its residents’ creativity and resilience.MORE:National Journal: Georgia's Fight to End The Childhood Word GapFastCompany: A Standing Desk For Kids, To Help Change Sitting Culture (There's An Adult Size, Too)The What’s Working Honor Roll highlights some of the best reporting and analysis, from a range of media outlets, on all the ways people are working toward solutions to some of our greatest challenges.
