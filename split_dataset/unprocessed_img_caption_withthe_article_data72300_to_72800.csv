Turness angered members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus during a meeting Wednesday by first referring to undocumented immigrants as “illegals,” and then speaking in Spanish in an attempt to pander to those present.“Yo hablo español,” the NBC News president said during the meeting, according to sources who attended. “We love the Hispanic community.”The incident, first reported by Politico, took place during a meeting that Latino lawmakers had requested to discuss diversity at NBC and Donald Trump’s recent appearance on “Saturday Night Live.” Members of the Caucus had sent a letter to NBC protesting the network’s decision to host the reality TV star and presidential candidate. In June, Trump sparked outrage among Latino groups by referring to Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and “criminals.”Rather than smoothing things over, Wednesday's meeting left lawmakers feeling frustrated and offended. Near the start of the meeting, Turness was describing a story her network had covered about Pope Francis’ interaction with a young girl who said she feared her parents would be deported. Turness referred to the girl’s parents as “illegals.”“I’m going to stop you right there,” interjected Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.), according to a Democratic congressional staffer who was in the room. “We don’t use the term ‘illegals’ to describe people. We use the term ‘undocumented immigrants.’”Turness apologized, but later reignited tensions by speaking Spanish, purportedly to try and show Latino lawmakers she understood their concerns.“Speaking Spanish to make up for insensitivity was tone-deaf,” the staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told The Huffington Post.The staffer argued that Turness' comments show why more Latinos need to be in newsrooms and on the air. “The insensitivity of these comments is exactly why we need Latino representation among news media,” the staffer said, adding that diversity at NBC would ensure that “there is someone in that room -- even before decisions like the Trump one get made -- to say, ‘Hold on, that’s offensive and tone-deaf to our community.’”Other lawmakers present included Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.), Linda Sánchez (D.-Calif.) and Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.).Among the NBC executives who attended were NBCUniversal Chief Diversity Officer Craig Robinson, Senior Vice President of Human Resources Joanne O’Brien and NBC News Washington Bureau Chief Ken Strickland. Phil Griffin, president of subsidiary company MSNBC, was also present.The network invited one of its Latino staff members to attend the meeting, but she barely spoke, sources said.Adding insult to injury, the executives told the lawmakers at the beginning of the meeting that they could not address objections to Trump’s appearance on ""Saturday Night Live"" because it was a matter for NBC Entertainment, whereas only representatives from the news division were present.“There was a lot of frustration in the room,” Cárdenas told Politico, adding that the exchange “was about them sitting down with the Hispanic caucus for the sake of saying they met with us -- like that is progress.”Define American, an immigrant rights group, released a statement Thursday condemning Turness’ use of “illegals,” which many in the Latino community consider a racial slur. NBC News’ own guidelines bar the use of “illegal” and “illegal immigrant” in news coverage.“Words matter because words and phrases like ‘illegals’ frame the conversation, how politicians talk about the issue, and -- inevitably -- how policies are created,” said José Antonio Vargas, the group’s founder. “It is absolutely an ethnically tied slur.”Rev. Ryan M. Eller, Define American’s executive director, said he “would like to personally invite Ms. Turness to have a conversation with undocumented immigrants and allies about the very real reasons terms such as ‘illegals’ are antiquated, offensive and inaccurate.”A spokeswoman for NBC declined to comment on the meeting, directing HuffPost to a statement made to Politico, in which a representative said the exchange was “an open and respectful dialogue about the progress that’s been made on diversity both in front of and behind the camera in the news division.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article was accompanied by the wrong photo."

3,BUSINESS,Price-Gouging Pharma CEO Takes Over Cancer Company,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/martin-shkreli-kalobios-ceo_us_564f55f0e4b0258edb313e7c,"Since investors led by Martin Shkreli swooped in, the price of KaloBios has skyrocketed.",2015-11-20,"Martin Shkreli is seen in August 2011, when he was chief investment officer of MSMB Capital Management.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564f68422100003e005ab522.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Martin Shkreli, the former hedge fund executive notorious for radically jacking up the price of a pill used by cancer and HIV patients, has taken over another pharmaceutical company. Shkreli's startup, Turing Pharmaceuticals, acquired the drug Daraprim in August, and overnight the price went from $13.50 per tablet to $750, a 5,000 percent increase. Shkreli is now the chief executive officer and chairman of the board at KaloBios, a publicly traded company in the San Francisco Bay Area, the company announced on Thursday.As part of that announcement, KaloBios said its mission is ""to improve the lives of patients with innovative therapies"" by developing breakthrough antibodies. The company is focused on developing a leukemia treatment, according to its website.Last week, though, the company announced it was going to liquidate its assets and halt development of two drugs.On Monday and Tuesday, a group of investors led by Shkreli swooped in and bought up 70 percent of the company's shares, paying as little as $0.61 per share, according to CNN. The stock closed at $10.40 on Thursday, and in Friday trading it fetched over $18.75. Shkreli's team ended up with a majority stake by committing $3 million of equity.Perhaps because he's been the target of public scorn, Shkreli announced that he won't take a salary at KaloBios.Shkreli confirmed to The Huffington Post on Friday that his compensation will be in the form of stock only.""It's wrong when the top people at a company keep all of the money for themselves,"" Shkreli said. ""If you're successful, you should let your employees get some of the money.""He argued that lab workers at his company would reap more of the profits than they would at other big rivals. He pointed to the pharmaceutical giant Merck, where CEO Kenneth Frazier's total compensation swelled to $25 million last year while the average worker earned about $103,000 annually, according to self-reported data from the salary-monitoring site Glassdoor. Shkreli said the discrepancy was unfair, since Frazier ""doesn't know anything about science.""""Let the CEO get a lot of stock. They can make their millions that way,"" he said. ""I lead by example.""Merck did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Shkreli also clarified a tweet from earlier in the day suggesting that KaloBios employees who'd been recently laid off could get their jobs back.Shkreli told HuffPost he would welcome back 18 KaloBios employees recently laid off.The new KaloBios CEO is likely to remain the object of public scrutiny for some time. Presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, among others, said in September that the exorbitant increase to the cost of Daraprim amounted to ""price-gouging.""Bowing to pressure, Shkreli said in September that Turing would lower the price of the drug, though he didn't specify when or what the new price would be. He confirmed to HuffPost on Friday that Daraprim is ""still the same price,"" and wouldn't discuss details of the announced price reduction.Patients who use the medicine -- whether to fight a parasitic infection or to compensate for a weakened immune system brought on by AIDS or cancer -- might not need to wait for him. A competitor popped up last month announcing the sale of a $1 alternative to Daraprim.The controversy over the soaring price of the drug revealed that Shkreli's earlier career was under scrutiny too. Financial reports by Turing to the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Shkreli had been under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York. The federal attorneys were reviewing Shkreli's relationship with the hedge fund that he'd founded. The SEC report said Shkreli admitted he owed over $500,000 to MSMB Capital Management, his former hedge fund. "

""No one else is to be blamed but me.""Bowers' troubles started Wednesday, when he came out against aiding Syrian refugees in the wake of the Paris attacks. He said all assistance should cease ""until these serious hostilities and atrocities end, or at the very least until regarded as under control by U.S. authorities, and normalcy is restored."" ""I'm reminded that President Franklin D. Roosevelt felt compelled to sequester Japanese foreign nationals after the bombing of Pearl Harbor,"" he added, ""and it appears that the threat of harm to America from ISIS is now just as real and serious as that from our enemies then.""Bowers quickly faced national criticism, perhaps most vocally from within his own party. Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.), who lived in an internment camp, and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz put out a joint statement saying that ""his rhetoric has no place in our party."" Bowers also lost his spot on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's Virginia Leadership Council. In his apology Friday, Bowers said his comments were ""a personal political view"" issued ""in a statement on mayor's office stationery"" and resisted calls for his resignation.""I anticipated that the statement might receive some coverage in the Roanoke Valley, but I did not in any way anticipate that it would trend internationally over the Internet,"" he said.""It's just not in my heart to be racist or bigoted,"" he added. ""My statement was intended to be respectful -- was intended to be respectful -- measured and moderate in tone and substance, but it fell short obviously.""In the wake of the Paris attacks, a growing number of U.S. politicians have called for the United States to impose tighter restrictions -- or close its doors completely -- to refugees fleeing war-torn Syria. Their concerns center around the fear that terrorists could pose as refugees and enter the country, even though none of the Paris attackers have so far been identified as Syrian. Also on HuffPost:"

Nearby Wellston is one of several towns suing in response to a law that decreases how much money small municipalities can make from petty fines.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55df514114000077002e43a4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ST. LOUIS -- A dozen St. Louis County municipalities are suing over a new law designed to curb their over-reliance on petty traffic tickets for revenue.A group of mayors on Thursday announced their lawsuit against Missouri Gov. Jeremiah Nixon (D) and various state officials. The leaders, who represent municipalities that on average are each smaller than a square mile, are targeting a bipartisan bill enacted in August that lowers the money their towns can make from court fines and traffic tickets from 30 percent to 12.5 percent of their total revenue.Following the police killing of Michael Brown last year, the St. Louis region erupted in chaos, with residents protesting the broken relationship between police and civilians. For years, police departments throughout the country bullied residents with tickets and arrests in order to generate revenue for municipalities.State Sen. Eric Schmitt (R), who sponsored the legislation, said in a press conference Thursday that the ""meritless lawsuit"" was fighting against the ""most significant municipal reform in the history of our state.""The current system ""has created debtors' prisons and contributed to the cycle of poverty for way too many folks in the St. Louis area,"" he said.Standing alongside Schmitt in support of the new law was state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed (D).""The problems you saw in Ferguson, it was beyond the killing of Michael Brown,"" Nasheed said. ""Those individuals in those municipalities felt they were economically oppressed for far too long, and that's the uprise you saw.""According to a report by the research group Better Together, some municipalities in the area were generating over 30 percent of their revenue from court fines and tickets. Schmitt said that three-fifths of the arrest warrants in St. Louis County (300,000) are from minor traffic violations.The Rev. B. T. Rice, who attended Schmitt's press conference, said the court system in St. Louis was ""horrible.""""We've seen our people standing in the heat of the day, 100 degree heat, trying to go to pay a traffic ticket because of a tail light, and they were unable to take their children in,"" he said.Rice said those people would then receive a warrant for leaving court. ""Then if found while driving, they would be arrested. They would lose their job,"" he said.In an email to the St. Louis American, Monica Huddleston, the former mayor of Greendale, said none of the mayors are in favor of ""victimizing anyone at the hands of local police or courts."" Greendale is one of the municipalities taking part in the lawsuit.""You and others are still talking about abuses that have been all but eradicated months ago, and such was occurring in very few of our muni courts,"" Huddleston wrote.The city of Pagedale, a plaintiff in the lawsuit, is currently facing its own federal lawsuit for the heavy ticketing of house ordinance violations. The Institute For Justice, a law firm with connections to the industrialist billionaire Koch brothers, is heading the lawsuit against Pagedale. Since 2010, the town increased non-traffic violations by nearly 500 percent.The city told The Huffington Post that in 2010, it made less than $1,000 for house ordinance violations, which cover things like broken screen doors and messy lawns. In 2014, that figure was nearly $9,000.Pagedale Mayor Mary Carter told HuffPost that the lawsuit against her city is ""unfair"" and part of an overall effort from liberal groups like the Institute for Justice and Better Together ""to get rid of some of the small municipalities.""""We have never tried to take any revenue as far as housing or traffic -- we have no traffic cameras. I don't believe in traffic cameras. I don't believe in ticket quotas. I believe that every ticket you write should be a valid ticket on its own,"" Carter said.Former St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch said that if some municipalities can't sustain themselves without excess traffic revenue, ""So what?""Fitch said the mayors who filed the lawsuit ""are not just guilty,"" they're also ""the main suspects"" in abusing the system. ""They're the ones telling their officers to go out and write tickets,"" he said. "

On this week's episode of ""The Second Half"" podcast, hosts Travis Waldron and Donté Stallworth discuss whether the Packers, who looked like Super Bowl contenders a few weeks ago, can get back on track with a trip to the first-place Minnesota Vikings looming this week (Packers talk begins around 34:00).It's been an interesting week in Green Bay. Shortly after the Packers lost to Detroit at home for the first time in more than two decades, quarterback Aaron Rodgers used his post-game press conference to denounce a fan's derogatory comments about Muslims during a moment of silence to honor victims of the Paris attacks.It was an upstanding moment in an otherwise bleak week for a team that has struggled to regain its form on offense over the last month.Also on this week's episode, Bleacher Report NFL columnist Mike Freeman discusses the rash of major injuries in football this season -- and how fantasy football may be changing the way fans view NFL players and the injury risks they face (that starts at 10:30). Plus, the hosts discuss whether injuries to Denver's Peyton Manning and New England's Julian Edelman will shift the landscape in the AFC (listen from the beginning for that), and a big matchup this week between Cincinnati and Arizona will be a battle of teams trying to prove they're Super Bowl contenders (that begins at 41:00).

""We will not allow anti-immigrant attacks. We will not support the status quo.

The groups will also run digital ads in Florida, Nevada, Colorado and Texas -- all states with substantial Latino populations.The 2014 Latin Grammys start time was delayed by nearly 20 minutes because President Barack Obama was delivering a speech to announce a sweeping immigration program that, if allowed to go into effect, would protect millions of parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents from deportation. The one-year anniversary of that announcement is on Friday, and SEIU and iAmerica Action are aiming to ensure Latino audiences do not forget that Republicans have consistently attacked the program, called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA. The program is stalled in the courts after Republican governors sued the federal government over it.GOP presidential candidates have also vowed to get rid of an already-running program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, that allows certain young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to stay in the U.S. The ad shows presidential candidate and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) saying, ""We need to get rid of all these illegal executive orders the president has put in place,"" and later, ""DACA is going to end.""His fellow presidential hopeful, Sen.

Bernie Sanders, 5 percent naming Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, and 23 percent saying that nobody won or that they're not sure who performed the best. Those who watched part or all of the debate named Clinton the winner over Sanders by a wider, 40-point margin.The debate modestly improved voters' opinions of all three candidates.There's little sign, however, that the debate altered the larger trajectory of the Democratic primary, which has remained mostly stable over the past month. The margin by which Clinton was seen as the winner closely mirrors her margin in national horserace polls, suggesting that viewers' opinions of who did best were mostly based on who they were backing to begin with.The event did, though, underscore some of the policy differences between the candidates. Foreign policy, which was mentioned prominently in Saturday's discussion, is an area of strength for Clinton. A majority of all Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters said they trust Clinton the most to handle foreign policy and the fight against the Islamic State group, with fewer than one-fifth preferring Sanders on either topic. Sanders, who criticized Clinton's reliance on Wall Street donors, holds a modest advantage on that issue, with Democratic voters saying by a 9-point margin that they're more likely to trust him than Clinton to deal with Wall Street and big banks.

""Effective immediately, NIH will no longer maintain a colony of 50 chimpanzees for future research.""According to NBC News, there hasn’t been a single request to use these chimps for the past two and a half years.""We have moved on from the time when research on chimpanzees was considered essential,"" Collins said, per the news outlet.In 2013, NIH retired about 310 chimps, saying humans' closest relatives ""deserve special respect.""

The visitors suspected that Nainggolan was a terrorist because of his appearance, according to the Mirror.

Nainggolan took it in stride and snapped a picture with the police.“Obviously, I have a look that is scary,” Nainggolan told a Belgian newspaper.

17,POLITICS,Annual U.S. Homeless Count Shows Tiny Decline,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-homelessness-2015_us_564dfd64e4b08c74b734a525,Looks like the government will fall short of its goal to end veteran homelessness this year.,2015-11-19,"Chronic homelessness in the U.S. declined an estimated 22 percent between 2010 and 2015, but that trend slowed significantly between 2014 and 2015, the government says.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Homelessness declined 2 percent from last year, the federal government announced on Thursday.On a single night in January, the government counted 564,708 Americans on the streets or in shelters, down slightly from the 578,424 counted on a single night in January 2014, the Department of Housing and Urban Development reported. The homeless count has declined 11 percent since 2007. In 2010, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness announced a plan to end chronic and veteran homelessness in five years, which now seems like a long shot. Thursday's report said there were 47,725 homeless veterans in January 2015, down just 4 percent from the previous year. Yet Matthew Doherty, director of the council, sounded an optimistic note. ""Because the data is 10 months old, it doesn't even reflect the progress that has been made this year as communities have been putting a very large effort to the end-of-the year goal of ending veteran homelessness,"" he said Thursday on a conference call with reporters.Doherty pointed out that homelessness among veterans has declined 47 percent since 2010. ""That tells us communities are doing a much better job of creating opportunities for veterans to leave our streets and get on a path to permanent housing,"" he said.But Doherty bluntly said progress has slowed on chronic homelessness, which affected 83,170 people in January -- just 819 fewer people than in 2014. The chronically homeless are the most visible cohort of the overall homeless population: HUD defines them as individuals with disabilities who've been homeless at least a year. Doherty said lower funding levels from Congress partly explain why chronic homelessness has barely declined in the last year.""The estimated 22 percent decline in chronic homelessness between 2010 and 2015 is really significant, but we've also seen that progress slowing,"" he said. ""The decrease between 2104 and 2015 of only an estimated 1 percent, I think, needs to be treated as a call to action at all levels of government."" Since the George W. Bush administration, the federal government has advocated a ""housing first"" approach for the chronically homeless, the idea being that local agencies should put homeless people in apartments before insisting that those with drug or alcohol addictions get clean and sober while they're still on the street. The approach has had some success, but it hasn't exactly caught on at the local level in towns across the U.S. The housing department's annual ""point-in-time"" estimate of the homeless population misses people who might be hiding in the woods, for example, and the even greater number of Americans who might be couch-surfing or living with friends. The agency has a broader measurement of ""worst case housing needs"" that says 7.7 percent of Americans are in dire need of more stable housing. Also on HuffPost:"
18,POLITICS,Senate Dems Try To Shift Focus From Syrian Refugees By Backing Visa Waiver Limits,Elise Foley and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-democrats-visa-waivers-syrian-refugees_us_564dfbbee4b00b7997f98819,"Following the Paris attacks, some Democrats wanted to support measures that don't go after refugees.",2015-11-19,Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) have pushed a proposal to limit the visa waiver program. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564dfc761e00002e00264e0b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Democratic leaders are rallying around a strategy to deal with the threat of domestic terrorism without going after Syrian refugees, who have been the target of intense backlash since last week's attacks in Paris.At a press conference on Thursday, Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), his likely successor Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and a number of other Democrats said they will focus on other proposals to combat terrorism. One such measure would make changes to the visa waiver program, which allows residents of certain countries to visit the U.S. without a visa and without going through an interview. The Democrats also emphasized the need to ensure that people on terrorist watch lists can't possess or purchase firearms or explosives -- although passing any legislation on guns will be nearly impossible due to Republican opposition.""It's outrageous that dangerous individuals can waltz into a gun show and buy any gun they want,"" Reid said.By pushing for changes to the visa waiver program and for the closure of certain gun loopholes, Democrats are attempting not only to address what many caucus members see as genuine national security vulnerabilities, but also to slow the growing momentum to block Syrian refugees from coming to the United States. Thursday's press conference came shortly after the House moved forward a bill to add strict requirements to the refugee screening process, which Republicans and some Democrats argue could be exploited by Islamic State members. The militant group claimed credit for the attacks in Paris, which left 129 people dead. The White House has threatened to veto the House bill, arguing that the screening process is already comprehensive and that it is morally dubious to place additional burdens on those fleeing terrorism. Reid said at the press conference that the bill ""won't get passed"" in his chamber.But Democratic lawmakers have privately griped that as pressure mounts to respond to the Paris attacks, it would be hard to stand by the president absent a separate measure to address concerns about Islamic State infiltration. The proposed limits on visa waivers will give those Democrats an alternate policy to support.The visa waiver program ""is the soft underbelly of our national security policies,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said at the press conference. Feinstein is working with Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona on one piece of legislation to address the visa issue, which would block people from being eligible for a waiver if they had visited Iraq or Syria in the past five years. Feinstein and other Democrats at the press conference also proposed other measures related to visa waivers, such as requiring the U.S. to get more biometric information on the people using the program.The press conference follows a Wednesday evening briefing during which administration officials talked to members of Congress about the situation in Syria. Lawmakers said after that session that while they still want to ensure the strength of the refugee screening program, they are most concerned about the possibility of terrorists using the waiver program to get into the U.S. without a visa. Reid said Thursday that White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough asked lawmakers to work on bipartisan measures to make changes to the visa waiver program. Visa waiver limits may stand the best chance of passage compared to the House bill and other proposals. Some Republicans are on board with the idea, as are progressive Democrats like Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who has noted that it is far easier to enter the country through the visa waiver route than through the refugee screening process, which lasts an average of 18-24 months. Schumer's prominent role at Thursday's conference was particularly notable, given that he angered fellow Democrats, including administration officials, earlier this week by indicating that he was open to restrictions on refugee admittance. The New York Democrat said that he now believes a ""pause"" in the refugee admission process is not necessary.""The appropriate place to focus is the visa waiver program and the ability of terrorists to buy guns,"" Schumer said.However, the Senate is unlikely to act on any legislation regarding the visa waiver issue until after its Thanksgiving break, Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the Senate's third-ranking Republican, said on Wednesday.Reporters pressed House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Thursday on why his chamber had focused on refugees rather than the visa waiver program or gun loopholes. He insisted it was just one step in a long process."

The Hawaii Supreme Court issued an order Tuesday that temporarily blocks crews from working on the telescope.For more than a year, Native Hawaiians and environmentalists have succeeded in stalling the building of TMT -- one of the world's largest telescopes -- via a series of coordinated protests.Protesters and law enforcement were preparing for yet another standoff this week. Responding to an emergency motion filed Monday, which argued that construction would cause irreparable harm to the area, the court suspended the TMT International Observatory team's construction permit through Dec. 2 or ""until further order of the court.""The motion was filed by the same group that is challenging the state's issuance of permits for the project. Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano on Hawaii's Big Island, is considered sacred in Native Hawaiian culture and opponents argue the telescope would desecrate the space and cause environmental damage to the mountain. In August, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case, but a final ruling has not been made. Scott Ishikawa, a spokesman for the project, said in a statement Tuesday that the TMT team respects the court's decision and will ""stand down"" until Dec. 2. The decision, he said, would ""give all parties involved in the appeal sufficient time to respond to the motion.""Kealoha Pisciotta, a leader of the group that's challenging the project, welcomed the news and said she was hoping the court would agree construction of TMT shouldn’t begin until a final decision is reached in the lawsuit, reported the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.On Nov. 10, TMT announced its plans to send a small crew of local workers to the project site to ""conduct site preparation activities, starting with equipment maintenance and repairs.""

The Hawaii Supreme Court issued an order Tuesday that temporarily blocks crews from working on the telescope.For more than a year, Native Hawaiians and environmentalists have succeeded in stalling the building of TMT -- one of the world's largest telescopes -- via a series of coordinated protests.Protesters and law enforcement were preparing for yet another standoff this week. Responding to an emergency motion filed Monday, which argued that construction would cause irreparable harm to the area, the court suspended the TMT International Observatory team's construction permit through Dec. 2 or ""until further order of the court.""The motion was filed by the same group that is challenging the state's issuance of permits for the project. Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano on Hawaii's Big Island, is considered sacred in Native Hawaiian culture and opponents argue the telescope would desecrate the space and cause environmental damage to the mountain. In August, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case, but a final ruling has not been made. Scott Ishikawa, a spokesman for the project, said in a statement Tuesday that the TMT team respects the court's decision and will ""stand down"" until Dec. 2. The decision, he said, would ""give all parties involved in the appeal sufficient time to respond to the motion.""Kealoha Pisciotta, a leader of the group that's challenging the project, welcomed the news and said she was hoping the court would agree construction of TMT shouldn’t begin until a final decision is reached in the lawsuit, reported the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.On Nov. 10, TMT announced its plans to send a small crew of local workers to the project site to ""conduct site preparation activities, starting with equipment maintenance and repairs.""
