2,BUSINESS,This Was The Year We Finally Started To Care About Working Parents,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2015-paid-parental-leave_us_56780dade4b06fa6887dd638,2015 was a tipping point for paid leave in the U.S.,2015-12-22,"The paid leave trend started in tech and has spread to traditionally more conservative sectors, like financial services.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/567969e6190000190178a7f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kirsten Calkins was about five months pregnant with her first child, working as an executive coordinator at a small nonprofit in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Like many working parents in the U.S., she worried about how she’d manage having less money coming in while she cared for a new infant.Her employer, the International Association of Privacy Professionals, offered four weeks fully paid leave, then five weeks at 60 percent pay and then, if you could swing it, an additional three weeks unpaid.But Calkins was lucky to become pregnant in 2015: the year companies, particularly in tech, woke up and realized that you can’t strand workers facing huge personal challenges.In January, IAPP -- which counts many tech companies as members -- started giving all its workers 12 weeks fully paid leave after the arrival of a new child.“The level of excitement is hard to put into words,” Calkins told The Huffington Post. “Not having to juggle a life altering experience like having a baby with budgeting for a new expense with less income. It was like a weight was lifted.”The U.S. is one of a handful of countries that offers mothers no paid maternity leave. It is the only developed country without a paid leave policy. The lack of support causes a significant percentage of working parents to fall into poverty. It puts the health of parents and infants at risk.Finally, in 2015, policymakers and companies started to pay attention -- we may some day look back and see this past year as a tipping point in the movement toward paid leave for all. A significant number of businesses -- from Adobe to Netflix to Microsoft to Goldman Sachs -- announced they would expand paid benefits for their employees. Twenty-one percent of companies surveyed by the Society for Human Resource Management were offering paid maternity leave in 2015, up from 16 percent in 2011.And, for the first time a U.S. President got serious about paid parental leave and sick leave. “Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers,” Obama said in January’s State of the Union address. “And that forces too many parents to make [a] gut-wrenching choice.” The Department of Labor started offering grants to states looking to study how paid family leave would work. Three states currently have paid family leave policies in place: California, Rhode Island and New Jersey -- where the policy is so popular that Republican governor Chris Christie never followed through on his promise to get rid of it when he was voted into office. Eighteen other states are considering paid leave initiatives.Political candidates, on both sides of the aisle, now find they can no longer ignore the issue. Hillary Clinton called for paid leave in her first major economic speech as a presidential candidate this year. She’d never pushed for it as a senator. One Republican candidate, Marco Rubio, is calling for a company tax credit for offering paid leave.Candidates who support paid leave, were 8 percent more likely to win, according to projections from The National Partnership for Women & Families, cited in a New Republic piece earlier this year. In Connecticut, Dan Malloy is believed to have won the race for governor on the back of his support for paid sick leave.Labor groups are agitating for more parental leave.“It’s kind of a new thing. We’ve always pushed to increase quality of life for our members, but the spotlight has fallen on leave,” Robert Daraio, a local representative of the News Guild of New York, told HuffPost. Daraio helped negotiate four months' paid parental leave for employees at the liberal magazine The Nation in December. “We’re pushing for this in all contracts going forward,” he said.It seems almost daily a company issues a press release announcing more time for parents and caretakers.“It was a good year,” said Ellen Bravo, the director of Family Values @ Work, a nonprofit coalition of groups pushing for paid parental and sick leave in the U.S.Perhaps one of the most outspoken proponents of paid leave, Bravo said that family leave came to prominence thanks to a spiral of factors -- most notably the Obama administration, as well as the many states and municipalities taking action on this. She credits “millennials,” -- young adults -- who are demanding employers give them paid time off to care for children and family members.Some companies have always had this benefit, Bravo said. “The interest in making announcements public is what’s new. Part of that comes from their desire to say to millennials come here, we’re paying attention to this.”In the business sector, tech companies fell over themselves in 2015 offering more generous benefits. When Netflix this summer announced it would offer 12 months of leave to new parents, regardless of gender, the news was widely picked up and a flurry of other companies raced to improve their offerings -- including Microsoft and Amazon.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is right now taking a highly publicized paternity leave that Bravo said set a great example for fathers, who are seen as a crucial part of the paid leave movement.Banks got in on the trend, too. Private equity shop KKR and Credit Suisse both beefed up their offerings for parents this year.“We knew it started in tech, but then we started seeing businesses in financial services and banking, which are typically conservative, saying we need to do this, too,” said Melinda Figeley, who consults on human resource issues as a vice-president at NFP, an insurance brokerage with clients in banking. ""As employers adopt it what they see is people actually come back to work in higher numbers and they're happier and less stressed.""One thing critical about the new momentum on leave: It's not just for birth mothers, but for adoptive parents, for fathers, and for those who need time off to take care of loved ones. Paid parental leave -- not ""maternity"" leave -- is the hot new thing for companies, Figeley said.The change stems from the country's opening up to gay couples in recent years and people of various gender identities, Figeley said. ""The barriers are coming down and people aren't so narrow in their thinking that there's one kind of family or only one way to do maternity leave.""Yet for all the positive momentum on leave, the data still looks bleak. An overwhelming majority of employers don’t offer paid leave. Most states don’t offer paid leave. The U.S. unpaid leave law -- the Family and Medical Leave Act -- only covers 60 percent of workers.About 9 percent of workers who take time off to care for a family member end up on public assistance, according to labor department data cited by the New Republic. The Family Act, a bill sponsored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D – Conn.) that would pay for federally mandated leave by taking a few cents out of employee paychecks, is stalled out.“We haven’t yet reached a polio moment or a moonshot moment where the country comes together and says we can’t let this go on anymore,” Bravo said. “The good news is we don’t need a vaccine. We know the solution. It’s a social insurance fund that can make this possible.”Bravo hopes that by 2020, the U.S. will make this happen. “We need to do it.”Also on HuffPost:More from HuffPost:"
3,POLITICS,White House Releases Plan To Fight Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis,Lauren Weber,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-multidrug-resistant-tuberculosis_us_56796f17e4b06fa6887ea9ed,But will it ever get the funding to get off the ground?,2015-12-22,A Chinese doctor examines an x-ray of a tuberculosis patient at the Beijing Tuberculosis Hospital March 18. TB has surpassed HIV/AIDS as the world's most deadly infectious disease.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586c0dc91900002a000e2bda.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Obama administration unveiled a long-awaited plan to combat the growing threat of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, a deadly strain of the number one infectious killer in the world.While tuberculosis advocates are thrilled with the ambitious scope and potential unifying force of the National Action Plan, many worry whether the funds will be made available to implement it.The plan is the first from the White House to address the global threat of MDR-TB, the more deadly strain of tuberculosis that develops after inappropriate TB treatment, head on. It recommends that the U.S. better track and identify the disease, boost international capabilities to fight it, and develop new drug regimens and vaccines.""TB has been one of those issues that has been neglected historically by the global health community,"" said Eric Goosby, the U.N. special envoy on tuberculosis. ""I'm very complimentary of the administration to feature MDR as the threat that it is.""Tuberculosis kills over 4,100 people a day, and the World Health Organization announced in its 2015 Global Tuberculosis Report this fall that it had overtaken HIV/AIDS as the most deadly infectious disease. Experts worry that the continued spread of MDR-TB could increase exponentially in the coming years. Over 480,000 people worldwide are estimated to have developed MDR-TB this year, and the disease has about a 50 percent cure rate, if treated. Over 75 million additional people could lose their lives to MDR-TB in the next 35 years, estimates a recent United Kingdom report. While there are only a hundred or so cases of MDR-TB currently in the United States, the airborne nature of the disease and its growing presence around the world adds up to a global health threat.""TB anywhere is TB everywhere, and we really need to look at how to reduce the risk both domestically and globally of MDR-TB ... recognizing if we don't act now, it will get worse,"" said Dr. Rebecca Martin, the acting director of the Center for Global Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""What this plan affords us is really an opportunity across the U.S. government to promote the coordination of U.S. government resources both in our domestic and global efforts.""For more on MDR-TB, read this special report from The Huffington Post.The White House's proposal to deal with the disease is ambitious, with a call to ""initiate treatment for 25 percent of patients with MDR-TB in 10 countries with the highest burdens of MDR-TB"" by the end of 2016 alone. The National Action Plan would require early check-ins with the secretary of state, the secretary of health and human services, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development and heads of other relevant departments over the plan's five-year span, which ends in 2020. The plan aims to treat 200,000 additional MDR-TB patients, on top of the 360,000 additional patients who are already accounted for in the U.S. Government Global TB Strategy 2015–2019, which is a separate plan. Treating these additional 560,000 patients in the 10 countries with the highest burden of MDR-TB would most likely include working more extensively with China, Russia and India. Achieving these goals will depend on the ability to mobilize funds from the private and public sector. The plan notes that its ultimate success will be ""subject to budgetary constraints and other approvals, including the weighing of priorities and available resources by the Administration in formulating its annual budget and by Congress in legislating appropriations.""Funding would need to be increased by at least $112 million in the next year to hit the National Action Plan's ambitious goals, according to David Bryden, a tuberculosis advocacy officer for Results, a nonprofit advocacy group.Prior to the release of the plan, the Obama administration had proposed cutting USAID's TB funding by nearly 20 percent over the last three years, though Congress stopped it. Two similar action plans on MDR-TB, released by the CDC in 1992 and 2009, laid out very similar goals for prevention and research -- but they never got the funding to get off the ground.Yet Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, believes the unifying call of the plan will help make funding for tuberculosis a higher priority at the National Institutes of Health, USAID, CDC and other U.S. agencies. ""That's what you'll probably see across agencies, the prioritization of this,"" he said. ""I think we'll be able to implement the national action plan.""Fauci said the plan could set a global example. ""It's … an effort to mobilize the political will and additional financial in-kind commitments from other donors -- bilateral, multilateral donors, private sector partners, the governments from the affected countries. So one of the positive spinoffs is to … galvanize the will and the political commitments of others to focus on latching onto this plan."" Dr. Mario Raviglione, the director of the WHO's global TB program, echoed Fauci, saying he hopes the National Action Plan motivates greater investment in combating MDR-TB around the world.""This bold move by the United States, I hope it's followed … by a similar type of attitude and bold moves by other European countries,"" Raviglione said. ""Especially in Europe, people are simply ignoring the fact that MDR-TB is at the border.""For Joanne Carter, the executive director of Results, the plan could become not only an example for other countries, but a model of ambition in dealing with this global health crisis.""We see it as a really important Christmas present. We're really, honestly, just happy [it came out] ... in advance of final revisions of the 2017 budget.""Also on HuffPost:"

In a decision that echoed the NFL team's argument that the clause is unconstitutional, the court reversed a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office decision to reject the proposed name of Asian-American dance-rock group The Slants because it could offend people of Asian descent.Nearly all of the judges active in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which handles trademark disputes and sits in Washington, heard and deliberated in the case. In Tuesday's 62-page ruling, nine of the 12 judges agreed that the disparagement clause of Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act -- the given name of federal trademark law -- constitutes ""viewpoint discrimination"" and violates the First Amendment.""It is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment that the government may not penalize private speech merely because it disapproves of the message it conveys,"" wrote Judge Kimberly Ann Moore for the court's majority.Several other judges wrote separately to express concurring and dissenting views.Calling Section 2(a) a ""hodgepodge of restrictions,"" Moore ran through a litany of names the trademark office has invalidated under the clause in recent years. The very first one listed was that of the Washington football team. Other such trademarks included ""Stop the Islamisation of America,"" ""The Christian Prostitute"" and ""Have You Heard that Satan Is a Republican?""""The legal significance of viewpoint discrimination is the same whether the government disapproves of the message or claims that some part of the populace will disapprove of the message,"" Moore wrote.That opinion is sure to enliven the broad coalition of civil rights and civil liberties groups who rallied behind Simon ""Young"" Tam, the protagonist of Tuesday's ruling and bandleader for The Slants. Tam had applied with the trademark office to register the band's name, hoping to ""take ownership"" of racial stereotypes against Asians, but his application was rejected.Tuesday's ruling reversed that determination and sent Tam's case back to the trademark office for reconsideration. In the process, the court called out the federal government for its ""inconsistent"" and ""arbitrary"" adjudications of names it finds distasteful while favoring those that espouse positive or neutral views. ""Section 2(a) is a viewpoint-discriminatory regulation of speech, created and applied in order to stifle the use of certain disfavored messages,"" Moore wrote.The ruling all but guarantees a boost to the Washington NFL team's own defense of its name -- which critics say should forbidden by federal trademark law because it disparages Native Americans.In July, a federal court upheld a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office cancellation of the name, and that decision is now being appealed by the football team.Lawyers for the team and the group of Native Americans involved in that dispute didn't respond to requests for comment from The Huffington Post.But in a court brief filed in October, the team's lawyers made essentially the same argument Tam did -- that cancellation of its trademark is unconstitutional and that federal trademark law ""facially discriminates based on content and viewpoint.""No matter how the court rules in that case, a future Supreme Court showdown appears certain.Travis Waldron contributed reporting."

9,POLITICS,Republicans Are Starting To Care Less About Whether Their Candidate Is An Outsider,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-outsider-candidates-poll_us_567835b9e4b014efe0d620ee,"GOPers still don't want an establishment candidate, but they're less vehement than they were a month ago.",2015-12-21,2016 Republican presidential candidatesstand on stage during the pledge of allegiance at the start of the Republican presidential candidate debate at The Venetian in Las Vegas on Dec. 15.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5678489a1f0000c000e9c4c1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Once upon a time -- about all of nine months ago -- Republicans thought ""experience and a proven record"" were way more important than new ideas or a different approach. Then Donald Trump entered the race, and support for political experience went out the window.Through most of the summer and fall, GOP primary voters, while divided on their choice of candidates, agreed that they wanted to elect a political outsider. Trump and fellow non-politican Ben Carson held the top two spots in national polls from August through the beginning of December. With Republicans miserably unhappy with their own party's leadership in Washington, anti-establishment sentiment seemed like a defining feature of the race.As the first primaries edge closer, however, the pendulum may be swinging back again.In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, 51 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters say they'd prefer an outsider candidate -- still a majority, but a 10-point drop since November.Thirty-eight percent of those who'd prefer an outsider say that it'll be very important to their vote, while 59 percent say it'll be somewhat or not very important.The change in preference is concurrent with a similar shift in the polls. Although Donald Trump remains the national front-runner, his closest competition now comes from Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ted Cruz. The other two most prominent ""outsider"" candidates have faded rapidly, with former neurosurgeon Ben Carson's campaign tanking sharply, and Carly Fiorina's campaign barely registering a pulse.That's despite the fact that views of Rubio and Carson's outsider cred have barely budged in the past month. Rubio is still overwhelmingly seen as an establishment figure. Cruz, a sitting senator who's managed to alienate many of his colleagues, is perceived as somewhere in the middle of the two categories.It's hard to disentangle cause from effect here: There's evidence that voters tend to work backward, basing their list of ideal qualities on the traits of the candidates they're already supporting. Weakening anti-outsider sentiment may be allowing Cruz and Rubio to gain steam, but it's at least equally plausible that instead, their rise itself has softened Republicans to the idea of choosing an elected official. Either way, it could mark a turning point as voters in early states begin making up their minds in earnest -- and it serves as a reminder that Americans' preferences for their candidates' backgrounds can fluctuate as much as their support for the candidates themselves.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 15-16 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here. More details on the polls' methodology are available here.Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov's reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample, rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error."

The two stars appeared on Sunday night's episode of ""Watch What Happens Live,"" where host Andy Cohen had them play a game of ""Clubhouse Playhouse."" During the segment, Cohen gave them each wigs and asked them to perform a scene between Kenya Moore (played by Ferrell) and Sheree Whitfield (played by Rudolph) from ""RHOA."" Things got heated pretty quickly as Ferrell's Moore told Rudolph's Whitfield that all their neighbors are fed up and complaining about the construction of her new home. ""I am building Chateau Sheree,"" Rudolph explained. ""Anybody who's built a house before, well, then they can probably come to me, but if they have not then probably keep wrenching.""When Ferrell quipped, ""Actually, it takes about six months to build a house from the ground up,"" Rudolph sent the sass right back.""Have you moved in?"" she asked. Of course, Ferrell said, ""Not yet,"" which warranted the response, ""Let me know when you finish your mold-infested house. No one should be in my business."" Fighting words!
