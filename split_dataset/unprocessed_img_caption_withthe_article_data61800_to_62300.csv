These Melanesians, like most human populations, also had Neanderthal genetic ancestry.The researchers found some of the genes inherited from these extinct species were beneficial for our species.Many are involved in the immune system and likely helped protect against pathogens, and some play important roles in skin and hair biology, said University of Washington evolutionary geneticist Joshua Akey, who helped lead the study published in the journal Science.The researchers analyzed DNA sequences from 35 people living on Northern Island Melanesia off the coast of New Guinea. These Melanesians were found to have about 2 percent Neanderthal ancestry plus an additional genetic contribution of roughly 2 to 4 percent from Denisovans.The non-African populations studied had roughly 1.5 to 4 percent Neanderthal genetic ancestry, Akey said. African populations do not have either Neanderthal or Denisovan ancestry because those two species were never on that continent.Denisovans, discovered in the past decade, are known only from a pinky finger bone and two teeth from a northern Siberian cave.The robust, large-browed Neanderthals prospered across Europe and Asia from about 350,000 years ago until disappearing shortly after 40,000 years ago. Less is known about the Denisovans.The fact that the only known Denisovan remains come from northern Siberia but that their genetic contribution is seen in people living far away in Melanesia suggests Denisovans had a broad geographic range extending across Asia, Akey said.Binghamton University molecular anthropologist D. Andrew Merriwether said the researchers also detected a contribution to people's genome from a fourth, unknown source.""So this paints a picture of probably at least four species of hominins (our species and extinct human species) alive at the same time and interbreeding at times over the last 100,000 years. Definitely not something most people supposed before 10 years ago,"" Merriwether said.(Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Sandra Maler)"
1,QUEER VOICES,TMZ Head Honcho Harvey Levin Gets Surprisingly Candid About His Sexuality,Noah Michelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harvey-levin-tmz-gay-los-angeles-lgbt-center_us_56ed44c7e4b09bf44a9d66cc,The media mogul gets personal to support a good cause.,2016-03-19,"In a new essay, TMZ executive producer Harvey Levin revealed shame caused him to keep his sexuality secret for many years.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ed4fe61e0000b300704b3c.jpeg?cache=wcdosbE3OS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TMZ big shot Harvey Levin is known for exposing the secrets of Hollywood's biggest stars, but now he's revealing a few of his own.The creator and executive producer of the popular gossip website and television gossip show of the same name opened up about his sexuality in a new essay he penned for the Los Angeles LGBT Center, ""the world's largest provider of programs and services for LGBT people.""Levin details in the piece, published on the non-profit's Vanguard Now site on Friday, the ""profound internal struggle"" he felt as a teen and how a ""homophobic campaign"" that someone close to him waged had ""scarred"" him for ""many, many years."" It caused him to try ""harder than ever to lead a 'straight' life.""His shame led to him living a life of secrecy and lies. ""If I went to a gay bar, I would wait -- sometimes for half an hour -- just to make sure cars weren’t passing by the front door for fear a driver might see me enter,"" Levin writes. ""When I met someone, I would often use an alias so I could easily cut ties. It actually makes no sense, but that’s what I did.""Levin, who earned the number 48 spot last year on Out magazine's list of the 50 most powerful queer people in America, first publicly spoke about being gay at a fundraising event in West Hollywood for the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association in 2010. ""I compartmentalized my life... Obviously friends knew I was gay but professionally I had to shut it out,"" Levin told the audience then. ""And I believe, at the time, there was good cause for thinking I’d get fired. It got to a point where I was agoraphobic. My biggest joy was just never having to leave my house.”Levin was eventually able to confront his fears. “It got to a breaking point with me where I just finally said, ‘This isn’t worth it.' And I just let it go. And nothing happened,"" he said.In retrospect, the media mogul said he wishes he had turned to the Los Angeles LGBT Center for support. ""I never used its services, because I was afraid to be seen, but I knew people who did, and I was amazed at how the center’s health and mental health counselors compassionately handled people with experiences similar to -- or much worse than -- mine.""Though the queer community has won many victories in recent years, Levin notes that ""tolerance is measured not by national polls but by individual families, many of which have little tolerance for those whose sexual orientation or gender identity differ from theirs."" For this reason, he donates to the center to ensure that its services will be available for those who might find themselves in a situation he once knew all too well.For more information about the Los Angeles LGBT Center, visit its official website."
2,TRAVEL,Cuba Travel: What the Latest Changes Mean for You,"Tamar Lowell, ContributorCEO of Access Trips, Exploring Culture Through Cuisine",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cuba-travel-what-the-late_b_9487302.html,"Cuba has inspired travelers who are eager to see, touch, hear and taste what has been unavailable for so long. Some visitors come for the music, some for the art, and still others to experience Cuban culture through its cuisine.",2016-03-19,2016-03-17-1458241621-5707105-DSC_0555PlazaVieja.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-03-17-1458241621-5707105-DSC_0555PlazaVieja-thumb.jpg,"The news out of Cuba is fast and upbeat. December's announcement that commercial flights between the US and Cuba will resume later this year - for the first time in over 50 years - means that American travelers will no longer have to rely on expensive and restrictive charter flights. This week the White House released news that travel restrictions for individuals will be eased further, making it easier for Americans to visit this long forbidden Caribbean nation. Visitors must still abide by the 12 permissible travel categories listed by the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and independent travelers are required to retain their travel receipts and records demonstrating a full-time schedule of authorized activities for five years. What's new is that travelers visiting the island nation through a people-to-people educational exchange (the category for most licensed tour groups) now have the option of traveling independently. According to OFAC: ""Travelers utilizing this general license must ensure they maintain a full-time schedule of educational exchange activities intended to enhance contact with the Cuban people, support civil society in Cuba, or promote the Cuban people's independence from Cuban authorities, and that will result in meaningful interaction between the traveler and individuals in Cuba.""Cuba has inspired travelers who are eager to see, touch, hear and taste what has been unavailable for so long. Some visitors come for the music, some for the art, and still others to experience Cuban culture through its cuisine. Whatever your reason for visiting Cuba, the changes in U.S. policy are a definite plus.How will the changes impact different kinds of travelers?Independent Adventurer Perhaps the best news for solo adventure seekers is that travel to Cuba is now doable on an adventurer's budget. Do-it-yourselfers who are willing to rough it when necessary can now travel to Cuba on their own as long as they meet the people-to-people requirements. It's important to have a strong grasp of Spanish before you take the leap though, as outside of Havana's more touristy locations and Cuba's beach resorts, most Cubans only speak their native language.With only 63,000 hotels rooms in the entire country, quality hotels and rooms in private homes are selling out months in advance. Keep a flexible attitude as the accommodations may not be as accountable as American travelers are used to. My tour company, Access Trips, uses only private accommodations for our small-group tours, and we've experienced a 10% cancellation rate by the owners of our rented villas, requiring quick action and excellent in-country contacts to ensure a trouble-free experience for our guests.Travel outside of Havana is sparse, with few cars on the roads and fewer fuel stations, so a sense of adventure is a must. Rental cars can book out during high season, so book your car early. Bring a paper map as most American mobile phones still do not work in Cuba. Verizon and Sprint, currently the only US services that roam in Cuba, will set you back around $2 per megabyte. Intercity buses are available with limited departures, so you'll want to book in advance through Viazul. Since US credit cards are still not accepted, expect this to require some effort.And finally, cash is still king. Bring as much as you think you will need, and then some, because if you run out of money, your ATM card will not yet work.Urban Explorer The city explorer is comfortable visiting an exotic city on their own, checking out local museums and attractions, sitting at cafes, and absorbing the local vibe. Not content to be on the outside looking in, these travelers seek opportunities to visit locations not easily navigable and enjoy experiences not easily found. Day tours are one way to satisfy this type of traveler, and while there is usually a fixed itinerary, there is also opportunity for unexpected surprises. We predict more of this kind of travel in the future as infrastructures are built within the Cuban hospitality system. Book your dinner reservations early, as the top paladares (private restaurants) are sometimes filling up weeks or months in advance.Enrichment Seeker With limited accommodations and Cuba more popular than ever, many visitors, including seasoned travelers, prefer to have a trusted tour company organize their-once-in-a-lifetime experience. This takes the stress out of the many logistics so they can fully engage with the Cuban people during this pivotal moment in history. Quality tour companies build vital relationships with locals that enable insider access into the Cuban culture. With knowledgeable guides who are passionate about their culture, guests enjoy non-touristy, intimate, and often serendipitous experiences. And when things don't happen quite as expected - and this is the norm in Cuba - the guides smooth the way for Plans B, C and D.The opportunity to fly commercially to Cuba later this year will lower the overall cost of your trip and shorten the amount of time it takes to get to the island. Book your tour well in advance, since tours are filling up quickly. And make sure to ask about the size of your tour group, as traveling in a group of 18-24 is a very different experience than exploring with a small group of 8-10.Beach Vacationer While we're pretty sure almost anyone can find a way to make one of the 12 travel categories fit their Cuban itinerary, the fact is that relaxing at a beach resort is still not allowed. If your hope is to travel to Cuba to languish on the white sand beaches of Varadero, daiquiri in hand, you are out of luck for now. But stay tuned!Lifting the restrictions on American travelers will welcome a new generation of visitors to Cuba, but finding ""luxuries"" like quality hotel rooms, fuel, or groceries at the store is not as simple as one might hope. Cuba has lived with limited resources for several decades and visitors must expect that if they go it alone there will be challenges. Whether you decide to venture on your own or explore with an experienced tour operator, traveling in Cuba right now is an incredible opportunity that you will never forget - one that may, in fact, change you forever.Tamar Lowell is CEO of Access Trips, a culinary tour company operating licensed people-to-people tours in Cuba.

That's when I know it's time to try it out in my own kitchen. From CPK's Thai Crunch Salad to Starbucks' Pumpkin Scones, these copycat recipes are just as good as their restaurant versions -- if not better. 1. Thai Crunch Salad with Peanut Dressing (California Pizza Kitchen)Inspired by the popular Thai Crunch Salad served at California Pizza Kitchen, this salad is made with crisp Napa cabbage, crunchy vegetables and edamame. But it's the creamy peanut dressing that makes it so good -- I guarantee you'll want to put it on everything! GET THE RECIPE2. Pumpkin Scones with Spiced Pumpkin Glaze (Starbucks) Based on the popular copycat recipe for Starbucks' pumpkin scones that's all over the Internet, these scones are packed with pumpkin flavor and heavily spiced with cinnamon, ginger, and cloves. The pumpkin glaze is the finishing touch: it adds just the right amount of sweetness and enhances the pumpkin flavor. GET THE RECIPE3. Chipotle Honey Vinaigrette (Chipotle Mexican Grill) I love Chipotle's Chipotle Honey Vinaigrette so I came up with this copycat version by fiddling around with the ingredients listed on the Chipotle website. It tastes almost identical to the original. GET THE RECIPE4. Chicken Tortilla Soup (Tommy Bahama's)A silky purée of vegetables, corn tortillas and spices with tender chunks of grilled chicken and crushed tortilla chips over top -- this recipe is a copycat of the delicious tortilla soup served at Tommy Bahama Cafe in Lido Key, FL. GET THE RECIPE5. Coconut Dream Pie (The Capital Grille) This dessert is my husband's all-time favorite, and the folks over at The Capital Grille were nice enough to share the recipe with me. With a coconut-scented cookie crust and creamy coconut custard, all covered in whipped cream and heaps of toasted coconut, it really is dream-worthy. GET THE RECIPE"

Despite how long these people have immersed themselves in the field, their passion often is hard to miss. I've been lucky enough to be an ambassador and student of the Parsons and Teen Vogue new online program where my fellow students and I will receive a Certificate in Fashion Industry Essentials. This amazing online program gives you an insider peek into what the fashion industry looks like at an accelerated speed - so you can start to define fashion instead of just following it.  I had always known my heart belonged in fashion. Little clues included a wave of emotions when I entered New York Fashion Week for the first time in 2012, or the way I fell in love with the Teen Vogue office touring it for the first time during their Fashion U weekend. When I first heard this certificate program would be starting, I rushed to my laptop to apply and had my fingers crossed I would be accepted to this once in a lifetime course.  Today, I am in the final course of the program, titled Developing Fashion Marketing and PR Skills. I have learned so much through this program and am getting truly sad I'm almost done. But it is exciting to think of how much I have learned and that I can now go off and apply my newfound knowledge and share my portfolio of work that will be reviewed by an industry expert.  One of the most important things I learned throughout this program was how important social media is for somebody trying to make their break into the fashion world. In the course, we hear from the Social Media Manager at Teen Vogue, Drew Elovitz. She shares in Module 4, entitled Working In Fashion Media, how important it is for Teen Vogue to interact with their readers on social media (where they are currently on 15 different platforms!).  My favorite part of this course was learning how to build a community around my own content, whether that was my Instagram page, or a future YouTube channel or blog! Caletha Crawford, a faculty member from Parsons School of Design talks about the challenges that come with content creation. She says what is important is to look out for what your readers, viewers or followers are really responding to by paying attention to their engagement. She says that ""those audience numbers are what make your social media attractive to advertisers and other brands.""  As someone who runs their own company, it was really important for me to learn these insider tips on how to make the most of the digital world. Everything I post is a reflection of who I am, or what my brand is. I've recently started managing the Parsons x Teen Vogue Instagram and Facebook, and that is why I found this module so beyond helpful. To someone else, an Instagram post may simply be a photo, but to me and the other students in the course, we see an opportunity to share a part of our personal brand. I have realized now that learning to use social media to tell a story is an irreplaceable tool.  There's a ton to learn, and I'm eager to dive in. Ready to get your style education on?

8,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Prediction Markets Give Democrats A 72 Percent Chance Of Keeping The White House,"Natalie Jackson, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prediction-markets-2016-race_us_56ebf46ce4b03a640a6a3039,"But with more than seven months to go and no nominees yet, a lot could change.",2016-03-18,https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/files/2016/03/tesler_econ1.png&w=1484, https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/files/2016/03/tesler_econ1.png&w=1484,"Political betting markets and polls both give Democrats a big advantage in November, but it’s still early to predict what will happen. Americans with bleaker economic outlooks are more likely to support Trump. And AP-GfK is testing online exit polls. This is HuffPollster for Friday, March 18, 2016. PREDICTION MARKETS FAVOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE IN NOVEMBER- David Rothschild: “The 10 March 15 primaries (five Democratic and five Republican) went just as expected, if you were following the prediction markets. On prediction markets around the world, people bought and sold contracts on any candidate winning...These contract prices are aggregated on my website, PredictWise.com, and turned into probabilities of any candidate winning any election….After Trump’s and Clinton’s strong showing on March 15, the markets predicted that the eventual Democratic nominee will win, at a probability of 72 percent….Here’s another point of reference. At this point in the 2012 presidential race, Barack Obama running for reelection was valued at a 60 percent likelihood to win….For March 16 of an election year, 72 percent is a very high probability of winning.” [WashPost]Not that different from what polls are showing - Polling on hypothetical general election matchups shows similar results: The Democratic candidate -- whether Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders -- polls ahead of the most likely Republican nominee, Donald Trump. Clinton leads Trump by 8 points in the HuffPost Pollster model and Sanders leads by 11 points. Both Democrats lead over Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) as well, but by smaller margins. There hasn’t been much polling of Ohio Gov. John Kasich against the Democrats, but he is the only Republican candidate to lead. However, these polling matchups should be viewed with caution.. Candidates will face more scrutiny and criticism in the general election campaign, and voters will be paying more attention in the fall. At this point, the results are not predictive of what would happen in November.ECONOMIC STRUGGLES HELP EXPLAIN TRUMP'S POPULARITY - John Sides: ""[P]olitical scientist Phillip Converse….found that people’s opinions of the parties and candidates were often based on how well things were going in the country. ….These are exactly the kind of voters who are supporting Trump... 'Our country doesn’t win anymore' and 'Make America great again' are refrains that tell voters that times are bad….It’s not surprising, then, that Trump’s support is strongest among those who are struggling….YouGov/Economist polls show that Trump’s gains among Republicans were larger among those who reported that their personal finances had gotten worse, compared to those whose finances had gotten better.

[Gallup] AP RELEASES RESULTS OF ONLINE ELECTION POLL TESTS - Paul Colford: ""With a $250,000 grant from the Knight Foundation , AP hired GfK Custom Research to conduct an experiment with online surveys during last fall’s general elections in Kentucky and Mississippi… AP wanted to know if the online methodology could provide accurate and timely estimates of candidate vote percentages in small states that are difficult to poll with traditional methods.The GfK survey had the correct winner in all seven statewide races polled in the two states, including the Kentucky governor’s race. Pre-election polls had predicted a win for Democrat Jack Conway, but he ended up losing to Republican Matt Bevin by almost 9 percentage points. The GfK online survey had Bevin winning by just under 5 points. Overall, the online poll had an average error of 3 percentage points on candidate estimates across seven statewide races….Online panel estimates of candidate vote percentages in the gubernatorial and senatorial races in each of those states proved to be much more accurate than exit poll estimates."" [AP] Building on earlier tests - More from Colford: “The surveys in Kentucky and Mississippi built on experiments GfK conducted for the AP in Georgia and Illinois during the 2014 general election. Online panel estimates of candidate vote percentages in the gubernatorial and senatorial races in each of those states proved to be much more accurate than exit poll estimates. In Georgia, for example, a combined exit poll of Election Day voters and a telephone poll of absentee/early voters had Democratic winners in three of the four races. The online panel estimates correctly predicted Republican wins in all three races.” [AP] WHY CAMPAIGNS NEED TO TRUST POLLSTERS - David Mowery: Polling, we’re told, is now in a state of perpetual crisis….Why, then, do campaigns of all sizes and candidates at every level listen to what public and private polling has to say?

Unlike man, all polls are not created equal....What I can say about getting accurate results ...is that to get good results you have to be willing to pay what might seem like astronomical amounts of money….You also have to be willing to keep your length down, your sample size up, and avoid split testing as much as possible….You have to define your objectives up front, and be willing to make hard decisions about what to test and what to leave out.

9,BLACK VOICES,'Black-ish' Star Yara Shahidi On Being A Positive Role Model For Teens,Taryn Finley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-ish-star-yara-shahidi-on-being-a-positive-role-model-for-teens_us_56ec50fbe4b084c6722034e8,"""[It's about] giving us opportunities... that allow teens to blossom.""",2016-03-18,"""Black-ish"" actress Yara Shahidi addressed 2,500 on Thursday evening at the Boys and Girls Club 2016 Keystone Conference in Dallas, Texas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ec6aac1e00009500710ab5.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's typical for actress Yara Shahidi to feel panicked before she addresses a large crowd. Not this time.To the 16-year-old's surprise, she felt excited as she looked out at the 2,500 empty seats during her mic check Thursday evening, she told The Huffington Post. She was preparing to address teens at the Boys and Girls Club 2016 Keystone Conference in Dallas, Texas about how they can own their future. ""I think why I’m here and what I want to discuss is what that means for a teenager,"" Shahidi, who plays Zoey on ABC's ""Black-ish,"" told HuffPost before she went on stage. ""Like we get the hypothetical, we get what it theoretically means but how do we actually enact it in our lives. And this is such a huge key because often times we do get such great advice but do we don’t know just how to [utilize] it.""Shahidi served as the keynote speaker for the three-day leadership conference which brought teens from all over the world together. She applauded the Boys and Girls Club and this conference for being pivotal for teens.""It’s really about impacting Generation Z as the people that are inheriting the world,"" she said, applauding the conference. ""[It's about] giving us opportunities to connect and create our own support groups as well as have positive programs that allow teens to blossom.""Teens like Whitney Stewart, 19, have benefited from attending this conference and getting involved in the support groups Shahidi mentioned. Stewart, who is now a freshman at University of Pennsylvania, told HuffPost that she was unsure of her future a few years ago. She was the oldest of three raised by a single mother living in poverty. On top of that, she was constantly bullied and suffered from depression, she told HuffPost. After finding guidance and mentorship, however, she now is the 2015-2016 National Boys and Girls Club Youth of the Year and aspires to become president of the United States one day. Like Shahidi, Stewart wants to spread a positive message to teens.""I just wanna make sure that I continue to be a leader, not only at the Boys and Girls Club but just as a college student and as a leader in my community so that the teens that are coming up can see what kind of possibilities are open to them so they know that they too can make differences in their communities,"" Stewart said.Though Shahidi's upbringing in Minnesota was different than Stewart's, the actress emphasized the importance of teens, especially teens of color, seeing themselves reflected in the media. Too often, she said, characters of color are narrowly developed in film and on TV shows.""Everybody’s story deserves to be told so it’s not saying there should only be black role models in media because that’s not life, there needs to be a spectrum. Cause, as of right now, we really only have one side,"" she said. ""[R]epresentation is more than just theoretically the numbers… it’s what are they doing and can my child watch them and aspire to be something or assume that successful is the expectation and not the anomaly?""But the teen shed some wisdom about how her journey that may be able to help teens shred the boxes and categories society tries to place them in. ""What is beautiful is enduring the space of recognizing that I’m growing and recognizing that we as teens are growing so there is no need to stay static but rather accept this growth and accept that… my opinions and decisions are going to change,"" she said. ""But as long as it comes from decent motive, that’s really all that matters."""

I'm tired of feeling that way.”Nash, who is currently recording her fourth album, posted a photo of herself accompanying the message. She is wearing a bright top and rose-tinted sunglasses, and is holding a cigarette on the edge of her rouged lip as she gawks at the camera.“I don't like the usual imagery associated with assault,” she wrote. “We don't have to look like a victim to be one. I actually happen to be a badass bitch from hell. This shit can happen to anyone.” Nash invited her nearly 56,000 Instagram followers to post their stories in the comments section of the post. As of Friday evening, there were over 90 comments including many personal accounts of sexual assault.She hosted a video live stream on YouNow Friday afternoon, during which she revealed she had been groped by a builder working in her home.“I was showing him work that needed to be fixed, so there was no needfor him to be touching me in any kind of sexual manner,"" Nash said.She discussed the incident, as well as past experiences she has had.Nash is the latest in a series of women to speak publicly about the pervasiveness of sexual assault in American society in general, and the music industry in particular.Pop star Kesha shined a light on the culture of impunity in the music world in February, when she failed in her attempt to withdraw from a contract requiring her to work with Dr. Luke, a music producer she has accused of repeatedly physically and sexually abusing her.Several women artists came forward in January alleging that successful music publicist Heathcliff Berru had groped or otherwise harassed them. People who knew about Berru’s misconduct toward other women say they were often told to keep quiet.Need help? In the U.S., visit the National Sexual Assault Online Hotline operated by RAINN.

11,POLITICS,Georgia's Anti-Gay 'Religious Liberty' Bill Could Tank Atlanta's Super Bowl Bid,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/georgia-anti-gay-bill-super-bowl_us_56ec65d8e4b084c672204e3e,NFL signals it's no fan of discriminatory laws when it picks game sites.,2016-03-18,Gov. Nathan Deal (R) hasn't said whether he'll sign a bill that allows organizations to openly refuse service to people in same-sex marriages.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_0_5052_3032%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The National Football League signaled Friday that it may pass over Atlanta as a Super Bowl site if the governor signs a law allowing open discrimination against gay people.Georgia lawmakers passed a bill this week, HB 757, that would prevent the government from taking action against any organization or person with ""a sincerely held religious belief regarding lawful marriage between ... a man and a woman."" That opens the door to all kinds of discrimination against people in same-sex marriages. It's up to Gov. Nathan Deal (R) to decide whether to sign it into law or veto it.Asked for their take on the bill, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy had this to say to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution:NFL policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard. Whether the laws and regulations of a state and local community are consistent with these policies would be one of many factors NFL owners may use to evaluate potential Super Bowl host sites.That is the last thing that Arthur Blank, the owner of the Atlanta Falcons, wants to hear. He's eager to host Super Bowls in the team's new stadium, which is set to open in 2017. The team is currently finalizing its presentation to NFL owners for a May meeting.""The bid that we put together is a very, very competitive one,” Blank said last month. “Not just because of the stadium, but because of where the stadium is located in downtown Atlanta.""The NFL has moved a Super Bowl amid controversy before. It relocated the 1993 game from Arizona to a stadium outside Los Angeles after Arizona refused to recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday.HB 757 has already hurt Georgia's reputation. A coalition of businesses -- including Twitter, Chase, UPS and Delta -- signed a pledge stating they believe that treating all Georgians fairly ""is essential to maintaining Georgia’s strong brand as the premier home for talented workers, growing businesses, entrepreneurial innovation, and a thriving travel and tourism industry."" Salesforce, a cloud-computing company valued at $44 billion, vowed to pull its investments out of Atlanta if the bill becomes law.Deal has said he won't sign any bill that promotes discrimination in order to protect people of faith. The Huffington Post reached out to his office on Thursday to see if that means he'll veto HB 757. His spokeswoman Jen Talaber didn't offer much clarity.""The governor has been clear as to his position on this issue and will assess the legislation in April during bill review,"" Talaber said in a statement."

Even concern among Republicans rose 9 points to 40 percent. That's less than half of the 84 percent among Democrats, but a stark contrast to the near-universal denial from leading GOP presidential candidates over the past year.Other leaders are more worried. Representatives of nearly 200 nations gathered last year in Paris for widely anticipated climate talks. President Barack Obama signed on to the landmark pact.""A confluence of factors -- the economic downturn, the Climategate controversy and some well-publicized pushback against global warming science -- may have dampened public concern about global warming from about 2009 to 2015,"" Gallup said in its release. (Climategate refers to now-debunked claims that researchers' hacked emails and files showed scientific data were manipulated.)""Several years of unseasonably warm weather -- including the 2011-2012, 2012-2013 and 2015-2016 winters -- has potentially contributed to this shift in attitudes,"" the pollster suggested.Earlier this week the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that February had shattered all-time monthly heat records, the 10th month in a row to do so. Other notable climate-related effects include rising sea levels, melting of the world's glaciers and thawing of the permafrost."
13,MEDIA,How Merrick Garland Made It Harder For Obama To Be So Secretive,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/merrick-garland-government-transparency-foia_us_56e99318e4b065e2e3d821f3,The Supreme Court nominee has an expansive view of who should be able to get government documents for free.,2016-03-18,President Barack Obama introduces Merrick Garland as his nominee for the Supreme Court.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ec2c70150000ad000b2809.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On his first day in office in 2009, President Barack Obama called the Freedom of Information Act “the most prominent expression of a profound national commitment to ensuring an open Government.” He also promised that his would be the ""most transparent administration in history.""It’s a promise he has repeatedly broken. An Associated Press report on Friday found that the Obama administration has again set a record for failing to fulfill FOIA requests. Earlier this month, documents — unearthed, ironically enough, by a FOIA lawsuit — revealed the Obama administration has actively lobbied against reforms to make the FOIA process stronger. And in January, Congress released a report titled simply: ""FOIA Is Broken.""But if there is to be one potential bright spot for FOIA in the eight years of the Obama administration, it may come from Merrick Garland, the president's nominee to the Supreme Court.Obama tapped Garland, the 63-year-old chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, on Wednesday to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Garland has been a judge on the highly influential D.C. Circuit since 1997. The court hears an inordinate amount of cases regarding FOIA.In an August 2015 ruling hailed as a victory for government transparency in the digital age, Garland took a broad view of who's eligible for fee waivers and fee reductions when making FOIA requests.""There is nothing in the [FOIA] statute that specifies the number of outlets a requester must have, and surely a newspaper is not disqualified if it forsakes newsprint for (or never had anything but) a website,"" Garland wrote in his opinion, joined by Judges Janice Rogers Brown and David Sentelle.""There is no indication that Congress meant to distinguish between those who reach their ultimate audiences directly and those who partner with others to do so, as some recognized journalistic enterprises do,"" the decision continues. The government charges money to fulfill FOIA requests. These fees can be ridiculously, prohibitively expensive -- sometimes costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions. By law, ""representatives of the news media"" are supposed to get fee reductions or fee waivers for FOIA requests. But before last year, some government agencies, particularly under the Obama administration, had taken to defining ""representatives of the news media"" in a highly restrictive manner, denying fee waiver and fee reduction requests to advocacy organizations, government watchdog groups and nontraditional news outlets.In one instance, the Department of Homeland Security tried (and later failed) to deny news media status to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an esteemed organization with an established history of examining government documents in a way that routinely precipitates media coverage.Garland's 2015 decision arose from another dispute -- a lawsuit brought against the Federal Trade Commission by Cause of Action, an up-and-coming conservative government accountability group. The FTC, which argued that Cause of Action did not count as a ""representative of the news media,"" had denied a FOIA request submitted by the group. Garland's decision rejected FTC's strict interpretation, instead laying out simple but expansive guidelines for who is eligible for fee waivers and reductions. The FOIA requester, he wrote, must ""(1) gather information of potential interest (2) to a segment of the public; (3) use its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work; and (4) distribute that work (5) to an audience."" And that ""audience"" doesn't even have to be large. Garland stipulated that “beyond requiring that a person or entity have readers (or listeners or viewers), the statute does not specify what size the audience must be.” According to Adam Marshall, a legal fellow at Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Garland's decision ""gets FOIA right."" ""If you have a website, that counts as disseminating news to the public,"" Marshall explained. ""You don't have to place papers on people's doorsteps -- which we think is absolutely correct and consistent with FOIA.""Open government advocates often invoke Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis’ 1913 maxim that “sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.” Saturday marks the end of Sunshine Week -- an annual celebration of FOIA, a law that will mark its 50th anniversary this summer. As ProPublica's Justin Elliot recently wrote, FOIA has been ""essential in disclosing the torture of detainees after 9/11, decades of misdeeds by the CIA, FBI informants who were allowed to break the law and hundreds of other stories.""Marshall told HuffPost that Garland's 2015 decision will hopefully ensure that journalists, advocates and whomever else can continue to shed sunlight on government actions.""The news media is performing a public good -- that's why they have to pay less fees than commercial requesters,"" Marshall said. ""Budgets in newsrooms are pretty tight these days and if news media had to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in FOIA requests, they wouldn't file FOIA requests, and they wouldn't get the info the public needs, and the the public would be deprived of that info."" Garland faces an uphill battle to actually becoming a Supreme Court justice. Senate Republicans have said they won't even consider a nominee, let alone hold a confirmation hearing, until after the presidential election in November. The next president, not Obama, should pick the next member of the Supreme Court, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said. Read Garland's full 2015 decision below. "

Waller County is where Sandra Bland died after a violent arrest at a traffic stop last July. It has one precinct with an African-American majority -- Prairie View, home of the historically black Prairie View A&M University. Students successfully advocated for an on-campus early voting site in 2014. The town of Prairie View had its own site, as well. But the county’s plan for its primary in 2016 did not include early voting sites in either location. Chad Dunn, an attorney and voting rights expert in Texas, was alerted to this significant reduction in early voting sites by a Democratic candidate in the area. He in turn notified attorneys at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit in Washington, D.C., focused on election reform. Three days before Christmas, CLC attorneys wrote a letter to the county’s election administrators arguing that its early voting plan would “have an adverse impact on black voters,” “burden their right to vote” and “hamper minority turnout,” since one of the two planned early voting locations was 25 miles away from Prairie View, and the other, closer location was inaccessible by public transit. The attorneys who wrote the letter -- Gerald Hebert, CLC's executive director, and Danielle Lang, a legal fellow -- urged Waller County commissioners to reconsider their decision not to place an early voting site in Prairie View. They cited Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits election practices that result “in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen... to vote on account of race or color.” They also pointed out that Waller County has resisted making it easy for A&M students to vote, and that the Department of Justice has intervened multiple times to prevent the county from disenfranchising students. Waller County ultimately reconsidered its primary plan and decided to give Prairie A&M an early voting site ahead of the March 1 primary. But the case nonetheless illustrates an urgent problem for voting rights activists and attorneys as the November election approaches. The right to vote has been under a sustained assault since Republicans captured a slew of state legislative chambers across the country in 2010. GOP lawmakers almost immediately moved to pass strict new voting requirements involving government-issued photo IDs. They also eliminated same-day registration and cut early voting days, among other measures. But the Supreme Court’s decision to dilute the power of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 made it significantly more difficult for the federal government to fight discrimination in voting procedures. The DOJ used to be able to block election practices or procedures that would leave minority voters worse off, like Waller County’s reduction in early voting sites in Prairie View. But in 2013's Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court struck down the provision that allowed the DOJ to halt such changes. Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which the court gutted in a controversial 5-4 decision, required jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination -- like Texas -- to get the approval of a federal court or the DOJ before making any changes to their election laws and procedures. While the federal government approved the vast majority of changes -- which exceeded 20,000 annually -- jurisdictions were still required to justify why they wanted to change their election procedures. With this process, civil rights groups gained valuable information about voter suppression measures, as the DOJ would publish the local election changes on its website.“What was lost when Section 5 was no longer operational was not just the ability to block changes, but also just the knowledge of what was coming up across the country,” said Caroline Fredrickson, president of the American Constitution Society.While high-profile challenges to these new voting restrictions, like Texas’ voter ID law, have garnered the most attention, voting rights activists say that more needs to be done to combat local election changes that wouldn’t have made it through the pre-2013 screening process.“We caught that one in Waller County, but how many more are happening every single day?"" Lang asked. “These small changes make the biggest difference in individual voters’ ability to access the polls. When they’re that local, it’s hard for national lawyers to attack it, so it’s like a death by a thousand cuts.”To combat this problem, civil rights groups are mobilizing to replace the power of Section 5. And they’re doing so with a novel new partnership. The American Constitution Society joined with the CLC in 2014 and with Georgetown Law last fall to found the Voting Rights Institute, a resource that's the first of its kind in the nation. The institute has three prongs. The ACS coordinates trainings for attorneys across the country to teach them how to litigate voting rights cases. The CLC does voting rights litigation and has populated the institute’s website with a brief bank of legal documents from past voting rights cases, to help attorneys doing the work. (Voters can also report complaints about their communities' elections through the website.) And Georgetown Law students and professors are conducting research and filing briefs of their own. “There was a recognition, even before the Shelby County decision was issued, that there weren’t enough lawyers who had been trained in voting rights litigation,"" Fredrickson said. ""It wasn’t as dire a problem before Shelby County, but it was already clearly evident that there was a narrowing of the voting rights bar."" “We started before Shelby thinking about how we could expand the pool, get more lawyers involved either directly or pro bono, and really raise the awareness of the importance of vigorously protecting the right to vote,"" she went on.In September, The Huffington Post attended one of the institute’s training sessions at Georgetown Law. Five top voting rights lawyers gave detailed presentations about past and future Supreme Court voting rights cases and others making their way there. The dozens of attorneys in the audience were not voting rights experts; they'd come to learn and get involved in a field where there’s an ever-increasing amount of work to be done. “We’ve got a ten-alarm fire and half a fire truck to fight it with, so we need as many people grabbing hoses as possible,” Dunn told HuffPost. “There’s no question that we need more lawyers, but we need more lawyers who know what they’re doing, because going in there without training or experience is disastrous and creates bad law. Where I think the Voting Rights Institute comes in is that, hopefully, folks will get training, mentors, direction and have a central repository of information.” The VRI was founded with the understanding that the nation’s major civil rights groups, like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union, don’t have the bandwidth or financial resources to handle the slew of recent election changes invited by the Shelby County decision on their own. “The Voting Rights Institute can play this role where no case is too large or too small. We want to make sure that we’re responding to every violation,” Lang said. “All voting is local, and we want to be able to be an organization that can be responsive to local problems with national expertise.” The institute is already engaged in these sorts of smaller cases. Georgetown Law students and professors, for instance, are representing an attorney who lost a redistricting case in Mississippi last year. The attorney argued that Quitman County was packing black voters into a small number of precincts. Now, Quitman is trying to force the attorney to pay the county's legal fees. An increasing number of jurisdictions are attempting to recover their fees by arguing that voting rights cases are frivolous; Hebert called this “a dangerous trend, because it will have a huge chilling effect” on individual lawyers who may fear bringing a voting rights case knowing they could be forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars if they lose. “We’re working on all of the issues you can imagine that are facing us right now, from redistricting [to] photo ID, early voting and moving polling places,” Fredrickson said. “There are so many creative ways that people can try to obstruct people’s fundamental right to vote. And we’re going to be there trying to stop them from doing it.”UPDATE: 3/23 -- The MacArthur Foundation, the philanthropic organization that awards the prestigious ""genius grants"" every year among other endowments, announced Wednesday that it will give a $1 million grant to Georgetown Law to support the establishment of the Voting Rights Institute."

They cited Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits election practices that result “in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen... to vote on account of race or color.” They also pointed out that Waller County has resisted making it easy for A&M students to vote, and that the Department of Justice has intervened multiple times to prevent the county from disenfranchising students. Waller County ultimately reconsidered its primary plan and decided to give Prairie A&M an early voting site ahead of the March 1 primary. But the case nonetheless illustrates an urgent problem for voting rights activists and attorneys as the November election approaches. The right to vote has been under a sustained assault since Republicans captured a slew of state legislative chambers across the country in 2010. GOP lawmakers almost immediately moved to pass strict new voting requirements involving government-issued photo IDs. They also eliminated same-day registration and cut early voting days, among other measures. But the Supreme Court’s decision to dilute the power of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 made it significantly more difficult for the federal government to fight discrimination in voting procedures. The DOJ used to be able to block election practices or procedures that would leave minority voters worse off, like Waller County’s reduction in early voting sites in Prairie View. But in 2013's Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court struck down the provision that allowed the DOJ to halt such changes. Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which the court gutted in a controversial 5-4 decision, required jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination -- like Texas -- to get the approval of a federal court or the DOJ before making any changes to their election laws and procedures. While the federal government approved the vast majority of changes -- which exceeded 20,000 annually -- jurisdictions were still required to justify why they wanted to change their election procedures. With this process, civil rights groups gained valuable information about voter suppression measures, as the DOJ would publish the local election changes on its website.“What was lost when Section 5 was no longer operational was not just the ability to block changes, but also just the knowledge of what was coming up across the country,” said Caroline Fredrickson, president of the American Constitution Society.While high-profile challenges to these new voting restrictions, like Texas’ voter ID law, have garnered the most attention, voting rights activists say that more needs to be done to combat local election changes that wouldn’t have made it through the pre-2013 screening process.“We caught that one in Waller County, but how many more are happening every single day?"" Lang asked. “These small changes make the biggest difference in individual voters’ ability to access the polls. When they’re that local, it’s hard for national lawyers to attack it, so it’s like a death by a thousand cuts.”To combat this problem, civil rights groups are mobilizing to replace the power of Section 5. And they’re doing so with a novel new partnership. The American Constitution Society joined with the CLC in 2014 and with Georgetown Law last fall to found the Voting Rights Institute, a resource that's the first of its kind in the nation. The institute has three prongs. The ACS coordinates trainings for attorneys across the country to teach them how to litigate voting rights cases. The CLC does voting rights litigation and has populated the institute’s website with a brief bank of legal documents from past voting rights cases, to help attorneys doing the work. (Voters can also report complaints about their communities' elections through the website.) And Georgetown Law students and professors are conducting research and filing briefs of their own. “There was a recognition, even before the Shelby County decision was issued, that there weren’t enough lawyers who had been trained in voting rights litigation,"" Fredrickson said. ""It wasn’t as dire a problem before Shelby County, but it was already clearly evident that there was a narrowing of the voting rights bar."" “We started before Shelby thinking about how we could expand the pool, get more lawyers involved either directly or pro bono, and really raise the awareness of the importance of vigorously protecting the right to vote,"" she went on.In September, The Huffington Post attended one of the institute’s training sessions at Georgetown Law. Five top voting rights lawyers gave detailed presentations about past and future Supreme Court voting rights cases and others making their way there. The dozens of attorneys in the audience were not voting rights experts; they'd come to learn and get involved in a field where there’s an ever-increasing amount of work to be done. “We’ve got a ten-alarm fire and half a fire truck to fight it with, so we need as many people grabbing hoses as possible,” Dunn told HuffPost. “There’s no question that we need more lawyers, but we need more lawyers who know what they’re doing, because going in there without training or experience is disastrous and creates bad law. Where I think the Voting Rights Institute comes in is that, hopefully, folks will get training, mentors, direction and have a central repository of information.” The VRI was founded with the understanding that the nation’s major civil rights groups, like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union, don’t have the bandwidth or financial resources to handle the slew of recent election changes invited by the Shelby County decision on their own. “The Voting Rights Institute can play this role where no case is too large or too small. We want to make sure that we’re responding to every violation,” Lang said. “All voting is local, and we want to be able to be an organization that can be responsive to local problems with national expertise.” The institute is already engaged in these sorts of smaller cases. Georgetown Law students and professors, for instance, are representing an attorney who lost a redistricting case in Mississippi last year. The attorney argued that Quitman County was packing black voters into a small number of precincts. Now, Quitman is trying to force the attorney to pay the county's legal fees. An increasing number of jurisdictions are attempting to recover their fees by arguing that voting rights cases are frivolous; Hebert called this “a dangerous trend, because it will have a huge chilling effect” on individual lawyers who may fear bringing a voting rights case knowing they could be forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars if they lose. “We’re working on all of the issues you can imagine that are facing us right now, from redistricting [to] photo ID, early voting and moving polling places,” Fredrickson said. “There are so many creative ways that people can try to obstruct people’s fundamental right to vote. And we’re going to be there trying to stop them from doing it.”UPDATE: 3/23 -- The MacArthur Foundation, the philanthropic organization that awards the prestigious ""genius grants"" every year among other endowments, announced Wednesday that it will give a $1 million grant to Georgetown Law to support the establishment of the Voting Rights Institute."

18,POLITICS,Marco Rubio Blames The Media For His Wrecked Presidential Ambitions,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rubio-blames-media_us_56ec1f33e4b03a640a6a454e,"It's a weird way to thank the people who kept calling him ""the real winner"" of stuff he lost.",2016-03-18,"Sen. Marco Rubio is very disappointed in you, media.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), having dropped out of the presidential race after a campaign that could best be described as ""existent,"" has begun the soul-searching phase of his post-campaign life. He's also ended the soul-searching phase of his post-campaign life, having definitively identified the real source of all his problems: the media.According to the Twin Cities Pioneer Press -- which reps one of the only parts of the country that seemed to manifest a genuine enthusiasm for Rubio -- the Florida senator had a sort of after-action meeting with his ""Minnesota supporters"" where he explained it was the political press that did him in.“This election was entirely driven by national media coverage, in many ways,” Rubio said, in audio of the conference call obtained by the Pioneer Press. “When the media narrative goes negative on you, and all the news is bad, it kind of knocks us off.”Oh man, yeah. When you lose that media narrative, dude, it can be devastating. Although this doesn't entirely explain how Trump repeatedly beat Rubio amid a ""media narrative"" that's pretty much accurately painted the front-runner as a violence-stoking bigot.Here's the funny thing: Last time I checked -- which was Tuesday -- the media was actually Marco Rubio's most avid booster, treating multiple second-, third- and fifth-place finishes as portents of some certain future success. Again and again, when Rubio failed to win a primary contest, the media would come up with some crazy rationale to consider him the ""real winner"" -- a tendency that was documented in full by The Huffington Post's Nick Baumann, in a tongue-in-cheek post titled ""Marco Rubio Was The Real Winner Of The New Hampshire Primary.""And when the Rubio campaign went out of its way to engineer a better narrative than the results deserved, the media would usually oblige, climbing aboard Rubio's crazy fantasy ride in much the same way you'd go along with your kid's insistence that a cardboard box was really a time machine.So it's pretty weird that Rubio is mad at the media, but it seems like his mind is made up. Just look at the way he's now assessing the quality of his post-Super Tuesday coverage, per the Pioneer Press:He said he “saw the bottom fall out of our support” after the March 1 elections, when Rubio won Minnesota but lost everywhere else.Of course, there was a pretty good reason why the media ""kind of just said"" that Rubio had a ""terrible night"" on Super Tuesday: He literally had a terrible night on Super Tuesday. In fact, if the media only kind of just said Rubio had a bad outcome that night, it was actually being quite nice to him.There's really no way to put a positive spin on what happened that night. Rubio lost nine states outright, and many of those losses were especially bad ones in which he failed to clear some pretty low voter thresholds that would have allowed him to claim some delegates and keep chunking along behind Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Prior to Super Tuesday, the media had gone out of its way to spin gold out of Rubio's distinctly straw-like numbers, but at a certain point it just becomes impossible. Of course, in some instances, it was hard to shine a positive light on the Rubio campaign before the Super Tuesday primary. At the GOP debate before the crucial New Hampshire primary, Rubio blew a gasket onstage, repeating a canned zinger (""Let’s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn’t know what he’s doing, he knows exactly what he’s doing"") over and over again until it couldn't not be noticed. It was certainly difficult to ignore the way New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie filleted Rubio on live television for this strained talking-point ostinato. So, yes, the media had a bit of a heyday with that, and it wouldn't be crazy to suggest that it cost Rubio dearly in the ensuing New Hampshire primary. But what could he have done about that, other than to have not provided the fodder in the first place? The sad truth is that Rubio did that to himself. Or, to put it in a way that Rubio might understand: Rubio did that to himself, Rubio did that to himself, Rubio did that to himself, Rubio did that to himself.Rubio is not the only GOP candidate who's decided the media is working against their interests in the primary. On the March 6 edition of ""Face the Nation,"" Cruz intimated that the media was ""sitting on bombshells"" about Trump, and delaying the deployment of said bombshells until they could only benefit the eventual Democratic nominee:""I think an awful lot of reporters -- I can't tell you how many media outlets I hear, you know, have this great exposé on Donald, on different aspects of his business dealings or his past, but they said, 'You know what? We're going to hold it to June or July,'"" Cruz said on CBS's ""Face The Nation"" Sunday.This has become one of Cruz's go-to stump speech lines, meaning that this is possibly just a bit he does to keep his supporters passionate and engaged. The reality is that there are probably a lot of media outlets -- including a ton of specifically conservative media outlets -- that would be very grateful for Cruz to share what he knows of these bombshells.Heck, it's not even confined to conservative outlets. Gawker's Sam Biddle reacted to Cruz's contention thusly: ""So, about a bombshell: Please email it to me. I’ll publish it today, Ted. That’s my promise to you, Ted Cruz: give me a bombshell (or even an old grenade, something, any kind of explosive device, any ordnance will do, PLEASE man) and I will let loose ASAP.""Indeed, there would actually probably be a robust competition for Trump bombshells, so I couldn't tell you why Cruz is waiting. (DM me on Twitter with your Trump scoops, buddy!)Nevertheless, Cruz definitely has a slam-dunk case to make against the media: It's made a habit of downplaying his electoral victories in favor of emphasizing Rubio's. The only difference is that Cruz's victories have actually been, you know, victories. Perhaps Cruz would have come to be widely known as the dynamic anti-Trump candidate if Rubio hadn't gotten weeks and weeks of credit for being that guy instead. As for Rubio, the story is that he might take a break from electoral politics, which means he'll likely begin his ascent into the lucrative, latter-day career choices that await politicians when they decide to depart their elected office. Somewhere out there, there's a corporate board or lobby shop or private equity concern that's willing to generously remunerate Rubio for having a media profile and a raft of important political connections.But a warning to Rubio's future patrons: He bites the hand that feeds.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below."
19,POLITICS,"Thanks To Flint, Republicans Love EPA Rules All Of A Sudden",Arthur Delaney and Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flint-epa-republicans_us_56ec30efe4b09bf44a9d1b7a,Or at least this one rule that's supposed to protect drinking water.,2016-03-18,House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz wants the EPA to be more aggressive about this one thing.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Republicans have made environmental regulations their punching bag for years. But now that there's a water crisis unfolding in Flint, Michigan, they've decided that what we actually need is more rules.""We need the Lead and Copper Rule to be updated,"" House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) told reporters Thursday after wrapping up his third and possibly final hearing on the Flint water crisis.Chaffetz had been asked how to prevent water crises like the one in Flint, where thousands of children have been exposed to high levels of lead in the drinking water. His response pointed to a regulation promulgated under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act -- a rule that Chaffetz said the Environmental Protection Agency had not enforced aggressively enough or updated fast enough.""Let this be a warning to every state and municipality that they need to check on lead and they need to check and pay attention to their water supply,"" Chaffetz said. ""Unfortunately, I don't think that Flint is the only situation where there's a real problem.""The Lead and Copper Rule is a regulation the EPA first issued in 1991, requiring public water utilities to monitor and address lead and copper levels in drinking water. The EPA has said it is considering revisions to the rule, but its stakeholder engagement and consultations on it have been underway since at least 2010.During a Thursday hearing, Chaffetz grilled EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on the timeline for revising the rule. She said the agency would have a proposal next year.""We are actively looking at this rule,"" she said. ""It is very challenging if you want to do a substantive revision to it.""The Flint water crisis has exposed several weaknesses of the rule, which dictates how public water systems, state regulators and the EPA monitor and control lead levels in drinking water.The city of Flint used questionable methods to monitor lead levels, taking samples from households that didn't have lead service lines -- an approach that can mask the extent of a water lead problem. The state regulator also failed to make sure Flint treated the water to reduce its corrosiveness to lead service lines, which the rule requires because when the pipes corrode, lead goes in the water. And when the EPA found out what was going on last year, it did almost nothing, deferring to local authorities given direct responsibility under the law -- even though those authorities were dropping the ball.In January, Gov. Rick Snyder (R) blamed the crisis on the Flint City Council for voting to change its water supply in 2013 (even though the city was under the control of an emergency manager Snyder had appointed). But when he testified before Chaffetz's committee on Thursday, Snyder abandoned that bogus talking point, instead brandishing a new one about how the Lead and Copper Rule needs to change because it is ""dumb and dangerous."" In calling for a stronger rule, Snyder and Chaffetz have essentially joined forces with the whistleblowers who fought the government to expose the Flint water crisis in the first place.Virginia Tech civil engineer Marc Edwards, whose independent testing of Flint's water raised alarms last summer, and Mona Hanna-Attisha, the Flint pediatrician who exposed high blood lead levels in Flint kids, are part of a brain trust of non-government experts who fear the EPA's rule revisions won't go far enough. The only way to make the water safe, they say, is to force public water systems to get rid of lead pipes. But the rule as it currently stands allows the pipes to stay indefinitely.Still, it's a little unusual to hear Republicans crying out for more rulemaking from the EPA. On the same day as the hearing, House Republicans released a budget that would dramatically cut funding for the EPA, so that the agency won't ""continue to implement an unprecedented activist regulatory policy to the detriment of states, localities, small businesses, and energy consumers.""The Republican-led Congress has chopped the EPA's budget in recent years, from a high of $10.3 billion in 2010 down to $8.1 billion for 2015. The funding cuts have forced the agency to reduce its workforce, from a high of 18,110 in 1999 to just 15,408 as of 2014 -- a 15 percent staffing cut from 15 years before.The Republicans' budget proposal last year sought to cut funding for water protection programs in particular by 24 percent. At the time, McCarthy warned the cuts “would have far-reaching consequences for the agency’s ability to ensure protections for public health and the environment.”Last year's Republican budget bill also included provisions barring the EPA from working on specific rules under the Clean Air and Clean Water acts. McCarthy called those provisions ""problematic,"" and said they would keep the agency from carrying out ""its mission as guided by science and the law.""The Republican Congress has also tried to block the EPA from developing, finalizing or issuing new rules on a variety of issues by adding riders to appropriation bills. These issues include coal ash disposal, stormwater and agricultural runoff, lead paint and toxic exposures, just to name a few. Most recently, Republicans have tried to interfere with the EPA's effort to clarify which bodies of water qualify for protection under the Clean Water Act -- an effort meant to ensure that the streams and lakes that provide America's drinking water are kept safe. The Republican-led Congress passed a measure in January blocking the agency's rule from going into effect, though President Barack Obama vetoed that legislation. Meanwhile, Donald Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, has said he would do away with the EPA as part of his effort to balance the budget. Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) noted the dissonance between Chaffetz and other committee Republicans calling out for stronger rules while also frequently bashing the EPA. “Republicans have been absolutely slamming the EPA for overreaching at every possible turn,” Clay said during Thursday's hearing. “Now they criticize the EPA for not doing more when Governor Snyder fell down on the job.""Reporters asked Chaffetz about the apparent contradiction after the hearing.""You gotta look at it on a case-by-case basis,"" he said."

The ""Statement From Conservatives Against Trump,"" published by The Resurgent's Erick Erickson, marks a new phase in conservative efforts to deny the GOP frontrunner the party's nomination.""We call for a unity ticket that unites the Republican Party,"" said the group, which met Thursday at the Army Navy Club in Washington. Attendees at the meeting included former George W. Bush adviser Bill Wichterman and Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), a vocal supporter of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Erickson, who participated by phone, later issued a statement on behalf of the group. ""We believe that the issue of Donald Trump is greater than an issue of party. It is an issue of morals and character that all Americans, not just those of us in the conservative movement, must confront,” the letter said.The self-described ""grassroots conservative activists"" said they plan to keep their options open, allowing the possibility of a contested convention and a third-party candidacy. Some of the nation's most prominent conservatives, Erickson included, have for months harbored doubts about Trump's campaign, citing his pledge not to reform Social Security or Medicare and his past support for Democrats as betrayals of core conservative values. Until recently, the GOP establishment said little, believing Trump would flame out on his own. But facing the dire prospect of Trump atop the GOP ticket in November, conservatives are finally beginning to organize their opposition in public.""We encourage all former Republican candidates not currently supporting Trump to unite against him and encourage all candidates to hold their delegates on the first ballot,"" the statement read, referring to a tactic to deny Trump the nomination at the party convention.The statement also alluded to the possibility of multiple rounds of ballots at the Republican National Convention in July. Trump recently warned of the possibility of riots at the convention if he were to be denied the nomination. ""The process should be good enough for all the candidates without threats of riots,"" the letter said. It also left open the possibility of a third party candidate, a ""real conservative,"" and referred to Trump as a ""Hillary Clinton donor,"" The prospect of the remaining GOP candidates dropping their opposition and uniting against Trump is difficult to imagine, given the current state of the GOP. Besides Trump, the two candidates remaining in the presidential race, Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, have little in common and have attacked one another in recent debates.Two other former Republican presidential contenders have endorsed Trump: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. As of Friday afternoon, Trump had a delegate lead of 262 over Cruz, with 673 delegates won to Cruz's 411. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly stated that Brian Darling attended the meeting at the Army Navy Club. In fact, he was not in attendance."
22,POLITICS,There Is A New Plan To Stop Wall Street Raiders From Preying On Main Street Companies,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/law-predatory-takeovers-main-street-companies_us_56ec2cfce4b03a640a6a4b9f,"Senate Democrats take on activist hedge funds and their ""wolf packs.""",2016-03-18,Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) has made addressing corporate short-termism one of her signature issues.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ec2ebd1e00009500710a11.jpeg?cache=ZRaU4k2vFx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A new Senate bill tries to make it just a little bit harder for activist hedge funds to exploit healthy companies rather than invest in their future. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) introduced the Brokaw Act on Thursday, which would strengthen disclosure requirements for activist hedge funds that buy parts of companies. Activist hedge funds, unlike other hedge funds, become deeply involved in the companies in which they buy a stake, steering them in a direction that most benefits the fund.The goal of the legislation is to make it harder for these private financial actors to secretly plot takeovers of companies to drive up their short-term share price, or to use an ownership stake to covertly undermine the health of the company in order to bet against it.Combating corporate “short-termism,” the trend of big investors pressing for immediate returns at the expense of long-term value, has become something of a crusade for Democrats in general, and Baldwin in particular. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, has outlined a plan to curb the short-term practices she and others have dubbed “quarterly capitalism.”Baldwin and Merkley’s bill is named after the small Wisconsin town of Brokaw, where an activist hedge fund's pressure on Wausau Paper resulted in the 2012 closure of the town mill, which bankrupted the town.“These reforms will help ensure that no other small towns in America will fall victim to activist hedge funds on Wall Street,” Baldwin said in a statement accompanying the bill. “It is time to stand up for our Main Street economy and rewrite the rules for Wall Street so we can build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.”The new bill, which also enjoys the influential backing of progressive Senate stalwarts Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a Democratic presidential candidate, would shorten the window before investors must disclose that they have purchased an ownership stake in a company of 5 percent or more. Currently, individual investors or funds purchasing a 5 percent or higher stake can wait 10 days before disclosing their acquisition; the Brokaw Act would require them to disclose the acquisition within two days.The measure aims to prevent hedge funds from using the disclosure window to tip off other investors about the purchase so they can join forces in what is known as a “wolf pack” to quietly buy an even larger part of the company. The price of a share in the company remains low until the public disclosure, allowing these allied investors to make an especially lucrative profit without competition from the broader public. It also prevents the company’s management, workers and other stakeholders -- who might be interested in keeping a plurality of ownership out of a hedge fund’s hands -- from working to counteract the acquisition.Baldwin contends that the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law already grants the Securities and Exchange Commission the authority to shorten the disclosure window, but the agency has not done so.The Brokaw Act would also treat allied funds with individual ownerships stakes under 5 percent as a single entity so they cannot avoid disclosure.And it would require an activist hedge fund to disclose the derivatives it has in connection with a company in which it invested, including a “net short,” or bet against the company. That would make it easier for other stakeholders to see if the activist hedge fund was undermining the health of the company because it stands to profit from its losses or demise.“Activists are having a chilling effect on reinvestment in the United States as they threaten companies and advocate reduced investment through share-buybacks versus investing to build long-term enterprises,” said Henry Newell, the former CEO of Wausau Paper, in a statement praising the bill.Newell was planning ways to keep Wausau Paper more competitive in 2011, when the activist hedge fund Starboard Capital, which had begun buying shares in Wausau, publicly announced it had no confidence in Wausau’s paper business. Newell has said the statement was so damaging to investor confidence that the company then had no choice but to shutter the Brokaw paper mill.The rise of activist investing in recent years has shined a light on short-termism more broadly -- and increased skepticism of its economic benefits. That is true of Democrats like Baldwin and Clinton, but also of many conservatives, business executives and academics.There were 551 companies pressured by activist investors in 2015, according to industry publication Activist Insight -- up from 136 in 2010.The explosion of activist investment has corresponded to a dramatic rise in the share of corporate spending dedicated to shareholder payouts in the form of dividends and stock buybacks.At the same time, corporate investment in fixed assets is at its lowest level in decades. Investments in infrastructure, like machinery or facilities, are a key part of improving a company's productivity. And higher productivity is more likely to generate higher returns for investors over the long term. Companies targeted by activists hedge funds have fared particularly poorly in this regard. At companies that survived four years after a hedge fund became involved in their management, research and development spending as a share of sales dropped by over 50 percent, according to a study by the Montreal-based Institute for Governance of Private and Public Organizations.Defenders of the bulk of activist interventions, like Harvard Law School’s Mark Roe, argue that its downsides are exaggerated, and that the dearth of corporate investment represents a prudent response to a “weak economy.”But for policy analysts and economists who believe short-termism is enormously harmful, the Brokaw Act’s increases in hedge fund transparency represent a modest and uncontroversial attempt to address the problem.Mike Konczal, a senior fellow at the progressive Roosevelt Institute who co-authored a paper in November proposing far more drastic measures (such as limiting stock buybacks and executive pay), called the bill a “really important first step.”“A lot of people know the problem of short-termism for publicly traded companies,” Konczal added. “This is extending that to the world of hedge funds.”"
23,POLITICS,Uncommitted GOP Delegates Are About To Become The New Political 'It Girls',Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uncommitted-gop-delegates_us_56ec294ce4b09bf44a9d16fa,"In 1976, the last time there was a contested GOP convention, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan gave these folks constant attention.",2016-03-18,"On Aug. 19, 1976, the closing night of the GOP convention in Kansas City, Missouri, President Gerald Ford thanked Ronald Reagan for his remarks. Reagan had unsuccessfully run for the Republican nomination.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ec2a561e0000b300704a3d.jpeg?cache=8t896cFUHz&ops=crop_0_0_3000_1954%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Since Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) won the primary in his home state and made Donald Trump's fight for the nomination a bit tougher, Republicans are increasingly getting ready for the prospect of a contested convention.The last time this happened to the GOP was in 1976, when neither President Gerald Ford nor former California Gov. Ronald Reagan had a majority of delegates heading into the August convention in Kansas City, Missouri. That meant that the votes of delegates -- and in particular, the precious individuals who were still undecided -- became very important. And those 150 unpledged delegates suddenly found themselves the most-sought after people in politics, facing constant media attention and personal attention from the candidates. It's the same type of treatment that the uncommitted delegates this year are already beginning to receive. Most delegates arrive at a convention required to vote for the candidate who won their state's primary, at least in the first round of balloting. But others are unbound or uncommitted. Some of those are from states where the winning candidate dropped out, and some are simply allowed to vote however they want. And this year, like in 1976, these delegates are in high demand. In his book Invisible Bridge, historian Rick Perlstein looked at some of the perks these individuals received:One obscure Republican official from Suffolk County, New York, emerged from a ten-minute audience announcing that the Leader of the Free World had agreed to take a closer look at the problems of his local sewage district. And when the queen of England arrived at the White House for a sumptuous state dinner, the gentleman the president chose to seat her next to was Clarke Reed, chairman of the largest uncommitted delegation -- Mississippi's, with thirty convention votes. ""I've gotten several calls but I can't say I've really gotten any pressure,"" uncommitted South Carolina delegate Sherry Shealy Martschink told UPI in June 1976. She added, however, that she had been invited to the White House for a dinner with the King of Spain. A political cartoon that ran on June 21 of that year captured some of the attention uncommitted delegates were getting from the president.Reagan didn't have the perks of the presidency, but he still gave uncommitted delegates plenty of TLC -- much as the candidates will need to do this year as well. On July 15, Reagan spent ""all day and much of the evening"" at the Penn-Harris Motor Inn in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, meeting in small groups with the state's 36 uncommitted delegates. But at the end of the day, he moved just two people, underscoring the time-consuming nature of the courtship: One person had committed to Reagan, and the second man moved away from Ford.""I was leaning to Ford. Now I'm straight up and down,"" delegate James Stein told the Associated Press. ""I'm unleaning.""H. Davidson Osgood Jr. of Scarborough, Maine, was another lucky delegate who received all sorts of attention. First, he received a call from the president, during which they talked ""at length,"" according to the Associated Press. He said he felt like Ford would have ""gone on for another 15 minutes if I wanted him to."" He later received a call from Reagan.Reagan also used one of his most powerful attributes -- his ability to connect with people through television -- to win over delegates. On July 6, he gave a speech on national television with the express purpose of convincing uncommitted delegates to choose him. Uncommitted delegates had entire pieces written about them in their local papers. Robin Lambert, a 25-year-old Maine resident, received his ticket to the convention when his boss -- a Ford delegate -- gave up his spot so the young man could go. Lambert, however, decided to back U.S. Secretary of Commerce Elliot Richardson, a man who wasn't even running. That set off a furious lobbying campaign by both the Ford and Reagan camps. From the Bangor Daily News on June 18: Reagan also struggled to pick up delegates after he promised to name Sen. Richard Schweiker (R-Pa.), who was known as a moderate, as his vice president. It was an unusual move by Reagan, since he wasn't even yet the nominee. And the decision likely cost him some uncommitted delegates.Reagan took Schweiker to Jackson, Mississippi, on Aug. 4, to meet with the state's uncommitted delegation and convince them he wasn't too liberal. It didn't go that well; Reagan delegate coordinator Swan Yerger told the Associated Press that they may have ""lost one or two"" delegates after the two-hour meeting. Keeping track of how many delegates each side had was no easy task for journalists either. Perlstein writes in Invisible Bridge that at one point, there were ""more delegates being counted by both sides than would be present at the convention; the psychological gamesmanship had become absurd."" Ford ultimately won the nomination after the first round of balloting at the convention. Reagan also ended up doing just fine for himself, despite the loss that year. "

President George W. Bush's decision to target Afghanistan after 9/11 meant the end of a Taliban government that had drastically shrunk opportunities for women to secure education, health care or careers and mandated stoning women to death for alleged immorality.The issue merits attention. Afghan women could lose much of what they've regained depending how peace talks between the current government and the Taliban proceed. They are still struggling to end demeaning practices like state-backed ""virginity tests,"" while dealing with a rise in assaults.But the way Laura Bush is speaking out for Afghan women is likely to backfire, hurting the cause among Americans who might otherwise sympathize and even endangering its proponents on the ground.At an event at the U.S. Institute of Peace on Tuesday, in a Washington Post op-ed last week and in conversations with the ""Today"" show, Glamour, People, Politico and USA Today, Bush has pointed to America's military presence in Afghanistan as the key to women's progress in that country.""I think we need to keep the troops there,"" she said at the Tuesday event in Washington. ""We need to make sure that Afghanistan has the security to be able to build stability. ... Obviously, the most important thing is the security and our troops can help on that.""This isn't new rhetoric for Bush. In late 2001, she famously became the first first lady ever to take over the president's weekly radio address two months after the U.S. began working to overthrow the Taliban regime. Bush argued that the U.S. invasion would have clear benefits for oppressed women in Afghanistan, whose hardships she said she and most Americans only became aware of through media coverage after 9/11.""Civilized people throughout the world are speaking out in horror -- not only because our hearts break for the women and children in Afghanistan, but also because in Afghanistan, we see the world the terrorists would like to impose on the rest of us,"" Bush said at the time. (In contrast to what her party's presidential front-runner, Donald Trump, now asserts about the inevitability of Muslim misogyny, Bush also noted that the global Muslim community condemned Taliban practices.)The first lady made similar arguments throughout her husband's time in office, prompting Mother Jones to write in 2007 that Laura Bush had taken the lead in pushing ""a tidy moral justification for [the U.S.] invasion of Afghanistan.""Women's empowerment has since become a favorite talking point for politicians on both sides of the aisle who support a U.S. role in Afghanistan. Just weeks before the NATO combat mission there ended in 2014, Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) told an international symposium that the issue was ""consistent with both American values and national security interests.""But do critical efforts to help women secure the status of full citizens really need to be tied to U.S. militarism?Talk of sending troops overseas and the positive benefits of invasions isn't popular these days. Despite escalating global crises, Americans today are less eager to be involved abroad. The Bush administration's foreign policy, long doubted on the left, is being blasted by the man most likely to be the GOP's presidential nominee. Trump has Americans ready to embrace criticism of even longtime allies like Japan for the U.S. support they've received.Recent high-profile military missteps in Afghanistan, like the October bombing of a hospital run by the charity Doctors Without Borders and the U.S. military's decision to ignore sexual abuse by its Afghan partners, make the prospect of keeping troops in that country even less popular.So if supporting equality for Afghan women means maintaining a U.S. military presence there, many Americans might say they'd pass.Meanwhile, Afghan women themselves and their local advocates actually lose out by being linked to the presence of American troops.Sadaf Lakhani, a development expert at the consultancy firm TrustWorks Global, has written about the harm that misguided rhetoric from American politicians can do. Discussing Casey's 2014 remarks, Lakhani argued that his pledge was positive but framed the wrong way:For example, in his speech in Oslo, Senator Casey noted that protecting Afghan women's rights is ""Consistent with both American values and national security interests."" This kind of language not only risks negating Afghan agency and ownership, but also plays into the hands of those who want to portray gender equality as an aim that is alien to indigenous Afghan struggles and aspirations.Those in Afghanistan who oppose gender equality, including Taliban supporters, know just how to present empowering women as code for entrenching American control, Lakhani suggests.In any case, what Laura Bush is advocating troop-wise has happened. President Barack Obama announced last fall that 5,500 U.S. troops will remain in Afghanistan even after he leaves office next year. (So died his campaign promise to end the American military role there.)That's widely seen as a good call by Republican lawmakers, Democratic lawmakers, war skeptic Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the U.S.-friendly Afghan government and many experts on the country's direction. Observers note that the Taliban is more confident than ever of retaking the country and that the Islamic State group has also established a significant presence there, which the U.S. has begun to target.But that doesn't mean that many ordinary Americans -- not the foreign policy hands who applauded Obama's move and gathered to see Bush in Washington -- have become any more sympathetic to Afghan women. To make that happen, the former first lady and other advocates should take a different tack: one that actually works with, rather than just talks about, those women.Bush understands this at some level. It's why the new book from the George W. Bush Institute features the stories of Afghan women and why she shared the stage at her event this week with noted activist Mina Sherzoy.Sherzoy is one of many Afghans who are grateful for U.S. support and eager to keep it flowing, despite all the evidence of waste and misuse. ""I thank you from my heart,"" she said at the end of Tuesday's event.Hearing from these women themselves, rather than mainly seeing Laura Bush talking on TV about her husband's war, might encourage Americans to accept a moral imperative to support gender equality in Afghanistan. It might also help Afghans understand that the issue has deep local importance.""Look for openings that local groups want to exploit. Find out where they are willing -- and not willing -- to push for change, despite resistance, and how they are willing to do it,"" Lakhani recommended to outsiders hoping to help in 2014. ""These are the struggles we should support, rather than create our own.""Some of Casey's own Senate efforts for Afghan women, which focused on female officials in the police and other state organizations, share that focus. So does an ongoing Smithsonian exhibit, which Bush swung by on Tuesday. It highlights the work of the nonprofit Turquoise Mountain, which is training Afghan artisans in ancient skills, and invites museum visitors to interact with the artists themselves.""Things have changed [in Afghanistan] ... and I wanted people to know that,"" Bush said Tuesday when asked by Stephen Hadley, chairman of the board of the U.S. Institute of Peace and her husband's former national security adviser, why she was working to bring attention to Afghan women now. ""I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to tell their stories.""The key is for her to share those stories in a way that really helps."

But human conflict has also protected natural areas, according to conservation biologist Dr. Thor Hanson.""It's an unexpected finding in some ways,"" the author of The Triumph of Seeds, told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. ""But it makes logical sense."" This is because biodiversity can rebound in areas where fighting has reduced human activity, he explained. The most striking example of a war's conserving power might be the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea.The area commonly known as the DMZ was set up in 1953 after the Korean War to mark the boundary between the two East Asian countries. Although it represents a bloody gash in the region's history, the zone is now remarkably biodiverse, Hanson said.""You have several kilometer-wide strip going from coast to coast that is depopulated,"" he said. ""There's a de facto park between those counties; all sorts of species are thriving there that have disappeared outside that area.""Similar conflict-cum-conservation zones exist around the world.The island of Vieques, Puerto Rico, was a bombing range for the U.S. Navy until 2003. Much of the island was turned into a national wildlife refuge after the navy left. Although bombs decimated marine life around the island, Vieques is now one of the most ecologically diverse areas in the Caribbean, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Several thousand miles south, in the Falkland Islands, penguins thrive among the land mines that litter the countryside. Soldiers laid down nearly 20,000 mines there during the 1982 Falklands War. The minefields have kept people out, but members of the island's growing penguin population are too light to spring them. ""So you have penguin rookeries on top of the minefields,"" Hanson said.While fishing threatened the Falklands' penguin population in the 1980s, the de facto wildlife refuge the minefields provided has allowed the flightless birds to thrive.The pressures of war can conserve land in other surprising ways. For instance, the Department of Defense has set aside 260,000 acres of land near military bases across the country so soldiers can train on undeveloped land.Conservation biologists have also proposed turning the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay into a protected area for scientific research.Joe Roman, a fellow at the University of Vermont's Gund Institute for Ecological Economics, said researchers hope that the base will close. Much of the site's 45 square miles of land remains undeveloped, Roman said. ""That's not to say that it’s pristine,"" he told HuffPost. ""But it's not developed in the way that, let’s say, a city is.""Most scientists agree that, overall, war tends to be devastating for the environment -- and it's not only bombs and gunfire that destroy natural spaces. Excessive energy use, resource consumption and waste production during wartime combine to make human conflict uniquely destructive to the planet. But while war more often destroys environments than preserves them, paying attention to cases in which conflict leads to conservation can teach scientists how to protect environments during and after war, according to Hanson.""Of course war is bad,"" Hanson said. ""But if you’re interested in conversing biodiversity then you must have a plan for working in conflict zones.""For Roman, the tragedy of war can create opportunities for conservation.""No one ever wants a war,"" Roman said. But in some cases, ""we can take advantage of them in order to advance the cause of peace and conservation."""

The radar scans reveal ""metal"" and ""organic materials,"" according to Egyptian officials speaking at a news conference in Cairo on Thursday. It's far too early to say if ""metals"" means a long-lost treasure and if ""organic materials"" indicates a mummy or mummies, but Egyptian officials, hoping for a much-needed tourism boost, are excited by the possibility. ""It could be the discovery of the century,” Mamdouh Eldamaty, the Egyptian antiquities minister, said in a news story from National Geographic, which also released images from the tomb: The new revelations offer more support for the theory that launched the experiments in the first place. Last summer, Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves of the University of Arizona made international headlines when he said he found evidence that the walls of the tomb had been patched over in two places, as if entrances to other chambers had been covered up. He made the discovery not in the 3,300-year-old tomb itself, which is located in the Valley of the Kings, but by examining high-resolution scans of the wall made by Factum Arte.Later, an on-site inspection of the tomb with Egyptian officials also revealed signs of the ancient cover-up, and in November a radar specialist scanned the walls and found what he called ""an entrance to something"" hidden within.""It’s very obvious that this is something,"" Hirokatsu Watanabe told NatGeo at the time. ""It’s very deep.""Reeves believes the hidden chamber is the long-lost final resting place of Queen Nefertiti -- and that if she's in there, the chamber and its treasures have likely been untouched by grave robbers. Not everyone is sold on this idea, however. ""There is not a 1 percent chance Reeves' theory is correct,"" Zahi Hawass, the country's former antiquities minister, told the Telegraph in December. “Mr Reeves sold the air to us,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I confirm that there is nothing at all behind the wall.""In addition, Live Science reports that the Valley of the Kings is notorious for tripping up radar readings with false positives that look like walls and tombs. ""There are fissures, seams of chert and gypsum, and voids in the bedrock known as karsts,"" radar specialist Glen Dash said, according to the website. ""They are so common that there was really no place in the Valley that we did not encounter them.""But experts who've reviewed the scans say the data is solid.Remy Hiramoto, a specialist in semiconductors and microelectronics, told National Geographic that there's ""a non-natural occurring chamber or cavity on the other side of that wall.""""Based on the signatures that are in the data, there’s a void, and there’s definitely something that’s within the void,"" he said. ""There’s something in there.""A National Geographic team will perform a second set of scans in the tomb later this month. Eldamaty, the antiquities minister, will then have to decide what to do next. The problem with reaching whatever is on the other side of the wall is that the wall itself is a priceless work of art. Last year, Eldamaty told National Geographic that they may be able to drill a small hole in a nearby wall and send a camera through -- but if it reveals artifacts, getting access to them won't be easy and may even involve removing the entire painted wall in Tut's tomb. The next news conference is scheduled for April 1. "

He made the discovery not in the 3,300-year-old tomb itself, which is located in the Valley of the Kings, but by examining high-resolution scans of the wall made by Factum Arte.Later, an on-site inspection of the tomb with Egyptian officials also revealed signs of the ancient cover-up, and in November a radar specialist scanned the walls and found what he called ""an entrance to something"" hidden within.""It’s very obvious that this is something,"" Hirokatsu Watanabe told NatGeo at the time. ""It’s very deep.""Reeves believes the hidden chamber is the long-lost final resting place of Queen Nefertiti -- and that if she's in there, the chamber and its treasures have likely been untouched by grave robbers. Not everyone is sold on this idea, however. ""There is not a 1 percent chance Reeves' theory is correct,"" Zahi Hawass, the country's former antiquities minister, told the Telegraph in December. “Mr Reeves sold the air to us,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I confirm that there is nothing at all behind the wall.""In addition, Live Science reports that the Valley of the Kings is notorious for tripping up radar readings with false positives that look like walls and tombs. ""There are fissures, seams of chert and gypsum, and voids in the bedrock known as karsts,"" radar specialist Glen Dash said, according to the website. ""They are so common that there was really no place in the Valley that we did not encounter them.""But experts who've reviewed the scans say the data is solid.Remy Hiramoto, a specialist in semiconductors and microelectronics, told National Geographic that there's ""a non-natural occurring chamber or cavity on the other side of that wall.""""Based on the signatures that are in the data, there’s a void, and there’s definitely something that’s within the void,"" he said. ""There’s something in there.""A National Geographic team will perform a second set of scans in the tomb later this month. Eldamaty, the antiquities minister, will then have to decide what to do next. The problem with reaching whatever is on the other side of the wall is that the wall itself is a priceless work of art. Last year, Eldamaty told National Geographic that they may be able to drill a small hole in a nearby wall and send a camera through -- but if it reveals artifacts, getting access to them won't be easy and may even involve removing the entire painted wall in Tut's tomb. The next news conference is scheduled for April 1. "

31,THE WORLDPOST,Madrid's 72-Year-Old Feminist Mayor Shares Her Wisdom On Life And Politics,"Montserrat Dominguez, HuffPost Spain",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/manuela-carmena-madrid-mayor_us_56ec40c5e4b09bf44a9d2e40,Manuela Carmena has become the unlikely face of Spain’s youth-driven social and political change.,2016-03-18,Mayor of Madrid Manuela Carmena came out of retirement and captured the imagination of Spanish politics.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ec441a150000ad000b2859.jpeg?cache=T66uZzgsru&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MADRID -- Manuela Carmena is, perhaps, Spain's most recognizable face of political change. A year ago, the 72-year-old retired lawyer and emeritus judge of the Spanish Supreme Court lived a happy and active life. She dedicated her days to her grandchildren and shopping in the Malasaña, a Madrid district where female prisoners from various Spanish prisons sell clothes and shoes that they themselves sew. These employment workshops were promoted by during her long and successful career.Until just a year ago, when angry youngsters of Spain's emerging grassroots socialist party Podemos knocked on her door, Carmena says that she was living in a sort of paradise. Then these same Podemos members suggested that she ought to be head of their party's mission to wrest Madrid's City Council from the conservatives of the People's Party, who had led the city for more than 20 years.It wasn't an easy decision, but in the end she joined them as an independent, representing Ahora Madrid in the city's municipal elections. Soon after accepting Podemos’ call, she became a political phenomenon. Days ahead of celebrating her nine-month anniversary as Madrid's mayor, she welcomed HuffPost Spain to her office in the Plaza de Cibeles. The streets were full of posters with the slogan ""Madrid needs feminism,"" which had been distributed by the city's government to celebrate International Women's Day on March 8. Why does Madrid need feminism?Because the world needs the leadership of female culture. It's nice to think that women's supposed inferiority only comes from differences in physical strength. The leadership of women is the leadership of conviction, conciliation, compromise, peace. That's the change, and it's clear that the world can't keep on destroying itself with puerile attitudes that are expressions of physical force. Human beings are both reason and heart, and women are experts dealing with both.Here in Madrid, the ecosystem is different from that of Spain's national politics. Women are leading the Mayor's Office and political opposition. Is there a particular reason for this?I don't know. Perhaps women are more comfortable in municipal politics. It was hard for me to say yes, and I never would have done it if it meant entering national politics. I said yes because it was about leading a candidacy that was organized by citizens from neighborhoods, by protest movements, by people with their feet on the ground, and there was a price to pay, but I thought I could do well. For me state policy would have seemed more distant, somehow. [M]unicipal [politics] is closer to the human being, to the everyday, to life.Is there an excess of testosterone in national politics? We are experiencing some very tough sessions in the new parliament as the new and the old parties clash, sessions that move us further away from the possibility of reaching a government agreement to prevent new general elections next June.Of course. It's testosterone, and something very childish as well! Sometimes they seem like big kids playing to see who catches the ball, when the important thing is that they just got elected and society wants them to reach an agreement. The beautiful thing is to see how the agreement is reached, not how they insult each other. ... They really act like kids! I think that their language is extremely damaging to the essence of politics. Politics means solving everyone's problems, which is why I love to work managing a city that belongs to no one in particular: the air belongs to everyone, gardens belong to everyone, transportation belongs to everyone. ... It doesn't make sense for those of us that have a political responsibility to insult, disqualify or disparage each other because then we lose the synergies that we ought to have.I'm surprised because I come from the judiciary. There, discussions are continuous: you're in a collegiate court, where you argue about how to judge the conduct of another person, and you put out there a lot of yourself when you judge someone else with your own parameters. Many debates in court are very intense, but they never have that level of disqualification that you find in politics. You can't build anything when we you are all insulting each other. I'm surprised that active politicians don't reflect on this. Why do you insult each other? Why do you disqualify each other? Why do you despise other? ... Why is it that what you think is better than what others think? It's true that every ideology, every political group has its strategic objectives, some essential points that they want to achieve. But then there's a ""How?""... a ""When?"" an enormous ability to speak and reason. ... Maybe the other person can come up with something interesting!This way of thinking is shared by many citizens. But you are the leader of an interesting experiment: Ahora Madrid is now headed by an independent like you. Your words are interpreted as an open criticism to the party's leader, Pablo Iglesias.Well, if it is understood that way ... criticism is necessary. It is the most loyal thing to do with the people that you're closer to, especially those you care about. I recently had dinner with Pablo Iglesias and told him what I think. Of course, there cannot, there should not be elections. Voters dealt you a hand, and they've told you, ""Use those cards."" And that's what needs to be done.Other respected figures, independents like yourself, are moving away from Podemos. Are you concerned about the disenchantment?I don't think so. That's the good part about being outside, you have a greater capacity to swerve through the different roads. I think it's better not to be too inside. I don't think political parties are the most suitable structures for political management. It may seem arrogant of me to expose this theory, but I think we are experiencing a structural crisis of the parties. We have to find another way to articulate political representation, a less ideological one, a more transversal one.And, what would substitute political parties?Imagine groups of citizens that came together to achieve, for example, housing as an enforceable right. We know it is a right because it is in the Constitution and the Declaration of Human Rights, but it's a right that is, let's say, ""unimportant"" because you cannot claim it. If you have the right to a certain benefit, you go to an office, fill out a form and you get it. There's no place where you can go and demand housing! And I think you have to demand it. The developed world has too much money and personnel for it to be impossible to give a home to every family that needs it.Imagine if the way to achieve this goal was a platform that entered the electoral debate. Then, imagine if that were true for what everyone thinks about abortion or other issues ... who knows?! Parties tend to form around a conceptual whole. They have to provide answers for everything. Why? There could be a group for a single objective. And it could be a left-wing objective, understood in the way I define the Left: people who believe that an essential objective of world development is equal opportunity for everyone. There would be others who would oppose that, of course, but that would allow us to articulate ourselves more effectively and freely.Is that why you're not part of any party?Of course. I can't do it.What has been the best and worst about these nine months as mayor?The best is Madrid. I am from Madrid, and I've lived almost all my life here, except when I was away on judicial trips. I rediscovered an amazing city, full of life. The number of associations, activities, artistic impulses, places, buildings. ... When the politician moves in the everyday space, he or she has the ability to feel how the citizens feel. The fact of being on the street, in the subway, standing in line -- it allows you to be a part of the city.But with the mayor's agenda, the bodyguards... Can you still live as a citizen?Yes, of course. This morning I took my subway, just like I do every day... People are very discreet. Sometimes they flash a smile, which is something that I appreciate a lot. Sometimes they just look at you. And sometimes you notice an unpleasant face, but they are usually very educated people and they don't say anything. And I also think it's reasonable that there are angry people who vent by saying critical things: It's OK, there's nothing wrong with that.And the worst moment, the most frustrating thing... was it the failure of the initiative to withdraw from Madrid's street names the names of soldiers who staged Franco's revolt in 1936? The mistake was wanting to do things without thinking them through enough. We were in a hurry, and that led us to make mistakes. Those are the worst moments: when there are difficulties with the team, because, for me, the human factor is crucial.You've already been forced to defend your team in public. The Ahora Madrid movement, in which Podemos participates, barely existed a year ago, and it is made up of very young people with no political or institutional experience. But a city can't wait for those who run it to grow up.Well, what they have is a huge amount of experience addressing social problems. And that is an enormous advantage, because that is what the City Council is supposed to do. Perhaps they still need to solve problems within the institutions. But I think each passing day we learn more and do better. Perhaps our particularity, unlike other teams, is that when we've done something wrong we have admitted it.The opposition is being tough with you and your team, and they've done so with an important level of aggressiveness. How are you managing it?Well, the truth is that I don't worry too much about that. I've got used to it, and since they are not real stabs ... I also have some therapy: I don't read newspapers that much. And above all, I have two positive inputs: seeing that you can do many things that improve Madrid, and that advantage that is proving so important to me, without having foreseen it, that arises from sharing the public space with the people. That is spectacular.Further contact, instead of a shell to hide in?Yes, and even if you receive some criticism, which is not much, it is life-giving because it is personal, direct contact.You are 72 years old. You were living a full life, you were involved in many social issues, and you were enjoying life and your grandchildren. Do you feel you have lost more than you've won?Well, I was in paradise because you have to work on active retirement. It was fantastic. Now I'm not in paradise, but I am confirming everyday how exciting and challenging it is to work to improve a city.There are many who don't believe you'll last until 2018...I hope I do. It is all about a Mediterranean diet and knowing that the things that really matter in life are not political criticism.How do you unplug yourself?Fundamentally, reading. It is something very special: you enter a shell and suddenly you're in another world. And you leave the shell feeling great. You get so much from reading ... For me that's the key.At The Huffington Post we are sleep evangelists. We think that many of the things that go wrong in the world would work better if leaders slept the necessary hours. Do you sleep well?I sleep very well, but I'm sleeping little. Sometimes I would like to sleep one or two more hours, especially in the morning. My day seems to be too short, and though I can't sleep more, I think I should. But what little I sleep, I sleep straight through.Can a city really change the style of politics as we understand it in this country?I think it can. There are some guidelines that are important and that have a lot of significance. Since I think that cleanliness is so important for Madrid, I usually greet the sweepers I meet. It is interesting to see how they react to it. The other day I received a Whatsapp [message] that read, ""Once again I have hope that politics can be different."" And it was nothing more than that. As I do so many times, I saw a sweeper, I took off my glove, she took off hers, we shook hands and talked about society, garbage, our jobs...This interview first appeared on HuffPost Spain.

Human beings are both reason and heart, and women are experts dealing with both.Here in Madrid, the ecosystem is different from that of Spain's national politics. Women are leading the Mayor's Office and political opposition. Is there a particular reason for this?I don't know. Perhaps women are more comfortable in municipal politics. It was hard for me to say yes, and I never would have done it if it meant entering national politics. I said yes because it was about leading a candidacy that was organized by citizens from neighborhoods, by protest movements, by people with their feet on the ground, and there was a price to pay, but I thought I could do well. For me state policy would have seemed more distant, somehow. [M]unicipal [politics] is closer to the human being, to the everyday, to life.Is there an excess of testosterone in national politics? We are experiencing some very tough sessions in the new parliament as the new and the old parties clash, sessions that move us further away from the possibility of reaching a government agreement to prevent new general elections next June.Of course. It's testosterone, and something very childish as well! Sometimes they seem like big kids playing to see who catches the ball, when the important thing is that they just got elected and society wants them to reach an agreement. The beautiful thing is to see how the agreement is reached, not how they insult each other. ... They really act like kids! I think that their language is extremely damaging to the essence of politics. Politics means solving everyone's problems, which is why I love to work managing a city that belongs to no one in particular: the air belongs to everyone, gardens belong to everyone, transportation belongs to everyone. ... It doesn't make sense for those of us that have a political responsibility to insult, disqualify or disparage each other because then we lose the synergies that we ought to have.I'm surprised because I come from the judiciary. There, discussions are continuous: you're in a collegiate court, where you argue about how to judge the conduct of another person, and you put out there a lot of yourself when you judge someone else with your own parameters. Many debates in court are very intense, but they never have that level of disqualification that you find in politics. You can't build anything when we you are all insulting each other. I'm surprised that active politicians don't reflect on this. Why do you insult each other? Why do you disqualify each other? Why do you despise other? ... Why is it that what you think is better than what others think? It's true that every ideology, every political group has its strategic objectives, some essential points that they want to achieve. But then there's a ""How?""... a ""When?"" an enormous ability to speak and reason. ... Maybe the other person can come up with something interesting!This way of thinking is shared by many citizens. But you are the leader of an interesting experiment: Ahora Madrid is now headed by an independent like you. Your words are interpreted as an open criticism to the party's leader, Pablo Iglesias.Well, if it is understood that way ... criticism is necessary. It is the most loyal thing to do with the people that you're closer to, especially those you care about. I recently had dinner with Pablo Iglesias and told him what I think. Of course, there cannot, there should not be elections. Voters dealt you a hand, and they've told you, ""Use those cards."" And that's what needs to be done.Other respected figures, independents like yourself, are moving away from Podemos. Are you concerned about the disenchantment?I don't think so. That's the good part about being outside, you have a greater capacity to swerve through the different roads. I think it's better not to be too inside. I don't think political parties are the most suitable structures for political management. It may seem arrogant of me to expose this theory, but I think we are experiencing a structural crisis of the parties. We have to find another way to articulate political representation, a less ideological one, a more transversal one.And, what would substitute political parties?Imagine groups of citizens that came together to achieve, for example, housing as an enforceable right. We know it is a right because it is in the Constitution and the Declaration of Human Rights, but it's a right that is, let's say, ""unimportant"" because you cannot claim it. If you have the right to a certain benefit, you go to an office, fill out a form and you get it. There's no place where you can go and demand housing! And I think you have to demand it. The developed world has too much money and personnel for it to be impossible to give a home to every family that needs it.Imagine if the way to achieve this goal was a platform that entered the electoral debate. Then, imagine if that were true for what everyone thinks about abortion or other issues ... who knows?! Parties tend to form around a conceptual whole. They have to provide answers for everything. Why? There could be a group for a single objective. And it could be a left-wing objective, understood in the way I define the Left: people who believe that an essential objective of world development is equal opportunity for everyone. There would be others who would oppose that, of course, but that would allow us to articulate ourselves more effectively and freely.Is that why you're not part of any party?Of course. I can't do it.What has been the best and worst about these nine months as mayor?The best is Madrid. I am from Madrid, and I've lived almost all my life here, except when I was away on judicial trips. I rediscovered an amazing city, full of life. The number of associations, activities, artistic impulses, places, buildings. ... When the politician moves in the everyday space, he or she has the ability to feel how the citizens feel. The fact of being on the street, in the subway, standing in line -- it allows you to be a part of the city.But with the mayor's agenda, the bodyguards... Can you still live as a citizen?Yes, of course. This morning I took my subway, just like I do every day... People are very discreet. Sometimes they flash a smile, which is something that I appreciate a lot. Sometimes they just look at you. And sometimes you notice an unpleasant face, but they are usually very educated people and they don't say anything. And I also think it's reasonable that there are angry people who vent by saying critical things: It's OK, there's nothing wrong with that.And the worst moment, the most frustrating thing... was it the failure of the initiative to withdraw from Madrid's street names the names of soldiers who staged Franco's revolt in 1936? The mistake was wanting to do things without thinking them through enough. We were in a hurry, and that led us to make mistakes. Those are the worst moments: when there are difficulties with the team, because, for me, the human factor is crucial.You've already been forced to defend your team in public. The Ahora Madrid movement, in which Podemos participates, barely existed a year ago, and it is made up of very young people with no political or institutional experience. But a city can't wait for those who run it to grow up.Well, what they have is a huge amount of experience addressing social problems. And that is an enormous advantage, because that is what the City Council is supposed to do. Perhaps they still need to solve problems within the institutions. But I think each passing day we learn more and do better. Perhaps our particularity, unlike other teams, is that when we've done something wrong we have admitted it.The opposition is being tough with you and your team, and they've done so with an important level of aggressiveness. How are you managing it?Well, the truth is that I don't worry too much about that. I've got used to it, and since they are not real stabs ... I also have some therapy: I don't read newspapers that much. And above all, I have two positive inputs: seeing that you can do many things that improve Madrid, and that advantage that is proving so important to me, without having foreseen it, that arises from sharing the public space with the people. That is spectacular.Further contact, instead of a shell to hide in?Yes, and even if you receive some criticism, which is not much, it is life-giving because it is personal, direct contact.You are 72 years old. You were living a full life, you were involved in many social issues, and you were enjoying life and your grandchildren. Do you feel you have lost more than you've won?Well, I was in paradise because you have to work on active retirement. It was fantastic. Now I'm not in paradise, but I am confirming everyday how exciting and challenging it is to work to improve a city.There are many who don't believe you'll last until 2018...I hope I do. It is all about a Mediterranean diet and knowing that the things that really matter in life are not political criticism.How do you unplug yourself?Fundamentally, reading. It is something very special: you enter a shell and suddenly you're in another world. And you leave the shell feeling great. You get so much from reading ... For me that's the key.At The Huffington Post we are sleep evangelists. We think that many of the things that go wrong in the world would work better if leaders slept the necessary hours. Do you sleep well?I sleep very well, but I'm sleeping little. Sometimes I would like to sleep one or two more hours, especially in the morning. My day seems to be too short, and though I can't sleep more, I think I should. But what little I sleep, I sleep straight through.Can a city really change the style of politics as we understand it in this country?I think it can. There are some guidelines that are important and that have a lot of significance. Since I think that cleanliness is so important for Madrid, I usually greet the sweepers I meet. It is interesting to see how they react to it. The other day I received a Whatsapp [message] that read, ""Once again I have hope that politics can be different."" And it was nothing more than that. As I do so many times, I saw a sweeper, I took off my glove, she took off hers, we shook hands and talked about society, garbage, our jobs...This interview first appeared on HuffPost Spain.
