The breakout star of the 2014 World Cup for Colombia, Rodriguez is still scoring goals capable of making the entire world gasp. The 23-year-old's latest golazo came for Real Madrid against Granada on Saturday at the Nuevo Los Carmenes stadium. With Madrid already leading 1-0 through Cristiano Ronaldo in the 31st minute, Karim Benzema set up Rodriguez with a deft touch of his own. Just inside the Granada penalty area, Rodriguez stepped up and struck a jaw-dropping, goalkeeper-defeating volley with his left foot. The ball sailed into the far, top corner of the Granada net to stake Real Madrid to a 2-0 lead. Sporting their black away kits, los Blancos would roll to a 4-0 victory. Madrid signed Rodriguez from AS Monaco following his stellar performance for Colombia in Brazil. Rodriguez netted 6 total goals at the World Cup to earn the Golden Boot as the tournament's leading goalscorer. Of those six goals, it was his sublime volley against Uruguay that generated the most attention. Not only did it help Colombia advance to the quarterfinals for the first time in its history but it was also voted the top goal of the tournament by FIFA.com users. Both breathtaking blasts figure to be in the running as 2014's ""goal of the year."""

Sgt. Samuel Hines, left, helps Cpl. Zachary Wicker tape gloves to his uniform in Fort Bliss, Texas, Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2014. About 500 Fort Bliss soldiers are preparing for deployment to West Africa where they will provide support in a military effort to contain the Ebola outbreak. (AP Photo/Juan Carlos Llorca)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dbb03c000018010dfaca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Obama was correct when he said that military members sent to West Africa to support efforts against Ebola are not volunteers. They are not, at least not in the same sense as their civilian counterparts. Service men and women volunteered to serve in the military, but they are taking the fight to Ebola because it's their job. And they are getting paid. They get a paycheck while they are working in Africa, and they get paid while they are in quarantine, as they should be.A deeper question, which is being obscured by semantic disputes, is this: If the decision not to quarantine civilians returning from Ebola-stricken areas is based on science, as the president and the head of the Centers For Disease Control insist it is, why is the federal government willing to pay military members for three weeks of unnecessary confinement, keeping them from essential duties? Our military is stretched thin, and so is our federal budget. An unscientific quarantine is a waste of military time and money. And don't get me started on the amount of time military members already spend away from their families.The CDC says the Ebola virus is transmitted through bodily fluids. Symptoms may appear anywhere between two and 21 days after exposure, and when symptoms appear, so does potential for infecting others. We've heard repeatedly from our leaders -- the president, legislators and doctors at the CDC -- that quarantining is not necessary for those without symptoms. They assert that any measures to prevent the spread of the disease should be based on science and not fear.Agreed.In spite of these assurances, military members returning from construction projects in areas affected by Ebola are being quarantined in isolation for three weeks, at government expense. Civilians who work directly with infected patients are required to answer questionnaires, are sometimes monitored, but are quarantined only if they become sick and therefore contagious. Could the reason be economic?The president and other leaders can't seem to come up another with a way to explain it, so they keep saying things that don't make sense. A couple of states have put mandatory quarantine and monitoring regulations in place for all returnees and then were chastised for it by President Obama, who then defended quarantining service members in the same press conference.The president told the press that measures to screen civilian health workers must be based on science. Then he said the military situation was different.""They are, first of all, not treating patients. Second of all, they are not there voluntarily. It's part of their mission they've been assigned to them by their commanders and ultimately me, their commander in chief. We don't expect to have similar rules for our military as we do civilians.""It's impossible to fathom why military members not treating Ebola patients makes them scientifically more eligible for quarantine. Equally incomprehensible is what being a volunteer has to do with disease prevention. The virus surely doesn't know or care who is being paid and who is not.We've been treated to a string of explanations for the quarantine disparity, none of which holds up to scrutiny.We're told that restrictions placed on those with potential exposure to Ebola would be burdensome and discourage medical professionals from volunteering to go to affected areas. For military families -- who routinely face the risk of death and loss of loved ones in service to their country and others -- quibbling over a couple of weeks of medical monitoring is truly baffling. A period of isolation as a health precaution is scarcely more onerous than risking a painful death to treat those who are suffering and dying.  Another explanation came from White House press secretary Josh Earnest. He said the thousands of military members involved in the Ebola mission made quarantine more efficient. Here again the correlation to civilian volunteers breaks down. Health care experts have said that thousands of volunteers will be needed in countries affected by Ebola, and we hope and pray they will also return home. What then?Several thousand health care professionals attended an educational event in New York earlier this month, where they were trained by representatives from the CDC and other experts in infection-control. Presumably, these trainees will go to West Africa in large numbers as well. The policies the United States puts into place for civilian volunteers returning from West Africa must be durable and sustainable for a long battle, not just for the few cases we've seen so far. We've already seen some of the results of policies that are not clear.Here's where I come back to that pesky volunteer issue. The fact that unpaid volunteer health care workers would have to forgo paychecks for even longer during quarantine is an obvious factor in the decision not to quarantine, but no one is talking about it. That -- as part of a larger civil liberties question -- is at the heart of the decision not to require quarantine for civilians.I'm not sure why this straightforward explanation is not being offered, except that it would also involve an admission that economics trumps science. And it would beg the question of why the government is willing to foot the bill for military members to be quarantined. Putting large numbers of military members in extended quarantine at government expense only feeds public suspicion that there's more to the Ebola story.Some military advocates feel quarantined troops are being treated as second-class citizens. Perhaps civilian health care workers should be asking themselves why the government is willing to make use of their expertise for free, but is not willing to foot the bill to closely monitor their ongoing health care.As the United States moves forward to lead the fight against the spread of Ebola, there's little doubt that military and civilians alike will serve honorably and well. We can only hope that good science and good sense will ensure they are treated in the same fashion when they all come home, whether they volunteered or were voluntold."

They are with us today both in reality and in fantasy. They present the world with the same dilemma that has troubled victims in the past -- how does the rest of the planet deal with them. One of the recurring themes in human history has been the rise of the empire builder -- leaders who seek to conquer territory beyond their own borders. Historically, they have been autocrats or authoritarians of the ilk of Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Catherine the Great, Hitler, Mao or Stalin. But even elected leaders of democracies in nations like Great Britain and the United States have seized land for their own ends. The most despicable of these lawbreakers/marauders are usually intent on avenging past humiliations, reclaiming national glory, adding to their country's wealth, or embracing manifest destiny. War traditionally has been the only way to stop such interlopers. Alliances among besieged states ward off the aggressor's advances. Diplomacy helps. A return to balance of power assures the peace.  Today, we have faux and true-blue expansionists. There's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Prime Minister of Turkey, a leader who laces his speeches with no more than yearnings to re-establish the Ottoman Empire. However, there is also Russian President Vladmir Putin outspokenly calling for the reuniting of Russian-speaking peoples -- which he has already partly accomplished by slicing off South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, and grabbing Crimea and jarring loose eastern sections from Ukraine. There is Chinese President Xi Jinping who is asserting sovereignty over islands in the East China Sea -- in the face of the claims by Japan and South Korea -- as well as over the islands in the South China Sea, in open disputes with the Philippines and Vietnam. There is the President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, who, following in the footsteps of his late predecessor, Hugo Chavez, talks about knitting together the states of South America under the flag of Simon Bolivar. There is Iranian Ayatollah Khamenei who fantasizes about reasserting his country's boundaries along the lines of the ancient 18th century Persian Empire. And there is the ISIS, which seeks to re-establish the Caliphate in Syria and Iraq and then spread to neighboring states. There are also inklings in countries like Hungary and Pakistan about pushing their frontiers outward. In dealing with today's empire builders, the first line of defense has been the 69-year-old United Nations, an organization which was expressly set up to prevent aggressors from taking other states. The UN Charter, under Article 2 Section 4, bars countries from threatening ""the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state..."" But the UN's ability to settle border disputes and stop incursions is limited. The UN has no military, no navy, no airforce, no missiles, no financial assets, and can only act with the direct authorization of its Security Council. The next layer of protection is the regional organization like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] which is currently applying economic sanctions against Moscow in response to Russian meddling in Ukraine. But only a few of such bodies have shown much initiative or muscle to act against invaders. And bodies like the African Union or the Arab League really do not have the sizeable strength or collective history to sustain any lengthy presence, barring any backup from stronger allies. The third possible defense is that countervailing powers like the United States may occasionally act against expansionists but do so rarely, primarily because of a lack of political will or national consensus. In any case, few nations wish to police the world, especially when they may have to expend valuable resources or act unilaterally, outside the ambit of international law. Finally, there are our planet's legal institutions, in particular, the International Court. The latter can produce carefully crafted judgments condemning the criminal activities of rogue states. But the court's edicts are voluntary, not compulsory, in nature, have a long lead time, and, in any case, do not have enforcement powers. It is extremely unusual to hear of useful outcomes through a juridical institution.  The only effective remedy seems to be a mix of all four constraints together -- the UN, regional bodies, powerful states, and legal pronouncements. The overall effect of these measures can sometimes create containment short of military action (without necessarily ruling it out) -- in the hope that internal weaknesses of outlaw nations may eventually lead to their collapse. This is at best a tenuous resolution but perhaps the only viable one in an age of genocidal actors, nuclear-armed states, loose weapons of mass destruction plus strident religious, ideological and nationalistic movements."

(Photo by Israel Premiership Press Office/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dbaa3c000032000dfac8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In case you haven't noticed, the Obama Administration is in the midst of an on-going and very public spat with the Netanyahu government in Israel. The ""tit for tat"" exchanges have been noted in the press, with reporters and some analysts providing banal motives for the acrimony. Some have suggested ""revenge"" -- pointing to Netanyahu's support for Obama's 2012 rival, Mitt Romney. Others have relied on the old Washington standard -- ""bad chemistry"". I believe, however, that it would be wrong to attribute the bitter words and bad feelings to trite personal concerns since there may be a strategic political purpose being served by this unfolding drama. First, a recap of the most recent events -- to set the stage: A few weeks back, following a Netanyahu-Obama meeting in Washington, the White House rebuked the Israeli leader's announcement of new settlement construction in occupied Jerusalem and the West Bank. The Israeli Prime Minister was quick to respond. He charged that the U.S. criticism failed to reflect ""American values"", bizarrely claiming that since Palestinians have the right to live anywhere they wish in the ""Land of Israel"", that Jews should not be denied that same right. To their credit, Israeli commentators were quick to point out that this was sheer nonsense since it is well-understood by Israelis that Palestinians cannot live anywhere they please. In fact, even Arab citizens of Israel are denied the right to live in most Jewish-only communities.The White House quickly shot back at Netanyahu suggesting that his harsh words were both uncalled for and more than a little ungrateful, reminding him how the U.S. had funded the ""Iron Dome"" and taken a host of other actions in Israel's defense.   Round two came last week as Netanyahu's Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon came to Washington and left after failing to secure meetings with the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, and other top Administration foreign affairs officials. This slight might have passed unnoticed, but for an official leak that made the insult public. Once again, the Israeli press pounced making it clear that it was the minister's undiplomatic criticism of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (Ya'alon had earlier charged that Kerry was driven by some sort of ""messianic"" complex in his efforts to achieve an Israeli-Palestinian peace) that had caused him to become ""persona non grata"" at the State Department and White House. The latest episode in this public spat came in the form of an interview given by an unnamed ""senior Administration official"" in which he was quoted saying ""The thing about Bibi is, he's a chickens**t... the good thing is he is scared to launch wars. The bad thing about him is that he won't do anything to reach an accommodation with the Palestinians or with the Sunni Arabs. The only thing he's interested in is protecting himself from political defeat... he's got no guts."" Tough words, to be sure, and what was most interesting was that the Administration let them stand for a full day, for maximum impact, before making any effort to diplomatically walk them back. The reaction in Israel was immediate and sustained. The Prime Minister acted like a wounded warrior claiming that he was being attacked solely because he was defending Israel. While Netanyahu had some defenders, to be sure, many commentators were not buying his arguments. They charged that his behavior was not only putting the U.S.-Israel relationship at risk; it was also isolating Israel in the world community. As evidence for their concern, they cited not only the above-noted repeated run-ins with Washington but also the decision of Sweden to recognize the State of Palestine and pro-Palestinian votes in Britain and Ireland, and new warnings from the EU over settlement plans in Jerusalem. With the recklessness of Netanyahu's own actions and those of his extremist allies fueling an ever-increasing volatile situation in Jerusalem and with the Palestinians launching an effort at the United Nations against settlements and for an end to the occupation, the Prime Minister's newly emboldened critics have become increasingly concerned that the last thing Israel needs in the face of these serious challenges is isolation from its friends in the West. Netanyahu may have already written off the Obama White House and may be counting on a Republican Congress to save him from the Administration's pressure, but opinion in Israel appears not to share his confidence that the country can whether the storms created by his defiance. They are warning that regardless of which party wins the upcoming U.S. election, Israel may be heading for two long and lonely years. This is what, I believe, is behind the Administration's gambit. The President has long been frustrated by the Israeli Prime Minister's wily and often dishonest maneuvering. But knowing that the opposition in Israel is too weak at present, to win control of the government, something needed to be done to shake up the internal Israeli debate. The ""conventional wisdom"", as projected by some former U.S. officials and pro-Israel groups in Washington, is that Israelis will only make peace when they are given everything they want and feel secure. In fact, the opposite is true. It is only external pressure -- especially pressure from the U.S. -- that historically has forced Israelis to make the right choice. George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker did just that when publicly rebuked and then denied loan guarantees to then Prime Minister Shamir in the early 1990s. Bill Clinton did much the same when he refused to meet with Netanyahu and sent clear signs of his displeasure with the Prime Minister's behavior in 1998. In both instances, Israelis got the message and unelected these Likud leaders in favor of governments that promised to restore the U.S.-Israeli relationship and move toward peace. This may very well be what the Obama Administration is up to right now. It is a gamble, to be sure. It may be too late to empower the Israeli peace camp and stop the right-ward drift in that country. But it is a risk that must be taken. Secretary Kerry was right to link the conflict against ISIS with the Israel-Palestine conflict. With delicate negotiations underway with Iran and in the midst of a war for the future of Iraq and Syria, the last thing the U.S. needs is a pyromaniac in Jerusalem pouring gasoline on the fires that will inflame the entire region. Netanyahu must go, but for that to happen, the debate in Israel must change and that country's peace forces must be strengthened to the point where they will coalesce around a candidate that will move the country in a different direction. That process is beginning. But if it is to have any chance of succeeding, it must be sustained. If Washington were to become weak-kneed and back down: Netanyahu would win, peace would lose, and the U.S. will not, any time soon, get another opportunity to restore its leadership in the region.

""The most ideologically oriented Americans make their voices heard through greater participation in every stage of the political process.""7. ""To those on the ideological right and left, compromise now means that their side gets more of what it wants."" In a nutshell, Americans are more partisan and more insular.The new Pew Research Center political typology poll segmented the American political electorate into eight groups based upon degree of partisanship. There were three clusters. The first is ""The Partisan Anchors,"" the Republican and Democratic base: ""Steadfast Conservatives"" (19 percent), ""Business Conservatives"" (17 percent), and ""Solid Liberals"" (21 percent). When we compare ""Solid Liberals"" to ""Steadfast Conservatives"" we see the challenges for bipartisanship. Ninety-eight percent of Liberals described themselves as ""consistently liberal"" or ""mostly liberal.""

Seventy-three percent of Liberals believe ""Government should do more to solve problems,"" whereas 87 percent of Conservatives believe ""Government is already doing too much."" Not surprisingly, 91 percent of Liberals agreed ""Government aid to the poor does more good than harm"" but 86 percent of Conservatives disagreed.Predictably, Liberals and Conservatives have diametrically opposed views on most important issues. Eighty-six percent of Liberals approve of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare); 94 percent of Conservatives disapprove. (87 percent of Liberals agree that is ""the government's responsibility to ensure all have healthcare coverage;"" 92 percent of conservatives believe it is not the government's responsibility.)Ninety-six percent of Liberals believe that immigrants ""should be eligible for citizenship if meet certain requirements;"" only half of Conservatives agree.Eighty-one percent of Liberals believe that it is more important to control gun ownership than to protect it; 89 percent of Conservatives disagree.Seventy-eight percent of Liberals believe ""the earth is getting warmer because of fossil fuels;"" 75 percent of Conservatives believe ""there is no evidence the earth is getting warmer.""

In the latest recording it is hard to see the man's face as he his filmed from a distance.But it is likely to raise grave doubts about whether talks between a Boko Haram faction and the government in neighboring Chad will secure the release of the girls, who were kidnapped from a secondary school in Chibok, northeast Nigeria, in April.""We have have married them off and they are all in their husbands' houses,"" the man claiming to be Shekau says.""The over 200 Chibok girls have converted to Islam, which they confess is the best religion.

Are you talking to yourselves? We don't know anybody by the name of Danladi. If we meet him now we will cut off his head,"" the man in the video says.""All we are doing is slaughtering people with machetes and shooting people with guns ...

The only known hostage seized in the northeast is a German teacher kidnapped from a college in the northeastern city of Gombe in July by gunmen widely assumed to be linked to Boko Haram.Shekau's denial of the ceasefire appears supported by the violence since the government announced it two weeks ago. It also raises doubts about the actual influence of Ahmadu.The five-year-old campaign for an Islamic state by Boko Haram, which has killed thousands and whose name means ""Western education is sinful,"" has become by far the biggest menace to the security of Africa's biggest economy and top oil producer.Its fighters have attacked targets almost every day for weeks and last week seized control of Mubi, the home town of Nigeria's defense chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh. It was Badeh who announced the ceasefire.They robbed banks, burned down houses and hoisted their black flag over the Emir's palace, killing dozens of people and forcing thousands to flee, witnesses in Mubi said.A car bomb thought to have been planted by Boko Haram killed at least 10 people at a crowded bus stop in Gombe on Friday morning, emergency services said.The government has blamed the violence on Boko Haram's allied criminal networks that it cannot control. There are also thought to be several competing factions within the group. (Writing by Tim Cocks; Editing by Louise Ireland)"

(AP Photo/Bram Janssen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1406c2400004f0024f7b6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Isabel ColesARBIL, Iraq, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Cloaked in Kurdish flags, thousands of people lined the roads to cheer on a military convoy headed for what was -- until recently -- an obscure Syrian border town, now the focus of a global war against the militants of Islamic State.The Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga were on their way to help fellow Kurds defend Kobani in a battle that has assumed huge significance in the United States' campaign to ""degrade and destroy"" the hardline Islamist insurgency.It is unclear whether the small but heavily armed contingent of peshmerga will be enough to swing the battle, but the deployment is a potent display of unity between Kurdish groups that more often seek to undermine each other.The unified front is being forged as Kurds emerge as the West's most trusted and effective partner on the ground in both Iraq and Syria.But preserving that unity be tricky, given the competing ambitions for leadership of the world's more than 30 million Kurds, the majority of whom are Sunni Muslim, but who tend to identify more strongly with their ethnicity than religion.Governments in each of the four countries across which they are spread - Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Iran - have tended to exploit internal Kurdish divisions to thwart their aspirations for independence.""We all want the Kurdish people to be united,"" said 33-year old Ayyoub Sheikho, who fled Kobani last month and is now living in a newly pitched row of tents at a refugee camp in Iraq's Kurdistan region. ""If we don't unite we will be trampled on.""Fuad Hussein, the Kurdistan president's chief of staff, said Islamic State had ""destroyed the borders.""""It is the same terrorist organization that attacks in (the Iraqi towns of) Khanaqin in Jalawla in Mosul in Kirkuk but also in (Syrian) Kobani, so this created a feeling of solidarity among the Kurds,"" he told Reuters. NATIONAL IDENTITYThe deployment of peshmerga to Kobani illustrates the unprecedented degree of cooperation that has emerged between Kurdish groups across borders since Islamic State overran a third of Iraq this summer and proclaimed a caliphate straddling the frontier with Syria.When Islamic State targeted Iraqi Kurdistan in August, fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) descended from mountain bases on the Turkey-Iraq border to help blunt the offensive.Around the same time, fighters from a Syrian Kurd group that has surged to promince during the civil war there -- the People's Protection Units (YPG) -- crossed into Iraq to save thousands of minority Yazidis from death at the hands of Islamic State militants who had torn through the peshmerga's defenses.Kurds from Iran have also been fighting alongside peshmerga forces in Iraqi Kurdistan.""Kurds today are more unified than ever before, and even if they were to take a few steps back, they will still be much further ahead than they were six months ago,"" said Henri Barkey, a former State Department official who now teaches at Lehigh University in the United States. ""The upshot of all of this is a consolidation of Kurdish national identity."" STRETCHEDIf Kobani were to fall, officials in Iraqi Kurdistan say they fear a domino effect on Syria's two other Kurdish ""cantons,"" precipitating a fresh wave of refugees into the autonomous region, already struggling to accommodate more than 1 million people displaced by violence within Iraq.It would also boost the morale of Islamic State in Iraq, where the peshmerga have been regaining ground in the north since U.S. air strikes began in August.Nevertheless, some question why Iraqi Kurds have deployed peshmerga abroad when they are still stretched at home, and have yet to win back all the territory they let slip.The decision to reinforce Kobani was made under intense popular pressure from Kurds worldwide.Barzani's efforts to extend his influence across the border into Syria have been repeatedly frustrated by the Democratic Union Party (PYD), the political wing group of the YPG militia, which has emerged as the dominant Kurdish force there.Rival Syrian Kurdish parties backed by Barzani have looked increasingly irrelevant by comparison. The U.S. government held its first publicly acknowledged meeting with the PYD in October and the YPG says it has been coordinating air strikes with the U.S. military during the Kobani campaign.Relations between the Kurds in Iraq and Syria have been rocky.Hundreds of Syrian Kurds trained under Barzani's auspices in northern Iraq, but the PYD refused to let them back in, saying its own YPG militia was the only legitimate armed force.In turn, PYD leaders were denied entry to Iraqi Kurdistan, and, earlier this year, the regional government dug a trench along its frontier with Syria, citing concerns about Islamic State infiltration.The PYD said that was a clear attempt to throttle its nascent administration, which the Iraqi Kurds did not officially recognize until this month.But, in another sudden sign of unity, the Syrian PYD -- which some say has been tarnished by its association the Turkish militant group PKK -- struck a power-sharing deal with other Syrian factions last week, a move aimed at least in part to improve its image abroad. COMMANDER IN CHIEFAs the peshmerga convoy departed Iraqi Kurdistan for Turkey, en route to Kobani, Kurds held aloft framed portraits of Barzani and his father, Mullah Mustafa, revered as a pillar of Kurdish nationalism. Some prostrated themselves in the road.By deploying the peshmerga -- of which he is commander in chief -- to Kobani now, Barzani is boosting his credentials as a transnational leader of the Kurds and their interlocutor with the West.A senior member of a rival party in Iraqi Kurdistan said the move would also help boost Barzani's popularity after setbacks on the battlefield this summer, and mend some of the political damage inflicted by his perceived over-reliance on Turkey, which failed the Kurds in their time of need.Turkey is one of Iraqi Kurdistan's closest political and economic allies, yet Ankara fears that if Syria's Kurds follow the example set by their brethren in Iraq and seek an independent state in northern Syria, it could embolden Kurdish militants in Turkey and derail a fragile peace process.Turkey's reluctance to support the fight against Islamic State over the border in Syria enraged its own Kurdish minority, complicated efforts to provide aid to Kobani and meant negotiations to enable the passage of the peshmerga through Turkish territory were delicate and complex.Rival groups' links to different regional powers, remain a threat to Kurdish unity, according to Maria Fantappie, Iraq analyst with International Crisis Group.""I see this as a temporary convergence of interest more than lasting realignment,"" she said. ""Beside ideological differences dividing KDP (Barzani's party) and PYD, these two parties' regional ties, with Turkey and Iran respectively, remain the largest impediment to the formation of a united Kurdish front.""

The United States will help fight Ebola over ""the long haul,"" the American ambassador to the United Nations said on a trip to the West African countries hit by the outbreak.(AP Photo/Abbas Dulleh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1406c2400003300382694.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Megha RajagopalanBEIJING, Oct 31 (Reuters) - China will dispatch an elite unit of the People's Liberation Army to help Ebola-hit Liberia, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday, responding to U.N. calls for a greater global effort to fight the deadly virus in West Africa.Washington has led the international drive to stop the spread of the disease that has killed nearly 5,000 people, sending thousands of troops and committing about $1 billion, but Beijing has faced criticism for not doing enough.The PLA squad, which has experience from a 2002 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), will build a 100-bed treatment center in Liberia, the first such facility in the three countries most impacted by Ebola to be constructed and run by a foreign country, said Lin Songtian, director general of the ministry's Department of African Affairs.The center will be open for operation in a month's time, he told a briefing in Beijing. China will also dispatch 480 PLA medical staff to treat Ebola patients, he said.It's the first time China has deployed a whole unit of epidemic prevention forces and military medical staff abroad, Lin said.China is Africa's biggest trade partner, tapping the continent's rich vein of resources to fuel its own economic growth over the past couple of decades. Some critics have rounded on Beijing for not helping more in Africa's hour of need.China has so far donated 750 million yuan ($123 million) to 13 African countries and international organizations to combat Ebola, according to the government.""China's assistance will not stop until the Ebola epidemic is eradicated in West Africa,"" Lin said.The White House this week responded to criticism that as the global superpower it was not doing enough by taking a veiled swipe at the contributions of Russia and China.""When we have a situation like this on the global scene, people aren't wondering what the Chinese are doing to respond to it. People aren't picking up the phone and wondering if Vladimir Putin is going to commit Russian resources to this effort,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told a media briefing.""People want to know what the United States of America is doing about it.""Howver, U.S. envoy to the United Nations Samantha Power, who was traveling in region this week, welcomed the arrival of an AirChina cargo plane with anti-Ebola supplies to Liberia on Wednesday. She said in a tweet that it was heartening to see U.S. soldiers and Liberians working together with Chinese to unload supplies from the plane. FOREIGN AID UNDER SPOTLIGHTChina said in July that more than half its foreign aid of over $14 billion went to Africa. In comparison, the United States spent about $46 billion in fiscal 2015 on foreign aid programs.China has also dispatched hundreds of aid workers to Africa to combat Ebola including health experts and medical staff.Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd., a Chinese drug maker with military ties, has sent several thousand doses of an experimental Ebola drug to Africa and is planning clinical trials there.Lin said several thousand Chinese nationals live in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and about a million Chinese nationals live on the African continent.U.S. and Chinese troops staged their first disaster relief exercise last November in a signal that China is increasingly eager to use its growing military muscle for humanitarian causes as it works to win international support.China dispatched a state-of-the-art hospital ship to the Philippines last year after one of the world's biggest typhoons that killed thousands there.The United Nations has called on foreign governments to ramp up efforts to help the Ebola-hit states of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, requesting they send hundreds more medical personnel to the impoverished states to help.Foreign efforts have been complicated by public health policy issues at home. Some U.S. states have slapped mandatory quarantines on health workers returning from Ebola-hit states, while Australia this week imposed a blanket ban on visas from the three affected states.Health experts have decried the measures as draconian, and say such policies may discourage badly needed foreign doctors and nurses from volunteering to help.Medical professionals say Ebola is difficult to catch and is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids from an infected person and is not transmitted by asymptomatic people. Ebola is not airborne. (Additional reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Jeremy Laurence)"

Some critics fear they could lead to nicotine addiction and tobacco smoking.""We see it as a backdoor entry, it doesn't have tobacco but it has nicotine,"" said the official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.""Expert panels have recommended regulation or a ban. India cannot regulate easily,"" the official added, saying that the government would consider the ban in the next month or two.The European Union has agreed to requirements around advertising and packaging to ensure the safety and quality of e-cigarettes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has proposed banning sales to anyone under 18.Up to 900,000 Indians die every year of tobacco-related diseases, and that number could reach 1.5 million by 2020 if users do not kick the habit, the International Tobacco Control Project estimates.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is taking several steps to curb India's tobacco consumption. It has increased taxes on tobacco products and ordered companies to print more health warnings on packages. SINGLE BAN?While most e-cigarettes are imported and sold by small firms, India's largest cigarette maker ITC started selling the devices in August.ITC did not comment directly on the likely ban, but said India should not be left behind in technology development of such products.India has also proposed a ban on the sale of single conventional cigarettes. The official said the ministry had proposed amendments to tobacco control laws and a cabinet note had been circulated for comments.Indians smoked more than 100 billion cigarettes in 2012, according to Euromonitor International, and it is common for vendors to sell them individually.The WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control states that countries ""shall endeavor"" to prohibit such sales as it makes them more affordable for minors. India is a party to the convention.A single cigarette costs about 10 rupees (16 cents) in the capital, New Delhi, compared with a pack of 20 that costs 190 rupees ($3).The ITC declined to comment on the proposed ban. The Tobacco Institute of India (TII), an industry body, said the proposed law would not be easily enforceable and would lead to retailers being harassed. (Editing by Douglas Busvine, Robert Birsel)"

With my kids.I eventually took my partner to a work function. Even to a client dinner.No fanfare, no announcement, no declaration. I didn't wave flags or scream it down the halls. It was just a slow process, really just telling people one on one, for the most part.For many years I had my own agency, CPPartners. We created the first print advertising for Tylenol specifically targeting the LGBT community, timed perfectly for Pride that year. An industry publication wrote that I was the ""openly gay"" president of the agency. It was meant well but just sounded so odd at the time. It sounds even odder now.Coming up through the ranks, I'm sure I paid for being open. I would walk into meetings and comments were made publicly about ""the gay guy walking in the room."" I smiled through it, but I worried about being labeled as someone who wouldn't go far as a result. I felt like it was being said to somehow push me down.Looking back from where I sit now, I don't care. I did what I had to do to balance my career with raising my kids. I'm happy with every decision I made. My kids are succeeding in college, thank you very much, and I'm thrilled with my work.Was I proud? Yes, but also scared. I didn't know what the impact would be on my professional or personal life. I still don't really know. But thanks to high-profile businesspeople like Tim Cook, I think we can all breathe just a little easier now. Let's hope he sparks a trend of people being more open about who they are, no matter who they are, at work.Have I ever considered being gay a gift? No, but I do now.I say bravo to Tim Cook. While some may say, ""What took you so long?"" I say anytime you're ready to talk about who you are is the right time. Bravo!His brand just skyrocketed in my book. Thank you, Tim!Maybe someday I can take the question mark out of the title of this post."

Their double-bill opening Saturday at the Chandler Pavilion marked the LA Opera's second collaboration with wave-making Australian stage director Barrie Kosky. It also heralded the promise of a long-term relationship.Chief Director of Berlin's Komische Oper from 2012, Kosky debuted here last year with a spoofy Mozart's Magic Flute  that looked like a silent movie. As with that production, this sparely staged pairing originated in Europe, but that's where their resemblance ends. Change-ups are a habit of the chameleon-like director.Two and a half centuries span the two tragedies of Dido and Bluebeard, one with a lot of fun, the other with none. When Kosky teases in an interview before the opening that the works have little in common, you can count on seeing as many parallels as lanes on the freeway you took to the Music Center. He spins an enigmatic few of them in the printed program: ""Arrival and departure, departure and arrival, a woman and a man, a man and a woman, a lost Eden, a forgotten Eden and a remembered Eden.""The protagonists of these tales are fodder for a psychiatrist's couch. Except for her brief amatory union with Aeneas, Dido's clinical depression keeps her so withdrawn from her court she heeds neither cheering up nor sinister plots. Duke Bluebeard's guarded split personality is a fatal attraction to obsessive new wife Judith, who, against his will and her own safety, makes him reveal his lethal all.However linked the psycho-atmospherics may be, their respective stagings sharply contrast. Katrin Lea Tag's spare scenery, slow-rising curtains, and vivid costumes (owing much to Julie Taymor and Germany's Pina Bausch) evoke radically different landscapes, historic time zones, and sound-worlds. The use of unscripted whispers in both works heightens the drama and helps span their stylistic discontinuities.Dido and AeneasDido is bathed in bright lights and dressed in (mostly) pastel-infused but freakish period clothing. Its drama unfolds on the outer edge of the stage proscenium, barricaded from behind by an accordion-shaped screen. The narrowly defined space emphasizes the wafer-thin superficiality of the courtiers, and probably also Dido's hold on power. A long white bench stretches across the stage to seat the retinue: a collection of nit-wits, sycophants and nasty plotters, who by turns ape the droopy sentiments of their queen or trot off to bizarre and brazen behaviors.All the while they sing nicely to Purcell's delicate score. (""If you drop it will break"" was Kosky's earlier characterization.) The music was realized with great fluency in the large hall, aided in projection by the forward placed screen. The modest-sized baroque orchestra was peppered with period instruments (wood bassoon, oboe and flute, with a continuo of organ, harpsichord and theorbos) and conducted to precision by Steven Sloane.As Dido's sister Belinda, soubrette soprano Kateryna Kasper is the court's excitable teenybopper. Her ""To the hills and the vales"" shimmered with youthful enthusiasm as sung to an enchanted audience from the outer edge of the orchestra pit.Outlandish comedy comes from the combo of a sorceress and two witches sung by an improbable assemblage of three African-American countertenors, led by recent Operalia winner John Holiday (the sorceress) with G. Thomas Allen and Darryl Taylor. Dressed in pitch black and suggesting a trio of harping crows, they were the conspirators against Dido who pranced and danced and shook their jowly cheeks in celebration of their own wickedness. Holiday even changed into a mock Dido dress as he spitefully employed an imposter Mercury to order Aeneas' departure for Rome. This has the intended effect of fatally demoralizing his queen. The sketch leveled the audience with laughter.Handsome Liam Bonner's Aeneas, en route from Troy to Rome, is presented more as feckless wanderer than purposeful hero. His plush baritonal colors lent plummy hues to his bass region and a tenorial gleam higher up. After Dido's fragile state of mind dismisses him for even thinking of leaving her, Aeneas stomps off stage and down to the the audience seating area, slamming a side door on his way out. Temper, temper.Dido is the only role treated as serious, and the contrast of her demeanor with that of the others enhances her isolation. In her local debut as the sole holdover from European productions, Irish mezzo Paula Murrihy's aristocratic poise and pearly voice captured Dido's exquisite melancholy, furious anger, and, in her famous lament ""When I am laid in earth"" and its aftermath, her grisly end-of-life journey of shocking gasps and sighs. As she dies, orchestra members and courtiers, who earlier had migrated from stage to pit, depart one by one, so that when Dido finally expires in a slump, she is left alone to commune with eternity. The scene touchingly recollected the late Lorraine Hunt Lieberson of not so many years ago singing Bach's ""Ich habe genug.""Bluebeard's CastleThe mood of Bluebeard's Castle after the interval grows even darker and much heavier. It unfolds on a large empty disc sitting in the Chandler's cavernous backstage, blackened but otherwise unadorned. The two protagonists, also draped in black, rotate on this disc in a glacially slow but intense dance of death. The spatial infinity suggests the bottomless pit of Bluebeard's concealed and bloody marital history and also Judith's morbid curiosity. The use of people in lieu of sets, which was suggested in Dido, here becomes literal. Traditional productions employ seven actual doors, which Judith coaxes Bluebeard to open, but in this instance three sets of supernumeraries stand in for the chambers containing his former wives. Former iterations of the Duke himself stream gold dust, leafy vines, and water in a dystopian Garden of Eden made fearsome and fatal after the fall.Claudia Mahnke as Judith and Robert Hayward as Bluebeard act out their Hungarian rendition of Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolf, forcing open the doors to each other's personalities. If, due to unrelieved narratives, their vocal tours de force can't quite keep us engaged for the hour-long layer-peeling intensity, their joint efforts earn points for honesty and sheer perseverance.Bartók's score is an expressionistic time bomb. Its massive modern orchestra can be compared in size and sonority, also artistic importance, to those of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring and Berg's Wozzeck. Each morbid revelation in the opera is accompanied by an ever more splendid soundscape, the most dramatic being the brass ensemble that depicts the castle's magnificent gardens in a kind of post-Wagnerian grandeur. Steven Sloane and his instrumental charges bridged the huge stylistic chasm after Purcell's light textures to realize superbly this musical Mount Everest.Apropos and worthy of note, the heavy costs of this joint production were not in sets but in musicians, and thanks for that.Left in the mind's eye after the performances was Dido's white claustrophobia and Bluebeard's black infinity, like the eternally clinging teardrops in a yin-yang.---ooo---Performances continue through November 25.

Former iterations of the Duke himself stream gold dust, leafy vines, and water in a dystopian Garden of Eden made fearsome and fatal after the fall.Claudia Mahnke as Judith and Robert Hayward as Bluebeard act out their Hungarian rendition of Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolf, forcing open the doors to each other's personalities. If, due to unrelieved narratives, their vocal tours de force can't quite keep us engaged for the hour-long layer-peeling intensity, their joint efforts earn points for honesty and sheer perseverance.Bartók's score is an expressionistic time bomb. Its massive modern orchestra can be compared in size and sonority, also artistic importance, to those of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring and Berg's Wozzeck. Each morbid revelation in the opera is accompanied by an ever more splendid soundscape, the most dramatic being the brass ensemble that depicts the castle's magnificent gardens in a kind of post-Wagnerian grandeur. Steven Sloane and his instrumental charges bridged the huge stylistic chasm after Purcell's light textures to realize superbly this musical Mount Everest.Apropos and worthy of note, the heavy costs of this joint production were not in sets but in musicians, and thanks for that.Left in the mind's eye after the performances was Dido's white claustrophobia and Bluebeard's black infinity, like the eternally clinging teardrops in a yin-yang.---ooo---Performances continue through November 25.

Gaye's estate then filed a countersuit, claiming that Thicke had a ""Marvin Gaye fixation,"" in addition to stealing music. Now, a California judge ruled that the songs may be substantially similar.U.S. District Judge John Kronstadt denied Thicke and Williams' motion for summary judgement on Thursday, citing that there was enough evidence to move forward with the Gaye family's claim. He wrote that the ""defendants have made a sufficient showing that elements of 'Blurred Lines' may be substantially similar to protected, original elements of 'Got to Give It Up.'""Kronstadt's ruling saw similarities in the two songs' bass lines, keyboard parts, vocal lines, melodies and harmonies. The trial is scheduled for Feb. 10, 2015.The lawsuit made headlines last month when The Hollywood Reporter obtained depositions from April, which contained bizarre revelations about the making ""Blurred Lines."" Thicke admitted that Williams wrote the song, though he tried to take credit for it, that he was ""high on Vicodin and alcohol"" during studio time and lied about the process of writing the song in previous interviews.Billboard reports that the case could be one of the biggest trials over alleged song theft ever.

Science has touched every facet of my life and on a broader scale has touched every facet of our existence as human beings. It's the reason we can have clean water to drink, the reason we can enjoy a life expectancy over 40 and the reason why we are no longer left to wonder about the particles that comprise our cells and make life possible. Science is enlightenment and science is power yet science must also be valued and respected. Science is neither partisan nor political and it never should be. Unfortunately denying science has become a prevalent position in this country and more critically one amongst our political leaders. Denial that our global climate patterns are changing as direct result of human activity has become an acceptable viewpoint and even more dishearteningly a counter-view to belief in facts. If the polls and pundits are right, next week, Democrats will likely lose control of the Senate and Senator James Inhofe (R-OK)--a man who denies climate change--will gain the chairmanship of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. This is the same man who calls the consensus of 97% of climate scientists that our planet is warming due to human activity a hoax--he's even written a book about it. Fortunately for him, at 80 years old, Senator Inhofe will never have to live with the consequences of his actions denying science. He will likely never see how shifting weather patterns will alter where we live, what we eat and how we adapt to water scarcity. He will likely never see the wheat crops of his native state of Oklahoma suffer as result of unpredictable rain patterns. Senator Inhofe will be allowed to enjoy spreading incredibly dangerous rhetoric for a few more years for his political gain and will then pass leaving a struggling planet in the hands of younger generations. This sounds awfully convenient. I am a millennial, a staunch believer in science and I think it is a shame that this man will be given an opportunity to chair a committee whose central jurisdiction is that of science. As the most powerful country on this planet what sort of message does it send that a man who has no interest in protecting it will be given this title? And while Senator Inhofe potentially may not even see comprehensive climate legislation come through his future committee, I think it's jarring symbolism that a man of his convictions should be granted a Chairmanship. It shouldn't be a wishful aspiration of mine that our elected officials have regard for the condition of the planet they are leaving my generation--it is the right thing to do. If the term ""climate change"" is too controversial then let's not use it. Let us simply, as citizens of this Earth, accept the conclusions of science as we have been doing for millennia. Our political differences should not cloud our judgment that this planet is warming and changing, their role will come to play when we must determine how to deal with the ramifications of this phenomenon. That will be a separate struggle, but for now let's start with holding our politicians accountable to science and not its denial."

In background conversations, these officials have called him everything from ""chickenshit"" and cowardly to ""Aspergery,"" obtuse, recalcitrant, reactionary and even anti-American.These accusations are far from the mark. Maybe Bibi is blustering and pompous, even myopic, overly attached to all the settlements and not responding quickly enough to opportunities in the Middle East. But the other issues under dispute -- Jerusalem, the Iranian nuclear program, Islamic fundamentalist groups on Israel's periphery (Hamas in Gaza, jihadists in Sinai, Hizbollah in Lebanon, ISIS in Iraq and Syria, Al Nusra in the Golan Heights) -- worry nearly all Israeli politicians. After all, they are responsible for a tiny state (8,000 square miles) with a small population (6 million Jews) in the midst of the dark hole of the New World Order.But, ""chickenshit"" and cowardly? How many Americans have fought as much and as successfully in wartime? Bibi fought in the front lines in the 1969 War of Attrition and 1973 Yom Kippur War where he became a captain in the elite Syeret Matkal special forces. He led his men on dangerous missions often deep in enemy territory in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Bibi even stormed a Sabena airplane seized by terrorists at Lod Airport. There he was shot in the shoulder by the terrorists before they were subdued.But, obtuse, stupid, slow to understand? Yet, Bibi graduated near the top of his class at MIT while carrying a double load of courses. His MIT advisor remembered, ""He did superbly. He was very bright. Organized. Strong. Powerful."" And after MIT he was admitted to the Ph.D program in political science at Harvard!But, recalcitrant? If anything he has been remarkably versatile. He has been a business consultant (Boston Consulting Group), businessman, diplomat (Israeli Ambassador to the United States), cabinet minister (Israeli Foreign Minister and Israeli Finance Minister), military officer (team leader of special forces) and national political leader (twice Prime Minister, leader of Likud Party).His versatility comes naturally. His father was a highly published (six books) academic who taught at Cornell, Dropsie and Denver. His brother Yoni, a national hero in Israel, was a poet who in July 1976 was killed commanding the Syeret Matkal special forces in the successful operation at Entebbe to free over 100 Israeli captives 2,400 miles from home. His other brother Iddo graduated from Cornell University and is a physician, playwright and author.But, reactionary? Bibi is many things but also one of two Likud leaders to have uttered those fateful words: a two state solution. Bibi, like Menachem Begin who gave up the Sinai for peace with Egypt in 1979 at Camp David and Arik Sharon who vacated the Gaza Strip and closed four settlements in the West Bank in 2005, is willing to consider trading land for peace.But, anti-American? Bibi is that rare foreigner who has spent almost 13 years in the United States and speaks English with an American accent. He not only went to college and graduate school in the United States but worked in business here for several years. He is a man who loves America and has spent much time here.Bibi is many things, not all positive by any means. But, to demonize so accomplished a man leading a democratic state in a region teeming with radical terrorist and fundamentalist groups is much worse than merely attempting to discredit him by making all these ad hominem attacks.It sends a dangerous message that the United States does not value the only state in the region to stand for American values: democracy, free market, globalized economy, hi tech, independent judiciary and rule of law, an Israel that is often called ""America's Fifty-First State."""
16,POLITICS,You'll Probably Never Know Why The CIA Spied On The Senate,Ali Watkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/torture-panetta-review_n_6078194.html,,2014-10-31,"File- This March 13, 2014, file photo shows Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., listening on Capitol Hill in Washington, during a Senate Transportation subcommittee hearing. In the aftermath of committee chairwoman Sen. Feinsteinâs accusations that the CIAâs intimidating tactics and breaching of its constitutional authority for filing a criminal complaint against congressional aides, observers say the U.S. intelligence community and its congressional minders have committed serious missteps over the 13 years since the 9/11 terror attacks. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8db89200000070201d491.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- When Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) took to the Senate floor earlier this year to allege that the CIA had spied on the U.S. Senate, she confirmed the existence of a secret document.That document, she said, could further validate a scathing report on the spy agency's torture practices that is expected to be unveiled in the next few weeks.The document is known as the ""Panetta Review,"" and senators contend it backs up damning conclusions in their still-classified report on the CIA's post-9/11 enhanced interrogation program. Senate investigators uncovered the internal CIA document in their years-long probe, and the agency was so concerned that it alleged the investigators had broken the law in obtaining the review. CIA agents, in turn, searched Senate computers.But the Panetta Review may never see the light of day.As chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Feinstein plans to release a redacted summary of the 6,300-page torture report, likely next month. To understand the importance of the CIA document -- considered so sensitive that the agency was willing to risk a constitutional showdown with the legislative branch -- requires a look back at exactly how the nation's top spies wound up in a clandestine battle with their elected overseers.At the heart of the fight is the massive Senate study, one of Feinstein’s landmark achievements. Its credibility could hinge on the Panetta Review.What Is The Panetta Review?In March 2009, Feinstein announced that her committee would conduct a study of the CIA’s George W. Bush-era interrogation program, in which suspected terrorists were shipped to secret overseas prisons and subjected to harsh techniques such as waterboarding that many, including President Barack Obama, equate with torture. According to an exchange of letters between Feinstein and then-CIA Director Leon Panetta, the study would be conducted at a secure CIA facility in Northern Virginia, where Intelligence Committee staff would be provided with access to the mountains of CIA records pertaining to the program. In an effort to catalog and track the millions of documents being provided to the committee, Panetta established the New Review Group on Rendition, Detention and Interrogation in March 2009.   “The Review Group will assemble data and formulate coordinated positions on the complex, often controversial, questions that define rendition, detention, and interrogation,” Panetta wrote in a 2009 public statement announcing the group.  The language suggests that the review group was launched to create an official internal report.   “When a government agency announces a report such as this, it clearly implies its intention to provide the end product to the public,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), an Intelligence Committee member.  But Panetta's review never emerged, and the agency has denied that it was a formal analysis of the enhanced interrogation program. Instead, the CIA contends that the result of the review group’s efforts was an informal collection of summaries, a draft document that was never officially approved or returned to the agency director. That body of work does exist, though, and it has come to be known as the Panetta Review.  The agency says that the Panetta Review was never formally completed and that it was stopped prematurely to avoid complicating a concurrent Justice Department investigation of the interrogation program. Because the Panetta Review was an internal draft document, the legislative branch was never entitled to have it, the agency contends.Justice Department investigators were provided access to the internal summaries, however, because their investigation was a criminal probe.What’s The Significance Of The Panetta Review?  The Intelligence Committee contends that the internal summaries in the Panetta Review align with much of its own study’s harsh conclusions about the agency. But the CIA has publicly disputed the key parts of the still-secret congressional study.Senators and staffers argue that the fact there are people within the CIA who agree with the Senate report's findings is important for the public to know and bolsters the credibility of the Senate investigation. The Panetta document, they say, illustrates internal CIA debate over the enhanced interrogation program.“If there’s dissent within the agency over the conduct and worth of the CIA’s detention and interrogation program, it ought to be made public alongside the CIA’s official response. By covering up the results of this review, CIA Director [John] Brennan is disavowing the hard, deliberative work of his officers, and instead putting forward the narrative that a torture program designed and propagated by a handful of individuals reflects the views and values of the entire Agency,” Heinrich said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “This is wrong, and it’s a disservice to the CIA and its legacy.”  How Did Senate Staffers Get Their Hands On It?The first the public learned of the Panetta Review was when Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) made a simple request of CIA general counsel nominee Caroline Krass at her nomination hearing in December 2013.  The CIA, he noted, had done its own internal review of the enhanced interrogation program. Udall wanted a copy.  “It appears that this review, which was initiated by former Director Panetta, is consistent with the Intelligence Committee’s report, but amazingly, it conflicts with the official CIA response to the committee’s report,"" Udall said.  As Udall left the hearing room, this reporter (then with McClatchy Newspapers) asked him how the Intelligence Committee found out about this internal review. The senator struggled to respond. “I don’t think I can say,” he finally answered.It was, in hindsight, an appropriately cryptic response.Parts of the Panetta Review, unbeknownst to the CIA, were already tucked away in a Senate safe. Committee staff had slipped some of the critical document out of the secure CIA facility sometime after June 2013 to protect it from the agency and locked it up in the panel's secure offices.Their motivation for doing so emerged when Feinstein made her dramatic public allegations in March. The CIA, she said, had a proven track record of hiding evidence it didn’t want its overseers to find and had even removed documents previously provided to Senate staff from their walled-off computer system at the CIA facility.The staffers, Feinstein said, had discovered the documents by using a search tool that the CIA itself had created for their use to sift through more than 6 million records relevant to the torture probe. They didn't want the CIA's own contradictory opinions to vanish. What Happened Next?Udall's question to Krass sparked a behind-the-scenes battle, with CIA personnel frantically trying to discover how the Senate had discovered the Panetta Review. It all burst into view when Feinstein took to the Senate floor. Warring criminal referrals were sent to the Justice Department -- one by the CIA alleging that Senate staffers had hacked into agency computers to find the review, and one by the CIA's Office of Inspector General saying that the agency may have hacked the Senate staff. The Justice Department declined in July to investigate either matter further. The CIA inspector general, meanwhile, performed a comprehensive review of allegations that the agency improperly monitored the committee’s computers. Those allegations were confirmed, and Brennan apologized to Feinstein in July.On the Senate side, the Office of the Sergeant-at-Arms was tasked by Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) with investigating the actions of Intelligence Committee staff in acquiring the Panetta Review: Was there a whistleblower? Did someone tip off staff to where the document could be found? Did the CIA accidentally dump the document into the massive trove of records that was given to the panel for the study? Or, as agency officials have implied, did Senate staff dig into CIA hard drives to find the document on their own?The sergeant-at-arms investigation failed to come to any conclusions on how the internal discussions wound up on Senate computers, in part because the investigators did not trust the computer records provided by the CIA.“The logs the CIA gave [the Sergeant-at-Arms Office] show all kinds of activity by Senate staff,” said a source briefed on the investigation. But the records provided were copies of the original computer logs, the source said, as the system was overridden at regular intervals throughout the committee’s five-year study. The fact that the records were copies raised concern over their authenticity, the individual said.  Another person familiar with the investigation said the Sergeant-at-Arms Office had the records for months but did not inform the CIA of its concerns until last week. When the agency was informed of those concerns, the person said, it offered to authenticate the records. The source said the agency has not yet received an actual request to do so, however, and all indicators point to the sergeant-at-arms investigation being closed.  Intelligence Committee staffers could, perhaps, shed light on the matter, but they have not spoken out publicly, and sources said they were not interviewed for the investigation. The Sergeant-at-Arms Office has declined repeated requests for comment on the matter.  The CIA Office of Inspector General did not examine how the Panetta Review reached Intelligence Committee staff because its authority is limited to the agency. The inspector general also determined that the criminal accusations leveled at the staffers by the agency -- that they had hacked into CIA databases -- were based on inaccurate information.Will The Panetta Review Ever See The Light Of Day? No one knows what will ultimately become of the Panetta Review.The Justice Department this week declined to provide the document in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.It’s unclear if some parts of the review will be included in the 500-page executive summary of the Senate's torture study that is released to the public. Feinstein has said that committee staff didn’t rely on the disputed document when writing the report. And the committee said it doesn’t have any plans to release the entire CIA document with the executive summary.   The CIA, which has read the entire Senate report, is expected to release a redacted version of a June 2013 response to the study indicating that the agency stands by its original objections, a U.S. official told HuffPost.Further complicating the Panetta Review’s fate is the possibility that Republicans will take control of the Senate -- and thus the helm of the Intelligence Committee -- in the upcoming midterm elections. Having often expressed their disapproval of the current staff’s actions in taking the document, Republican leadership could very well return it to the CIA come January.All this uncertainty remains despite the importance Feinstein herself put on resolving a battle that strikes at the heart of the constitutional separation of powers.“How Congress responds and how this is resolved will show whether the Intelligence Committee can be effective in monitoring and investigating our nation’s intelligence activities, or whether our work can be thwarted by those we oversee,” she said in her dramatic March floor speech.The public, of course, can still hope that the Panetta Review will eventually be declassified.But the more likely scenario is that it gets leaked.

In a press statement issued Friday, UltraViolet pointed to multiple allegations of abuse contained in an open letter published by the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund earlier this month against Karnes County Residential Center. “The Department of Homeland of Security has a rape problem, with a huge number of allegations of sexual assault being reported out of Karnes,” Karin Roland, organizing director at UltraViolet, told The Huffington Post. “They need to investigate this immediately.” The Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund wrote an open letter to Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier this month alleging that at least three employees harassed or abused ""numerous"" women at the detention center since August. The letter alleges detention center guards removed female detainees from their cells in the middle of the night to engage in sexual acts with them, groped them in front of their children, and requested sex in exchange for money or assistance with their immigration cases. After the women reported the allegations of abuse, the MALDEF letter says, authorities at the detention center failed to address the problem. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman declined to discuss ongoing investigations earlier this month when the letter was first published, but said the center had implemented protections against sexual abuse consistent with the Prison Rape Elimination Act. ""ICE remains committed to ensuring all individuals in our custody are held and treated in a safe, secure and humane manner,"" ICE said in a statement. ""ICE has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse or assault and our facilities are maintained in accordance with applicable laws and policies. Accusations of alleged unlawful conduct are investigated thoroughly and if substantiated, appropriate action is taken.""UltraViolet is circulating a petition demanding that DHS investigate the sexual abuse allegations. The petition had fielded more than 41,000 signatures as of Friday, the group said. The Obama administration is expanding the family immigrant detention this year due to an sharp rise in the number of Central American families crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said the MALDEF letter alleged three women had experienced abuse at the detention center. In fact, the letter alleges three employees had harassed or abused ""numerous"" women."

Four parked U.S. Postal Service mail trucks.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dba8200000f90101d49b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Postal Service has a reputation for being unstoppable. And while rain, snow and gloom of night can't stop the U.S. mail, the heat just might.The Council on Environmental Quality, the White House office overseeing environmental issues, released plans on Friday from 38 federal agencies that detail how they each may need to adapt to climate change. Some of the agencies' concerns are to be expected: The U.S. Forest Service is looking at the threat of wildfires, the National Park Service is assessing how parks might be affected and the Department of Defense is looking at effects on conflicts abroad. The Postal Service, however, has some worries of its own. From the CEQ: The Postal Service is concerned that increased flooding, rising sea levels, more intense weather events, and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns could disrupt its ability to provide mail service and increase costs for maintaining infrastructure. These issues could jeopardize delivery to Postal Service customers and the safety of the nearly 500,000 USPS employees who deliver mail and perform other critical tasks.The Postal Service's climate adaptation plan, which it completed in June, elaborates further, noting that major precipitation events and more days with temperatures that are hotter than average could pose challenges for their employees. And given that nearly 40 percent of the United States population lives in coastal areas, sea level rise driven by climate change could put many of the service's facilities and staff in risky areas.The Postal Service says in its report that it is currently reviewing its facility locations and making decisions about future leases and construction. It is also assessing how rising temperatures might affect its equipment. "
