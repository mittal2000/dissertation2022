For some of them, it is about taking the bible literally. The Hebrew word translated as ""virgin"" in the Greek actually means a girl of childbearing age, regardless of virginity, but it matters to some people that no man was involved in the conception of Jesus.One of the reasons the Virgin Birth doesn't matter to me at all is because I trust the God I serve would not be limited by the conditions of Jesus' birth. If the God who created the earth out of nothingness wanted the son of Mary to be God's own son, do we really think God couldn't make that happen?The more I read the news, though, the more I think there is another reason why the Virgin Birth matters to so many people. And that's what has me concerned.I think the Virgin Birth is primarily about purity for many American Christians. Unmarried women who have sex are tramps, sluts, and cheap. (Don't ask who they are having sex with or why the label doesn't carry over...) The Mother of Our Lord could not possibly be a slut, so that means she could not have had sex with a man before marriage.Of course, once a woman is married, she should have sex whenever her husband requests it, and the number of children she gives him will be proof of God's favor. (That's biblical family values for you. Literally).If you think I'm exaggerating about this, think about what Elizabeth Smart said about why she did not try to escape after being raped by her kidnapper (a situation I would hope even the most conservative people would acknowledge was not her fault).  ""I thought, 'Oh, my gosh, I'm that chewed up piece of gum, nobody re-chews a piece of gum, you throw it away.' And that's how easy it is to feel like you no longer have worth, you no longer have value. Why would it even be worth screaming out? Why would it even make a difference if you are rescued? Your life still has no value.""This young woman had been taught her value was tied to not having sex before she was married. Purity sure mattered to Elizabeth Smart when she was kidnapped by a lunatic and raped multiple times a day. Thankfully, she seems to have come up with another narrative and has moved on with her life.And there was a high school in Pennsylvania who offered this advice to their female graduates last week:So the boys are told to pull their pants up, which is well and good. But the young women are told ""you can't put 10 pounds of mud in a five-pound sack"". Super.Or the school that forced a girl whose skirt was shorter than knee length to wear an oversized yellow t-shirt that read ""DRESS CODE VIOLATION"" and oversized red sweatpants.Or take the Duggar family. Now that their oldest son Josh (one of their 19 and counting children) has acknowledged he molested multiple girls, including his own sisters, when he was a teenager, I can't stop thinking about his victims. Because they are being raised in a family who follows the teachings of a man who has been accused of sexual misconduct by over 30 women. The Advanced Training Institute was founded by Bill Gothard (who has since stepped down over the allegations of misconduct).Look at this ""lesson"" from its curriculum for homeschooling families.While this lesson predates Josh Duggar by many years, it reveals that the girls also held responsibility for their abuse. ""What teaching could have been given to each child to resist evil?"" and ""What factors in the home contributed to immodesty and temptation?""The ""answers"" to those questions by the boy in question (offered as an illustration? as a guide? ugh) included that because his siblings were naked when they got out of the bath, he was led into temptation and the home should have been more modest. You can read the whole horrifying thing here.When we place the responsibility to NOT be molested on the young children themselves instead of on their violators, or when we tell high school girls that at an awards ceremony people will be focusing on their ""sausage rolls"" instead of on the awards they are to receive, we buy into a myth of purity that women cannot live into.When we hold up the Virgin Mary as the example women are to follow, women lose. Because we can't be a mythical woman. We can't be modest enough. We can't be pure enough. We can't be virginal enough.We are actual women, embodied women. Made in the image of God women. Women who deserve agency about when and how they want to be sexually active.All of these situations show the dark side of American Christianity's ""purity"" culture and how it endangers women and take away from men the responsibility for their own behavior.""What does the Virgin Birth mean to you?""It means oppression, unrealistic expectations, and violence against women. It both distracts from both God's sovereignty and God's ability to work through the beautiful gift of human sexuality, leading people to have unhealthy views of sexuality. Was Mary a virgin when the Spirit came upon her? Maybe so. God knows. Should it matter to how we live our lives in faith? No.This post first appeared at RevGalBlogPals for The Pastoral is Political feature."

Perry was among the many speakers featured during this past weekend’sProduced By conference in Los Angeles, Producers Guild of America's. He opened up to moderator, Ava DuVernay about his entry into Hollywood. “I’m not the person to ask about racism in this town, coming from where I came from I never had to go through what I’ve heard a lot of people had to go through in this town,”  he said, according to Deadline. “I got into this town and I didn’t understand it.”The movie mogul went on to discuss how his upbringing in New Orleans prepared him for some of the frustrations familiar to those working in the industry. “I’m from the South where they tell you they don’t like your ass if they don’t like something,” he said. “This town, with so much madness inside, it will talk you out of what you feel is your instinct, what you feel you should do. The key is to learn how to be malleable and fluid inside a system that will constantly battle your instinct.”Perry has been listed by Forbes of one of the highest-earning men in entertainment, and his OWN original series “If Loving You Is Wrong” and “The Haves and the Have Nots’” have broken records for the network. As his projects continue to attract millions of viewers on television, Perry discussed the emergence of Fox's ""Empire"" in the television landscape.“In order to have the success of an ‘Empire,’ you have to have Fox. You have to have huge P&A, you have to have huge budgets for the show itself,” Perry said. “I’m pretty comfortable saying Empire's budget is six times what I’m spending on The Haves and Have Nots."""

Adding to the concert's surreal, heartbreaking circumstances, the audience included high-ranking Nazi officials and a small number of representatives from the Danish Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross  who had pressured the Nazi rulers to allow them to visit following the deportation of nearly 500 Jews from Denmark to Theresienstadt, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.The concert was ordered as part of an elaborate, sinister hoax staged at Theresienstadt, set up by the Nazis as a ""model ghetto"" to mislead the world into believing that it was not mistreating -- and murdering -- Jews and other prisoners. While the Nazis allowed some creative outlets at Thereseinstadt, there was no sparing of life; tens of thousands were sent to Auschwitz, including most of the members of the chorus who sang that night; other prisoners died of disease. Only 15 percent of the 141,000 prisoners there survived. Schacter died in 1945 on a death march from Auschwitz. But thanks to world-renowned conductor Murry Sidlin, his inspiration lives on.Seven decades after that concert, the now 94-year old Krasa, who endured deportation to Auschwitz and a death march, sat in Boston's magnificent Symphony Hall, as Sidlin led a production of Defiant Requiem, a multi-media concert-drama Sidlin created to keep the memory of this remarkable story alive. Conductor Murry Sidlin/PHoto by Jeff Roffman/Courtesy Defiant Requiem FoundationDefiant Requiem includes a full performance of the Verdi Requiem punctuated with testimonials of survivors, vintage footage from a propaganda film made by the Nazis, and the spoken words of Schacter -- the demanding leader who inspired them.Edgar Krasa/Photo by Michael J. Lutch/Courtesy Defiant Requiem FoundationAccording to Krasa and the testimonies of other survivors, the power of the music and Schacter's conviction sustained their spirits, against all odds. Singing the Requiem, Schacter told his chorus, was an act of defiance against their captors.""We will sing to the Nazis what we cannot say to them,"" he said.The Boston performance featured the Orchestra of Terezin Remembrance, led by Sidlin and the world acclaimed Tanglewood Festival Chorus, whose powerful voices were a perfect, heart-stopping pairing with the emotional weight of the program. Soloists included soprano Aga Mikolaj, mezzo-soprano Ann McMahon Quintero, tenor Marc Heller, and bass Nathan Stark. Award winning Boston-based actors Will LeBow and Jeremiah Kissel joined Sidlin in the program readings.The performance, postponed from the winter due to a Boston snowstorm, was dedicated to Krasa and in memory of his wife, Hana, also a Thereisenstadt survivor, who died only two weeks earlier; the concert was made even more poignant with the Krasas' son and grandson singing with the Tanglewood chorus. PHoto Michael J. Lutch/Courtesy Defiant Requiem FoundationIn a conversation after the concert, soloist Stark said performing with Defiant Requiem was an emotional and eye-opening learning experience. Having Holocaust survivors at the performances is so important,"" he remarked. ""You can't help but want to hug them. They're heroes, he said.In a phone interview after the concert, Jeremiah Kissel  said that while he's narrated many other performances by the Boston Symphony  - including holiday shows such as the Grinch Who Stole Christmas - being part of this production was particularly poignant because of the power and enormity of the subject.It was tremendously ""satisfying for an artist to go these places emotionally with the audience. We all go together, the chorus, conductor, soloists and every drum roll."" Seated in the bass section, he felt he was part of the orchestra.Courtesy Jeremiah KIsselKissel has become steeped in the history of Thereisenstadt. Last year, he performed in Brundibar, a children's opera that was also performed at the camp. The production was staged by the Underground Railway Theater  in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with an English language libretto by Pulitzer Prize winning writer Tony Kushner.Kissel noted the tremendous courage of those who performed the Verdi opera at Thereisenstadt. ""Here were these people going into the depth of hell, but as they went, they made it as beautiful as they could and using art to do it."" That story of how Sidlin created Defiant Requiem, his collaboration with Krasa and the founding of the foundation in 2008 is retold by Charles Munitz, of Boston Arts Diary, in a recent article in the Jewish Journal of Massachusetts.Krasa shared his experiences and friendship with Schacter in ""The Music man of Terezin: The Story of Rafael Schaecter as Remembered by Edgar Krasa,""  by Susie Davidson.Over these years, Sidlin has led some 29 performances of the concert across the world, including three performances at Terezin, according to the Foundation program notes. In 2012, the Foundation produced a film, Defiant Requiem, that includes interviews with Sidlin, Krasa and other members of the original Terezin chorus.The Foundation also extends its reach in tribute to other musicians at Thereseinstadt. On May 17, at the site of the former camp, Sidlin and the Defiant Requiem Foundation gave the world premiere of a new program, Hours of Freedom: The Terezin Composer.  A survey of the work of 15 of the dozens of composers who were imprisoned at Terezin, the concert includes live performances of music composed at Terezin, historic film clips and descriptive narration. Performances of Hours of Freedom in the 2015-2016 season will be announced soon. For more information, visit, the website for Defiant Requiem Foundation."

The latter might be summed up in two words: Citizens United. His regrets over that controversial 5-4 decision, handed down just months before he left the Supreme Court, are strong, and many.Stevens, who turned 95 in April, appeared recently at an event in Washington DC co-sponsored by the Alliance for Justice and George Washington University Law School. Introduced by AFJ President Nan Aron, Stevens was interviewed by Slate senior editor Dahlia Lithwick and Washington Post opinion writer Jonathan Capehart.Stevens demurred on several issues such as the benefits or evils of social media and citizen journalists: ""I'm not a good person to ask about that."" But on most points he was crystal clear.Regarding political candidates having ""a litmus test"" for potential Supreme Court nominees? Even as to Citizens United, ""it's a bad idea. But the (Citizens United) case should be overruled."" Throughout the interview Stevens referred to the case as bad for the country and the future, and damaging to the basic principles of democracy, ""which should be 'one person, one vote' and not (decisions hinging) on a bunch of money.""Asked by Capehart why he had changed from the conservative he was considered when first named to the bench to his later identification as a liberal, Stevens said, ""I didn't change, the Court changed."" Every member appointed from 1981-91, he pointed out, was more conservative than his predecessor.On electoral reform, another issue Stevens sees as imperative, he said ""some things can be done at the state level. The right to contribute (to campaigns, etc) should have some geographical boundaries. Excessive photo IDs have never made sense.""Stevens, in response to a question from Lithwick about ""bombast and aggressive, ideological arguments"" in the Court, said that ""ideology is not good. That's one reason I am against televising arguments, which would have an adverse impact on the deliberating process. I believe firmly in people knowing the institution, but not if it has an adverse effect on the institution itself."" Possibly because some member might be a camera hog, Lithwick interposed? ""Any one of the nine. And I would include myself.""Talking briefly about interactions among the justices, Stevens -- known to have had a close relationship with arch conservative Justice Antonin Scalia -- gave the impression that the Court does indeed function as intended. ""I think John Roberts is a very good Chief Justice,"" he said. ""He executes the duties of Chief Justice well, although I disagree with some of his decisions.""Stevens recalled stumbling over a few words while giving his dissent in Citizens United. ""I said to myself, 'You're not as articulate as you were.' And that's when I stepped down.""Fielding questions five years later, the renowned Justice showed no problem articulating his thoughts. Including the need for electoral reform -- and the need to overturn Citizens United."

A new post titled ""Letter from Lauren: June Shake Up"" revealed that the editorial team will soon say goodbye to terms focused on shapes and sizes:When we’ve talked about getting in shape in the past, words like ""skinny,"" ""slim,"" and ""thin"" have often come up. Starting this month, we’ll be banning any body shaming terms from the site, and replacing them with words like ""fit,"" ""toned,"" and ""healthy."" We try do to [sic] this for the most part anyway, but now we’re making it official! The word skinny will now be reserved for skinny jeans. My editorial team and I had a long talk about it, and we want to make sure that the focus is on being fit as opposed to a number on the scale. Every body is created differently -- and healthy bodies come in all shapes and sizes.It's important to note that many women's bodies are naturally thin or slim, but moving the aspirational quality from the words is a positive step. If people are making an effort to make healthy decisions, being skinny, slim or any other shape or size shouldn't matter.After hearing the news, women expressed their support on Twitter.As if @LaurenConrad wasn't already my idol...now she bans the word ""skinny"" from her site.

I hope @10CentsPerCup. Less than one cent per cup, as it has been, is exploitative!The German Chancellor Angela Merkel will this week host the G7 leaders in Schloss Elmau for what could turn out to be a decisive cup of coffee for the more than 250 million people in coffee growing nations whose livelihood depends -directly or indirectly- on the production of coffee. Most of them live in poverty while the coffee industry, with US $175 billion in global consumption value per year, generates tens of billions in added value, taxes and profits for the G7 nations annually.The German G7 presidency has put sustainability of the supply chain and insurance for developing nations against the consequences of climate change on the agenda of the G7. Chancellor Merkel said recently at a G7 preparatory meeting with labor organizations: ""we cannot pretend that working conditions in the countries we buy supplies from have nothing to do with us""  Those who will have coffee with Chancellor Angela Merkel are: Shinzō Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, David Cameron, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada, Francois Hollande, President of France, Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, Barack Obama, President of the United States, Matteo Renzi, Prime Minister of Italy and Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, representing the most powerful and important group of coffee drinkers in the world. The citizens of G7 & EU drink together nearly 1.5 billion cups of coffee every day. Those who produce the coffee, with great sacrifice and little in return, are not invited to these decisive G7 coffee dates. They will receive as payment for their coffee beans less than a couple cents from every cup of coffee drank by G7 & EU leaders and by the hundreds of journalists attending the summit.Whatever is agreed at the G7 coffee dates with Merkel will have a major impact in the EU-CELAC ""partnership"" meeting to be held in Brussels on June 10th and 11th and on the lives of coffee farmers, they are the weakest link in the supply chain. The outcome could be a watershed moment, until now both the G7 and EU have shown little interest in real shared value and prefer to overlook the human and social sides of ""sustainability"". They both support inefficient aid programs and ""Fair Trade"" systems that will never eradicate poverty. This can only be done by CHANGING THE EQUATION OF COFFEE or of any other product. As I wrote recently in The Guardian: ""If European politicians and consumers want to eradicate poverty, they should pay a compensation of @10CentsPerCup to coffee-producing regions"". The initiative @10CentsPerCup of coffee should be adopted by coffee shops, restaurants, hotels and institutions in all developed nations and by all coffee lovers who want to help eradicate the unacceptable poverty in coffee. If you love coffee... you can help eradicate poverty. Sustainability is about REAL Shared Value along the supply chain.  The supply chain and the shared value of every cup of coffee drank by G7/EU leaders is irrefutable evidence of an exploitative business model that perpetuates the poverty of coffee producers and keeps the lion's share of the benefits, taxes and profits in G7/EU nations. Germany for example has since the XVIII century had an anachronistic coffee tax, -similar to the one that provoked the Boston Tea Party-. It collects more than a billion euro per year, taxing roasted coffee at a rate of €2.19 per kg. and instant coffee at €4.78 per kg. The German coffee tax is an example of the lack of partnership and unacceptable ""shared value"". It can be called a colonial style tax on coffee .  Today, even if the coffee industry is booming in G7 and EU nations, less than one cent of every cup of coffee they consume helps eradicate poverty and bring economic development to the coffee producing regions. Sadly, this is also true of the coffee consumed at the Bundeskanzleramt, the White House, at 10 Downing Street, at the Elysee Palace, at the EU Commission and EU Council, the same is true in all the other seats of power. This is an appalling reality that must be changed immediately by G7 & EU leaders as a first step to demonstrating that they are seriously committed to partnership -as defined by the dictionary- and to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, as they claim they are with all their talk about Sustainability, Partnership, ""the European Year of Development"" and their ""aid"" development programs. I am creating CAFÉ FOR CHANGE and @10CentsPerCup because it is high time to CHANGE THE EQUATION OF COFFEE to solve the structural problems that the politicians and the largest players in the coffee industry have been ignoring for decades as if the poverty and exploitation of their suppliers was not their problem or responsibility, even if their work and sacrifice helps them generate tens of billions in profits and taxes in G7 and EU nations. Madam Chancellor, how many cents of every cup of coffee you will serve at G7 will help eradicate poverty in coffee growing regions? I hope, from now on, @10CentsPerCup.   To PM Abe, PM Cameron, PM Harper, President Hollande, President Juncker, Chancellor Merkel, President Obama, PM Renzi and President Tusk, I ask that: If you love coffee, you help eradicate poverty with @10CentsPerCup and supporting the creation of comprehensive insurance for the more than US$60 billion in coffee plantations and all coffee farm workers.

On Thursday, The True Cost premiered in NYC and I'm thrilled I got to be part of it. If you do one thing this week, watch this movie. I've never seen a more impactful, multi-dimensional presentation of the state of fashion. I love a good outfit, and that's especially why the movie has moved me. Whatever you hold dear in life -- great design; top-notch materials; clean air, water, soil; animals; mother earth; the wellbeing of your fellow humans; your very own health; self-expression; sustainability; innovation; profit; heirloom pieces; true craftsmanship; beauty... -- you'll make the connection between the issues of this planet and your point of power. As Livia Firth, executive producer of The True Cost, puts it: ""Become an active citizen through your wardrobe."" You're in charge because you vote with your dollars (euros, pounds, yen...). And it's worthwhile to remember that the fashion industry depends on you and me. If we don't buy, they're out of business. As an individual you have more influence than you might think; as a collective we can shape the world according to our desires. Questions is, what do we desire? While I can only speak for myself I feel I'm in good company when I say that I desire a fantastic wardrobe that's elegant, ethical, practical, well-made. Fast fashion doesn't meet any of these requirements (nor do quite a few designer brands, by the way). Quality all the way is where it's at. It's the trail to the gold. The bridge to better business.May The True Cost inspire you to look at fashion with fresh eyes. What you wear becomes part of you; make it worth your while.

8,FIFTY,My QEII Obsession,"Elizabeth A. Havey, ContributorBlogs at Boomerhighway.org.; Author of 'A Mother's Time Capsule'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-qeii-obsession_b_7486146.html,"Did you obsess about someone in your childhood or teenage years? Someone in the time before the Internet that you idolized with posters, newspaper stories or color photos from a newsstand magazine?",2015-06-02,"Britain's Queen Elizabeth II smiles as she arrives at Lancaster railway station in Lancaster, northern England on May 29, 2015, where, in her role as Duke of Lancaster, she visited Lancaster Castle and a local livery yard. AFP PHOTO / POOL / ANDREW YATES (Photo credit should read ANDREW YATES/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb674763c000032000d4c5f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Did you obsess about someone in your childhood or teenage years? Someone in the time before the Internet that you idolized with posters, newspaper stories or color photos from a newsstand magazine? Maybe for you it was Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Audrey Hepburn, Natalie Wood, members of the Rolling Stones, Jim Morrison, Bruce Springsteen? Or perhaps it was a sports personality.My obsession started with a photograph and it led me in directions that fed my love of history, my desire to read, write and ultimately travel. What? Not possible. No childhood obsession could do all of that, you say. Yes it could.When the June 15, 1953 issue of LIFE magazine appeared on the coffee table in our home, I asked my mother about the queen on the cover. All little girls know about princesses and queens from having read fairy tales. I knew about Cinderella and Snow White, but who was this lady? When my mother told me her name was Elizabeth, that sealed the deal. She had my name and that sent me on a long and fulfilling journey.And if you find that laughable, I get it. Being super-interested in someone, reading about them, cutting photos of them out of the newspapers and making a scrapbook with those photos -- it's all part of the obsession. Most of my peers waited a bit and then fell in love with Elvis (his first recordings occurred in the same year as the coronation above). I never cared about Elvis. And though my knowledge of rock and roll was wanting, I knew my history.  Searching the library for books on QEII led me to books on Elizabeth the First, who ruled England from 1558 to her death in 1603. The floodgates opened and I read about Henry VIII and the Tudors, then Spanish and French royalty and the wars fought, won and lost. The role of the United State's independence from England and the settling of this new nation also figured in my reading. And when traveling and looking at a map of the U.S. I could easily find the names of English people and places: Jamestown, New England, New York, Maryland, Elizabeth City and Virginia.An amusing story accompanies Virginia. I was in grade school and we were reading about the American colonies. One day, I remarked to my mother that Virginia was named after Elizabeth the First, the Virgin queen. ""But she was no virgin,"" I said. My mother stared at me. She believed I was her innocent daughter. And I was truly innocent of sex and all its ramifications. I remarked that Elizabeth the First was no virgin, because my definition of the word was garnered from my Catholic upbringing. To me, calling someone ""Virgin Mary"" just meant they were good and I knew QEI had waged wars and hung folks. But the comment to my mother immediately led to ""the sex talk."" Ah, more floodgates opening.And what did I want for Christmas one year more than anything? A 250-page work of black and white and color plates of QEII and her family -- entitled Undoubted Queen. It remains a precious possession that my mother found in the Marshall Field book department. That Christmas, I was one joyful kid.Of course the next step after reading and researching was writing. In middle school, I wrote to the queen, addressing the letter to Queen Elizabeth II, Buckingham Palace, London, England. The letter got there. Why wouldn't it? Her picture was on the stamp I used! There was a long waiting period for an answer. I had asked for a favor, one I am sure was asked many times. I wanted to be Prince Charles' pen pal. He was a bit younger, but I imagine I had dreams of becoming his princess. I got a lovely reply on beautiful Buckingham Palace stationery. Though the content was a form letter, it was signed by Lady Rose Baring -- a real person. Years later, I found her obituary on the Internet: Rose Gwendolen Louisa McDonnell, courtier: born London 23 May 1909; Woman of the Bedchamber to the Queen 1953-73... married 1933 Francis Baring (died 1940; two sons, one daughter); died Swindon 2 November 1993.And though there was always much reading and discussion of books going on in my home, it is also quite possible that my QEII obsession led me to major in English in college and to become a secondary level teacher of English. There isn't much distance between British history and English writers who have influenced American literature -- we speak the same tongue, though it's always amusing to draw comparisons between what the Brits call something as opposed to our word: ""boot"" for trunk and ""lift"" for elevator, to name two common ones.And of course I got myself out of bed in the middle of the night to watch Prince Charles marry Diana Spencer. The confusion and sadness that followed kept me checking on the Royal Family so that I have photo books of Diana tucked away with my QEII books and a plate that commemorates her marriage to Charles.Early in my life, I realized that I'm fortunate to be me and not some princess trying to live in the glare of publicity. I did meet a woman online who actually had a worse obsession. She wrote a book about her journey from the U.S. to England in the hopes of marrying a prince. Her plot failed. But I'm guessing that I am not alone -- that there are others like me who got on the QEII journey because of curiosity and interest and stayed there. If you are one of those people, comment. I'm certain I've met you in English gift shops as we purchase a memento of the royal family, something we could afford, something that smacks of a long and amazing history."
9,COLLEGE,Six Degrees to Skilled Labor,"Dr. Bill R. Path, ContributorPresident, Oklahoma State University Institute of Technology",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/six-degrees-to-skilled-la_b_7486326.html,"The idea that we can be separated into categories by our career paths into white collar and blue collar; professional and vocational; lofty and lowly; is almost absurd. In order for our economy and our communities to function and thrive, we need everyone.",2015-06-02,2015-06-01-1433182324-2925337-16635797753_5a07ea85b6_m.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-01-1433182324-2925337-16635797753_5a07ea85b6_m-thumb.jpg,"Through technology, the world has evolved to the point where we have many modern conveniences available to us, literally right at our fingertips. Our use of technology connects us to each other, but can also leave us disconnected. As we all rely more on computers and technology to perform more of our daily operations and tasks, it is easy to believe that our reliance on skilled workers has decreased. We come to believe that we are self-sufficient, but that notion is far from the truth. All of us count on those who work in technical industries and skilled trades all day every day.The smart phone, laptop computer or tablet we all can't seem to live without? They all need power, and that means they all need electricity. And while we take for granted that we can always charge our devices at the nearest wall outlet, there are thousands of people who work around the clock making sure there is a steady flow of electricity to our homes and places of work.In fact, every facet of our lives has been touched in some way by someone who has the skills and training in what some consider blue collar or manual labor professions. Let's just think about your smart phone for a moment. At the point of sale, you likely encountered a knowledgeable sales representative who assisted you with your selection and final purchase. What special training did this person have? When you opened the box and took out your phone for the first time, did you stop to think about the people who packaged it or shipped it? When you turned it on and began to inspect the default programming, did you give any thought to the individuals who wrote or loaded that programming? What special skills did they possess? Did you consider the engineering that went into the phone itself? After all, the phone didn't design itself; someone designed and manufactured it. Someone assembled all the necessary components, and someone supplied the raw materials. It was mass produced in an assembly process that used automated manufacturing systems that were customized for your specific phone. What kind of skilled trades person did it take to operate that assembly equipment and to repair it when it malfunctioned?You see, there are never more than six degrees of separation between those of us who are end users and the highly skilled workers who make our modern conveniences possible. According to a recent national study of workers by occupational category, blue collar workers -- those who identify themselves as laborers, skilled trade workers, service workers and technicians and repair workers -- make up more than 50 percent of the workforce in all 50 states. But even though skilled labor plays such a large and vital role in our economy, and in our lives, many of these professions and those who choose to work in them continue to be marginalized. In his book, The Mind at Work: Valuing the Intelligence of the American Worker, author and UCLA research professor Dr. Mike Rose studied why those in service and skilled labor professions are looked at as unintelligent and how those perceptions are wrong. ""I want to demonstrate the considerable cognitive demands of blue collar and service work and what it takes to do such work,"" Rose said in an interview with the Washington Post in 2014. ""Because of cultural and class biases, the dynamics of occupational status, and our current understandable enchantment with high technology, we as a society tend to underestimate and undervalue the smarts involved in such work.""Rose pointed out that those in the service industry like chefs and servers have to prioritize a number of demands from customers, management and the kitchen. Plumbers have to diagnose a problem just by feeling the pipes they can't see inside a wall. Carpenters need to know about mathematics to measure and build. Not to mention many people in trade vocations who work for themselves have to be familiar with economics and financial markets. The idea that we can be separated into categories by our career paths into white collar and blue collar; professional and vocational; lofty and lowly; is almost absurd. In order for our economy and our communities to function and thrive, we need everyone. We need people who run numbers and people who run water and sewer lines. We need people who can create computer programs and people who create and protect the network infrastructure for those programs. We need visionaries and problem solvers.It takes millions of men and women braving weather and injury to ensure our lights work, our water runs, our homes have heat and our cars get us from here to there. It's important that those who work primarily behind a desk in temperature-controlled comfort, safe from the elements take time to acknowledge and appreciate the work of those in the skilled trades. We are more interconnected than we realize.Photo credit: Sharon & Nikki McCutcheon"

Twenty-six thousand, four hundred and sixty-seven was the official attendance number of the sold-out crowd at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey, with many of the fans donning red, white and blue and chanting the names of players: Alex Morgan, Abby Wambach, Hope Solo and Sydney Leroux. Fans attend Saturday's USWNT match against the Korea Republic.  (Credit: Lucy McCalmont)It’s stark reminder of just how far women’s soccer has come in America since the women's last World Cup send-off game in 2011 against Mexico, also played in Red Bull Arena.The size of that crowd? 5,852.Saturday’s match wasn't an anomaly. The sport has been growing with record attendance numbers for the national team. It's enjoyed sold-out crowds for its two previous games, and 35,817 witnessed the U.S. Women's 4-0 victory over New Zealand at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri, on April 4, a record number in the team’s history.For the players, this year’s World Cup is an opportunity to take the momentum that largely started with the legendary 1999 World Cup-winning team and solidify the presence of women’s soccer in the U.S. permanently, with hopes that the enthusiasm may extend long-term to the professional and youth levels.“We don’t want to go through our group stage and get to Game 4 and Game 5 and lose, because that means what these fans have done for the last four years, and following us, and building the game and building women’s soccer -- it’ll be all for nothing,” team captain Abby Wambach told The Huffington Post.”So I want to give these fans something to cheer about and continually cheer about,"" she added. A World Cup victory could be a particularly bittersweet ending for Wambach, 35, who appeared in her first professional game 13 years ago and has played in all three iterations of professional women’s soccer in the U.S., starting with the first professional women’s soccer league, the Women’s United Soccer Association. She then played for the Women’s Professional Soccer league, then today’s National Women’s Soccer League. With her career winding down, she aims to add a World Cup ahead of her exit.Wambach, who joined the national team in 2001, has won three Olympic gold medals and taken over as the the face of women’s soccer for her generation. She's topped, and since long passed, Mia Hamm’s once-held record of 158 goals, netting 182 (and counting) of her own so far.And while Hamm jerseys may have been aplenty following the team’s historic 1999 championship and in the many years since, on Saturday it was Wambach, Morgan and Leroux's names on the backs of jerseys worn by girls, many of whom weren’t even born when former USWNT player Brandi Chastain made what has become the most iconic goal in U.S. women's soccer history, beating China 5-4 in a penalty shootout.  Brandi Chastain's unforgettable celebration following her game-winning penalty shootout kick. Nevertheless, long after Saturday's match ended, these young girls were kicking soccer balls around in the gravel parking lot just outside Red Bull Arena, surrounded by empty warehouses and in-construction condo buildings. There for every step of the sport’s transformation has been Christie Rampone, 40, the lone player still on the squad from the 1999 team. Rampone will become only the fourth player to compete in five Women’s World Cups, and has the “most caps of any active player in the world and second most in soccer history” with 305, according to MLS Soccer.Rampone acknowledged that players like Hamm, Chastain and Julie Foudy “paved the way,” adding that “they’re not forgotten.” She echoed Wambach on how critical the World Cup will be in continued success of women’s soccer. Hamm and teammates celebrate after winning the 1999 Women's World Cup. (Getty) “I want to leave this sport in a better place than I found it,” Rampone said. “And that’s the goal: to keep pushing and have these young kids to aspire to not only have the U.S. to look up to, but now they have a professional league, and there’s more opportunity for girls to go further past college.""Both women urged fans to tune into the tournament, which begins June 6 in Canada (the U.S.’s first group match is on June 8 against Australia), and hope the time zone will make it easier for viewers. The 1999 Women’s World Cup game had an estimated viewership of 40 million and just over 14 million watched the U.S. fall to Japan in the 2011 Women’s World Cup final.Rampone agreed that the 1999 team really resonated with fans, adding that “we had a little bumps in the way, where I think attendance started to drop.” She believes women’s soccer, however, is “heading in the right direction.”And she’s right. In addition to attendance records, women will be featured in FIFA 16 for the first time and USWNT jerseys will also be sold in men’s cuts and sizes for the first time.All this shows a vastly different landscape for women’s soccer in the U.S. -- and the roaring crowds at Red Bull Arena (with a noticeably higher pitch than most soccer matches) emphasized that point ahead of Canada. But for the women, they’ve hardly reached the finish line.  Alex Morgan celebrates after scoring a goal during a 2012 Olympics match. (Getty) “We could do something really special with this World Cup, and if we win it, it’ll be a major turning point in women’s soccer,” said midfielder Carli Lloyd as groups of young girls screamed her name from the stands.And one group of girls, just in kindergarten when the U.S. women’s team won in 1999, said they are heading to Canada next week, hoping to see history be made again. “Just growing up watching them has been incredible,” Kelly Westerman, 22, said.And whether it's from older fans of the 1999 team, or new generations aspiring to be the next Alex Morgan, Wambach said it’s the support that keeps them going. “For me, it makes even more special, it makes it -- makes me wanna play more, makes me wanna play harder, makes me wanna reach for that last ball,” Wambach said. “And I want to go off into the sunset with a world championship around my neck.""  Wambach celebrates with her team during a 2012 Olympics match."

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fd78260000300183c5d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the early summer of 1971 I received a telephone call from Wes Barthlesmes, a key U.S. Senate aide. He asked if I would to join him for lunch with a young Democrat from Delaware planning to run for the U.S. Senate against Caleb Boggs, the state's senior senator.  ""Who's running?"" I asked. ""Joe Biden,"" Barthlesmes answered. ""He's a New Castle County councilor."" ""How old?"" ""Twenty-nine,"" he said. ""Twenty-nine! The Constitution says you have to be 30 to serve in the Senate."" ""He'll be 30 by then,"" I was told.  I did some quick political math. Caleb Boggs was a Delaware political institution, U.S. Representative, governor, senator; a highly likeable guy, with no known enemies that I could think of. (I had gotten to know Boggs when I was press secretary to New York senator Charles Goodell, a fellow Republican, whose offices adjoined one another.)  For one of the few times in my life, I turned down a free lunch. It was pointless. What chance had some county councilor against the likes of Caleb Boggs? A mere sapling lost amid the lengthening shadows of a towering oak, standing large against the Delaware political landscape.  I've been wrong many times. Wrong about people. Wrong about politics. Wrong in ways I don't even want to think about, but seldom have I been more egregiously wrong than I was about Joe Biden.  The phone call from Barthlesmes, the invitation to lunch, was 44-summers past. But it came back to me when I heard the news, the terrible news, that Biden has lost his son, Beau, to brain cancer.   It started me thinking again about Biden, about our long friendship (while I was a no show at the luncheon, we would later meet). It reminded me that among the chattering classes of Washington and an often arrogant national media, Biden was mostly misunderstood. They didn't understand someone who would leave Washington at the end of each day to go home to Delaware, someone who would rather be with family and friends than attending fancy Georgetown dinner parties. But mostly I thought about his extraordinary qualities as a person, his great decency, of his transcendent personal values.  I'm not Joe Biden's best friend, but I know him well, and I believe to the core of my being, that in the whole of American politics, there's no better person than the Vice President.   When Biden lost his wife and daughter in a pre-Christmas car crash in '72, just a few weeks after his surprising election to the U.S. Senate, he wasn't certain he would take the job. He was, amid a huge political win and the most crushing personal tragedy, understandably traumatized by deeply conflicting emotions, he didn't know what he should do -- take the Senate seat he had won or dropout and stay home? His life had become the stuff of which novels are written and movies made; the type of improbable happenings that escape even the most imaginative writers of fiction.  Biden's ultimate decision to go to Washington was significantly influenced by the Senate's majority leader, Mike Mansfield, the wonderful man from Montana. Mansfield assisted others, family and friends, in bringing Biden through the necessary healing process; he would tell the young man from Delaware that the challenge of the Senate would help him overcome his grief.  The decision to become a senator came with a personal commitment, a commitment to his young sons, Beau and Hunt (who barely survived the crash that took the life of their mother and sister). The commitment was this: After the work of the Senate was finished, Joe Biden would leave Washington, board Amtrak at Union Station, and go home to family -- and he would do it every night through all the years of serving in the U.S. Senate.  A commitment made in a time of extraordinary personal loss, of unimaginable grief, but kept through better times, reveals a person whose ultimate loyalty is not to ambition alone, but to transcendent and lasting values -- to serve the people of your state and country, to keep the ideal of family foremost in your heart, mind and soul, all dramatically underscoring the character of Joe Biden.  While others preach ""family values"", Biden lives it. To know the Bidens -- mother and father, wife and children, sisters and brothers -- is to appreciate anew the meaning of family.  Biden, as a friend is also special. In the past 44-years he's spoke more than 15 times to the public forum I run -- The City Club of San Diego. He never asked to be paid (even when it was permissible under senate rules, and many senators were handsomely rewarded for their speeches). Neither did he do it because I'm a major contributor to his campaigns, I'm not. He's did it because, as he values family, so too does he value friendship -- even when there is no political capital to be found in that friendship.  For his many gifts -- keen intelligence, gift of camaraderie, and stunning ability as an orator (one of the best speakers in politics) -- the people of Delaware justly rewarded Biden by returning him to the Senate six times. But I'm confident each time a decisive majority of Delawareans cast their votes for Biden, their judgment was less about Biden, the politician, and more about Biden the person. They know their senators, as those of us who live in mega-states like California or New York, are never permitted to know ours -- and in knowing him, they know he is one of them.Tip O'Neil famously said, ""All politics is local."" Joe Biden has said, ""All politics is personal."" The Vice President is closer to the truth than the late Speaker.  To earn the trust of your constituents is a politician's greatest achievement; to keep it through four decades, even as cynicism has grown toward politics and government, is nothing short of remarkable. It stands as a tribute to Joe Biden, yes, but also as a tribute to the sound values and good sense of the people of his home state.  I'm grateful to Delaware for sharing Joe Biden with the rest of America -- and, as Vice President, the magnitude of that sharing is even now more abundantly clear."

Flags will fly and parades will be had. In many ways mainstream America will witness the media perpetuated stereotype of LGBT community.Of course all folks in the LGBT community act the way the media portrays them, right? Gay men will wear bright colors, feather boas and dance around in their underwear; while lesbians will wear leather jackets and ride Harley Davidsons through the streets. For years as a closeted man, I feared being placed in this category. I was a man, I was masculine, I could never dress in drag or wear eccentric types of clothing. Everyone would know I was gay and my life would be over. For a long time I believed in the stereotype and in many ways it drastically delayed my coming out process.However, over the course of the last two years something interesting has occurred. I began to embrace some of the practices that I was previously petrified about. I've marched in gay pride parades. My style of dress has shifted and my clothes are a little tighter. I enjoy a good drag show and spending the weekend on Fire Island, arguably the ""gayest place on Earth"".My attraction to specific men has also shifted. For a long time, I looked for men who fit the masculine profile. A deep voice, sports loving, beer drinking man is what I looked for. After becoming more active in the community, my mindset changed. I love hanging out with those who are different then me. I love talking about clothing and asking my boys which outfit looks best on a Friday night.Sitting on a deck in the Pines this weekend with a gentleman from Australia and a few other friends, we discussed gay stereotypes and how closeted men generally stay clear of such visuals. The conversation made me think about how pride festivities can really be stressful to some people who have yet to share their orientation. In many ways they fear rejection from their own community.I now feel a part of a community. I feel the pride of being a gay man. I love having such a great group of friends to spend time with. My advice is to find your comfort zone, now. Do not let society dictate your ability or desire to be happy. If you like to rock out to Whitney on a Friday night with no one around, then you should feel comfortable doing the same on Sunday with those who are willing and accepting. It will be amazing and you will become a much happier person."

I am now 33. Here are some things to consider when thinking about what rare disease means for your life. Photo credit: Rick Guidotti for Positive Exposure1. Always Remember: This Doesn't Change Who You Are Diagnosis of a rare disease seems to change everything. Your doctors' appointments become more frequent, family dynamics get more intense, relationships with friends get confusing, your outlook on the future changes and you begin to question whether this situation is changing your personality and character. However, these challenges actually strip away some of the everyday nonsense that creeps into all of our lives and bring you face to face with who you are at your core. Rare disease does not change the definition that you have for yourself; it helps refine the definition.2. Get Involved With the Community When I was first diagnosed with FA, my family and I couldn't even pronounce Friedreich's ataxia. We searched online and saw people in wheelchairs and read about symptoms like vision loss, hearing loss, and life shortening heart complications. In that moment we thought: Life is over. And our imagined reality showed us the worst possible scenario.  I lived in this imagined reality for several years, and I was reluctant to meet other people for fear that I might get a glimpse into a terrible future.  However, when I finally met others with FA, I realized that I had no reason to fear the future. I found out that people with FA are smart, funny, successful people just like everyone else. I began to reconstruct my imagined reality into an actual reality of what this disease might mean for my future through positive encounters with others in the community.  There is no doubt that it is a scary thing to meet others with the same rare disease. Sometimes, it may feel like looking into a difficult future. However, it is critical to construct an accurate picture of the future, so you can navigate your new landscape with confidence.3. Use This As an Excuse to Do Something Great A diagnosis of a rare disease is probably a socially acceptable reason to feel sorry for yourself. If I got really mad and locked myself in a room and just played video games for the rest of my life, people would question it and try to convince me that there is more to life, but there would be a certain level of understanding for my behavior. FA, like many unfortunate situations, is on some level an acceptable excuse to give up.However, it is also a perfectly acceptable excuse to do something a little outside the box, a little risky. You're going to be in a wheelchair soon, and you will likely die a premature death due to heart disease. Take a chance. Act with urgency. Use your circumstance as an excuse to do something great with your life.The disease I have, FA, is an energy deprivation disease. Cells in the body do not make enough energy to carry out their operations and one of the main symptoms is extreme fatigue. However, in 2010, I got together with three friends; John Lockwood, Mike Mellott, and Sean Baumstark (who also has FA like me) and participated in ""The World's Toughest Bike Race"" -- Race Across America (RAAM) to raise awareness for FA research. RAAM is a 3,000 mile, nonstop race from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic. Some might have thought this was not an entirely rational thing to do, especially when half the team is living with an energy deprivation disease. However, we do not view FA as an excuse to feel sorry for ourselves; we view it as an excuse to do something great with our lives. We had a film crew with us during RAAM and our journey is the subject of ""The Ataxian,"" a feature-length documentary hosting it's World Premiere on June 6th, at Dances With Films' annual festival in Los Angeles, CA. Photo credit: Blake Andrews, SLOtography.com4. Be Prepared for Change Many rare diseases such as FA are progressive and degenerative, -- they get worse over time. This means that you are always adapting to a changing situation and constantly figuring out how to work with diminished abilities. I went from playing sports and running around with friends to stumbling around awkwardly to part-time use of a wheelchair, a walker, hand controls on my car, and eventually, full-time use of a wheelchair -- all within about 15 years.   Transition to a wheelchair is one of the toughest and most dreaded transitions for someone with a degenerative neuromuscular disease. People going through this transition, myself included, try to delay it as long as possible -- and for good reason. Many times, FA is a ""use it or lose it"" situation, so the longer you make the effort to use those walking muscles, the longer they will remain. However, when I finally sat down in a wheelchair, I found out that it allowed me to accomplish much more than if I continued to try to walk. It conserved my energy so I could use it for the things I enjoyed like cycling. When I was still standing -- perhaps in a crowded room where I was being introduced to people for the first time, I was constantly scanning the room for the next thing to hold on to and worrying about falling over. When I started using a wheelchair, I could once again concentrate on making eye contact, having a firm handshake, and remembering names. My wheelchair is a tool that helps me get things done rather than an obstacle to be avoided.5. Get Over It! In all these transitions, it is important to stay objective. It is important to focus on the tools that will help you get the job done rather than what others think or what will it look like. Life with a rare neuromuscular disease creates many awkward situations -- you are going to fall on the ground in front of a group of peers; you are going to need to carry mail in your mouth so you can push your chair; you are going to have to scoot down the stairs on your butt and ask someone to carry your chair; you are going to lose control, hit a crack in the sidewalk, go flying and need to ask for help to get back into your chair. There will be many awkward situations...Get over it! If you are focused on your goals, then it doesn't matter what it looks like or if it takes longer. You are going to arrive at the same destination. Rare disease does not change your destination, it only changes how you get there.6. Keep Crankin' These thoughts are by no means a complete list. There are so many things to figure out, but when you are stuck, please consider the above tips. I hope they will relate to your situation and help you move forward. Once you build some momentum, there is no limit to what you can accomplish."

Greg Abbott (R) signed a bill Monday legalizing the limited use of marijuana extracts for severe forms of epilepsy.The law allows the use of cannabis oils that are high in CBD, or cannabidiol, a non-euphoric compound found in the marijuana plant, and low in THC -- the main psychoactive ingredient found in marijuana associated with the ""high"" sensation -- to treat intractable epilepsy. The state will oversee the regulation and distribution of the cannabis oils, which are only available to patients who have tried at least two traditional epilepsy medications and have not found them to be effective. The patient must also get the approval of two doctors before being able to take advantage of the new law.While marijuana policy reformers are critical of laws like the one signed today for not providing fuller access to medical marijuana, Heather Fazio, Texas political director for Marijuana Policy Project, still saw today as a historic moment for Texas.“While this program leaves most patients behind and we’re concerned about its functionality, today is one for the history books,"" Fazio said. ""The Texas Legislature is sending a resounding message: Marijuana is medicine. We commend our Texas lawmakers and look forward to continuing this conversation when the 85th Legislature convenes in 2017.”Abbot's signing makes Texas the 15th state to allow for limited medical use of marijuana-derived oils. Twenty-three other states have adopted broader laws that allow for some form of legal and regulated cultivation, sale or production of multiple strains of medical marijuana for multiple debilitating conditions. The federal government considers all forms of marijuana to be illegal and classifies the plant as one of the ""most dangerous"" with no medical value.CBD has been found to be effective not only at treating epilepsy, but also at stopping metastasis of many kinds of aggressive cancer and at killing cancerous cells found in leukemia patients. But critics of these limited CBD extract bills contend that while support for low-THC/high-CBD laws is growing, the laws are too restrictive, as there is research suggesting that THC may also be effective in treating epilepsy.According to the bill, at least three CBD oil-dispensing organizations must be approved by the Texas Department of Public Safety by Sept. 1, 2017, provided that at least three dispensary applicants in the state have been approved by that time.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story, citing an older version of the bill, misstated the state regulators' licensing deadline for dispensing organizations."

This marks Clinton's first major political event in New Hampshire after announcing her campaign for president a little over a week ago. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fcb33c000018010e03d7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Two Canadian banks tightly connected to promoting the controversial Keystone XL pipeline in the United States either fully or partially paid for eight speeches made by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the period not long before she announced her campaign for president. Those speeches put more than $1.6 million in the Democratic candidate's pocket.Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and TD Bank were both primary sponsors of paid Clinton speeches in 2014 and early 2015, although only the former appears on the financial disclosure form she filed May 15. According to that document, CIBC paid Clinton $150,000 for a speech she gave in Whistler, British Columbia, on Jan. 22, 2015.Clinton reported that another five speeches she gave across Canada were paid for by tinePublic Inc., a promotional company known for hosting speeches by world leaders and celebrities. Another speech was reported as paid for by the think tank Canada 2020, while yet another speech was reportedly funded by the Vancouver Board of Trade. But a review of invitations, press releases and media reports for those seven other speeches reveals that they, too, were either sponsored by or directly involved the two banks.Both banks have financial ties to TransCanada, the company behind the Keystone XL pipeline, and have advocated for a massive increase in pipeline capacity, including construction of Keystone. Further, Gordon Giffin, a CIBC board member and onetime U.S. ambassador to Canada, is a former lobbyist for TransCanada and was a contributions bundler for Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign.It is not immediately clear what the sponsorship of speeches by the two banks entailed. Did they pay upfront costs to tinePublic to cover Clinton’s fees? Did they purchase a large number of tickets to underwrite the event? The banks themselves were not helpful on that score.Ali Duncan Martin, a TD Bank spokeswoman, told The Huffington Post in an email that the bank sponsored a series of speeches by both Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton starting in 2008. (Bill Clinton received more than $1.6 million for speeches sponsored by TD Bank, according to past financial disclosures.) The bank was the “title sponsor or a co-sponsor of the events, with most events having a number of sponsors participating,” according to Martin. She declined to say how much the bank spent in sponsoring the speeches.Spokespeople from CIBC did not respond to a request for comment. One event invite, however, indicated that CIBC provided tickets the company had purchased to others. “Kindly RSVP to your CIBC Advisor and advise of any dietary restrictions,” the invite stated. Some details of Hillary Clinton's Canadian speechifying were first reported by independent journalist Ron Brynaert. The Clinton campaign did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.Clinton’s first swing through Canada started on March 5, 2014, with a speech that cost the Vancouver Board of Trade $275,500. While Clinton’s financial disclosure form reported the board as the payer, an invite to the event also lists “presenting sponsors” as TD Bank and Vancouver City Savings Credit Union. Following her speech, Clinton participated in a question-and-answer session hosted by TD Bank Deputy Chairman Frank McKenna. The next day in Calgary, Clinton gave another speech reportedly paid for by tinePublic at a cost of $225,500. McKenna also came along to interview her after the speech. Martin confirmed that TD Bank also sponsored this speech.In June, Clinton gave a speech in Toronto for a price of $150,000. The primary sponsor was TD Bank, according to an invite. Other sponsors included the Canadian Club of Toronto, Blakes Lawyers, KPMG and the Real Estate Investment Network. For the third time, McKenna interviewed Clinton after the speech.Clinton went west to the city of Edmonton on June 18 to give another tinePublic-paid speech for a $100,000 price. The chief sponsor of this speech, according to the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce, was CIBC. Victor Dodig, then senior executive vice president at CIBC, interviewed Clinton on stage after her remarks. On Oct. 6, 2014, Clinton traveled up north again to speak at a meeting hosted by the liberal think tank Canada 2020. CIBC, which is also a funder of Canada 2020, was the primary sponsor of this $215,500 speech, according to a Canada 2020 web page for the event. Lesser sponsors included Air Canada, the Canadian Real Estate Association, Johnson & Johnson, Ernst & Young, Stampede Group and Telus. Again, Dodig, by then promoted to president and CEO, handled the Q&A session. Over a span of two days in January, Clinton gave three more speeches -- one directly paid for by CIBC and two paid by tinePublic, but sponsored by CIBC. On Jan. 21, she spoke in Winnipeg for $262,000 and then Saskatoon for $262,500. The next day she spoke at that CIBC event in Whistler for $150,000 -- the only speech directly reported on her financial disclosure form as having been paid for by a Canadian bank. Dodig pitched questions to Clinton after each of these three speeches.CIBC and TD Bank both have large energy portfolios and have pushed for the U.S. government to approve final construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would link the Canadian oil sands in Alberta through the middle of the United States to Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. Since the Keystone pipeline is being built across national boundaries by a foreign company, TransCanada, it requires approval from the U.S. State Department. While serving as secretary of state, Clinton said that she was “inclined” to approve the pipeline. Since then, she has been mum on the issue, even as environmentalists -- with their major grassroots and money sway in the Democratic Party -- have made stopping the pipeline a priority.“Like all major banks, institutional investors, and pensions, we invest in the energy sector. On Keystone we are one of many financing partners,” TD Bank’s Martin said, adding that the bank is “not a fundamental shareholder in TransCanada.”Whether the U.S. government will approve further construction of the pipeline was a hot topic in each of the Q&A sessions hosted by the bank executives. And at every turn, Clinton refused to answer.“No comment,” she told TD Bank’s McKenna during that first speech in Vancouver. She further explained that it would not be right for her to comment while the State Department was still debating the project. McKenna returned to the topic the next day in Calgary, asking Clinton whether the delay in the approval process was driven by domestic politics. She answered that the review process is “very comprehensive” and that “it’s important not to let whatever that decision is on one pipeline color the potential for co-operation across the board between the United States and Canada on energy production and climate change.” In Toronto, McKenna continued to push Clinton on the pipeline, which she said should not “be a proxy for the relationship” between the two countries.CIBC’s Dodig also asked Clinton about Keystone at each of her five CIBC-sponsored speeches. In Winnipeg, she replied to Dodig’s question on the subject, “You won't get me to talk about Keystone because I have steadily made clear that I'm not going to express an opinion.” She did, however, express an opinion when asked whether the U.S. and Canada could work together to harmonize energy and environmental regulations. That idea has been pursued by Canadian energy companies and other Keystone backers as a possible trade-off for approval of pipeline construction.In Vancouver, Clinton told McKenna that she would consider the possibility of creating a group to work on regulatory harmonization and would “personally convey” the idea to those in power in Washington. She also noted the need for “greater symmetry” in the electrical grids and oil and gas supply lines of the two countries. TD Bank and CIBC's interest in the energy sector is not limited to the construction of Keystone XL. The two banks also support the construction of pipelines in Canada heading west to the Pacific and east to the Atlantic as alternative means of getting the country's crude oil into the international market. In 2012, they both published reports calling the construction of these pipelines a “national priority.”One of those alternatives is the construction of the Energy East pipeline, which would move oil from Alberta to ports in Quebec. But that plan by TransCanada is opposed by Gaz Metro, a Quebec-based natural gas company.It just so happens that Clinton’s only recent Canadian speech not involving TD Bank or CIBC was sponsored by Gaz Metro. According to her financial disclosure form, the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal paid her $275,000 for a March 18, 2014, speech. An invite for the event lists Gaz Metro as a sponsor, along with La Presse, CJAD radio, Loto Quebec, Osler Lawyers and the Montreal Gazette. The Q&A session was hosted by Gaz Metro President and CEO Sophie Brochu.The Gaz Metro-sponsored speech was the only such event at which Clinton was not directly asked about the Keystone pipeline. If President Barack Obama neglects to make a final decision on the pipeline in his last year and a half, the question would fall to the next president and his or her secretary of state.

You're funny, Pete."" - From the movie Moneyball""You showed me Just how to walk without your hands Cause Mom you always were The perfect mom"" -Backstreet BoysWalker Buehler was a key contributor to Vanderbilt's national championship baseball team last year. According to the Vanderbilt Hustler, Vanderbilt's student newspaper, Buehler is listed as high as the second best overall prospect in the upcoming Major League Baseball draft. Economics and baseball are going to be very important in Buehler's life soon. To quote a piece by Hustler sports editor Ben Weinrib, ""On the mound, Buehler is always calm, cool and collected. It's very similar to how he is off the field as well.""I've never watched the movie Moneyball, but I have read every book that Michael Lewis has written and Moneyball is my favorite. Lewis pointed out why college baseball players were better prospects than those who came straight out of high school. The older players have maturity and in Buehler's situation, he has been through the pressure cooker of winning a college World Series. Walker was drafted by the Pirates out of high school, but his Vanderbilt experience has made him a more valuable prospect and more likely to quickly help a major league team. But this story is not about Walker Buehler. It's about his mother, Karen Walker. Walker is a well-known trial lawyer and mediator in Lexington, Kentucky. Her children, Walker and Bella, age 8, are the driving forces in her life.""Mama said there'll be days like this,  There'll be days like this my Mama said"" -The Shirelles Two primary forces dominated my childhood in Northern Kentucky: Organized crime and single mothers. Northern Kentucky was run by the Mafia in the early part of my youth. At age 12, I met another kind of Hustler publisher, Larry Flynt, who had lived in the area before starting his pornography empire. My parents split after 10 years of marriage. My mother worked at a potato chip factory while going to nursing school. Her focus was to give my sister and myself a better life and keep paying tuition for my private school education. Her strategy worked. I've had a great career and one of my master's degrees is from Vanderbilt, one of the best colleges in the world. One person doing a job designed for two takes unique intensity and focus. Thus, I understand Karen Walker completely. She is intelligent, polished, charming and well-mannered, but if you mess with her children, you will wish you had the option of dealing with the Mafia instead. I adore Karen, but never want her mad at me. She is a trial lawyer and a mediator and frequently calls on me to help her clients. Our strong willed personalities can clash. Neither of us backs down easily, but we usually wind up on the same page. Karen is an excellent listener. And like my mother, Karen has the unique ability to have you come around to her point of view and make you think it was your own idea. The Trial Lawyer ""Oh, it seems to me Sorry seems to be the hardest word"" -Elton JohnOn a dark Kentucky street, an incredibly drunk college student from a rich, privileged and well-connected family went barreling through a stoplight and rammed into a poor, African American, single mother of four children. The jerk was not the slightest bit repentant. He bragged upon his ""feat"" on social media. She didn't die, but she lost her eye and her ability to get around easily. Her vision is really messed up. She has many other serious and permanent injuries that altered her life. The son of wealth and privilege could, and did, hire excellent lawyers and dug in for a long and difficult fight. The road to economic justice for the victim looked long and difficult. First, she had to fight the issues of being poor, a minority, unconnected and physically disabled in a legal battle where her opponent was the opposite. The victim also had to overcome a sudden ""posse"" of new ""friends"" around her, hoping for a quick settlement and hitting up their ""friend"" for some easy money. She had companies harassing her to borrow against her settlement before she even received it and later on, a barrage of phone calls from people trying to induce her to sell her structured settlement for pennies on the dollar. The victim had a lot of hustlers in her life. Some were street hustlers and some were billion dollar corporations. All looked at her as any easy mark. The client was smart enough to know that she needed an outside team to protect her from the hustlers and protect her from herself. To get the victim compensation equal to her injuries was going to be a struggle. To have the victim hang onto the money and improve her quality of life was going to be an even bigger struggle. Thanks to Karen Walker, the victim received a large, multimillion dollar settlement. Even better, the victim has been able to run all the people after her money away and use that money for herself. Karen had me involved with her client long before any settlement or verdict was possible. Karen and her client worked closely together to make sure every kind of economic device, such as structured settlements, trusts, counseling, hand holding and warding off of ""friends"" trying to get their hands on the money was in place, long before any money arrived. It's fascinating to watch how attorneys approach how they practice law. I've been doing it for 33 years and every attorney has a different strategy.Karen is a solo practitioner. She owns and runs her own business. She has for almost the entire time she has practiced law. A legal publication recently asked me to write a piece about financial wellness for attorneys, with a focus on people who run small firms. Karen was the obvious choice to be my coauthor. She handles her money well and spends less than she makes. When she gets a large fee, she does not go out and buy a racehorse (a very common move in Kentucky) or a fancy sports car. She puts some of the money in a structured settlement annuity to make sure that she always has cash flow to run her business and to put money away for Bella's college education.You can't count on all your children getting a scholarship to Vanderbilt like Walker Buehler did. Large injury cases, or any kind of legal case, is a little like playing high stakes poker. The longer that you can sit at the table and never get rattled or nervous, the more likely that the cards will come your way. It's also like poker in that you need a multi-part strategy. If a plan of action doesn't work, what is going to be the backup plan? Karen impressed me on all fronts. She was prepared to take her large case to trial and fight for as long as needed. She communicated with her client frequently and kept up on all aspects of the client's life. Karen never factored in what was good for Karen; all attention was focused on the client. The result was justice. And economic justice.The Mediator ""Come on people now Smile on your brother Everybody get together"" -Youngblood Karen Walker's fame and acclaim in the Kentucky legal community comes from her work as a mediator. Mediation has been a concept that has revolutionized the legal profession in the past 20 years. I've been well to over 1000 as a structured settlement and wealth transition expert and it is a very different dynamic than going to a trial. The idea is to get opposing sides to find middle ground and resolve conflicts that would normally go to court. Being successful in mediation requires very different skill sets than communicating to a judge and jury in a courtroom. The Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron of Kentucky mediators are Pierce Hamblin in Lexington and Brian House in London. They work on all the big cases, receive universal acclaim, are booked for months in advance, are first class human beings and do it all without taking steroids. They came into the mediation business as it evolved from their successful careers defending insurance carriers.Walker came into mediation almost directly out of law school and it has been her primary focus since then. It makes good economic sense as the steady stream of fee based work as a mediator balances her trial work, where cases can take years to be resolved.It also fits her personality. She can see all sides of a picture and not show a bias toward plaintiff or defense. One of my first times to watch Karen in action was a complicated, high dollar, multi-party mediation where one of the claims adjusters from New York City kept going out of his way to express his opinion that all Kentuckians were a bunch of yo-yo's. (I often run into claims people from New York City who think Kentuckians aren't very smart, even those of us with Vanderbilt educations.) It was one of those environments where it could have broken into a fistfight. Instead, Karen got it to be a settlement. It took many hours and many attempts at keeping all parties calm and at the table, but her patient skill set got it done. She was able to steer the argument away from the personalities and focus it on the issues at hand. A great skill set for a mediator and a great skill set for the mother of a potential big league star. The Baseball Mama ""Cause I'm your biggest fan No one I know puts on a show quite the way you can"" -Neal McCoy""Somebody told me when I came to Nashville Son, you've finally got it made"" -Waylon Jennings Karen and I are active on social media and the one thing you notice is that she never misses a Vanderbilt baseball game when Walker Buehler is pitching. She told me that her only ""vacation"" is going to Vanderbilt baseball games. Sometimes that means going to Florida or Los Angeles. Sometimes that means going to Hoover, Alabama or Omaha. One of my favorite moments was a game last year, where a television network had a split screen of Walker Buehler pitching and the intensity of Karen Walker rooting for him. Buehler appears on the surface to be laid back, but he seems to rise to the occasion in clutch situations. That competitive spirit definitely comes from his mother. Whatever city Vanderbilt plays in probably doesn't make any difference to Karen. Her world is going to be the baseball stadium in every stop. And then she races back to her law office the very next day. It takes a lot of focus and energy, but Walker seems to get it done. I wrote a best-selling book, Life Lessons from the Lottery, about the staggering number of people in every walk of life, especially professional sports, that run through their money in a short period of time. A star like Walker Buehler is going to attract big time agents and scores of people wanting to help him with his money. His father is in the financial business and very active in Buehler's life, but having a mother who has a keen legal mind and squeezes a dollar will take Buehler a long way. I watched Karen ward off grifters and fake friends of her clients. She can do the same at a major league level. Karen Walker is fortunate to have a son like Walker Buehler who has the rare combination of talent, intelligence and emotional maturity to make an impact in a major league way. Walker Buehler is fortunate to have Karen as his mother. In a world where baseball and economics will soon collide, Karen Walker has the unique skill sets to counsel her son as he enters the world of true major league: Moneyball.

I've had breast cancer in the past so am unable to take hormones, but I wake up nearly every night because of night sweats and have occasional hot flashes during the day.ANSWER: There are options for managing night sweats and hot flashes that do not involve taking hormones. Many women find that making some lifestyle changes can make a big difference. In addition, several prescription medications that do not contain hormones are available to treat hot flashes.As you mention, doctors often advise women who have had breast cancer not to take hormone therapy for menopause symptoms. But that does not mean you have to simply suffer through those symptoms.A good first step is to take a look at adjustments you can make in your day-to-day routines. For example, staying cool and lowering your stress can reduce the likelihood of hot flashes and night sweats. Some tips that may help include the following:Try to avoid hot, spicy foods, warm beverages, caffeine and alcohol, as these are common hot flash triggers. When choosing clothing in the morning, dress in layers, so you can remove a layer if you get too warm. Pick light, breathable fabrics.To minimize night sweats, make your bedroom cool and comfortable. Lower the temperature in your room and use layers of bedding you can remove easily during the night. Keep a small fan near your bedside, along with a glass of cold water. Some women put a frozen cold pack under their pillow, too.To lower your stress and to help you sleep better, exercise regularly. Other stress reduction techniques such as meditation, yoga, qigong, tai chi, acupuncture and massage can also be useful. When used during hot flashes, a form of deep breathing called paced respirations may also reduce your symptoms.Making choices to improve your health can make a difference, too. For example, along with other serious health problems, smoking raises your risk for hot flashes. If you smoke, talk to your health care provider about programs and resources in your area that can help you stop smoking. Your weight can also have an impact. Women who are overweight tend to have more hot flashes, so try to get to and stay at a healthy weight.If lifestyle changes are not enough to give you relief from hot flashes, you may want to consider taking a prescription medication that does not contain hormones. A number of options are available. For your situation, a drug called gabapentin may be a good choice. Gabapentin can also cause drowsiness, so it is often recommended for women who have bothersome night sweats.Other medications that can be effective include certain drugs that are approved to treat depression, but also reduce hot flashes in women without depression. Venlafaxine, escitalopram and paroxetine are examples of these medications. But be aware that you should not take paroxetine if you take tamoxifen for breast cancer.Some people tout nonprescription medications as being useful for reducing hot flashes. Be careful with these. In many cases, their effectiveness has not been confirmed. Some of them are associated with an increased risk of other health problems. The herbal supplement black cohosh, for instance, is sometimes cited as being useful for minimizing hot flashes. But it has not been shown to be effective, and it may be linked to liver damage.If you are interested in taking medication for your hot flashes, talk to your doctor about which one is right for you. It may also be useful to talk with a physician who specializes in women's health issues. At Mayo Clinic, specialists in the Women's Health Clinic are available for this purpose.

Somehow, in spite of that fear, we muster the fortitude and rally the forces to move forward with a deliberate plan for healing. We persevere even when the daunting obstacles we face make us feel paralyzed and full of doubt. Perhaps we are able to do this because we are hard-wired for hope.In her book Help, Thanks, Wow, Anne Lamott describes the power of hope this way: ""Hope begins in the dark .. .the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You don't give up.""In our more doubtful and defensive moments, we might eschew our own or another's sense of hope as we level the accusation, ""Oh, don't be such a Pollyanna!"" This phrase harkens back to the classic novel  Pollyanna by Eleanor H. Porter and the subsequent 1960 Disney film starring child actress Haley Mills. It's the story of a 12-year-old orphan, Pollyanna, who is described as a ""cheerful, optimistic youngster"" who doggedly focuses on the goodness of life. She is always ""glad."" She teaches a wide variety of doubters in her new community ""how to be glad no matter what.""When she suffers a paralyzing accident, the formerly resistant, crabby, decidedly un-glad community undergoes a change of heart. They come to her assistance by returning the optimism that she had shared so generously with each of them. Everyone is transformed in the giving and receiving of hope.Over the decades, in everyday conversation, the pejorative stance on being a ""Pollyanna"" translates to being viewed as a cock-eyed, cheerful-for-no-good-reason, goody-two-shoe. The research, however, does not support this cynical, bah-humbug attitude. Quite to the contrary, scientific studies have revealed a clear bias toward positivity in the way we communicate with one another.It began in 1969, when researchers, Boucher and Osgood put forth The Pollyanna Hypothesis. Their research included small-scale, cross-cultural studies, which suggested that a universal positivity bias exists in human communication. They uncovered evidence that positive words are not only prevalent, but have a significant impact and ability to shape our thinking and behaviors in a positive direction.Fast forwarding to this present year, in a study in the Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences, researchers confirmed the Pollyanna Hypothesis using an exhaustive, data-driven analysis of 5 million individual human scores. They concluded: ""Overall, our major scientific finding is that .. .words, which are the atoms of human language, present an emotional spectrum with a universal, positive bias.""When considered only philosophically, hope, more often than not, seems to be at odds with rational, analytical thinking. But due to its proactive nature, hope in action touches the heart and creates its own validation. A good example of this is found in the philanthropic work of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. In the 2015 Annual Gates Letter he wrote: ""Optimism for me isn't that things will get better; it's a conviction that we can make things better -- that whatever suffering we see, no matter how bad it is we can help people if we don't lose hope and we don't look away.""Hope and a positive outlook embody a creative and contagious quality. This can be seen in the work of the Los Angeles artist Mary Beth Heffernan. The images of the scary-looking suits that the health care workers on the front lines of the Ebola epidemic wore disturbed her. She felt that they made the selfless workers look like ""menacing, storm troopers."" She wondered how difficult it would be for Ebola patients to not be able to see a person's face for days on end. She believed that there must be a way to alleviate this problem.This hope led her to create photo kits. Her idea was to take a photo of the smiling health worker and then print the picture on large stickers. Each time the worker donned the protective gear, they would affix the photo sticker onto the chest of the suit. She relayed her idea across the world and succeeded in getting her photo kits to West Africa. Hope and determination trumped each setback and eventually the project started working. The photos have made a huge difference for both the suffering patients and for the tireless workers previously hidden in those massive, protective suits. The health care heroes are no longer faceless. The brave patients feel less isolated and alone because now they can see the warm, friendly human underneath the suits delivering hope.When all is said and done, we don't need scientific studies to prove to us the inestimable value of having, sustaining and sharing hope. For those of us working hard to improve our health, in spite of huge challenges, hope forms an indispensable infrastructure of internal love and support. Hope tends to beget more hope. By keeping hope alive within us, we are automatically inducted into the Pollyanna Hall of Fame. There we join ranks with Bill Gates and Mary Beth Heffernan and countless others who are determined to bring life and light into places of loss and darkness. It starts with our own hearts.How do you keep hope alive during challenging times?This article was originally published on Ornish Living."

25,PARENTS,8 Ways Pinterest Changed Parenting Forever,"Jenny Evans, ContributorMother of 6, blogger at UnremarkableFiles.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/8-ways-pinterest-changed-parenting-forever_b_7468600.html,"In simpler times, you could call up your BFF from the OB's office after your ultrasound and tell her the gender of your baby. Now, people can only learn the gender when you release a giant box of pink or blue balloons that float up to heaven and later deflate to choke a baby seal.",2015-06-01,2015-05-29-1432924451-5805207-8wayspinterestchanedparentingforever.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-29-1432924451-5805207-8wayspinterestchanedparentingforever-thumb.jpg,"1. Throwing a birthday party is freaking exhausting. Forget playing a simple game of ""pin the peg leg on the pirate"" at my kid's 6th birthday. Thanks to Pinterest, I know he won't have a happy birthday unless I decorate 10 large cardboard boxes to look like 18th century pirate ships and stage a treasure hunt spanning the entire neighborhood. Each game station must be marked with cardstock printables in coordinating colors and an authentic-looking seaworthy font.For refreshments, I'd better be using tiered cupcake stands to display the fresh fruit kabobs I've speared with 100 toothpick-sized skull-and-crossbones flags I made myself, right beside the watermelon I've cut up to look like a shark. If I don't, what will the other 6-year-olds at the party think?Don't even get me started on the props for the pirate photo booth.2. You have to throw a party to tell me if you're having a boy or a girl. In simpler times, you could call up your BFF from the OB's office after your ultrasound and tell her the gender of your baby.But what you really need is a gender reveal extravaganza complete with pick and blue refreshments and team games to guess the sex of the baby-to-be. People can only learn the gender when you release a giant box of pink or blue balloons that float up to heaven and later deflate to choke a baby seal.Let's just hope the ultrasound tech was accurate.3. All our parenting advice comes packaged in numbered lists. And it's accompanied by a pinnable cover image (like the one above! I have a disease.)Just click the stock photo of the happy child, or the grumpy child, or the sleeping child on a clean white background and you'll find THE most important piece of parenting advice you'll ever get.Can you really live without knowing the 10 things you should never say to your children, the 8 ways to get your kids to listen or the 14 lessons every mother should teach her daughter? I don't think so.4. Halloween costumes are serious business. When I was a kid, I dressed up as a hobo for three consecutive years. Fingerless gloves, dad's oldest flannel shirt and some dirt smudges on my face and I was a respectable (if not altogether politically correct) bum. At the time, I don't think I appreciated how much work this saved my lucky pre-Pinterest parents.Yes, I'll often make or buy some elements of my kids' Halloween costumes, but my favorite years are the ones when they take something out of the dress-up box and be that.Sorry, Pinterest, I love my son, but I don't have the time to fashion an elaborate scuba diver costume out of duct tape hooked up to fake oxygen tanks which are really silver spray-painted two-liter bottles. He can just be a hobo.5. Complete parenting hack overload. I'm drowning in an ocean of parenting hacks so vast that I will never be able to claw my way out to do something terribly ordinary, like make my kids grilled cheese. I get so stressed out by the ""parenting hack"" deluge that hits me every time I log onto Pinterest!What if I don't want to glue magnets on plastics cups to put on the fridge for my kids' drinks? Or cut stickers in half to put inside each pair of their shoes to tell left from right? Or make my own preservative-free sidewalk chalk in deodorant containers so the kids can easily grip and swivel?I just don't want to do it.6. Your car has to be organized. The inside of our minivan looks like a compost heap for most of the year, and I don't feel too bad about that -- except for when I get on Pinterest.According to Pinterest, I need to have a little trash bin for the car, an organized over-the-seat caddy filled with sunscreen and Clorox wipes and each kid should have their own color-coded activity bucket within arm's reach.But you know what? I like having a messy car. It means that if we're ever stranded for a few days in the desert in our broken-down vehicle, we won't starve to death because there are two pounds of pretzels and Goldfish crackers hidden in them thar seat cushions.7. Chore time is a lot of hard work -- for parents. It used to be that you could just tell your kids to unload the dishwasher when you wanted a chore done. But those were less enlightened times. How can a child possibly be expected to do her work without an attractive and whimsical chart to remind her?Here's how to make a Pinterest-worthy chore chart in 5 easy steps.Step 1: Find a wooden pallet.Step 2: Pry apart, nail planks together and apply three coats of magnetic paint.Step 3: Use a stencil to write out the chores. Painstakingly emboss each letter with glitter.Step 4: Make a ""done"" and ""not done"" column, then buy cute little magnets for the columns at Michael's and spend all afternoon covering them in washi tape.Step 5: Child still does not unload the dishwasher.I think you get my drift.8. You can't just play outside anymore. I love the Little House on the Prairie books because the girls went outside and had a tea party with rocks, leaves and sticks and they had a grand old time. Do kids go outside and just play with sticks anymore? Because it seems like expectations are higher now, at least on Pinterest.No summertime fun will be had unless you break out the power tools and spend two weeks shopping for and constructing something that's impossible to store over the winter. If you can't build your kids a giant obstacle course out of PVC pipe and pool noodles in the backyard, don't even bother going outside.Let's not even talk about the mosaic stepping stones I decided would be ""fun"" to make with the kids that have been sitting half-finished in the basement since last summer.Jenny Evans is a writer, a perfectionist, a night owl and a Mormon mom of five who makes jokes at her own expense and blogs about her messy life with a houseful of kids at Unremarkable Files.You can also visit her on Facebook."

This was the last semester of her high school career, and nothing was going according to plan. I'm not sure what I envisioned when she was a little girl, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't this.  My daughter didn't enjoy high school. In fact, she found the whole process ridiculous. I couldn't relate to this at all. My high school years were a blast, with football games, parties, friends and fun. Her experience was the polar opposite. She started at an all-girls Catholic school that we worked hard and paid big for her to attend. After two years, she realized it was not for her. She felt mediocre, her group of friends fell apart and it seemed unbearable for her to return. She really wanted to try public school, and so she did. Sadly, public school in Los Angeles is quite the gamble. We went all in and lost. There was no consistency, the administration was uncaring and her student body was one that the teachers had to spend more time policing than teaching. Without a doubt, this is not what we had hoped for. She had no solid group of friends, no potential suitors and no extra-curricular activity that enticed her. When it was time to apply to college and take the SAT's, we realized she was not quite ready for certain things. There would not be enough time to prepare better for the test or raise grades that suffered in the transition. Let's just say the Ivy League was way out of the question.What we learned in the process was actually not so bad. From where we sit today, I feel like she is doing better than many of her peers. She made a plan for herself and is sticking to it. She survived senior year and got her diploma. There was no prom, no walking graduation, no hoopla. In our case, prom photos and graduation hats would have been for me, not her. Instead of all the traditional things associated with school and graduation milestones, I bought her a special locket she will wear far longer than a class ring. We created our own graduation announcements and we planned a trip to NYC to see two shows instead of a family graduation celebration. After all, this is her life, and school itself is not her source pride -- her own interests and accomplishments are.   Photography has been her passion since her 16th birthday. Instead of having a party, she begged for a Canon Rebel T-3i. She proved to herself, and everyone around her, the abundance of her potential. She frequents Disneyland, and used that bustling canvas of beautiful scenery and people to hone her skills. She is already so good she has been hired to shoot two weddings, and has a third this summer.She enrolled at a community college, where she will major in photography. This sounds like a failure to so many people, and she felt the same way at first. After reading many beautiful articles and blogs about how the expense of major universities is crippling the average family, I changed my focus. I continued to remind her that this is HER journey. She decides, she makes the decisions and she will succeed according to her plan and her timeline. She is moving out into an apartment with friends, is gainfully employed and will be registering for junior college where she will attend, tuition-free, in the fall. Not a bad start, don't you think? The world is her oyster. I've read many pieces reminding me the value of community college. Some of the most successful CEO's in our country started at community college. I can't stress enough how much this does NOT feel like a failure or a setback. Our kids are on a journey, and each one is as unique as their own DNA. Supporting their dreams is our only job. Not all of them need, or want, to go to Harvard. When we become OK with this, they fly. I'm confident my girl with not just fly, but soar towards great things.
