In a report released Thursday, the CBP warns that body cameras could be ineffective, costly and damaging for morale. (An earlier draft of the report was leaked to the media last week.) The Obama administration has urged local law enforcement to use body cameras as a way to keep police officers accountable. Those same concerns apply to CBP, which had 768 recorded incidents of use of force last year. But the federal government doesn't yet have its own guidelines regarding the use of body cameras, leaving CBP and other nationwide law enforcement agencies off the hook.CBP's report suggests that, among other disadvantages, officers may view required body cameras as a signal that the agency does not trust them, which could affect morale.However, CBP Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske said Thursday that the decision should not be interpreted as ruling out body-worn cameras. He noted that the specific cameras tested as part of the review were deemed unworkable for Border Patrol agents, whom CBP officials said may be out on motorized vehicles for 10 hours at a time in high temperatures and other conditions that can cause the cameras to function improperly. Kerlikowske stressed that CBP, which has about 21,000 Border Patrol agents and 24,000 officers who work at official ports of entry, does not oppose cameras. He said the agency operates more than 7,500 cameras -- not necessarily body cameras -- at ports of entry to the U.S., and more than 1,200 elsewhere.He pointed out that CBP has seen the value of cameras, citing a report last year alleging that an officer in Alaska drew a gun on a Boy Scout. After a review that included video footage, investigators cleared the officer and said they could not find evidence that the claim was true.In the upcoming months, Kerlikowske said, the agency will test other types of cameras to see if they work better. In addition, CBP will review dashboard cameras and fixed cameras that are already in use.One potential challenge is working with unions, which Kerlikowske said would need to be consulted before the agency could implement a change like requiring body cameras.""We'll work through it both from a technological standpoint and from a negotiation standpoint, but the goal is to employ body cameras where they would be most useful and helpful,"" he said.CBP officials did not give a precise timetable for completing the review, although they said the first steps would be completed by March 2016. They also were unable to estimate the cost of the effort, but said it could be in the ""tens of millions"" of dollars.Activists who support body cameras on CBP agents were critical of the announced delay.""If CBP was as serious as it says it is about transparency and accountability, the agency would prioritize the deployment of body-worn cameras to all its field personnel immediately,"" Terri Burke, executive director of the ACLU of Texas, said in a statement.Jacinta Ma, director of policy and advocacy at the National Immigration Forum, called for ""greater urgency"" on the issue. National Immigration Forum recently published a report arguing that body cameras on CPB officers would promote accountability, security and transparency.

8,POLITICS,Ted Cruz Goes After Marco Rubio On Immigration,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-ted-cruz-immigration_us_5644ee00e4b08cda3487ffd0,Rubio's fighting back.,2015-11-12,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), left, has criticized Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) over immigration as they compete for the Republican presidential nomination.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5644ef50180000f000304946.jpeg?cache=IQc25CdgEg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential candidate and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is increasingly coming under fire from his GOP opponents over immigration reform -- something that could make it harder in months to come for him to get away with vague responses about deportations. Rubio has long been a master of talking points on immigration. He supports ""enforcing the law"" and opposes ""amnesty."" During his bid for the presidency, he's said border security must come first and that he'd end programs that block people from deportation. But his record includes helping draft and push through a 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill, and fellow candidate and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) isn't letting him forget it. ""My reaction in all of politics is talk is cheap,"" Cruz said of Rubio Thursday on Laura Ingraham's radio show. ""That you know where someone is based on their action. ... When politicians say the exact opposite of what they've done in office and I'd treat that with a pretty healthy degree of skepticism.""Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), another presidential contender, have both ramped up criticism of Rubio over the 2013 ""gang of eight"" bill, which was drafted by Rubio, three Republicans and four Democrats. Cruz, who voted against the bill, said at a Wednesday town hall that it rendered Rubio indistinguishable on the issue of immigration from Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. ""That is a path to losing,"" Cruz said.Paul, speaking to Ingraham on Thursday, accused Rubio of working with Democrats on the gang of eight to keep out conservative measures.""Rubio went along with [New York Democratic Sen.] Chuck Schumer and there was a secret deal made. They voted en bloc against every conservative reform that was brought forward,"" said Paul, who also voted against the bill.The dispute is over whether Rubio's more recent veer to the right is genuine, and whether he can be trusted. But his words can be interpreted different ways. Democrats can accuse him of flip-flopping. People like Cruz and Paul can make the case that he is too soft on undocumented immigrants because the Senate bill would have allowed many of them to remain in the country and eventually gain citizenship. But how deportation policy functions is much more complicated than simply enforcing the law versus ignoring it. One of the biggest questions is over prosecutorial discretion, or the need for law enforcement officials to prioritize some people over others given limited resources. That principle was the justification for the Obama administration's decision to instruct agents to prioritize recent border-crossers, individuals convicted of serious crimes and national security threats -- a move criticized by Republicans. It was also the basis behind the creation of deferred action programs, which Rubio and other Republicans have vowed to end.Most candidates have said broadly that immigration laws must be enforced and that President Barack Obama's policies are at best misguided, at worst unconstitutional. But they haven't been all that specific on how their administrations might apply prosecutorial discretion, if at all. There are 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have said they have the resources to deport about 400,000 per year. If the candidates want to indiscriminately deport everyone without prioritizing, they'd need a lot more money or could risk expending resources on people who came to the U.S. as children, or other longtime residents, when they could be using that funding to go after criminals and other potential threats.Mass deportation is the stance Republican candidate Donald Trump has taken -- albeit without giving many specifics either, other than to say he would mimic a 1950s-era program called ""Operation Wetback"" that led to the expulsion of more than a million people, but also the deaths and removal of U.S. citizens. Rubio has left himself wiggle room on deportations. He's said mass deportation would be impossible and that some people should gain legal status, but also hedged on whether the people he hopes to deny deportation relief to should actually be deported. Wednesday on CBS's ""This Morning,"" Rubio was asked specifically whether he thinks people who would benefit from Obama's yet-to-be-started Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents policy should be deported. ""We need to enforce our law, and I do not support DAPA,"" Rubio said. ""It's unconstitutional, it's the wrong way to do this, and quite frankly, we need to begin to enforce our immigration laws in this country or we don't have immigration laws.""That could be interpreted as a yes. In effect, though, it could just mean Rubio wants to nix Obama's policies and continue deportations -- which isn't the same as calling for those would-be beneficiaries to be rounded up and deported, particularly when he says he wants a bill that would allow some undocumented immigrants to stay.Cruz has railed against a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but he, too, has previously left the door open to allowing some of them to stay in the country legally. Paul has called for legal status for certain undocumented immigrants, too.Rubio took advantage of that point on Thursday, when he said that he and Cruz have ""almost all the same views on immigration,"" according to The Washington Post. ""Ted is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally,"" Rubio said. ""In fact, when the Senate bill was proposed, he proposed giving them work permits.""Roque Planas contributed reporting.Also on HuffPost:"

In an article published Thursday, the paper wrote:Mr. Trump called it a “terrible deal,” though it wasn’t obvious that he has any idea what’s in it. His one specific criticism was its failure to deal with Chinese currency manipulation. But it took Rand Paul to point out that China isn’t part of the deal and would be happy if the agreement collapsed so the U.S. would have less economic influence in Asia.Trump defended himself, saying the paper should have reached out to him for comment or clarification.Wall Street Journal Editorial Page Editor Paul Gigot defended the piece.""We stand by the editorial, which is accurate, though Mr. Trump is welcome to write a letter to the editor in response,"" he said in an emailed statement to HuffPost.

""I understand why they are coming up but maybe it's a British thing. I don't like talking about money; it's a bit vulgar isn't it?"" Winslet’s hardly alone in feeling uncomfortable talking about money. Most people would rather talk about their sex life than their salary, Elizabeth Weingarten recently pointed out at a conference about the gender pay gap held at the Harvard Club in New York. ""Asking my mom how much my dad made was harder than asking her about sex,"" said Weingarten, a deputy director of the New America Foundation who wrote a lengthy piece on salary transparency published in this month’s More magazine.And just like parents need to have that awkward sex talk with their kids, coworkers need to have that same awkward pay talk with each other.

At his company salary information is public to all employees, which makes hiring and negotiations fairly simple, he said.It's getting easier to figure out how much people make, thanks to companies like SumAll that are taking the transparency tack -- Whole Foods also practices pay transparency -- and, especially due to websites like GlassDoor and Payscale, which publish self-reported salary information.Women, across the board, still make 78 cents for every dollar a man makes, according to federal data. Even when you control for other factors -- like experience and industry -- women still are paid less than men, from CEOs to cashiers. It’s even worse for black and Hispanic women.In the public sector and in unionized jobs, where pay is publicly known, the pay gap is lower -- 89 cents and 91 cents respectively, Weingarten points out in her article. Lily Ledbetter, a manager in a Goodyear plant in Alabama, was paid less than the male managers who worked alongside her for decades -- until, finally, someone dropped her an anonymous note telling her what was going on. She sued and her case went all the way up to the Supreme Court. Though she lost, her fight inspired a federal law that makes it easier for workers to sue their employers for pay discrimination.Even though the issue had been litigated at the nation’s highest court and discussed by the president, the issue of gender pay discrimination didn’t really take off until extremely good-looking Hollywood actors took up the battle-cry.Leaked documents in the Sony hack last spring revealed that Jennifer Lawrence was being paid less for her work in the movie ""American Hustle"" than her male co-stars, or “the lucky people with dicks,” is how she put it in a recent essay. The hack also revealed a pay gap between male and female Sony executives. Actor Charlize Theron used the information from the hack to negotiate a better payday for herself.Arming yourself with information about pay makes you better able to negotiate a deal for yourself, Deborah Kolb, the author of Negotiating at Work: Turn Small Wins Into Big Gains, told The Huffington Post recently. “If you have good information when you ask for a raise ... that’s a good thing,"" said Kolb, who is a professor emerita at Simmons College and advises female executives on negotiations and pay. Women do better at negotiating pay when they have actual salary information, according to a couple of studies. The information can be particularly useful when you're negotiating your pay at a new job. It’s trickier to ask your current employer for a raise after learning you're paid unfairly, but there’s a smart way to do it, Kolb said. You want to frame the issue as a systemic problem. “I might say to my boss, ‘Can we look at the compensation in our group? I think that might be an issue.'” Frame it as a company problem, not a personal problem, Kolb advises. A former Google employee recently revealed that she had created a spreadsheet for workers at the tech giant, where a few of them shared their pay information. The document exposed some discrepancies, she said. And ultimately the company gave out raises. Knowledge may be power, but talking about how much you make isn't so easy. Explaining that she’s lucky and happy with her pay -- which is obviously legions above what most people make -- Winslet said, “it seems quite a strange thing to be discussing out in the open like that.”But as J.Law showed, public figures like Winslet do the most good when they get over their embarrassment about their big paychecks and talk about pay fairness.Weingarten said that when she asked the experts who were advocating for pay transparency how much they make, none of them would say.And even though I'm writing about it, I admit I'm a little queasy at the thought of telling the guy next to me how much I make (sorry Ben!)Still, telling your coworkers how much you make is not illegal. Salary talk between colleagues is protected by a depression-era labor law. So, if you feel like you're not getting paid what you're worth it's in your best interests to start asking around. Transparency alone, of course, won't solve the gender pay gap -- but it certainly doesn't hurt. "

""I was kind of caught off guard because I didn't think that anything like that would happen anymore.""On Tuesday, Judge Scott Johansen, of the state's Seventh District, ordered the removal of the one-year-old and placement into the care of a heterosexual couple for the child's wellbeing, the Associated Press reported.Hoagland said the juvenile court judge cited research in the courtroom that children do better when they are raised by heterosexual couples. She said when he was asked to produce his research, the judge said, ""he would not.""""I believe that it's a religious belief,"" she said of Johansen's decision.The married couple -- who are already raising Peirce's two children, ages 12 and 14 -- told KUTV that they have passed home inspections, background checks and interviews from the state's Division of Child and Family Services. They said the baby's biological mother also wants her child to stay with them.""It's not fair and it's not right and it just hurts me really badly because I haven't done anything wrong,"" Hoagland said.The couple isn't alone in their disbelief.Democratic presidential candidate hopeful, Hillary Clinton, voiced her opinion on the issue on Wednesday in a tweet with a link to the story.""Being a good parent has nothing to do with sexual orientation -- thousands of families prove that,"" she wrote.The Human Rights Campaign also dove into the discussion. ""Removing a child from a loving home simply because the parents are LGBT is outrageous, shocking, and unjust,"" Chad Griffin, the gay and lesbian political action committee's president, said.""It also flies in the face of overwhelming evidence that children being raised by same-sex parents are just as healthy and well-adjusted as those with different-sex parents. At a time when so many children in foster care need loving homes, it is sickening to think that a child would be taken from caring parents who planned to adopt,” he continued.Hoagland and Peirce said they are seeking an attorney to fight the judge's decision.A spokeswoman for the state's Division of Child and Family Services has also said they plan to review the order and see what options they have to challenge it.Attempts to reach Hoagland, Peirce and the foster child’s attorney for comment were not immediately successful. The story will be updated with more information should we hear back from any of the parties.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Also on HuffPost:"

Each of its roughly 4,500 students, in one way or another, focuses on the idea of performance -- on the stage, in the recording studio and in everyday life.Four years ago, cultural studies professor Lori Landay was inspired to take that idea of performing and dig deeper into it, designing an annual seminar-style course called “What is Being?” Each spring, 12 students join Landay on campus, attend arts performances in the city, and read novels and philosophy texts to try to understand what it means for humans to exist and thrive. (The course is not being offered this year because Landay is on sabbatical.)Landay, whose own research focuses on visual culture and interactive media, spoke with The Huffington Post about what it means to work with artists to explore the big questions.How did this class come to be?The course came about because there were posters around Berklee with the college motto, ""to be, not to seem,"" and I started pondering what that meant for my students -- as individuals, as performers, and in an age when there is so much emphasis on seeming in celebrity culture and through our use of the media. When I was developing the course to apply for the National Endowment for the Humanities ""enduring questions"" grant that made it possible, the question evolved: What does it mean to be? What is being?What does it mean to be? What is being?In many ways, it’s my favorite course to teach. The narrative that I weave in it -- of how people ask the same questions in different ways, why those ways are different, and how the different answers others have found can help us form our own answers -- is a challenging and exciting stretch for me each time. Seeing what the students make in their multimedia projects is the great reward for my effort.How do you define ""being""? How do students? Is there even an answer?There are a lot of answers! But not a sole answer that the course offers. Each student comes in with some perception of what being is, and they each leave better able to articulate their individual answer to the question of what is being, and a much stronger sense of what that question means.The goals of the course include giving students the tools to form questions, seek information, articulate their ideas in the contexts of what others have thought, and discuss them with others. We encounter many different definitions of being in the course, from different thinkers and artists, disciplinary perspectives, cultures and time periods. The central question leads to subquestions that shape the semester: Is it better to be, rather than to seem? Or is performance being or seeming? Or what is being in contemporary culture when images and illusions are so prevalent? Those subquestions connect our inquiry into being to our everyday lives and experiences.What’s been the reaction from students?I've noticed how the students have grown into posing big questions and thinking deeply about them. At first, there’s almost an embarrassment about it. ""Whoa, that’s deep!"" they say, shaking it off, or hedging a terrific insight with, ""I’m probably reading too much into this, but..."" By the end, that hedging is over, and they are engaging with the thinkers and artists, putting their ideas in the contexts of those of Plato, Machiavelli, Erving Goffman, Nella Larsen, Marina Abramović, Terry Gilliam or Philip K. Dick, and discussing with their classmates. The other big change I love to see is that they leave the course with a much stronger sense of a historical perspective. On the first day, when we read the source of the college motto -- Cicero’s ""On Friendship"" -- and find that Cicero was talking about flattery, students quickly connect to ""friendship"" on social media platforms like Facebook, and how seeming is emphasized over being. It’s a great discussion every time, but it’s like nothing has changed between Cicero’s era and ours.By the end of the course, they understand that what Cervantes, Shakespeare, Edward Hopper, Heidegger or Tibetan monks creating a mandala out of sand, expressed about being was shaped by their worldview, just as their perspective is. We cover a lot of territory in the course through the lens of the central questions, but what I tell students is that while we can only we dip into something, they have the rest of their lives to read, see or listen to the rest.Why’s being so important to study, especially at a place like Berklee where students focus on music?It’s an important area for students to study because everyone, whether they are specializing in music or anything else, asks the ""enduring"" questions. The questions endure for a reason -- they are part of what defines us as human, and they connect us to the past, to others in the present, and to the future. By learning how people have explored the biggest questions in cultural expressions like art, literature, film, music and dance, we give students concepts, characters, themes and images that will help them as they inevitably ask the big questions in their lives. By thinking through how others have posed and answered questions in philosophy, sociology, science and religious studies, students gain models to use in forming their own ideas. That will only make them stronger musicians, citizens, friends and people.It’s important for students to have time to focus only on the big question so they can get past the tendency that’s prevalent in our culture to stay on the surface and have a forum in which to think deeply about serious issues. They are really interested in the big questions and eager, once you show them how, to develop and express their ideas.What’s been the biggest moment of teaching ""What is Being""?The authenticity, creativity, and clarity of some of the student projects has moved me tremendously. The biggest highlight for me was when Bobby McFerrin, who was on campus as a visiting artist, came to the class. McFerrin explained that when he is on stage, he is not ""performing,"" but ""being,"" and this made for a great discussion, with the students telling him some of what we’d been doing in the class.He shared with them his story, how he made a conscious decision to choose authenticity. It was fantastic interaction, and I felt privileged to sit in a circle with him and the 12 students. We had other great guests, too, like the bassist/composer/producer/educator John Clayton, the photographer Henry Diltz, who shot so many iconic rock images like the Morrison Hotel Doors album cover, and slam poet Caroline Harvey. The more I think about the course, the more I can’t wait until I teach it again.This interview has been edited for clarity and length. "

We had other great guests, too, like the bassist/composer/producer/educator John Clayton, the photographer Henry Diltz, who shot so many iconic rock images like the Morrison Hotel Doors album cover, and slam poet Caroline Harvey. The more I think about the course, the more I can’t wait until I teach it again.This interview has been edited for clarity and length. "

18,TECH,The Woman Behind The Game-Changing 'Star Wars Battlefront',Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sigurlina-ingvarsdottir-star-wars-interview_us_5644d661e4b045bf3dee2795,"Sigurlina Ingvarsdottir talks to us about giving the ""Star Wars"" universe the diversity it so badly needs.",2015-11-12,"Sigurlina Ingvarsdottir, lead producer of ""Star Wars Battlefront,"" chills with an Imperial stormtrooper.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5644de2e1800009d003048fc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"When ""Star Wars Battlefront"" launches on Nov. 17, it could bring diversity into everyone's favorite space fantasy like never before.The video game -- easily among the most anticipated of the year -- will allow players to create Rebel troopers and Imperial soldiers who are men, women, black, white, young and old. You'll customize how your character looks and then join others in battles, sometimes recreating iconic scenes from the ""Star Wars"" trilogy. The notable difference from the films is that the battles won't be whitewashed: When you fight on the ice planet Hoth, you'll do so next to characters who actually look like they're pulled from every part of the galaxy. (That includes decidedly less-real races like Twi'leks and Rodians.)This a big deal: The original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, for all its excellence, wasn't exactly a landmark achievement for diversity in film. True, Princess Leia is a butt-kicking, take-no-prisoners leader with killer hair, but the illusion is tarnished somewhat when she's put into a golden bikini ""slave"" outfit in ""Return of the Jedi"" and slobbered over by an awful worm beast named Jabba the Hutt. The only main black character is Lando Calrissian, and he's not even in every movie. And the ethnic stereotypes in the prequel trilogy are best forgotten entirely.To learn a bit more about diversity in ""Star Wars Battlefront"" -- and a few more tidbits -- The Huffington Post spoke with Sigurlina Ingvarsdottir. She served as senior producer for the game, which was made by DICE, a subsidiary of software behemoth EA Games.This interview has been edited for clarity and length.Why was it important for you and for your team to include diverse character options in ""Battlefront""?We’re now rebooting a beloved franchise, and we’re building something that we want to appeal to ""Star Wars"" fans young and old and of both genders, and it seems very natural to be very inclusive in the character design to that end.Was there pressure from Disney or Lucasfilm to include diverse characters, or was this a directive that you took on yourself?It was always a directive that we took on ourselves. That’s how we envisioned the game, and it was extremely nice when we spoke to them about it. They were like, “Yes, that’s absolutely in line with what we’re doing with 'Star Wars'.” So it came completely naturally.A lot of people feel that the tech and video game industries don't empower women and those from racially diverse backgrounds in the way that they should. Can you talk a little bit about how you built your team on ""Battlefront"" from that perspective?One of the things I strongly believe in [when building] teams is that you create a culture of trust and transparency within the team, and that you empower your team to make decisions. That’s how you create the spirit of initiative and ownership that’s really crucial for you to be able to have a high-performing team. So, that trust in transparency and ownership has really been a foundation for this team, and that goes very hand in hand with the culture of DICE. I mean, we’re based in Stockholm, Sweden. Hierarchical or corporate culture here is typically quite flat, with people taking a lot of ownership and initiative. So, that kind of culture has been very much in alignment with my personal beliefs on how you run teams. Would you say that there was a unique pressure on you and your team given that ""Star Wars"" is such a big deal?So many people of my generation and younger that have grown up with ""Star Wars"" -- I feel like I’ve never not known about ""Star Wars."" I grew up knowing about ""Star Wars"" and it’s always been a part of my cultural environment, if you will. For so many people, it means so much and it’s so big and so vast, so of course that creates a lot of pressure on us. But it’s also pressure that we put on ourselves as fans of ""Star Wars"" from a very early age. I mean, this project is for all of us the project of a lifetime, and there’s nothing like that to drive people to do their absolute best work. So yes, fans put a lot of pressure on us, but then again, so do we. How did you ensure that you nailed that ""Star Wars"" vibe?In other games, when you’re working with your own intellectual property and you’re creating a universe or you’re creating a world, there are so many unknowns and so many things that you need to figure out. But with ""Star Wars,"" as you said, it’s about nailing that ""Star Wars"" feeling. You know what you’re going after: Everyone has a pretty clear vision, whether it’s from the audio perspective or from the visual perspective. Then coupled with that, we have this unique access to Lucasfilm and the original John Williams music.And [we used a] technique that we call photogrammetry, which is basically where you go and take models from the film or natural objects -- like leaves or twigs or rocks or trees -- and you capture these using a camera from a variety of different angles and then you stitch those images together with software. So, you create models that are actually based on these objects [from the original films], and this is the process that we use to get to this incredible visual fidelity.In terms of painting the picture for the team, people instinctively know when they’ve gotten to a place where it feels right.Everyone's familiar with ""Star Wars"" -- what's going to surprise them about ""Battlefront""?I think that they’ll be surprised by the breadth of experience that they’re able to have. You’re able to jump into the Star Wars universe in a way that you’ve never been able to before. Do you want to have a lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader? Check: We’ve got the “Hero Battle” mode. Do you want to feel like you’re part of a really, really epic battle? Check, we’ve got that. Do you want to pilot the Millennium Falcon? Yes, you can do that. The list just goes on and on and on about different fantasies from ""Star Wars"" that we’re capturing in the game.""Star Wars Battlefront"" comes out Nov. 17 on PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 for $59.99."

Bernie Sanders' presidential run.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) won the endorsement of the American Postal Workers Union on Thursday, giving the self-described democratic socialist a boost as he seeks more support from organized labor in the Democratic primary.APWU represents 200,000 U.S. Postal Service employees and retirees. It's the second major national union and member of the AFL-CIO labor federation to endorse Sanders over rival and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Sanders ""stands above all others as a true champion of postal workers and other workers throughout the country,"" said Mark Dimondstein, the union's president, in a statement. The endorsement came from the union's 13-member executive board.Although he's one of unions' closest allies in Congress, Sanders still trails well behind Clinton when it comes to official backing from organized labor. The former secretary of state has already nabbed endorsements from the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, all of them huge public-sector unions.The other national union to endorse Sanders was National Nurses United. The biggest fish -- the AFL-CIO itself -- is unlikely to endorse while the primary is still being disputed. Sanders has long been a vocal backer of a robust postal service, particularly during the postal reform debate of recent years. APWU views itself as fighting a battle against postal service privatization, and it counts the Vermont senator as perhaps its leading defender.As the postal service bleeds millions in losses -- mostly due to unique funding mandates placed upon it by Congress -- Sanders has staunchly opposed the closure of postal facilities and cuts in postal service, such as Saturday delivery. He is also a leading proponent of the concept of postal banking, which would allow post offices to provide small loans and compete with payday lenders. Postal banking is a top issue for APWU, and Sanders has sought to make it a campaign issue.In his statement, Dimondstein noted Sanders' long history of standing with workers on picket lines, as well as his support for a national $15 per hour minimum wage. Sanders spoke at a protest against Verizon last month that was held by the Communications Workers of America union, and he joined a Fight for $15 rally outside the U.S. Capitol building earlier this week.""We should judge candidates not by their political party, not by what they say, not by what we think they stand for, but by what they do,"" Dimondstein said. ""[Sanders] walks the walk."""

22,BUSINESS,More Bad News For Macy’s Ahead Of Holiday Shopping Season,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/macys-declining-sales_us_5644bbd8e4b08cda3487af87,But bargain-hunters will rejoice.,2015-11-12,Macy's is hoping its new Macy's Backstage discount stores can help boost sales.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5644bdab180000a700304894.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's been a bad year for Macy's, and it just keeps getting worse.The company said on Wednesday that it has seen a 5.2 percent drop in sales between the beginning of August to the end of October, and is responding to these figures by speeding up closures of struggling department store locations and doubling down on its discount store chain.Macy's announced in September that it would close 35 to 40 poorly performing department store locations. On Wednesday, the retailer's CEO, Terry Lundgren, said he'd close more stores once those locations are all shuttered, according to the Cincinnati Business Courier.The iconic retailer launched Macy’s Backstage -- which, much like competitors Nordstrom Rack or Off Fifth, has bare-bones decor and carries clearance items year-round -- in August. It currently has six locations in the greater New York City area, and the company announced plans on Wednesday to open 50 more of the stores over the next two years.Lundgren also intends to experiment with adding Macy's Backstage sections to 10 department store locations, the Business Courier reported.A key reason for the decline in Macy's sales is the growing popularity of so-called off-price stores like T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, as many customers who prioritized bargain-hunting during the recession have maintained their frugal habits.So-called off-price or discount retailers saw their sales grow 44 percent from 2009 to 2014, according to The Wall Street Journal.Macy’s share of department store sales actually rose significantly from 2006 to 2013, according to the Journal. However, department stores’ share of overall merchandise sales dipped during that same period.News about declining sales prompted Macy's share price to fall 14 percent on Wednesday, the Journal reported, bringing the total drop to 40 percent on the year. Since Macy's is the first department store to report earnings, investors interpreted the news as an ominous sign for other traditional retailers. The stock prices of Kohl's, Burlington Stores and Hudson’s Bay Company, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor, all fell the same day.Macy’s will open its doors to shoppers at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day, and offer Black Friday sales until 1 p.m. the following day.H&M, by contrast, announced on Tuesday that it will close its stores nationwide on Thanksgiving Day. It joins a growing number of retailers, including Nordstrom, Costco and BJ’s, that have chosen to close all of their U.S. stores on Thanksgiving Day out of consideration for their employees.Also on HuffPost:"

Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) back in June. Reid's appearance in the video is his first public statement urging the president to sign the executive order.Reid’s endorsement of the movement, and the video, are part of a delivery of more than 800,000 petition signatures to the White House by groups supporting a political disclosure executive order that occurred on Tuesday. The groups include American Family Voices, Public Citizen, Every Voice, Brennan Center for Justice, Common Cause, MoveOn.org and Sierra Club. Supporters are encouraged to call the White House to support the disclosure order.Proponents of the order see it as a potential piece to the president’s fourth quarter agenda of executive actions. They argue it will allow Obama's administration to put a stamp on an issue that he has largely ignored, aside from opting out of public financing for his general election run in 2008, which helped increase the amount of money in politics.“Their legacy on this issue is something that they haven’t established yet,” said Lisa Gilbert, director of Public Citizen’s Congress Watch.The campaign to pressure Obama to sign an executive order mandating disclosure of political contributions by federal contractors began after a proposed draft leaked from the White House in 2011. In the 2010 Citizens United decision, the Supreme Court opened the door to unlimited election spending by corporations, unions and wealthy individuals. A side effect of the decision, later bemoaned by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the opinion’s author, was a dramatic decrease in the transparency of election spending as a large portion of the newly allowed unlimited spending flowed through nonprofit corporations that are not required to disclose their donors. This practice came to be known as “dark money.”Later in 2010, the Democratic-controlled Congress attempted to close this disclosure loophole, only to have their Disclose Act fail to clear a Republican filibuster by one vote. Democrats lost control of the House in the 2010 elections, dashing hope of post-Citizens United disclosure measures.The idea for an executive order grew out of this failure. As the president demonstrated on issues from paid sick leave to the minimum wage, the ability to use executive authority over the contracting process provides great leeway for the expansion of policies blocked in Congress.An executive order mandating contractor disclosure of political donations, including to trade associations and dark money nonprofits, would cover many politically active companies. Koch Industries, Exxon Mobil, JPMorgan Chase, Dow Chemical, Chevron and General Electric all hold or have received government contracts in recent years. Even News Corp., the parent company of Fox News, holds government contracts.These companies and many others would be required to disclose their contributions to entities that currently are non-disclosing, like the Koch brothers’ Americans for Prosperity, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, or the environmental group League of Conservation Voters.When the proposed executive order leaked out of the White House in 2011, conservatives and business lobbyists vociferously objected.Bruce Josten, the top lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest pro-business trade association, told The New York Times it was an attempt to silence the business community.“We will fight it through all available means,” Josten told the Times.Republicans in Congress sought to prevent the White House from issuing the order by trying to slip riders onto spending bills banning the use of funds to enforce such a rule. A similar rider has already been floated for the end-of-year omnibus spending bill to come up in December.Reformers said they're encouraged that Obama will respond to the petitions and to the letter from congressional Democrats. “We hope that he seizes the sixth anniversary [of Citizens United] to do something meaningful,” Gilbert said."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Remember all that empty political talk about improving mental health care? It may not be so empty after all.Responding to the outrage over gun violence, both houses of Congress are considering bills designed to make treatment for serious psychiatric disorders more available and effective.The leading House bill, from Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), won approval from a key subcommittee last week. In the Senate, a similar bill from Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Chris Murphy (D-Ct.) will get preliminary hearings before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee next month.Both bills have bipartisan support. Both have endorsements from major organizations that work on mental health, including the American Psychiatric Association and the National Alliance on Mental Illness. And while both proposals face significant political obstacles, including opposition from other mental health advocates, some kind of legislation has a real chance of passing Congress and getting the president’s signature by next year.Whether enactment would actually reduce the incidence of gun violence is difficult to say. The vast majority of people with mental illness, like most people without mental illness, are not violent. But passage of something resembling either of the two bills could mean real improvement for people suffering from serious psychiatric ailments -- people who, traditionally, have gotten a short shrift from the U.S. healthcare system.At the heart of each proposal is a significant, if seemingly obscure, change to Medicaid, the government-financed program that provides insurance to millions of poor and disabled Americans. Under current law, Medicaid does not cover inpatient care at some psychiatric hospitals. The provision is a legacy of the 1960s, when Medicaid first became law and policymakers were eager to discourage the warehousing of the mentally ill at institutions. Another purpose of the provision, in some tellings, was to stop states from cutting back on their own funding for long-term psychiatric care.Many experts feel that restriction limits the availability of inpatient psychiatric beds -- at a time when such beds are frequently in short supply. Both the House and Senate bills would modify the existing restriction, allowing more Medicaid money to flow to psychiatric hospitals. Supporters of the bills hope this change would allow the hospitals to provide more care, alleviating the existing shortages where they exist.A second key feature of the bills is an investment in promising new treatments for severe mental illness, including early intervention services for schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown that the early intervention approach, which provides social and psychiatric supports to people first experiencing psychotic symptoms, can yield substantially better outcomes than traditional care for people with schizophrenia. The federal government has already set aside some money for early intervention, but it’s short-term funding that will soon run out.The House bill has been a labor of love for Congressman Murphy, who is a trained psychologist. He led a congressional investigation into mental health care following the Sandy Hook massacre and, last year, introduced a preliminary proposal that reflected what the committee found. Following Wednesday’s subcommittee vote, NAMI executive director Mary Giliberti said that her organization “is thrilled that Congress has taken the first crucial step in moving forward comprehensive, bipartisan mental health legislation.”But the House bill has also been the one to attract the strongest opposition, primarily (but not exclusively) because of two controversial elements. One is a proposal that would offer state governments small financial incentives to introduce and make greater use of ""assisted outpatient treatment."" That’s a program in which courts can order people to enroll in treatment programs as a condition for avoiding involuntary hospitalization. Groups like the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law fear that greater reliance on assisted outpatient treatment would compromise the civil liberties of people with mental illness -- and discourage the kind of community-based care that in many cases produces the best results.Murphy’s House bill would also alter existing privacy regulations, loosening restrictions on communication between the providers of mental health care and the families of the mentally ill. Advocates for the bill feel this will make it easier for caregivers to take care of people who are so sick they cannot manage their own treatment. Critics say the changes would violate patient privacy. “Moving this bill forward is the same as moving backwards on mental health for this country,” John Head, spokesman for the Bazelon Center, told The Huffington Post.The Senate bill doesn’t have those same controversial provisions, perhaps because Cassidy and Sen. Murphy introduced their measure later and took some of those objections into account. But the Senate bill includes the House proposal to change Medicaid and that could ultimately pose the biggest obstacle to passage, because that provision comes with a hefty price tag. The Congressional Budget Office predicted that a previous version of the House bill would cost $46 billion to $66 billion over 10 years. Mainly that is because inpatient psychiatric care is expensive and, if implemented, both the House and Senate bills would allow a great deal more of it. Congressman Murphy has since scaled back the Medicaid portion of his proposals and the Senate version was always less ambitious. If either bill moves forward, the CBO will likely find it costs less than the earlier House bill -- and maybe a lot less. But even more modest expenditures would require lawmakers to agree on offsetting revenue or spending cuts, or tolerate modestly higher deficits. Serious discussions about finding offsets hasn't begun, since the legislative process has just started -- and both proposals are likely to undergo more revision before they go to floor consideration. Some advocates would argue that if Congress is going to spend more money on mental health, the balance between outpatient and inpatient care should tilt more heavily to the former. But the financing question looms and, at some point, the proof of whether Congress takes mental health seriously will be whether Congress is willing to spend money on it.Also on HuffPost:"
