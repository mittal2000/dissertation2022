When your guests arrive, you'll be ready to celebrate rather than slaving away in the kitchen or, worse, nodding off at the table. From my Carrot & Sweet Potato Soup to the Easiest Roast Turkey You'll Ever Make, these no-hassle Thanksgiving dishes are all tested and perfected crowd-pleasers.1. Autumn Carrot & Sweet Potato SoupMade with carrots, sweet potatoes, apples and honey, this savory soup with a hint of sweetness and spice is the essence of fall. The secret ingredient is curry powder, which doesn't give the soup an Indian flavor like you might think, but instead lends a subtle hint of autumn spice. Make it now and freeze it, then check it off your list! GET THE RECIPE2. Best Buttermilk BiscuitsRich and buttery with a fluffy interior and golden crust, these biscuits can be made ahead of time and frozen so all that's left to do on Thanksgiving day is pop them in the oven.  GET THE RECIPE3. Oranges, Caramelized Red Onions & Spinach in Balsamic VinaigretteInspired by Patrick O'Connell's Inn at Little Washington Cookbook, this salad of oranges, red onions and greens is dressed in a balsamic vinaigrette spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg. It sounds unusual but it really works, and the flavors are perfect for fall. Make all of the components the morning of Thanksgiving and quickly assemble before the meal. GET THE RECIPE4. The Easiest Roast Turkey You'll Ever Make Ever since I started hosting Thanksgiving dinner ten years ago, I have been on a quest to make the perfect Thanksgiving turkey. I've brined it, deep fried it, marinated it, injected it, buttered it, dry-rubbed it, butterflied it and stuffed it. And you know what? None of it made much difference! My advice to you on Thanksgiving is to keep it simple. Make a basic roast turkey along with an over-the-top delicious gravy and some cranberry sauce to go with it. Focus your time and creativity on the side dishes and desserts because that's what everyone really looks forward to anyway. GET THE RECIPE5. Fresh Cranberry Orange SauceFresh cranberry sauce is a cinch to make! This version is flavored with orange juice and orange zest, and can be made several days before the feast. GET THE RECIPE6. Homemade GravyFlavored with onions, turkey drippings and fresh herbs, this rich gravy will make your Thanksgiving turkey (and anything else) taste delicious. GET THE RECIPE7. Challah, Wild Mushroom and Herb StuffingBake your stuffing separate from the bird so that you can make it ahead of time and ensure that it gets nice and crispy on top. This version, loaded with an earthy mix of onions and vegetables, is easy to make and pairs beautifully with simple roast turkey. GET THE RECIPE8. French Green Beans with ShallotsWith so many other flavors on the table, it's perfectly fine to keep your green vegetable simple. This dish has only three ingredients, but is much more than the sum of its parts. GET THE RECIPE9. Sweet Potato Pecan CrispYou can't have a Thanksgiving feast without a sweet potato casserole. Everyone loves this version topped with a pecan streusel. Make it a day ahead of time and reheat until the top is crisp. GET THE RECIPE10. Easy Sausage and Herb StuffingThis delicious sausage and herb stuffing relies on store bought stuffing cubes, which eliminates the step of slicing and drying out the bread. Believe me, when you are using a pound of sausage and an entire stick of butter, the bread does not matter much! The stuffing can be made in advance and reheated on Thanksgiving day. GET THE RECIPE11. Cauliflower Puree with ThymeEveryone loves mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving but the downside is that they can't be cooked ahead of time. Try this cauliflower purée instead -- it happens to taste remarkably like mashed potatoes but is easier to make, healthier and perfect for making ahead of time. You won't even need any oven space to reheat it -- just put it in the microwave! GET THE RECIPE12. Apple Cranberry Oat CrumbleThis old-fashioned Thanksgiving dessert comes from Rustic Fruit Desserts by Cory Schreiber and Julie Richardson. There's no fussy pie dough -- just apples and fresh cranberries tossed with sugar and cinnamon and a simple crumb topping of oats, flour, brown sugar and butter. Unlike pie, it's essentially foolproof (and I don't know about you, but I'd take a crunchy crumble over flaky pie crust any day). Bonus: you can make it a few days ahead of time. GET THE RECIPE"

3,POLITICS,John Kasich Didn't Do Himself Any Favors At The Last GOP Debate,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fourth-republican-debate-poll_us_5647684ae4b08cda3489136c,Voters who watched the debate say they'd rather hear the candidates attack the Democrats than each other.,2015-11-14,"In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, nearly half of Republican and Republican-leaning voters who watched some of the latest GOP debate said it worsened their opinion of Ohio Gov. John Kasich.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56476c3b1400006f023cacf3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republicans' fourth primetime debate on Tuesday ended with a now-familiar winner's circle, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds, while dealing a significant blow to Ohio Gov. John Kasich.As in the prior debate, Republican and Republican-leaning voters who watched at least clips of the event -- ""GOP voters,"" for the sake of brevity -- named Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) the winner, followed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and current front-runners Ben Carson and Donald Trump. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who forcefully defended his libertarian principles after a string of lackluster debates, was the only other candidate to top 5 percent.Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's performance was less calamitous than his previous outing, when he clashed halfheartedly with Rubio, but he continued to make a negative impression on voters. The politician to incur the most damage this time, however, was Kasich, who stood out largely for his exasperation with his fellow candidates.At the earlier undercard debate, meanwhile, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), bumped out of the top tier, handily bested his opponents -- 53 percent of Republican voters who tuned in for at least part of that debate named him the winner. Despite goading from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R), Christie focused his energy squarely on the general election, pivoting repeatedly back to attacks against Hillary Clinton.GOP voters prefer that strategy to infighting among the candidates, although by a relatively slim margin. Among those who watched either the undercard or the primetime debate, 51 percent said they'd prefer to hear the contenders talk about how they would challenge Democrats in the general election, while 41 percent said they'd rather have the candidates focus on discussing the differences between themselves and the other GOP contenders on policy issues. When Republican and Republican-leaning voters who didn't catch the latest debates are included, preferences are split about evenly.GOP voters who watched the debate did broadly agree on one thing: 84 percent thought that Fox Business, which moderated the event, did a good job -- a marked change from the last debate, when 81 percent disapproved of how CNBC ran the event.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Nov. 11-13 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here. More details on the polls' methodology are available here.Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov's reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample, rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error."

""Indeed, the Retirement Code affirmatively required the board to grant the pension benefits,"" he added.According to PennLive, the court decision partly hinged on its interpretation that Sandusky was not a Penn State employee when he committed the crimes between 2005 and 2008. Although he had speaking engagements and received other perks from the school, Sandusky's legal team had argued that he was officially retired.A provision of the state Pension Forfeiture Act denies pension to school employees convicted of child sex crimes, but it didn't go into effect until 2004, several years after Sandusky had retired, PennLive noted.Sandusky was also awarded back interest, according to Philly.com.Sandusky's lawyer, Charles Benjamin, argued that his client had earned the pension money, and said that it was being used to support Sandusky's wife, Dottie.""I spoke with her this morning, and obviously she's happy to hear that the pension has been restored,"" Benjamin told Philly.com. ""And I'm sure that Jerry is also.""The decision may still be subject to appeal.Also on HuffPost:"

They were each notified on Thursday and had to leave the newsroom that day.Massey and Gordon both separately confirmed to The Huffington Post that they no longer work at The Times. They each declined to comment further. A Times spokeswoman said the paper does not comment on personnel issues.The two longtime editors played key roles in the print operation, which is currently being reorganized. Though the re-tooling of the print side may account for their positions being cut, management did not explain the decision to staffers Thursday, according to newsroom sources. Management's handling of the situation was out of character for The Times, sources said. The Times has gone through a series of layoffs and buyouts in recent years, including 2014, yet has maintained a robust newsroom by redeploying resources to growth areas such as digital, video and audience engagement. The two dismissals come on the heels of executive editor Dean Baquet informing staff earlier this month that The Times would offer buyouts in the video department as part of a reorganization and that layoffs were possible. Baquet's memo surprised staffers given that video is an area that's been expanding. Baquet has not informed staff of any potential layoffs in other parts of the organization, leaving colleagues puzzled by the dismissal of the two veteran editors. Gordon joined The Times in 1995 from the Philadelphia Inquirer and has worked in layout as a copy editor, and for the past decade as an assistant news editor.Massey began his career as a sportswriter for the Log Cabin Democrat in Conway, Arkansas. He next spent a decade at the Little Rock-based Arkansas Democrat-Gazette before heading to the Charlotte Observer as a copy editor. He joined The Times in 1999 as copy chief for the Metro desk.Massey, who has been described as The Times ""headline guru,"" oversaw many of the paper's top headlines each day and filed and in-house critique each week for the standards editor. He's also written several pieces for Times Insider on newsroom processes, including changes to the legendary Page One meeting, and the art of headline writing at The Times. “The best heads are skillful, informative and terse,” Massey wrote last year. “Times headlines also have a definite tone that readers have come to expect: knowing and sophisticated but often wry, funny or poignant. The kinds of puns readers expect from other publications — tabloids in particular — are rare in our report, or should be. We wouldn’t put ‘Headless Body in Topless Bar’ on the front page, even though most of us would admit that it’s genius. It just isn’t our tone.”"

NIC and NPC, umbrella groups representing fraternities sororities, respectively, backed out of supporting the Safe Campus Act after eight sororities went public this week to say they would not support the bill. Sens. Kirstin Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) had criticized NIC in recent weeks for supporting the legislation, which they said would make campuses less safe. The Safe Campus Act, presented in the House, would prohibit colleges from investigating sexual assault cases as violations of the student code of conduct, unless alleged victims also reported the incidents to police. Sexual assault and battery would be the only form of behavior subject to this requirement -- other illegal acts like physical assault or theft would not face similar rules.""After listening to our member fraternities and partners, the NIC is withdrawing its support of the Safe Campus Act,"" NIC said in a statement. ""The ultimate goal of campus reform is to provide a safer environment for students to further their education.""The Safe Campus Act is uniformly opposed by rape victims' advocacy groups. It's also opposed by a group started by the families of victims in the Virginia Tech massacre, and several higher education trade organizations. The Clery Center, started by the family of a student who was raped and murdered in her dorm, which helped push for the nation's first campus safety law, also opposes the bill. The NIC and NPC spent more than $200,000 lobbying for the most controversial provisions in the Safe Campus Act throughout 2015. They played a key role in pushing for the legislation. NPC's statement said it would double down the Fair Campus Act, similar legislation that would allow students to hire lawyers to represent them in student misconduct hearings. Fair Campus would not block colleges from investigating sexual assault cases unless at the request of law enforcement.Several provisions of the Fair Campus Act are important to NIC, the fraternity group said, specifically regarding preserving Title IX single sex exemptions for Greek life organizations, ensuring more due process for student organizations, and barring ""individual university officials from playing multiple roles in conduct investigations or hearings.""______Tyler Kingkade covers higher education and sexual violence, and is based in New York.

Assad, speaking from his capital of Damascus, offered to work with France and other countries to help stamp out the group, which is also known as ISIS.Assad conveniently did not mention his own state policy of empowering extremists in Syria, according to reports of his remarks in the pro-Assad and Western media. His regime has avoided direct assaults on the Islamic State, occasionally aided it on the battlefield and released known militants from prison. The brutal behavior of Assad's regime is also understood to be one of the chief draws for foreign fighters flocking to the radical group and other extreme elements within Syria. Because Assad is a member of a minority sect of Islam known as Alawites and the Shiite theocracy of Iran is one of his chief supporters, the radical Sunni Islamic State is able to frame the war in Syria in sectarian terms and convince potential supporters they are playing a key role in a battle for Islam's future.The Islamic State gained influence in Syria during the civil war there, which began in 2011 after Assad's forces attacked peaceful pro-democracy protesters.Western nations, including France and the U.S., have since backed the Syrian opposition. So have Turkey and the Sunni Arab states of the Gulf. Those nations argue that aligning with Assad would only amplify the trouble in Syria by radicalizing even more Sunni Arabs and preventing a resolution of the divisions within Syria that are driving the conflict.""What I ask [French President Francois Hollande] to do is to act in the interest of the French people -- which means changing his policies,"" Assad continued.Assad and his chief supporters, Iran and Russia, define all non-regime forces in Syria as ""terrorists."" That includes nationalist rebels supported by the U.S. and its allies, who have been the primary focus of a Russian military intervention in Syria launched earlier in the fall. (Though a Pentagon program to train Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State largely imploded this year, a parallel CIA program to train anti-Assad forces is ongoing, and those rebels are also gaining stronger American weapons from their Arab backers.)The French government is one of the primary critics of that argument. Hollande said in September that Assad's regime was ""pointing fingers at Daesh"" (another way of referring to the Islamic State) to distract from the true source of instability in Syria -- Assad's violent rule and stubbornness toward a peace process.The Syrian autocrat has previously tried to win support abroad by playing up his ostensible secularism and fear about radical Islam. He blamed the January attacks on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris on the West's Syria policy.Major powers met in Vienna on Friday and Saturday for the latest round of talks regarding Syria's future. They announced that they had reached an agreement on an elections schedule and a United Nations call for a cease-fire but had yet to agree on what would happen to Assad. Analysts warn that future talks about that question may be skewed by the Paris attacks if Assad and his supporters continue to deceptively promote the Syrian regime as the solution to the Islamic State problem.More than 250,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict since it began. The majority, observers say, were killed by pro-Assad forces rather than the Islamic State."

He looked grim, as though there had been a death in the family.And there was: more mayhem in Paris, more deaths, and more body blows to a city and country that helped invent the modern ideals of “liberty, equality and fraternity.”France, the mournful but determined president said, is the “oldest ally” of the United States, and Paris represents the “timeless values of human progress” at a moment when they are under attack.Our old ally, he added, had been a crucial partner with the U.S. in “counter-terrorism” campaigns around the globe. What Obama didn’t say, but implied, was that France in general and Paris in particular were suffering as a result.So their fight is ours.The apparently coordinated attacks around Paris, which officials described as terrorism, resulted in dozens of deaths.Obama’s counterpart, President Francois Hollande, appeared on French television shortly after the U.S. leader spoke.He looked more shaken than saddened. He declared that the borders of the country had been closed, and that the army had been summoned to Paris. After past terrorism incidents -- the Charlie Hebdo and grocery store attacks, and a recent violent incident on a high-speed train -- Hollande had sounded like chief executive as police commissioner.This time, he sounded like a wartime leader -- and so, in muted tones, did Obama.The terrorists, Hollande said, wanted to use blood and chaos to scare the people of France and, by extension, other democratic, secular countries throughout the world. But, he had to concede on Friday night, “there are reasons to be afraid.”Indeed, there are.How, one wonders, will France be able to host next month’s colossal global climate meeting, which is expected to draw thousands of delegates from scores of countries?How can France close its borders at a time when thousands of refugees from Syria and elsewhere are seeking safety there? On the other hand, what kind of safety can they expect? If France is the ultimate “soft target” -- an open city in a defiantly secular country -- how can it protect itself in this new war? An open city of sidewalk cafes and public parks, Paris is, in its layout and lifestyle, the embodiment of the ideals now threatened by violence. The answer to these and other questions is simple and difficult at the same time.Fear will simply have to be replaced by calm, bravery and life as Paris knew it. Things will change, but not enough to kill the eternal flame that burns in the City of Light.Why? Because there can be no freedom anywhere if Paris a prisoner. The world knows that. The world learned that lesson twice in the last century. We will all learn it again if we have to, and it looks like we have to. Also on HuffPost:"

You will even fear traveling to the market,"" said one of the militants, identified as Abu Maryam the Frenchman.Hollande said the attacks were ""an act of war.""The location of the Islamic State fighters in the video was not clear and it was not possible to determine when it was filmed, but the message was unmistakable.The fighters, who appeared to be French citizens, sat cross-legged in a group wearing fatigues and holding weapons in what appeared to be a wooded area. The video showed the militants burning passports.""Indeed you have been ordered to fight the infidel wherever you find him - what are you waiting for?,"" said Abu Maryam.""Know that jihad in this time is obligatory on all.""Another militant, identified as Abu Salman the Frenchman, said: ""There are weapons and cars available and targets ready to be hit. Even poison is available, so poison the water and food of at least one of the enemies of Allah.""""Terrorize them and do not allow them to sleep due to fear and horror,"" he added.Foreign fighters who join Islamic State, the group which controls large swathes of Iraq and Syria, are seen as especially dangerous because Western passports enable them to live in and travel to Western countries undetected.Another militant in the video, identified as Abu Osama the Frenchman, appealed to Muslims living in France to head to Syria to wage jihad, in ""a message from your French brothers.""""Jihad is the path of Allah You strengthen their economy and pay taxes which they use to fight us, and kill our sister, our women and our children,"" he said.""Are you not embarrassed?

The man suspected it was because people were suspicious of his Muslim faith in the wake of the Paris attacks.Malloy empathized with the driver and expressed his support over the course of the 25-minute ride from Columbus Circle to Washington Heights. Malloy was so moved, he told HuffPost, he forgot to ask for the driver's name.The exchange inspired Malloy to share his experience on Twitter and Facebook immediately afterward. The passionate message against Islamophobia went viral overnight. “He cried the whole way to my apartment and it made me cry, too,” Malloy wrote. “He kept saying, ‘Allah, my God, does not believe in this! People think I’m a part of this and I’m not. Nobody wants to drive with me because they feel unsafe. I can’t even do my job.’”Malloy took the opportunity to speak out against those who use the actions of extremists to generalize about Muslims.“Please stop saying ‘Muslims’ are the problem because they are not and they are feeling more victimized and scared to the day,” Malloy wrote. “These are our brothers and sisters as humankind, we are all humans underneath this skin. And they deserve nothing more than our respect and attention. They need our protection. Please stop viewing these beautiful human beings as enemies because they are not.”Malloy went to bed shortly thereafter, pleased to see the message had already been retweeted 25 times. He wanted the story to reach as many people as possible. But he was completely unprepared for the avalanche of retweets and replies he received when he woke. He normally tweets about celebrity news and workplace jokes.As of 4:30 p.m. on Saturday, the tweet with Malloy's cab ride story had been retweeted nearly 30,000 times.“The replies were so touching and so sincere,” Malloy told HuffPost. “It wasn’t just the Muslim community replying, but everybody replying. Especially at a time like this, in our country and in our world ... to see people come together over something I had written and saying, ‘This is so important’ -- it made me cry.”Malloy also received a smaller number of negative replies, including people who said they would not have gotten in the cab. He's choosing to block those messages.“That put such a sick feeling in my stomach because you’re disregarding another human being,” he said. “It was sad and I didn’t want to see it.”Malloy moved to New York City four years ago from St. Petersburg, Florida.

Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the coordinated assault.U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed confidence that Abu Nabil, also known as Wissam Najm Abd Zayd al Zubaydi, was likely killed in the air strike by F-15 aircraft on a compound in the city of Derna.""Nabil's death will degrade ISIL's ability to meet the group's objectives in Libya, including recruiting new ISIL members, establishing bases in Libya, and planning external attacks on the United States,"" said Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook, using an acronym for Islamic State.Four years after the overthrow of Gaddafi, Islamic State has steadily grown, controlling the city of Sirte, and worrying Western governments who fear it can only become stronger.Nabil, an Iraqi national, was a longtime al Qaeda operative and the senior Islamic State leader in Libya, the Pentagon said.U.S. airstrikes have targeted militants outside the main battlefields of Iraq and Syria, but this strike was significant because of Nabil's close ties to Islamic State's main leadership, one U.S. official said.""There's a lot of people around the world who call themselves ISIL. But those are people who have taken the ISIL brand and there's no relationship with the home office,"" the official said.""But this guy (Nabil) had a no-kidding relationship back with main ISIL.""Cook said it was the first strike against an Islamic State leader in Libya.Islamic State is mostly based in Sirte, but they still have some presence in Derna, where they were ousted in July by local Libyan Islamist fighters and residents fed up with the presence of foreign jihadists.An eye-witness in Derna told Reuters aircraft using night-vision systems carried out air strikes in places controlled by militants of Islamic state in the city's south-east suburb of Fattayah.Islamic State fighters have left their mark on the North African state. They have massacred Christian Egyptians on a Libyan beach, publicly flogged criminals in Sirte, stormed oilfields, and attacked a five-star Tripoli hotel.Cook cited reporting suggesting that Nabil might have been the spokesman in a February 2015 Coptic Christian execution video.(Reporting by Phil Stewart in Washington and Patrick Markey in Algiers; Additional reporting by Ayman Al Warfalli in Benghazi, Libya; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and James Dalgleish)"

19,POLITICS,How Super PACs And Campaigns Are Coordinating In 2016,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/super-pac-coordination_us_56463f85e4b045bf3def0273,Efforts to circumvent the coordination ban have grown more aggressive.,2015-11-14,Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) have used different tactics to get around the ban on coordination between campaigns and super PACs.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5646422f180000a700304b00.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The role of single-candidate super PACs has expanded exponentially in the 2016 presidential campaign. Candidates have become increasingly reliant and entwined with these committees, which can raise unlimited sums of money from most any source.Created in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision and a subsequent lower court ruling, super PACs and other outside groups are supposed to operate independently from the candidates they support. The Citizens United decision made it possible for super PACs to collect unlimited corporate, union and individual contributions as long as they did not coordinate with candidates to determine how to spend the money.Yet the real-world application of this new spending paradigm means that unlimited money groups are closely connected to single candidates, political party leaders and highly influential Washington lobbyists. Spending by outside groups like super PACs has already hit $64 million in the 2016 presidential race, with 90 percent of that total coming from single-candidate groups, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics.Since candidates and super PACs are forbidden from coordinating a large amount of activity with each other, they deploy a number of strategies to get around this ban and share information with the other party. Many of these tactics have been developed over the past three election cycles, although some of the most aggressive ones are new to 2016.The new rules of super PAC coordination went into effect soon after the 2014 midterm elections. In December 2014, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announced that he would “actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States."" The hedged declaration stopped short of declaring that Bush was either an active candidate or was exploring a run, but rather suggested the possibility of one.Some election lawyers say this allowed Bush to directly coordinate with a super PAC.Bush used his get-out-jail-free statement to directly staff his Right to Rise super PAC and tour the country, raising over $100 million to spend on his presidential campaign. Nearly all the money Bush raised for the super PAC came in amounts above the legal $5,400-per-donor limit. Bush and Right to Rise coordinated strategy and materials for an extensive period before Bush declared his candidacy, which put up a firewall between the two parties.“[W]e actually were able to do some filming before the wall went down, so we can do excellent creative,” Right to Rise director Mike Murphy said in a call with donors that Buzzfeed recorded. “We have some incredible stuff in the can that we shot with the governor.”Bush’s super PAC involvement is just the most high-profile example of direct coordination in the supposed pre-candidate period. Republican presidential candidates, including Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former candidate Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, were all involved with the super PACs supporting them before they publicly entered the presidential race.In Kasich's case, every ad aired by two groups that support his candidacy -- New Day Independent Media Committee and the New Day for America super PAC -- includes footage of the governor talking directly to the camera. Candidates aren't allowed to appear in footage shot exclusively by a super PAC or other outside group. However, the groups say they shot the footage prior to Kasich’s announcement that he was running for president. One of the ads can be viewed below.Presidential candidates who hold federal office, including Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), can't take advantage of the gaping coordination loophole Bush and other candidates have used. The coordination laws apply to them at all times they occupy federal office. Still, they've found other techniques to get video and other information to their super PACs.Two groups back Rubio's candidacy: Conservative Solutions PAC, a super PAC, and Conservative Solutions Project, a nonprofit group that does not disclose its donors. Conservative Solutions PAC advertisements contain footage of Rubio on the campaign trail shaking hands with workers and giving a stump speech that could only have been filmed by his campaign.How does a super PAC get access to this footage? Candidates believe they can share information with super PACs or other outside groups if that information is relayed in a public setting.In September, for example, Rubio's campaign uploaded more than five minutes of b-roll footage -- snippets of film of the candidate with filler music playing -- to its Vimeo account. The practice of uploading b-roll footage for super PACs to “find” was widespread in the 2014 elections among congressional campaigns.The b-roll footage from Rubio's campaign, along with a super PAC ad that used that same footage, can be viewed below.Buzzfeed noticed that Cruz’s Senate campaign uploaded hours of footage to YouTube showing the Texas senator talking alongside his wife, father, mother and other family members. All of this is now available for outside groups to use if they need feel-good footage of Cruz with his family.And Fiorina’s super PAC, CARLY for America, has uploaded over a minute of b-roll footage to its Vimeo account.The Fiorina campaign also uses other public forums so its super PAC can handle much of the work normally associated with campaigns, including advance work at events and communications. The campaign posts her schedule online so the super PAC can track where she's supposed to be and arrive before her. Fiorina’s super PAC has also hosted events and conference calls featuring the candidate as a “special guest.”Groups supporting Jindal have done the same. Jindal’s Believe Again super PAC has events already planned with the candidate in Iowa, up until the state’s caucus.Democratic Party presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton also gets support from the Correct the Record super PAC through public channels. The group posts opposition research to its site that the Clinton campaign can reuse. The Clinton camp also pays a market rate to use the super PAC's non-public research. This essentially makes the super PAC a direct arm of the campaign, subsidized by six-figure contributions Clinton cannot raise directly.Candidates and super PACs can also communicate through the press. The Cruz campaign did precisely this when anonymous Cruz advisors told Politico they were dismayed by the lack of advertising from the quartet of super PACs created to support him.“I assume they’re waiting so their media buyers make the highest commission,” a Cruz advisor told Politico.The strategically placed complaint apparently came about because one pro-Cruz super PAC worried about coordinating with the campaign. According to CNN, Keep the Promise I super PAC was planning a series of biographical advertising spots in South Carolina using the b-roll from Cruz' Senate account -- until lawyers stepped in to say that using the footage could run afoul of the coordination statutes. The footage can be viewed below.One of the Cruz super PACs, Keep the Promise III, heard the call. The group made a tiny ad buy of $3,700 for 14 spots on the local CBS station in Davenport, Iowa, from Nov. 16-25.At the end of October, a document detailing the struggling Bush camp's appraisal of its own campaign was leaked to different media outlets before U.S. News & World Report obtained a full version. The document did not paint a pretty picture of the campaign, but as The Washington Post’s Philip Bump noted, it did provide a blueprint for how his super PAC could aid his campaign.“The ‘leak,’ like so many ‘leaks,’ may have been an intentional move to pass information to a pro-Bush super PAC,” Bump wrote.This potentially strategic leak could have been prompted by the extensive interview that Right to Rise’s Murphy gave to Bloomberg Politics. In the interview, Murphy described that the pro-Bush super PAC viewed the race as a long slog into March. He further stated that the campaign would start airing “contrast” -- attack -- ads later in 2015. The full documents leaked to U.S. News & World Report painted a more urgent situation for the candidate in the early states, and seemed to urge immediate attacks on Rubio.Less than two weeks later, The New York Times published a story citing sources who had been briefed on Right to Rise's lines of attack against Rubio, effectively describing the super PAC's ideas on how to campaign against him.While there may not be any way to prevent super PACs and candidates from speaking through leaks to the media, some organizations have filed complaints against multiple presidential campaigns and their super PACs for allegedly violating coordination statutes -- and more are likely on the way.Campaign finance reform groups Democracy 21 and Campaign Legal Center have already filed complaints against the campaigns of Bush, Walker and former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) for coordinating with super PACs while stating that they were not candidates. The groups previously filed complaints against super PACs and campaigns for many of the practices taking place this year, including sharing and reusing b-roll footage.The Federal Election Commission deadlocked on some of these key questions at a hearing on Tuesday, however, when it considered a request from Marc Elias, a lawyer for the two main Democratic congressional super PACs and the Clinton campaign.Elias sought permission for the potential plans of his clients -- House Majority PAC and Senate Majority PAC -- to allow candidates to coordinate with super PACs prior to announcing their candidacy. Bush, a number of other Republican presidential candidates, and even one Republican Senate candidate, Florida Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, have also taken similar actions.FEC commissioners split along partisan lines about whether this, and other techniques used by current candidates, would be permissible. The commission also reached an impasse on whether or not a candidate could shoot footage or create other materials with a super PAC in a proposed pre-candidacy period -- as Bush, Kasich, Fiorina and others have already done.The FEC did approve candidates' right to appear as ""special guests"" at fundraising events hosted by super PACs with as few as one or two donors present.The possibility that the commission could decide against these tactics led Bush’s super PAC lawyer, Charles Spies, to file his own comments. Spies objected to whether the FEC could even consider imposing such rules, arguing the commission does not have “jurisdiction over private individuals who are not yet ‘candidates.’”A divided FEC means that campaigns and super PACs with adventurous lawyers will continue to push the boundaries, as most presidential campaigns already have. “Deadlocks by the FEC are viewed by many as a green light to go ahead and continue to break the law,” Campaign Legal Center counsel Paul Ryan says.Those in favor of tough enforcement look to the Department of Justice to intervene in the most egregious cases. Earlier in 2015, the law enforcement agency prosecuted its first case of super PAC and campaign coordination.Democracy 21 and Campaign Legal Center have already appealed to the Department of Justice to appoint a special counsel to investigate Bush’s creation of his super PAC, which they say involved a violation of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.

In private, however, Western and Afghani intelligence agencies admit that the real Taliban budget is closer to between one billion and two billion dollars, with most opting for the higher number. Intelligence sources at the former International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), since replaced by the Resolute Support Mission (RSM), place the number even higher--at more than two billion. Moreover, it is widely believed that the Taliban has stockpiled cash amounting to several billion additional dollars in preparation of a major campaign to seize control of Afghanistan at some point in the future. Where exactly does the Taliban get all this cash? The sources are many and varied. Narcotics are one of the principal sources of the Taliban's financing. Over the last two decades, Afghanistan has emerged as the principal source of the world's heroin, producing somewhere between 70% and 90% of the world's supply. Afghanistan sits at the heart of a region called the ""Golden Crescent,"" a rugged mountainous region incorporating northeastern Iran, Afghanistan, and northwestern Pakistan, which is the center of the world's heroin production. Afghanistan is a ""vertically integrated"" heroin producer in that the entire process, from the cultivation of the opium poppy to the production of morphine and its subsequent conversion into heroin, all takes place within the country. It does not appear that the Taliban is actually involved in the physical production of heroin or its antecedents. The Taliban's principal function in the drug trade is to organize the smuggling of heroin out of Afghanistan, smuggle in chemicals, principally acetic anhydride, that are necessary for the manufacture of heroin and insure that government officials, either through bribery or intimidation, don't interfere with the heroin trade as well as provide protection to the heroin factories. Because of its use for the synthesis of heroin by the deacetylation of morphine, acetic anhydride is a key ingredient in the manufacture of heroin and it is listed as a U.S. DEA List II precursor, and restricted in many other countries including, at least officially, Afghanistan. Afghan government sources estimate that the Afghan heroin trade generates approximately two billion dollars in turnover within Afghanistan, with roughly one-third of the proceeds going to the heroin producers, one-third going to the Taliban, and the balance going to expenses including paying poppy farmers, running the heroin factories, and bribes to government officials and security personnel.  Taliban hashish seized by the Drug Enforcement Agency during Operation AlbatrossThe production of hashish is also a significant source of funding for the Taliban. According to UN sources, Afghanistan is also the world's largest producer of hashish, supplying approximately 4,000 tons. Utilizing the same smuggling networks as those for heroin, hashish adds another 100 million to 150 million dollars to the Taliban's coffers. Currently there are approximately 50,000 acres devoted to the production of hashish in roughly 17 provinces. For farmers, the cultivation of hashish is actually more profitable than that of opium poppies, yielding a profit of around 4,000 dollars per acre. Smuggling, in general, is also a major source of funding for the Taliban. The same networks that can be used to smuggle in arms and munitions, or smuggle out drugs, can be used to smuggle a broad range of goods. Cigarettes, after drugs, are the second most significant item smuggled. Afghanistan imports approximately two billion dollars of Western cigarettes a year, an amount that seems disproportionately high given that only about 20% of inhabitants smoke. In addition, local cigarettes sell for around 30 cents a pack, one-third of the price of Western cigarettes. Western cigarettes cost around a dollar a pack in Afghanistan. Officially, the Afghan government levies an excise tax of 20% on imported cigarettes. In June 2015, that tax was increased to 100%. In addition, cigarettes sold in Afghanistan are required to bear a government stamp showing that the excise tax has been paid. It appears that the excise tax and its required documentation are largely ignored. Kabul street markets are full of vendors selling Western cigarettes all clearly marked ""South Asia Duty Free Sales Only"" and absent any government excise tax stamp.  Taliban cigarette smugglingThere are only a handful of Duty Free Stores in Afghanistan, about a half dozen at major airports and border crossings, and a few that cater to ISAF personnel and diplomatic staff. It's hard to imagine that these stores, perhaps a dozen or two, are responsible for sales of two billion dollars of foreign cigarettes. Those same cigarettes in India will fetch four to five times the average Afghan street price. It's unclear how much cigarette smuggling adds to the Taliban's coffers. It could be in the range of 100 to 200 million dollars a year.In addition, the Taliban operates a range of commercial businesses, including emerald mines in Pakistan's Swat Valley, timber concessions, some of which are legal some illegal, and marble quarries. The Taliban also levies taxes on citizens and businesses in areas they control. The extent of the contribution from these operations is unclear.  Emeralds from the Taliban controlled Mingora Mine, Swat Valley, PakistanKidnappings are another important source of revenue. Although the United States remains resolute in not paying ransoms for kidnapped Americans (The Bowe Bergdahl case notwithstanding), other European countries have been willing to ransom their citizens. France and Italy have both paid multi-million dollar ransoms to free their nationals. Even Great Britain, which ostensibly agrees with the United States in not paying ransoms, has, it is rumored, on at least one occasion, paid a ransom to free a kidnapped Briton. In addition, extortion against nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the form of protection money or payments for ""security services"" is also common. Additionally, kidnappings or extortion of Afghan citizens in both Afghanistan and Pakistan also add to the Taliban's funds. All told, kidnappings and extortion of westerners, NGOs, and others probably contributes around 50 million dollars yearly.Two other major sources of Taliban funding are Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Agency (ISI) and, ironically, indirectly, the United States itself. Pakistan has supplied the Taliban with a broad range of arms, supplies, and financial help. In addition, the ISI has also assisted the Taliban's smuggling operations, indirectly adding to their financing. A significant portion of the Taliban's Pakistani financing in turn came, ironically, from American sources. Pakistan has been a major recipient of US military and financial aid over the course of the past 15 years. Direct US military and economic assistance to Pakistan has amounted to over 20 billion dollars since 2001. Moreover, a significant amount of additional US aid to Pakistan was channeled through third party contractors. Pakistan was also reimbursed by ISAF for various services that it provided to American and coalition troops.ISAF soldier keeps watch during construction of Route Trident in Helmand Province, AfghanistanDirectly and indirectly, U.S. financial aid to the Pakistani government is probably upward of 40 billion dollars. A significant amount of that aid went to the ISI, and from there some portion went to finance the Taliban. There is no way to determine what is the actual amount of financial support that the ISI has given the Taliban or how much of this assistance was derived from U.S. aid programs, since much of this aid is in the form of various services and supplies. The Afghan government estimates that actual cash transfers to the Taliban from the ISI have been in the range of 200 to 400 million dollars yearly.Ironically, another major source of funding for the Taliban has been the construction projects undertaken under the auspices of ISAF, and the bilateral aid programs of the US and other European countries. After three decades of warfare, much of Afghan's infrastructure had been destroyed. Large portions of its major cities had been reduced to rubble. Power transmission grids, roads, and rail networks have all suffered extensive damage. All told approximately 30 billion to 50 billion dollars was spent on a broad range of construction projects. Many contractors will now readily admit that they routinely added 10% to as much as 40% to the cost of such projects to kick back to the Taliban as protection money.On a recent trip to Afghanistan one contractor recounted to me a story of a bridge in Helmand province that was built and destroyed a total of six times. According to the story, the contractor agreed to add 20% to the budget for the project and to kick that amount back to the Taliban as protection money on condition that the Taliban would not blow up the bridge until he had been paid for the construction job.  Taliban fighters in AfghanistanOnce the funds had been received he promptly paid the Taliban their cut and they proceeded to blow up the bridge. According to the contractor, the bridge was built and destroyed a total of six times, each time the Taliban getting their 20% of the construction budget. In conversations with other contractors, I tried to confirm if the story was true. All I could get was a chuckle followed by an enigmatic smile. Everyone I spoke to did confirm, however, that it was standard practice to build in a kick back to the Taliban to insure that militants did not attack or disrupt a construction project and that there were numerous examples of projects that were rebuilt multiple times.I do not know if the story of the Helmand Bridge is true. I doubt we will ever know, but it is nonetheless a fitting metaphor for what happened in Afghanistan during the construction boom that followed the American intervention. Afghan intelligence sources estimate that the Taliban was able to skim off between 10% and 20% of the funds that were earmarked for construction over a roughly ten year period. That would put the Taliban's take at somewhere between five and ten billion dollars over this period, or roughly an average of $500 million to a billion dollars a year.The one refrain I heard while I was in Afghanistan, from everyone, government sources, RSM personnel and the proverbial ""Afghan man on the street"", was that ""the Taliban has plenty of money"" and that ""for the Taliban money is no problem."" Considering that the Taliban leadership was largely uneducated and inexperienced in matters of finance, it is remarkable that they could administer a multi-stream financial empire that was spitting out yearly several billion dollars in income or that they could do this while in hiding in Afghanistan's and Pakistan's remote mountain wilderness. It stands to reason that managing sums of money of this magnitude, collecting them, moving them around and spending them, would require a fairly sophisticated financial network and experienced money managers. Here again, all signs point to the ISI. They already have a track record managing and moving around sums of this magnitude having done it once before for the CIA while funding the mujahedeen fighters in Afghanistan during the 1980s. No doubt, the reputation of ISI personnel for having sticky fingers gives them a powerful incentive to manage the Taliban's cash. In fact, the Taliban's most significant weapon is not its arms or its ability to mobilize jihadists, but the vast sums of money that it seems to have at its disposal. The Taliban has billions with which to buy influence, corrupt government officials, and suborn even the most resistant opponent. Money can buy guns and recruit soldiers, but its insidious effects in undermining opposition and corrupting government security forces is far more deadly and a far more formidable challenge. Considering that al-Qaeda's attack on September 11 cost less than 300,000 dollars, a jihadist organization with the Taliban's financial resources should be a matter of serious concern. The most effective strategy for destroying the Taliban once and for all is to uncover the financial networks that it uses to move money around, to cutoff its funding sources, and shut down the smuggling networks and illicit activities that it uses to fund its operations. It may well be that in time the Taliban may drop any pretense of jihadism or a political agenda and simply revert to a criminal enterprise, a common enough evolution among political-terrorist organizations. For now the most effective strategy the US can use to shut down the Taliban is simply to ""follow the money."""

France and Italy have both paid multi-million dollar ransoms to free their nationals. Even Great Britain, which ostensibly agrees with the United States in not paying ransoms, has, it is rumored, on at least one occasion, paid a ransom to free a kidnapped Briton. In addition, extortion against nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the form of protection money or payments for ""security services"" is also common. Additionally, kidnappings or extortion of Afghan citizens in both Afghanistan and Pakistan also add to the Taliban's funds. All told, kidnappings and extortion of westerners, NGOs, and others probably contributes around 50 million dollars yearly.Two other major sources of Taliban funding are Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Agency (ISI) and, ironically, indirectly, the United States itself. Pakistan has supplied the Taliban with a broad range of arms, supplies, and financial help. In addition, the ISI has also assisted the Taliban's smuggling operations, indirectly adding to their financing. A significant portion of the Taliban's Pakistani financing in turn came, ironically, from American sources. Pakistan has been a major recipient of US military and financial aid over the course of the past 15 years. Direct US military and economic assistance to Pakistan has amounted to over 20 billion dollars since 2001. Moreover, a significant amount of additional US aid to Pakistan was channeled through third party contractors. Pakistan was also reimbursed by ISAF for various services that it provided to American and coalition troops.ISAF soldier keeps watch during construction of Route Trident in Helmand Province, AfghanistanDirectly and indirectly, U.S. financial aid to the Pakistani government is probably upward of 40 billion dollars. A significant amount of that aid went to the ISI, and from there some portion went to finance the Taliban. There is no way to determine what is the actual amount of financial support that the ISI has given the Taliban or how much of this assistance was derived from U.S. aid programs, since much of this aid is in the form of various services and supplies. The Afghan government estimates that actual cash transfers to the Taliban from the ISI have been in the range of 200 to 400 million dollars yearly.Ironically, another major source of funding for the Taliban has been the construction projects undertaken under the auspices of ISAF, and the bilateral aid programs of the US and other European countries. After three decades of warfare, much of Afghan's infrastructure had been destroyed. Large portions of its major cities had been reduced to rubble. Power transmission grids, roads, and rail networks have all suffered extensive damage. All told approximately 30 billion to 50 billion dollars was spent on a broad range of construction projects. Many contractors will now readily admit that they routinely added 10% to as much as 40% to the cost of such projects to kick back to the Taliban as protection money.On a recent trip to Afghanistan one contractor recounted to me a story of a bridge in Helmand province that was built and destroyed a total of six times. According to the story, the contractor agreed to add 20% to the budget for the project and to kick that amount back to the Taliban as protection money on condition that the Taliban would not blow up the bridge until he had been paid for the construction job.  Taliban fighters in AfghanistanOnce the funds had been received he promptly paid the Taliban their cut and they proceeded to blow up the bridge. According to the contractor, the bridge was built and destroyed a total of six times, each time the Taliban getting their 20% of the construction budget. In conversations with other contractors, I tried to confirm if the story was true. All I could get was a chuckle followed by an enigmatic smile. Everyone I spoke to did confirm, however, that it was standard practice to build in a kick back to the Taliban to insure that militants did not attack or disrupt a construction project and that there were numerous examples of projects that were rebuilt multiple times.I do not know if the story of the Helmand Bridge is true. I doubt we will ever know, but it is nonetheless a fitting metaphor for what happened in Afghanistan during the construction boom that followed the American intervention. Afghan intelligence sources estimate that the Taliban was able to skim off between 10% and 20% of the funds that were earmarked for construction over a roughly ten year period. That would put the Taliban's take at somewhere between five and ten billion dollars over this period, or roughly an average of $500 million to a billion dollars a year.The one refrain I heard while I was in Afghanistan, from everyone, government sources, RSM personnel and the proverbial ""Afghan man on the street"", was that ""the Taliban has plenty of money"" and that ""for the Taliban money is no problem."" Considering that the Taliban leadership was largely uneducated and inexperienced in matters of finance, it is remarkable that they could administer a multi-stream financial empire that was spitting out yearly several billion dollars in income or that they could do this while in hiding in Afghanistan's and Pakistan's remote mountain wilderness. It stands to reason that managing sums of money of this magnitude, collecting them, moving them around and spending them, would require a fairly sophisticated financial network and experienced money managers. Here again, all signs point to the ISI. They already have a track record managing and moving around sums of this magnitude having done it once before for the CIA while funding the mujahedeen fighters in Afghanistan during the 1980s. No doubt, the reputation of ISI personnel for having sticky fingers gives them a powerful incentive to manage the Taliban's cash. In fact, the Taliban's most significant weapon is not its arms or its ability to mobilize jihadists, but the vast sums of money that it seems to have at its disposal. The Taliban has billions with which to buy influence, corrupt government officials, and suborn even the most resistant opponent. Money can buy guns and recruit soldiers, but its insidious effects in undermining opposition and corrupting government security forces is far more deadly and a far more formidable challenge. Considering that al-Qaeda's attack on September 11 cost less than 300,000 dollars, a jihadist organization with the Taliban's financial resources should be a matter of serious concern. The most effective strategy for destroying the Taliban once and for all is to uncover the financial networks that it uses to move money around, to cutoff its funding sources, and shut down the smuggling networks and illicit activities that it uses to fund its operations. It may well be that in time the Taliban may drop any pretense of jihadism or a political agenda and simply revert to a criminal enterprise, a common enough evolution among political-terrorist organizations. For now the most effective strategy the US can use to shut down the Taliban is simply to ""follow the money."""
22,BUSINESS,7 Challenges Successful People Overcome,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/7-challenges-successful-p_b_7881826.html,,2015-11-14,2015-07-27-1438025443-7545781-7ChallengesSuccessfulPeopleOvercomeHP.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-07-27-1438025443-7545781-7ChallengesSuccessfulPeopleOvercomeHP-thumb.jpg,"It's truly fascinating how successful people approach problems. Where others see impenetrable barriers, they see challenges to embrace and obstacles to overcome.Their confidence in the face of hardship is driven by the ability to let go of the negativity that holds so many otherwise sensible people back.Martin Seligman at the University of Pennsylvania has studied this phenomenon more than anyone else has, and he's found that success in life is driven by one critical distinction--whether you believe that your failures are produced by personal deficits beyond your control or that they are mistakes you can fix with effort.Success isn't the only thing determined by your mindset. Seligman has found much higher rates of depression in people who attribute their failures to personal deficits. Optimists fare better; they treat failure as learning experiences and believe they can do better in the future.This success mindset requires emotional intelligence (EQ), and it's no wonder that, among the million-plus people that TalentSmart has tested, 90% of top performers have high EQs.Maintaining the success mindset isn't easy. There are seven things, in particular, that tend to shatter it. These challenges drag people down because they appear to be barriers that cannot be overcome. Not so for successful people, as these seven challenges never hold them back.1. AgeAge really is just a number. Successful people don't let their age define who they are and what they are capable of. Just ask Betty White or any young, thriving entrepreneur.I remember a professor in graduate school who told our class that we were all too young and inexperienced to do consulting work. He said we had to go work for another company for several years before we could hope to succeed as independent consultants. I was the youngest person in the class, and I sat there doing work for my consulting clients while he droned on.Without fail, people feel compelled to tell you what you should and shouldn't do because of your age. Don't listen to them. Successful people certainly don't. They follow their heart and allow their passion--not the body they're living in--to be their guide.""They follow their heart and allow their passion--not the body they're living in--to be their guide.""2. What Other People ThinkWhen your sense of pleasure and satisfaction are derived from comparing yourself to others, you are no longer the master of your own destiny. While it's impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you, you don't have to hold up your accomplishments to anyone else's, and you can always take people's opinions with a grain of salt. That way, no matter what other people are thinking or doing, your self-worth comes from within.Successful people know that caring about what other people think is a waste of time and energy. When successful people feel good about something that they've done, they don't let anyone's opinions take that away from them.""No matter what other people think of you at any particular moment, one thing is certain--you're never as good or bad as they say you are.""3. Toxic PeopleSuccessful people believe in a simple notion: you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.Just think about it--some of the most successful companies in recent history were founded by brilliant pairs. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak of Apple lived in the same neighborhood, Bill Gates and Paul Allen of Microsoft met in prep school, and Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google met at Stanford.Just as great people help you to reach your full potential, toxic people drag you right down with them. Whether it's negativity, cruelty, the victim syndrome, or just plain craziness, toxic people create stress and strife that should be avoided at all costs.If you're unhappy with where you are in your life, just take a look around. More often than not, the people you've surrounded yourself with are the root of your problems.  ""You'll never reach your peak until you surround yourself with the right people.""4. FearFear is nothing more than a lingering emotion that's fueled by your imagination. Danger is real. It's the uncomfortable rush of adrenaline you get when you almost step in front of a bus. Fear is a choice. Successful people know this better than anyone does, so they flip fear on its head. They are addicted to the euphoric feeling they get from conquering their fears.Don't ever hold back in life just because you feel scared. I often hear people say, ""What's the worst thing that can happen to you? Will it kill you?"" Yet, death isn't the worst thing that can happen to you...""The worst thing that can happen to you is allowing yourself to die inside while you're still alive.""5. NegativityLife won't always go the way you want it to, but when it comes down to it, you have the same 24 hours in the day as everyone else does. Successful people make their time count. Instead of complaining about how things could have been or should have been, they reflect on everything they have to be grateful for. Then they find the best solution available, tackle the problem, and move on.When the negativity comes from someone else, successful people avoid it by setting limits and distancing themselves from it. Think of it this way:""If the complainer were smoking, would you sit there all afternoon inhaling the second-hand smoke?""Of course not. You'd distance yourself, and you should do the same with all negative people.A great way to stop complainers in their tracks is to ask them how they intend to fix the problem they're complaining about. They will either quiet down or redirect the conversation in a productive direction.6. The Past or the FutureLike fear, the past and the future are products of your mind. No amount of guilt can change the past, and no amount of anxiety can change the future. Successful people know this, and they focus on living in the present moment. It's impossible to reach your full potential if you're constantly somewhere else, unable to fully embrace the reality (good or bad) of this very moment.To live in the moment, you must do two things:1) Accept your past. If you don't make peace with your past, it will never leave you and it will create your future. Successful people know the only good time to look at the past is to see how far you've come.2) Accept the uncertainty of the future, and don't place unnecessary expectations upon yourself. Worry has no place in the here and now. As Mark Twain once said,""Worrying is like paying a debt you don't owe.""7. The State of the World Keep your eyes on the news for any length of time and you'll see it's just one endless cycle of war, violent attacks, fragile economies, failing companies, and environmental disasters. It's easy to think the world is headed downhill fast.And who knows? Maybe it is. But successful people don't worry about that because they don't get caught up in things they can't control. Instead, they focus their energy on directing the two things that are completely within their power--their attention and their effort. They focus their attention on all the things they're grateful for, and they look for the good that's happening in the world. They focus their effort on doing what they can every single day to improve their own lives and the world around them, because these small steps are all it takes to make the world a better place.""They focus their effort on doing what they can every single day to improve their own lives and the world around them...""Bringing It All TogetherYour success is driven by your mindset. With discipline and focus, you can ensure that these seven obstacles never hold you back from reaching your full potential.What other challenges do successful people overcome?

23,BUSINESS,10 Communication Secrets of Great Leaders,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-communication-secrets_b_7881738.html,,2015-11-14,2015-07-27-1438024930-3533255-10CommunicationSecretsofGreatLeadersHP.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-07-27-1438024930-3533255-10CommunicationSecretsofGreatLeadersHP-thumb.jpg,"No one ever became a great leader without first becoming a great communicator.Great leaders connect with people on an emotional level every time they speak. Their words inspire others to achieve more than they ever thought possible.Great communicators are intentional about it, and there are 10 secrets they rely on to deliver a powerful message. Put these secrets to work in your communication and watch your influence soar.1. They Know Their AudienceGreat communicators don't worry about sounding important, showing off their expertise, or boosting their own egos. Instead, they think about what people need to hear, and how they can deliver this message so that people will be able to hear it. This doesn't mean that leaders tell people what they want to hear. Quite the opposite­--they tell people what's important for them to know, even if it's bad news.2. They Are Experts In Body LanguageGreat communicators are constantly tracking people's reactions to their message. They are quick to pick up on cues like facial expressions and body language because they know this is the only feedback many people will give them. Great communicators use this expertise to tailor their message on the fly and adjust their communication style as needed.3. They Are HonestThe best leaders know that for communication to be effective it has to be real. They can't have people parsing every word trying to separate fact from spin. When great communicators can't share certain information, they come right out and say it because makeshift, half-truth answers breed distrust and anxiety. In good times and bad, honesty builds trust.4. They Are AuthenticGreat communicators don't try to be someone they're not just because they've stepped behind a podium. There's a reason Mark Zuckerberg presented Facebook to investors in a hoodie and jeans. Great leaders know that when they stay true to who they are, people gravitate to their message. They also know the opposite happens when leaders put on an act.5. They Speak With AuthorityGreat communicators don't try to cover their backs by being ambiguous, wishy-washy, or unassertive. Instead, they stick their necks out and speak very directly about how things are and how they need to be.6. They Speak To Groups As IndividualsLeaders rarely have the luxury of speaking to one person at a time. Whether it's a huddle around a conference table or an overflowing auditorium, great leaders know how to work the room and make every single person feel as if he or she is being spoken to directly.7. They Have Ears (And They Use Them)Great leaders know that communication is a two-way street and what they hear is often more important than what they say. When someone else is speaking, great communicators aren't thinking ahead and planning what they'll say next. Instead, they're actively listening, fully focused on understanding the other person's perspective.8. They Use Phrases Like ""It's My Fault,"" ""I Was Wrong,"" and ""I'm Sorry""When great leaders make a mistake, they admit it right away. They don't wait for someone else to find and point out their blunder. They model accountability for their words and actions, even when they could have easily ""gotten away"" with the mistake. And they do it matter-of-factly, without drama or false humility.9. They Solicit FeedbackThe best communicators never assume that the message people heard is the exact same one they intended to deliver. They check in to verify that their message was understood correctly, and, if it was not, they don't blame the audience. Instead, they change things up and try again.10. They're ProactiveLeaders with the best communication skills don't waste time playing catch-up. They're quick to head off the rumor mill by sharing bad news in a timely manner. They also give clear, concise goals and directions so people don't waste their time heading in the wrong direction.Bringing It All TogetherGreat communicators stand out from the crowd. They're honest. They're authentic. They listen. They excel in communication because they value it, and that's the critical first step to becoming a great leader.What other strategies make for great communication?

The program was created to raise awareness of the value of integrating the arts, including media arts, into STEM curricula and to highlight existing K-12 public schools across the country that have developed successful, measurable and replicable STEAM programs which could serve as national models. The innOVATION STEAM Grant Awards Program represents the first funding program of its kind for STEAM education. The award recipients, were:• BOSTON ARTS ACADEMY Boston, MAThe Ovation Foundation's panel of experts found that the highest-ranking schools, listed above, shared some similarities, or best practices. The panel found that high-quality STEAM education:• Incorporates the expertise of both STEM and arts educators to create an authentic interdisciplinary experience for students: co-teaching model / co-planning is strong & replicable; • Is thoroughly planned, including the identification of state or national standards in each subject area, balancing standards offered from each subject equally; • Borrows from scientific method, the iterative artistic and creative processes, and artistic production and exhibition as critical milestones in the experience; • Has the buy-in of school administrators; • Leverages local artists, artisans, scientists, area nonprofits and other experts, as appropriate; • Is well-documented through photography, lesson plans and other means, as a method of advocacy and to ensure partnership longevity for STEAM as a new instructional method; • Has a tangible outcome, such as an artistic product, scientific experiment, architectural or design specs or other artifacts; • Allows students to direct their own learning through experimentation, positioning teachers as guides and personalizing learning; • Leverages real-world connections wherever possible and highlights the nexus of career and technical education and the arts; • Includes built-in, tailored assessments that help students and teachers understand what students have learned and what they have not; • Includes solid, clear and well-constructed rubrics that integrate the arts. In a foreword to a publication produced for the ceremony, Charles Segars, CEO, Ovation, Rachel Goslins, Executive Director, President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, and Robert Lynch, President and CEO, Americans for the Arts, said :""The benefits of arts education have been proven time and time again by various studies and research spanning decades. From students improving their reading, writing and math skills, to preparing a 21st Century workforce, to curbing drop out rates among at-risk youth, the advantages of investing in arts education are numerous ... Taught in tandem with traditional STEM subjects, the arts build skills of creativity, improvisation and open-ended thinking that are critical to innovation."" Also attending the ceremony in Washington, D.C. were Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR) and Elise Stefanik (R-NY), co-Chairs of the Congressional STEAM Caucus. Representative Bonamici said ""I am working to advance the innovative approach to education that these eight schools embody,"" The innOVATION STEAM Grant Awards aim to provide the education field with national models. We believe the moment is now for the arts to be incorporated into STEM education. The Ovation Foundation has provided further information including a resulting publication, information about the recipients, model lesson plans, resources, and more at a site dedicated to the innovation program."
