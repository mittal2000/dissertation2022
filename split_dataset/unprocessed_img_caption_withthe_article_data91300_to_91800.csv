It should go without saying these animals differ from humans on many essential anatomical levels. These differences lead to sub-par training. Today, high-tech simulation devices based on human anatomy allow trainees to work with lifelike human skin, fat, and muscle. These medical simulation devices can now replicate the look, feel, and even smell of severe combat injuries. And unlike anesthetized animals, high-tech simulators can move and respond. Plenty of evidence exists that this training is now as effective as the use of live animals, if not more effective. In fact, more than 95 percent of civilian trauma programs have already switched to modern simulators. The Uniformed Services University -- the military medical school -- now trains future military physicians without using animals and, as of January 2015, Advanced Trauma Life Support courses across the U.S. military no longer use live animals either. To ensure that our armed forces are using the most advanced trauma training, we've introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation--the Battlefield Excellence through Superior Training, or BEST Practices Act. Our bill modernizes military combat trauma courses by phasing out the use of live animals over several years. In so doing, it improves the standard of care for troops sent into harm's way. The bottom line is that maiming, burning, and killing animals isn't necessary because better training methods are readily available. We'll be working with our colleagues to make sure the BEST Practices Act brings the DoD into the 21st century of combat trauma training.

I could have if I'd really worked at it, but I didn't. I even bought a health club, thinking I could teach aerobics and it would miraculously disappear.

The universe can be cold when you need to wake-up and face reality.Life went on, and twenty lus years later I still hate my stomach, but I'm trying to let it go. I am 10 pounds overweight, (give or take a few), which is not bad for someone who loathes exercise.I don't worry much about my stomach these days, because I'm trying to figure out how to get my eyebrows back. Stomachs can be hidden, camouflaged, buried under clothing. Eyebrows? Not so much.I've had the thyroid test and all is normal.

5,POLITICS,How A Man Who Got His Start In Construction Became The Most Powerful Foreign Policy Voice In Congress,Jessica Schulberg and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bob-corker-senate-foreign-relations_n_7088102.html,,2015-04-19,"WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 14: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Bob Corker (L) (R-TN) confers with ranking member Sen. Ben Cardin (R) (D-MD) during a committee markup meeting on the proposed nuclear agreement with Iran April 14, 2015 in Washington, DC. A bipartisan compromise reached by Corker and Cardin would create a review period that is shorter than originally proposed for a final nuclear deal with Iran and creates compromise language on the removal of sanctions contingent on Iran ceasing support for terrorism. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f32e3c000020010e01ad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Last week witnessed one of the most piqued foreign policy showdowns between the executive and legislative branch during the Obama presidency. And in a clash between a president allied with his secretary of state and vice president -- themselves former chairmen of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- it was a self-admitted newbie to international affairs who scored the win.The 19-0 Foreign Relations Committee vote to ensure congressional oversight of a final nuclear deal with Iran was unexpected, considering the current political climate in which bipartisan cooperation is increasingly scarce. But the vote also signified the arrival of a new player in the foreign policy debates of this country. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the committee’s chairman and the man widely credited with engineering the political breakthrough, is now one of the most prominent foreign policy voices in Congress. Even for him, it's an unexpected ascendance.“I think what you just said is an understatement,” he told The Huffington Post, in response to an observation about his limited foreign policy experience before becoming senator in 2007. “I had almost no foreign policy experience and certainly did not major in political science or anything like that in college.”What Corker lacks in experience, he makes up with effusive cordiality and a realist's approach. He applied that in droves in order to sell a bill that the administration deemed a constitutional overreach and his own party considered a half step. To save his bill, he convinced fellow Republicans to make two significant concessions: They agreed to cut a requirement that the president certify that Iran is not supporting acts of terror against Americans and shortened the period of time that Congress has to review the nuclear deal -- during which time there will be a freeze on lifting any congressionally enacted sanctions.In turn, Democrats, including some who had loudly opposed the original bill, offered their support for the legislation and President Barack Obama rescinded his veto threat.The administration, which opposed the bill even the morning of its passage through committee, declared that it had succeeded in watering it down to a point where it would no longer harm nuclear negotiations. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) dismissed the new bill as “innocuous.”Corker and his allies called it spin. They didn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, they conceded. But they still got the good. Corker's work getting there earned him praise from both sides of the aisle.In Time’s recent “100 Most Influential People” issue, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) called his junior colleague an obvious choice for the next secretary of state, secretary of the treasury or even president. “I think Sen. Corker is bringing a refreshing spirit of openness to input and contributions from both Republicans and Democrats that is in strong contrast to some of the other recent, much more partisan actions by Republican senators,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) last Tuesday.Coons, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee who became a co-sponsor of the Corker bill after the modified version passed the panel, told HuffPost that while he was traveling in Africa the week prior to the vote, he received phone calls at odd hours of the night from Corker, discussing ways to get an agreement on the bill. Corker’s efforts, he said, were “relentless.”Praise aside, Corker is the first to admit that he was an unlikely candidate to be at the forefront of debate on the role Congress should play in international nuclear negotiations with a longtime U.S. adversary.His degree is in industrial management from the University of Tennessee, which is about 100 miles away from Chattanooga, the city where he has spent most of life. After graduating, he worked as a construction superintendent, eventually saving $8,000 to start his own construction company.One of Corker’s first trips overseas, a church-organized mission trip to Haiti, left him not with a heightened interest in foreign affairs but with a desire to be more involved in his own community. Shortly after, he started a nonprofit with a focus on affordable housing.He went on to climb the ranks of Tennessee politics, ascending from state commissioner of finance and administration, to mayor of Chattanooga, to U.S. senator.In 2006, he swept the Republican primary election, beating out two former congressmen, both of whom tried to convince the electorate that Corker was an untrustworthy leftist. In the general election, he ran against then-Rep. Harold Ford Jr. (D) during a terrible year for Republicans. The race was marked by a highly controversial ad run by an independent group, contracted by the Republican National Committee, that depicted Corker’s African-American opponent Ford as a party boy with an affinity for attractive white women. Corker called the ad “distasteful” and said it should be dropped from the airwaves. But the suspicion was that he did not mind benefitting from the collateral damage.After securing the Senate seat, he ended up on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee somewhat by chance. “I joined the committee really to make myself a better senator,” recalled Corker. “It wasn’t necessarily a keen interest in foreign policy. I just felt like that was an area where I need to learn more.”As part of his learning process, Corker visited more than 60 countries, including such faraway outposts as Mali, Bahrain and Oman. He often went alone, without an organized congressional delegation, and incorporated an extensive reading of world news into his morning routine.According to Corker, membership on the foreign relations panel was not in high demand within his party when he entered the Senate. By their own rules, Senate Republicans may serve on only one of the four ”Super A” committees -- foreign relations, armed services, finance and appropriations -- at a time. The real competition, he said, was for a spot on the Finance Committee.As the new chairman, he hopes to change that by selling his own party members on the idea that you can have a big imprint on world affairs not just by serving on the armed services committee. “One of my goals is that over the course of the next short period of time, it resumes [being] not just a place that is hard to get on the Democratic side of the aisle, but is very difficult to get on in the Republican side too, just because of people’s desire to be there,” he said of the Foreign Relations Committee.To some of his colleagues, the revised Iran bill constitutes a big step toward elevating the committee’s relevance. “I think too much of the last decade, we have seen the reduced emphasis on Congress taking an independent view looking at foreign policy issues. I think it is important for us to go back to that,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who recalled growing up watching Arkansas Sen. J. William Fulbright tackle the Vietnam War as committee chair.Shaheen, who offered her support for the bill after the modified version was introduced, told HuffPost on Friday that she was impressed with Corker’s interest in hearing suggestions from Democrats on how to make the bill something they could get behind.While his committee colleagues agree that the chairman has developed impressive foreign policy chops, they point to his businesslike approach to politics as the main reason for their faith in his leadership.“I think the fact that he was a mayor and someone who had a long and successful career in the private sector makes him a pragmatist,” said Coons. “He is a conservative Republican, we do not agree on many political issues, but he has an outcome orientation.""If Corker were merely willing to hear out Democratic concerns, he would be a good-natured chairman but probably not a successful one. On Iran, it was his ability to move his own party -- and to stomach the downsizing of his own agenda -- that ended up being critical to the passage of the bill out of committee. In the days leading up to the committee vote, he persuaded several Republicans to hold back on offering amendments that would have made the bill untenable for Democrats -- including an amendment by presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to require Iran to recognize Israel.Before that, he withheld his support for a letter signed by 47 of his colleagues, telling leaders in Iran that any nuclear agreement reached with the U.S. and its five negotiating partners could easily be undone by Congress or a future president.The most critical moment, however, came earlier in the year. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), perhaps Corker’s strongest Democratic ally, teamed up with fellow Iran hawk Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) to craft legislation that would ramp up sanctions against Iran if a final nuclear deal were not reached by the June 30 deadline. The sanctions bill, which was sent to the Senate Banking Committee, has 44 Republican co-sponsors -- but Corker is not one of them.It was a strategic decision -- a recognition that if that bill were to ultimately pass and a deal with Iran were to fall apart, the blame would be put squarely on Congress and, in particular, the Republican Party in control of both chambers.“I did believe that there was truth to what the administration was saying regarding the fact that if it passed during the negotiations, then it’d be like, you know, it’d be like rolling a hand grenade in the room,” explained Corker, who also sits on the Banking Committee. “And I didn’t want the United States to be in a position to be blamed by the international community -- I wanted the focus to continue to be on Iran.”Corker would ultimately vote in favor of Kirk-Menendez in the committee markup, but only after it became apparent that Democrats would not allow the bill to become law until after a key deadline in the ongoing nuclear talks. By then, he was turning his attention to fallback options and selling Menendez, then the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, about the benefits of legislation that would guarantee Congress the opportunity to weigh in on any nuclear deal and yet might be less divisive than the sanctions bill.""Corker was reasonable and wanted to create something as an alternative to Kirk-Menendez. This is not a sanctions bill in any way. He realized that wouldn’t fly or get off the ground,” a Democratic Senate aide familiar with the legislative talks told HuffPost."

It is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. It requires a new physician to swear, upon a number of healing gods, to uphold specific ethical standards.---Dear Dr. Oz,You may remember me as I previously reached out to you with a group of national mental health advocates when your name was making headlines for television antics that offended your viewers. I asked for you to engage in a dialogue and to be our hero in shedding light on the use of language in the media around mental health issues. I was calling for your support and attention to our cause of educated awareness at The Flawless Foundation. That was almost two years ago, and here we are again.Today, people are calling for your job.It seems some of your viewers and colleagues have lost their trust in your name, your show and, above all else, your word. In recent headlines, medical professionals have sent a letter to Columbia University questioning the validity of your advice and product endorsements. They are wondering how you could maintain an academic position at such a prestigious institution.As I read article after article, I can't help but think that perhaps your TV persona has clouded your judgment and compromised the Hippocratic Oath that is sacred and binding to those in the field of medicine. Have TV ratings replaced your promise to heal those who seek your help?The Hippocratic Oath reads, ""Warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug."" When I watch your show -- and especially the episode that I wrote about deeming patients with mental health challenges ""Normal or Nuts"" -- the oath becomes the last thing that comes to mind.There is a lack of trust when people hear your name. I understand that your have two roles to satisfy, a celebrity figure and a medical professional, which I imagine can be difficult to juggle. You, however, are also sworn to two more covenants: heal with good intention and do no harm. And as I put simply in this video reflection, shouldn't we all just try to live with integrity and do no harm? I wonder what you would think if you just watched your show strictly as a medical professional who has sworn to the Hippocratic Oath. Do you think you are honoring your lifelong promise? We all struggle with issues of right and wrong. But maybe it is time to look at the challenges of balancing the sacred profession of practicing medicine with media and fame.You often talk about people being their best and healthiest selves. The offer I wrote to you two years ago still stands. Let's talk, let's heal, and let's go viral with a message of pure intention to be our best selves.Will you be the hero and doctor you swore to be?"

Lynch has recently been the top U.S. prosecutor in Brooklyn, and would be the first African American woman to hold the position of Attorney General if confirmed. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f34b2400005000577b28.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell hinted that a vote will finally come on Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch. Another GOP senator Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, assured that a Senate vote on Lynch is practically days away. It probably will happen this time. The GOP has been pounded, lambasted and pulverized for weeks by President Obama, Democrats and every civil rights group around for shamefully stalling Lynch's confirmation. She has the distinction courtesy of the GOP of having her nomination held hostage to anti-Obama hard core partisan politics longer than any Attorney General nominee since the Reagan administration.The issue has never been Lynch's legal and administrative credentials. They are impeccable. The issue is not really the trumped up issue that McConnell and GOP leaders claimed was the reason for the unconscionable foot-drag on her confirmation and that's that they wanted a vote on an anti-human trafficking law. The issue is their die-hard, take no prisoners, assault on Obama.Even when Lynch is confirmed, that won't change. The first long and loud warning that Lynch would be held as a hostage to the GOP's assault on Obama's policies came virtually the moment he announced that he had chosen her to replace AG Eric Holder. GOP Senators Chuck Grassley and Ted Cruz, both of whom sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, publicly made it clear that they ticked off that Obama would tap Lynch when many Democrats are lame ducks, and thus not giving the incoming wave of GOP Senate members a chance to have their say on Lynch. This was in December. But this limp excuse fell apart when month after month after the new batch of GOP senators were sworn in Lynch's nomination still languished unmentioned and unaddressed by GOP senate leaders. They then snatched at yet another ploy. They harped that that she was supposedly close to Al Sharpton, and met with him during the protests around the strangle death of Eric Garner by New York police. This quickly morphed into the wild, irresponsible and politically loaded question, ""Did Sharpton pick the next attorney general?"" -- that being Lynch. That ploy quickly went by the wayside when no one could produce a shred of proof that Sharpton had had any backroom dealings with Lynch or Obama on her.Then again that wasn't really the issue anyway. It was that Lynch was Obama's pick. The GOP could latch on to this in its relentless drive to tar Obama as an imperial president who thumbs his nose at Congress at every turn and chooses partisan handmaidens to do his bidding.The GOP played that card repeatedly during every moment of Holder's tenure at the Justice Department. It began during his Senate confirmation hearing in 2009. He was grilled over his role as Deputy Attorney General in Bill Clinton's administration in a handful of controversial decisions. Holder was overwhelmingly confirmed as Attorney General. Yet, the flack he took was only the start. The GOP viewed him as a pawn in their relentless attack plan on Obama. If they could discredit, taint and tarnish Holder for even the most picayune act, it would be another slap at Obama.The GOP had yet another reason to try and figure out a way to brush aside Lynch's sterling credentials and make her a target. She almost certainly would carry on the fight Holder waged against voter registration discrimination through aggressive enforcement of the voting rights laws. This poses a major threat to the GOP's push to undermine the Voting Rights Act with a rash of voter ID laws and restrictions, topped by the lawsuit before the Supreme Court to scrub the Act.This is even more important with the opening gun of the 2016 presidential elections at hand. There are already three GOP declared presidential candidates. The GOP's trounce of Democrats in the mid-terms would ultimately be wiped out if there is an upsurge in black and Latino voter's dash back to the polls in 2016. They made a huge difference in Obama's election and reelection victories, and in insuring Democrat gains in many state elections in 2008 and 2012. The full enforcement of the Voting Rights Act is a strong safeguard that those gains could be made again in 2016. This is the last thing the GOP wants. This would virtually insure the continued Democratic hold on the White House.Obama called the GOP's disgraceful delay on Lynch's confirmation, ""embarrassing."" It is that and much more. Yet, Obama is well aware that Lynch from the start was simply a pawn in the GOP's high stakes game to not just embarrass him, but to hamstring his presidency in its final stretch drive to the end of his White House tenure. Its confirmation of Lynch will do absolutely nothing to change that.--Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

George Balanchine's iconic The Four Temperaments set a high bar for the rest of the evening, followed by a much-anticipated new work by Hofesh Shechter. And a 65-minute closer, which violates the rules of programming evenings of dance - except that it's Kenneth MacMillan's Song of the Earth, set to the sublime Mahler song cycle, Das Lied von der Erde.  Tuesday night's performance of Four T's was not as uniformly bracing as generally seen across the pond, though Robert Clark on piano and the Royal Opera House orchestra under Barry Wordsworth gave a crisp account of the Hindemith score. Apart from the stupendous Itziar Mendizabal, who blazed through Choleric like a fighter jet, this cast did not push the off-balance work to the extremes that make Balanchine's 1946 riposte to classicism so exciting. Still, there was much to admire, starting with the sweeping shapes Claire Calvert made with her legs, the poetry of Matthew Golding's every move, the expert partnering by all the men, and the razor-sharp style and aplomb of Lara Turk's dancing - even after her pointe shoe ribbons came completely untied. Turk did not dial down her performance at all, and managed to keep the shoe on and the flying ribbons from tripping her or any of her comrades. The irresistible Vadim Muntagirov radiated the angst and despair of a war-ravaged generation in Melancholic better than any of the current crop of New York City Ballet dancers.

This was Shechter's first commission for the Royal. Unlike the overtly political, in-your-face work he has made for his own company, he has given these ballet dancers an exciting new vocabulary without anything to say. The first few minutes of the ensemble moving as one squadron, their unison staggering, slouching and prowling in a dusty gloom proved riveting. The next two minutes less so.

Hints of Eastern European folk dance, of Omani-style bullfighting, fits of Sufi whirling and chest-slapping, packaged without any dramatic arc, lit by a Trekkie (""beam me up, Scotty""), did nothing to enlighten the situation. The American reality television competition So You Think You Can Dance is littered with countless examples of this style of dance, dubbed 'combat jazz' by Sonya Tayeh, one of the show's most popular choreographers. The SYTYCD format limits these pieces to about 90 seconds, which is about right when you don't have a story to tell or a mood to convey other than belligerence. That the highly trained athletes of the Royal Ballet can master this style should come as no surprise; the real surprise is that Shechter, known for his spine-chilling innovation, failed to exploit the rest of their considerable gifts. The thumping score with Middle Eastern overtones was written by modern Renaissance man Shechter, in collaboration with Nell Catchpole. Voices started chanting what sounded like holy syllables in a Middle Eastern tongue; when her date whispered ""they're singing Nigel Farage"" it meant nothing to Ballet to the People. Until she tuned in to the BBC election debate on Thursday evening and got a full dose of the right-wing politician's toxic fumes. Still, it was hard to take any of this seriously, when the thought of an American composer creating a score for a ballet around an incantation of the name of Texas Senator Ted Cruz just cracked her up.Pairing Untouchable with MacMillan's 1965 Song of the Earth only diminished the power of both. The MacMillan, with its lack of bombast, looked stylistically quaint, and the Shechter even more devoid of meaning. But, like a sturdy clean-up batter, Song of the Earth came through.  MacMillan created a shimmering world and indelible characters, a community stalked by an ever-present Messenger of Death, danced with quiet menace by Edward Watson. Watson eventually tears the trusting Nehemiah Kish from the lovely, dignified Laura Morera, whose journey from hope to anguish, and finally to acceptance, is marked by captivating gestural expressions that bridge mime and pure dance.  The ballet is replete with taut, finely chiseled images of abstract beauty, that also serve as visual metaphors. A group of dancers seated on the floor, with legs extended, magically become a sea, or a ship. Women gliding smoothly over the ground assume the form of angels. Hoisted effortlessly into the air by Kish, Morera stretches and arches her back, high over his head, poised in a perfect balance in his hands - an archer's bow, or a crescent moon. The faintest hints of Chinese influence in movement and shape echo the ancient Chinese poetry that inspired the Mahler song cycle. The entire work is a marvel of austerity and restraint, even as it evokes intense emotion. It's a tricky business programming mixed bills, and taking risks with new choreographers is essential. Hofesh Shechter may have been uncharacteristically risk-averse in his first outing at the Royal; should he be given another shot at these tremendous dancers, Ballet to the People hopes he comes prepared to unleash his full artillery."

Iran's top leader on Thursday stopped short of giving his endorsement to the framework nuclear deal struck last week between Teheran and world powers, while the country's president warned separately that Tehran's approval of a final deal depends on the immediate lifting of all sanctions related to its controversial nuclear program. (AP Photo/Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc149db260000520070a7f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"* Supreme leader says Iran being threatened militarily* Khamenei has supported talks but remains distrustful* IRGC leader rejects inspections of military sites (Adds comments from U.S. senators)By Sam WilkinDUBAI, April 19 (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told military commanders on Sunday the United States had created the ""myth"" of nuclear weapons to portray Iran as a threat, hardening his rhetoric before nuclear negotiations resume this week.Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, has supported the nuclear talks but continues to express deep mistrust of the United States.""They created the myth of nuclear weapons so they could say the Islamic Republic is a source of threat. No, the source of threat is America itself, with its unrestrained, destabilizing interventions,"" Khamenei said in a televised address to a hall of several hundred military commanders.""The other side is methodically and shamelessly threatening us militarily ... even if they did not make these overt threats, we would have to be prepared,"" he said.Political leaders in Iran and the United States have to contend with domestic constituencies skeptical about the outcome of the talks. Khamenei's comments did not appear to suggest he has withdrawn his cautious support for the diplomatic process.Iran and six world powers including the United States reached a framework accord on Iran's disputed nuclear program this month and will resume negotiations in Vienna this week, aiming to reach a final deal by the end of June.The framework accord is a step towards a settlement that would allay Western fears that Iran could build an atomic bomb, with economic sanctions on Tehran being lifted in return.Despite significant progress, the two sides still disagree on several issues, including how quickly international sanctions would be lifted under a final deal. ""NATIONAL HUMILIATION""Earlier this month, Khamenei insisted that all sanctions be lifted immediately on a deal being reached, a condition the U.S. State Department dismissed. He warned of Washington's ""devilish"" intentions, even as he reaffirmed his support for Iran's negotiating team.The deputy commander of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) on Sunday rejected any inspections of military sites as a ""national humiliation,"" highlighting another area of difference between the two sides.""This subject is treasonous and selling out the country, and if anyone speaks of it we will respond with hot lead,"" Hossein Salami said, in comments cited by state news agency IRNA.Republican U.S. Senator Bob Corker, the co-author of legislation that would allow Congress to review any final nuclear deal with Iran, told CNN on Sunday that lifting of sanctions must be phased to ensure Iran's compliance and include broad inspection capabilities for military sites.Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican 2016 presidential candidate, said the agreement thus far leaves too much infrastructure in place for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.He told the CBS program ""Face the Nation"" that U.S. and international sanctions must remain in place, with a warning of U.S. military action if certain thresholds are crossed.""We don't want that to happen, but risk of a nuclear Iran is so great that that option must be on the table,"" Rubio said.Khamenei also criticized U.S. support for a Saudi-led offensive in Yemen, where a coalition of Arab countries is bombing Iran-allied Houthi rebels who seized the capital Sanaa last year and took control of other parts of the country.""Today these tragic events are happening in Yemen and the Americans are supporting the oppressor,"" he said.The four-week old campaign, in which Iran and Western countries have backed opposite sides, began during the last round of nuclear talks. Growing civilian casualties and Western suspicions that Iran is arming the Houthis have added to tensions. (Additional reporting by David Lawder in Washington; Editing by Gareth Jones)"

Sir Henry Moore's ""Spindle"" in Miami (Abu-Fadil)The sculpture I saw at Miami's Intercontinental Hotel is based on Moore's Spindle series and was carved in Italy in 1981.

In ""Miami Attracts the World's Ultra Wealthy,"" a feature in the April issue of Cityscape Abu Dhabimagazine, developers are drawn to the city's growing real estate market in upmarket Miami Beach as well as districts like Wynwood, a former industrial zone, a magnet for galleries, trendy cafés, restaurants and boutiques. Shepard Fairey's wheat-pasted mural (Abu-Fadil)It's noted for, among other things, the Wynwood Walls, an open-air display of street art and graffiti that combines amazing imagination, technique, nuance, peculiarities and beauty.Visitors can walk freely along pathways into open courtyards and alleys, sit at picnic benches, or enjoy a meal or coffee at the café while taking in the mix of colors, genres and designs on display all over the area.Visitors entering Wynwood Walls can't miss Shepard Fairey's wheat-pasted mural with images of the Dalai Lama, Martin Luther King, Jr., and, particularly, as a tribute to Tony Goldman.Goldman, the late patron who conceived of the walls project in 2009, said: ""Wynwood's large stock of warehouse buildings, all with no windows, would be my giant canvases to bring to them the greatest street art ever seen in one place.""Artist Ryan McGinness' 33 Women mural of Day-Glo paint set against a black wall brings out in stark assertion his rendition of female nudes. Ryan McGinness' 33 Women (Abu-Fadil)He is quoted as saying: ""These drawings are my version of what is sexy.""  ""Women on the Walls"" is another perspective on female sensuality by Miss Van, a.k.a. Vanessa Alice Bensimon, and occupies an imposing space in the Wynwood art park. Miss Van, who hails from the French city of Toulouse but has lived in Barcelona and exhibited in various cities, is a noted graffiti and street artist who often renders her female characters' faces into animal and bird visages.   Miss Van's ""Women on the Walls"" (Abu-Fadil)The New York-born, Baltimore-based artist who goes by the single name of Gaia produced an impressive portrait of American oil and railroad tycoon Henry Flagler on one of the walls.Gaia, in Greek mythology a deity personifying the Earth, said of Flagler:If you're from Miami, you've definitely heard of him. He's the reason why Florida is essentially Florida or why Miami is even called Miami... He established Overtown on the west side of the freight tracks for his black workers. This historic neighborhood that sits 15 blocks south of the Wynwood Walls would eventually be decimated by the construction of (interstate highway) I-95 and urban renewal.  Gaia's portrait of American industrialist Henry Flagler (courtesy Kadragic)The area is overflowing with art. I walked outside the main enclosure to find murals on side streets and alleys and well into adjacent neighborhoods.A very realistic portrait of what seems to be a woman -- one can't always tell -- with a fixed look that adorns a segment of a street corner's wall next to a shuttered shop. The vertical stylized script alongside it could almost pass for Arabic. There was no description of it.    Outside the Wynwood Walls (Abu-Fadil)A very colorful mural of four characters from what could be a comic book shows three males (one carrying a bouquet of flowers) and a female with horns holding an ice cream cone.Again, nobody in sight to explain.  Comic book characters street art?

Sir Henry Moore's ""Spindle"" in Miami (Abu-Fadil)The sculpture I saw at Miami's Intercontinental Hotel is based on Moore's Spindle series and was carved in Italy in 1981. It stands majestically at 4.5 meters (14.7 feet) in height and weighs about 70 tons.But that's not all.I enjoyed that aspect of the city on a recent visit and did the traditional thing of discovering the Pérez Art Museum Miami (PAMM) that I hadn't seen during a brief hop years earlier. In ""Miami Attracts the World's Ultra Wealthy,"" a feature in the April issue of Cityscape Abu Dhabimagazine, developers are drawn to the city's growing real estate market in upmarket Miami Beach as well as districts like Wynwood, a former industrial zone, a magnet for galleries, trendy cafés, restaurants and boutiques. Shepard Fairey's wheat-pasted mural (Abu-Fadil)It's noted for, among other things, the Wynwood Walls, an open-air display of street art and graffiti that combines amazing imagination, technique, nuance, peculiarities and beauty.Visitors can walk freely along pathways into open courtyards and alleys, sit at picnic benches, or enjoy a meal or coffee at the café while taking in the mix of colors, genres and designs on display all over the area.Visitors entering Wynwood Walls can't miss Shepard Fairey's wheat-pasted mural with images of the Dalai Lama, Martin Luther King, Jr., and, particularly, as a tribute to Tony Goldman.Goldman, the late patron who conceived of the walls project in 2009, said: ""Wynwood's large stock of warehouse buildings, all with no windows, would be my giant canvases to bring to them the greatest street art ever seen in one place.""Artist Ryan McGinness' 33 Women mural of Day-Glo paint set against a black wall brings out in stark assertion his rendition of female nudes. Ryan McGinness' 33 Women (Abu-Fadil)He is quoted as saying: ""These drawings are my version of what is sexy.""  ""Women on the Walls"" is another perspective on female sensuality by Miss Van, a.k.a. Vanessa Alice Bensimon, and occupies an imposing space in the Wynwood art park. Miss Van, who hails from the French city of Toulouse but has lived in Barcelona and exhibited in various cities, is a noted graffiti and street artist who often renders her female characters' faces into animal and bird visages.   Miss Van's ""Women on the Walls"" (Abu-Fadil)The New York-born, Baltimore-based artist who goes by the single name of Gaia produced an impressive portrait of American oil and railroad tycoon Henry Flagler on one of the walls.Gaia, in Greek mythology a deity personifying the Earth, said of Flagler:If you're from Miami, you've definitely heard of him. He's the reason why Florida is essentially Florida or why Miami is even called Miami... He established Overtown on the west side of the freight tracks for his black workers. This historic neighborhood that sits 15 blocks south of the Wynwood Walls would eventually be decimated by the construction of (interstate highway) I-95 and urban renewal.  Gaia's portrait of American industrialist Henry Flagler (courtesy Kadragic)The area is overflowing with art. I walked outside the main enclosure to find murals on side streets and alleys and well into adjacent neighborhoods.A very realistic portrait of what seems to be a woman -- one can't always tell -- with a fixed look that adorns a segment of a street corner's wall next to a shuttered shop. The vertical stylized script alongside it could almost pass for Arabic. There was no description of it.    Outside the Wynwood Walls (Abu-Fadil)A very colorful mural of four characters from what could be a comic book shows three males (one carrying a bouquet of flowers) and a female with horns holding an ice cream cone.Again, nobody in sight to explain.

Let that party or grouping have no stable or defined leadership, or a coherent ideology other than opposition to the prevailing order in the United States and embracing the model of the PRC.And maybe it defines itself as the genuine representative of North American society, yet stands for no real interest of any one social sector in particular. Let's further suppose that the Chinese government, as part of its official foreign policy, granted this grouping hundreds of millions of yuan in order to promote a so-called project of ""peaceful evolution"" toward a model whereby the country builds intimate relations with China.Finally, imagine that the People's Republic was located exactly where Canada is today, with a population 30 times bigger and an economy 233 times stronger than that of the United States, which, for half a century, in this scenario, has had very bad relations with this country. And maybe this imaginary Chinese president insisted on being photographed with the leaders of such a grouping.How would the U.S. government react? Would it put this group in prison at the Guantanamo Naval Base, without any right to a trial or to legal protection? Would it regard the group as a peaceful protest movement because it doesn't incite armed rebellion?Perhaps the U.S. government would limit itself to charging the group with collaborating with a foreign power, thus exposing the group only to several life sentences. Or might it be possible to identify the group as a legitimate opposition organization, proposing to exercise its civil rights as it protests the established order, cultivates free thought, and its members behave like good citizens?Would North Americans see the group as defenders of democracy and pluralism, capable of engaging in dialogue and respecting those who don't share their ideas? Would they view members of the group as standard-bearers of freedom of expression, by virtue of their means of communication, that are neither partisan nor dedicated to disowning the system, but rather to playing a role of providing information that is balanced and independent of any political tendency?Would the U.S. government recognize the group's political and intellectual leaders as capable of leading the country along the road of human development, independence, and citizen democracy? If all of the above is taken into consideration in a spirit of equanimity -- even if one may eventually disagree with the Cuban policy towards the dissidents -- it must be appreciated also that there's more involved than simple ideological impulsiveness, incompetence in dealing with dissenters, mental fog, or just plain evil.Naturally, the explanation does not rest on the assumption that these people themselves pose a real threat to Cuba's national security. They are not the problem. Rather, it's Washington's policy of giving them support.We still hear about ""bringing democracy and human rights to Cuba"", which means much more than objecting ""the Castros"" and ""the export of revolution"". Instead, it's about transforming the social, economic and political order of the country in their image and likeness (""promote our values,"" as Obama said on December 17).Beginning with Brigade 2506 (those Cuban exiles defeated militarily at the Bay of Pigs in 1961) until today, Cubans on the island have regarded Cuban political exiles as a function of North American policy dealing with the revolution. In that regard, December 17, 2014 showed that it wasn't the tail wagging the dog, but ultimately the dog doing the deciding.In terms of realpolitik, the main question after December 17 (""17D"", as it is called in Cuba) left behind the option of confronting the dissidents as subversives (putting them in prison); using them as a bargaining chip when the time comes to negotiate with the United States (that country always requires things in exchange, for example, in case they consider returning the Guantanamo base), or applying the full extension of the current Cuban law to them. In all these alternatives, we would end up turning them into victims, or for some of the Western media, into heroes. The question now is whether or not this opposition is really contributing to the 17D Obama policy.We need to understand that the new policy is already hooked into another logic, that of dialogue and negotiation. Pressure, ideological confrontation, and coercion are not excluded, but they come into play differently. The media on the island tirelessly harps on the idea that the United States has not given up on its objectives. That highlights an obvious truth for Cubans: they must not trust that powerful neighbor. It remains as imperialist as ever and has only ""changed its methods."" However, if one thoroughly examines all this about ""changed methods,"" the new policy harbors large-scale implications.In effect, the strategic formulation of 17D is aimed at opening up a highway for communicating with the heart of the Cuban political system. This new strategy represents an alternative to a half-century of ineffective brute force.For example, to influence young people, it's not so much the hip-hop groups (who haven't unleashed revolutions anywhere), but rather government leaders, provincial Communist Party officials, the armed forces and the state security, the technocrats, and the scientific, educational, and cultural institutions.To get in touch with the economy evolving out of Raul Castro's reforms, the main targets are not just private businessmen who own paladars and food marketing services, but to the broad layer of managers, heading up the new public sector, anxious to gain efficiency in production and business methods.This policy is aimed to reach out not only to artists and filmmakers fashioning provocative creations, but mainly to the thousands of social communicators and journalists who work in the government media system. They are more adept with the Internet than what is said, therefore they complain, with reason, about limited access to broadband and free wifi. They even admire (in known cases) CNN or Discovery channel as a model.Will entry onto this information highway be left in the hands of the dissidents, many of whom are somewhat opposed to the politics of 17D? As for those Cuban-American congresspersons famous in the United States for their ultra-conservative persuasion, and who support dissidents on the island, will they be the bridge between Cuban entrepreneurs on either side of the Florida Straits? And what about the Ladies in White, who let down the attempted mediation role the Catholic church tried to play? It is hard to believe that advisors to the President of the United States could be so clueless about Cuba's real civil and political society to take the delegation of provocateurs who descended on Panama (to attend the Summit of the Americas) for actual emissaries of dialogue about democracy and freedom in Cuba.Nevertheless, we must not forget that politics is mostly a strange kind of grand theater. Marti used to say that, in such a production, the most real thing is what is unseen. A former U.S. Interests Section Chief, in the intimacy of a report to the State Department, observed astutely that ""there are few if any dissidents who have a political vision that could be applied to future governance... it is unlikely that they will play any significant role in whatever government succeeds the Castro brothers.""This wouldn't be the first time that these two paths have diverged -- that of the North American government and that of this peculiar Cuban opposition. The Missile Crisis had hardly cooled down when President John Kennedy accepted the flag of Brigade 2506 members, and promised to return it as soon as they triumphantly entered a ""free Havana."" More than 52 years after President Kennedy's speech in Miami's Orange Bowl stadium, almost 300,000 Cuban-Americans, including descendants of those Brigade members, continue to arrive on the island, although not precisely to the tunes of war.Those average Cubans, embracing their cousins in Havana's Terminal 2, aren't up there on the dissidents' wagon, nor are they still waving that flag (a current property of the Kennedy Library), but rather, another kind of banner -- one that expresses their peaceful return to the land where they were born. They are going back to a Havana that is being revitalized little by little -- or to a beach where they will retire, now that they see the promise of normalization floating over Cuba.A CubaNews translation by William Whitney.

Between 2006 to 2008 he was reportedly in U.S. detention facilities, including Abu Ghraib prison.In 2010 however, it was Bakr and a small group of former Iraqi intelligence officers who made Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the official leader of Islamic State, with the goal of giving the group a ""religious face,"" the story says.Two years later, the magazine says, Bakr traveled to northern Syria to oversee his takeover plan, choosing to launch it with a collection of foreign fighters that included novice militants from Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Europe alongside battle-tested Chechens and Uzbeks.Iraqi journalist Hisham al-Hashimi, whose cousin served with Bakr, describes the former officer as a nationalist rather than an Islamist. The story argues that the secret to Islamic State's success lies in its combination of opposites - the fanatical beliefs of one group and the strategic calculations of another, led by Bakr.Spiegel said it had obtained the papers after lengthy negotiations with rebels in the Syrian city of Aleppo, who had seized them when Islamic State was forced to abandon its headquarters there in early 2014.

A friend snapped a pic of me lounging naked on a raft in the pool and I remember being startled when I had the film developed weeks later (remember those days?) and there I was buoying in the buff above a scribbled shimmer of turquoise water -- like a Hockney painting come to life.In an era where everyone from out gay teenagers to middle-aged men and even seniors are snapping naked selfies for trade on hookup apps like Grindr, Scruff and DaddyHunt, it's almost quaint to look at that picture now. But at the time it was a revelation. I had never before seen a complete view of my backside bare and knew even then the image reflected the spoils of youth.Shortly thereafter I began entertaining the idea of hiring a photographer to do a professional nude photo shoot for the purposes of putting together a collection of images that would decades later serve as a time capsule of myself as a younger man. A few years went by... then a few more. Last year I turned 40, and it was official: My youth had departed a long time ago.Aside from the inevitable anxieties about turning 40 placed upon us all by the culture, I greeted the beginning of my fifth decade with relative calm. My 30s had been quite the run and it was at last time for a new chapter. However, one thing I had let society convince me was that opportunities to make romantic connections would dwindle -- and I resigned myself to that. But to the contrary they expanded exponentially. It was as if 40 was a magical number among guys seeking out older men or so called ""daddies"" and I had just entered the club.This very much surprised me. When I was 22 and living in San Francisco, it wasn't an aspiration among guys my age to openly seek out older men. The generation that had come before us had been severely scarred and diminished by the AIDS crisis and the drug cocktail that would transform the disease from a death sentence to a chronic condition was still in its nascent stage. In my youth there simply wasn't a plethora of middle-aged men around to serve as role models, thus I felt emboldened at 40 to renew the idea of hiring a shutterbug to photograph me au naturel. After all, even younger gays who seek older men often fear being one themselves and I saw in this venture a symbolic opportunity to give them permission to age triumphantly. I discovered Marlen Boro while browsing online and connected to his work right away. He's a Minneapolis-based photographer who calls his portraits ""Male Boudoir"" in that his work concentrates on naturalistic images of guys of every shape, age, size, color and body type captured mostly at home and at their most relaxed, intimate -- and revealing. On his website I discovered hundreds of guys in various states of undress and erotic expression who were piercingly handsome and desirable whether or not they'd ever stepped foot inside a gym. I felt a kinship with this tribe and knew Boro would ""get it right."" I contacted him right away.We agreed upon a punishingly hot late July shoot. I've always loved Palm Springs in the summer when visitors to the region are scarce and the vastness of the Coachella Valley is intensely felt. As it happened, I was going to be working and traveling around California at that time anyway so Boro agreed to meet me at a meticulously restored mid-century home we discovered through AirBnB. It was an ideal setting.But in the days leading up to our encounter a peculiar thing happened -- I panicked. In the months prior to our shoot I had failed to get to the gym as often as I'd wanted. I felt out of shape, undesirable and old. I kept hoping Boro would flake and that I would be able to cancel and get my deposit back. All along I had convinced myself that the shoot was a hero's journey designed to combat ageism and show our community that we're sexy, vital and important at any age. Turns out it wasn't the world that needed reassurance -- it was me. This was about my own insecurities all along.Of course, all of these worries turned out to be nonsense much like most of the self-destructive shit that rattles around in the human brain. Boro was a pro and put my fears at ease as we staked out spaces both inside and around the swimming pool to take pictures over the course of two unforgettable days. We even had the pleasure of driving out to the Salton Sea -- a largely forgotten wasteland in the southeast corner of the state that barely registers in the sun-drenched minds of most Southern Californians but is nevertheless one of the most beautiful places on earth -- and snap pics alongside the silver Ford Mustang I'd rented for the journey.I waited with baited breath for the images to be completed and am happy to say that not only are they as sharp and beautiful as I'd hope they'd be, but also as startling and compelling as that first naked pic taken all those many years ago. It's not my bare bum or any other body part that transfixes me this time around but something else entirely. The passing of years reveal in these images the kind of confidence, wisdom and undeniable sex appeal that comes only with the passage of time and for that I'm grateful (although it helps that my ass still looks amazing).Welcome to 40. Whenever you get there and whoever you are and when you do, don't forget to snap a few pics. This is one of the greatest eras of life and you're going to want to remember it."

Walker Criminal Probe to Be ""Heard"" in Silence The Wisconsin Supreme Court is slated to take up the ""John Doe"" criminal investigation of alleged coordination between Friends of Scott Walker and ""independent"" groups during the tumultuous 2011-2012 recall elections. The Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) has detailed the bipartisan state investigation into the Walker campaign and the secretive big money groups that bankrolled his 2012 recall victory. Wisconsin Club for Growth (WiCFG), headed by Walker campaign manager R.J. Johnson and the ""third Koch Brother"" Eric O'Keefe, spent at least $9.1 million on Wisconsin's unprecedented recall elections, and funneled almost $10 million more to other politically-active groups, including Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce. Yet, WiCFG, which enjoys tax free status, told the IRS that it spent $0 in political activity during that period. Prosecutors allege that Walker secretly raised millions for WiCFG from out-of-state donors like Donald Trump and Paul Singer, and allegedly coordinated with WiCFG in order to evade Wisconsin's donor disclosure laws. Talking points prepared for the governor advised him to ""stress that donations to WiCFG are not disclosed,"" and to tell donors ""that you can accept corporate contributions and it is not reported.""These dark money schemes left voters completely in the dark about who was truly influencing elections in the state, CMD argued in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Wisconsinites never knew that a Florida-based mining company lobbying for a massive open pit mine in Wisconsin secretly gave $700,000 to WiCFG, nor did they know that John Menard gave $1.5 million to the group, and in turn received at least $1.8 million in tax credits from Walker's job development agency.The investigation has been halted by a passel of lawyers hired by the groups under investigation and its fate now rests with Wisconsin's Supreme Court.In an unprecedented move, the court's right-wing majority decided not to hear oral arguments in order to protect the defendants against leaks, over the strong objections of the Chief Justice.While WiCFG leader Eric O'Keefe is constantly ""partisan witch hunt"" to the Wall Street Journal and even likened the investigation to being raped, the fact is that the chief prosecutor is the case is Francis Schmitz, a well-respected Republican anti-terrorism prosecutor who received the ""U.S. Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service"" from Michael Mukasey's Justice Department in 2007. Schmitz even admitted to voting for Walker in the recall election.Schmitz and his team took note that four of the right-wing justices were elected to office with huge expenditures by the very big money groups under investigation. He has demanded that these justices recuse themselves from the case, but the request has been ignored.In ""hearing"" the John Doe, the Wisconsin Supreme Court will consider not only the future of the investigation and the fate of Walker, but also the future of Wisconsin campaign finance law, and whether candidates (including the justices themselves, when they are up for reelection) will be able to coordinate with dark money groups whose job it is raise and spend unlimited dollars from powerful special interests.Wisconsin's Common Cause director Jay Heck explained:What is at stake here is the independence of the Wisconsin judiciary. The Wisconsin Supreme Court was once considered the model for the nation in terms of its impartiality and independence. That history could be wiped out by a single decision by this court to open up the doors to coordination with outside groups and effectively render campaign contribution limits meaningless.Walker and Dark Money Allies Orchestrate Coup of the CourtsIn a related case, Walker's big money allies are busily engineering a coup of the courts to strip the independent Chief Justice, Shirley Abrahamson, of her title and authority.Wisconsin elects Supreme Court Justices for 10 year terms. For 126 years under the Wisconsin's Constitution, the title of Chief Justice has been given to the longest serving member, but sticking to that plan would leave critical thinkers in charge for decades to come. Abrahamson was reelected as Chief to a 10 year term in 2009 with 60% of the vote. After Abrahamson, Justice Anne Walsh Bradley, who has fought to keep partisan politics out of the courts, would be next in line.As CMD previously reported the threat of having a Chief who was not under their thumb was simply too much for Team Walker and his dark money allies. The GOP controlled legislature urged on by WMC and the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity backed a Constitutional Amendment to get rid of the Chief and rushed to get it on the low-turn out spring ballot.As veteran Milwaukee journalist Bruce Murphy put it: Proponents of the measure have said it's about displacing seniority with democracy, but declined to make it effective in 2019, when Abrahamson's term ends, leaving no doubt this was a get-Shirley amendment."" And let's not forget the unseemly, undisclosed lobbying by other justices hoping to be Chief, including Pat ""Patience"" Roggensack.To orchestrate a constitutional coup a phony ""vote yes"" group was formed by Rogensack's former campaign manager and WMC piled on the cash in a $600,000 ad blitz saying it was all about ""democracy."" In the final weekend before election day, the liberal Greater Milwaukee Committee fielded an extra $200,000 in ads, but it was too late to make a difference.Perhaps if the WMC ads had explained that they were unseating the chief and purchasing the best court money could buy, the result may have been different. But it was no surprise when, as the Capital Times explained: ""They secured a narrow 53 percent to 47 percent victory in a low-turnout election; barely 10 percent of Wisconsin's voting-age population supported the deliberately confusing amendment."" Court observers tracking the ""We Hate Shirley"" amendment assumed that she would soon lose her title and her authority. But the feisty 81-year old Chief Justice is not taking the dark money onslaught lying down. She filed a federal lawsuit (documents here) brought by one of the nation's most respected constitutional lawyers, Robert Peck of the Center for Constitutional Litigation, arguing that changing the rules concerning how a Chief is selected in the middle of her term violates the Equal Protection and Due Process rights of the chief herself and the voters who elected her under the U.S. Constitution.While WMC lobbyists and right-wing politicians are fuming at this audacious move, respected constitutional scholar David Schwartz, Professor of Law at the University of Wisconsin had a different view.Chief Judge Abrahamson's decision to file a suit in federal court is a ""sensible and appropriate way"" to resolve a complicated question of how to interpret the new Wisconsin amendment which was silent on when it should take effect. ""Changing the rules in the middle of the game violates fundamental fairness that is guaranteed by the Due Process Clause. It would violate both her rights and the rights of voters who elected her in the expectation that she would be Chief Justice,"" Schwartz tells CMD. ""Note that the Chief Justice's suit challenges only the retroactive application of the law, and does not question the right of the people of Wisconsin to restructure its court system in general, or to change the rules for selecting a chief justice at the next vacancy of that position.""In addition, Schwartz explained that ""by suing in federal court, Chief Justice Abrahamson seeks a resolution by neutral judges who have no personal stake in the outcome of the case. Since the Wisconsin Supreme Court justices have a personal stake in the case, it would be problematic for them to try resolve the question themselves.""Walker to Anoint Lawyers in the Abrahamson Challenge?But the dark money men at the WiCFG are also not backing down. WiCFG director Eric O'Keefe is apparently so awash in money that he has teams of both state and federal attorneys ""building a court they can bend to their will,"" as judicial watcher Nan Aron from the Alliance for Justice put it.Last year, O'Keefe hired federal lawyer David Rivkin to unleash a swarm of frivolous lawsuits related to the campaign finance probe. Rivkin, last spotted defending Bush's torture memo in the New York Times, filed suit in federal court to try blocking the investigation. O'Keefe had some initial success with a far-right judge who regularly attended Koch judicial junkets, but he was eventually slapped down by famed conservative jurist Frank Easterbrook on the 7th Circuit.But O'Keefe, who funded infamous hatchet man James O'Keefe the year he took down a Republican State Senator standing in Walker's way, is not done.Last week, Rivkin went after the Chief Justice herself in a federal suit. In a bizarre twist, Rivkin's suit cited newspaper articles describing an incident when Justice Prosser called the Chief ""a bitch"" and threatened to ""destroy her"" and another article when Prosser nearly choked Justice Bradley to somehow make the case that it was Abrahamson and not Prosser who was out of control. (He missed Prosser's latest ethical stumble.)Rivkin purported to represent Wisconsin voters who backed the constitutional amendment. But Milwaukee reporter Bruce Murphy quickly spotted the usual cast of characters, deeply tied to both Scott Walker and Eric O'Keefe. Eric O'Keefe is on the CRG Board, says Murphy. In 2014, Rivkin helped CRG file another lawsuit in U.S. District Court challenging the legality of state laws banning coordination between political candidates and dark money groups. CRG was last in the news working with the David Koch's Americans for Prosperity group to stop -- horrors! -- a proposed trolley system in Milwaukee.But Rivkin's gambit to intervene in the Abrahamson case was wisely rebuffed by the federal judge James Peterson.And in the latest odd twist to the case Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that counsel for the Supreme Court justices named in the Chief's suit will be appointed by none other than Governor Scott Walker.Abrahamson and her attorney should protest. While Walker might think he runs the courts, he doesn't yet. If private counsel is needed by any judge it is the policy of the state courts that the Director of the State Courts appoint outside counsel, not the governor."

It took its first spin in Philadelphia in 1888, the brainchild of Theophilus Van Kannel, the soon-to-be founder of the Van Kannel Revolving Door Company. Its purpose was twofold: to better insulate buildings from the cold and to allow greater numbers of people easier entry at any given time.On March 31st at the Wayne Country Treasurer’s Office, that Victorian-era invention was accomplishing neither objective. Then again, no door in the history of architecture -- rotating or otherwise -- could have accommodated the latest perversity Detroit officials were inflicting on city residents: the potential eviction of tens of thousands, possibly as many as 100,000 people, all at precisely the same time.Little wonder that it seemed as if everyone was getting stuck in the rotating doors of that Wayne County office building on the last day residents could pay their past-due property taxes or enter a payment plan to do so. Those who didn’t, the city warned, would lose their homes to tax foreclosure, the process by which a local government repossesses a house because of unpaid property taxes.“Oh, my lord,” exclaimed one bundled-up woman when she first spotted the river of people, their documents in envelopes and folders of every sort, pouring out of cars, hunched over walkers, driving electric scooters, being pushed in wheelchairs, or simply attempting to jam their way on foot into the building. The afternoon was gray and unseasonably cold. The following day, in the middle of a snowless meadow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the governor of California would announce the state’s first-ever water restrictions as a result of an unprecedented, climate-change-influenced drought. Here in Michigan, city residents were facing another type of man-made disaster: possibly the largest single tax foreclosure in American history.“It’s the last day to pay,” one woman heading toward the rotating glass chamber yelled to a pedestrian who had slowed to watch the commotion. Inside, a Wayne County Sheriff’s Department officer-turned-traffic-controller boomed instructions to a snaking line of people. “When you get to the eighth floor, you will get a number. Keep that number! Then go to the fifth floor.’”The eighth floor, however, turned out to be little more than another human traffic jam, a holding space for thousands of anxious homeowners who faced hours of waiting before reaching the desk of some overworked city representative down on five. Yet, as a post office delivery worker gaping at the fiasco told me, this was less hectic than it had been a only few days earlier, when the treasurer’s office had rented out the Second Baptist Church across the street. There, people waited for the opportunity to enter the revolving doors to take the elevator to the eighth floor before heading for the fifth floor to... you get the gist.In fact, the whole week had been a god-awful mess. A day earlier, rumors had it, a woman had passed out in the elevator between the eighth and fifth floors en route to “making arrangements,” the euphemism for getting on a payment plan that might save your home.“What happens if you can’t pay?” a slender man asked me as we dodged a new wave of people surging through the glass cylinder.“Then they sell your house at auction,” I replied.“For real?” he asked, amazed.He was waiting for his sister to make those “arrangements.” He didn’t have to worry about all this, he explained, because ever since he’d lost his job, which had provided him with housing, he’d been staying in motels. The Victory Inn over in Dearborn and the Viking across from the Motor City casino were both reasonable enough places, he assured me, but the Royal Inn on Eight Mile was the cheapest of all -- $35 a night plus a $10 key deposit. That establishment’s single enigmatic Yelp review read: “This is definitely someplace you want to go where totally normal things happen.”A Blueprint for Civic HellDetroit was once famous for creating the largest, most spectacular versions of whatever its residents set their minds to, be they assembly lines, record labels, or revolutionary workers' associations. The city is often credited with inventing and mass-producing the twentieth century, while its workers simultaneously took the lead in revolting against the injustices of the era. Its factories put the world on wheels and labor laws on the books. Its workers and thinkers sparked and fanned a number of this country’s most influential resistance movements.Detroit: every article about you should include a love letter, a thank-you note, a history lesson, for without you…Few care to admit, however, that the city that was the arsenal of the twentieth century may also provide the blueprint for a more precarious era. Which brings us to those massive tax foreclosures of the present moment. Just over 60,000 homes, about half of them occupied, are slated for the auction block. As many as 100,000 of the city’s residents -- about a seventh of the total number -- are now on track for what many are calling an eviction “conveyor belt.”Such an image easily springs to mind in this city whose auto factories were famous for their oh-so-efficient shop floors. These days, sadly enough, it’s all-too-easy to imagine a twenty-first-century version of a classic Detroit assembly line dedicated to processing its own residents, workers, and retirees -- all the ones it claims to no longer need, all those too old, too young, too ill-trained, too inefficient for a post-bankruptcy city. These undesirables, it seems, are to be turned into so many economic refugees on a conveyor belt to nowhere. While everyone loves to hear about legendary industrial Detroit, no one wants to hear about its de-industrialized progeny, and especially not about foreclosures -- not again.Mike Shane, a Detroit resident and organizer with the anti-foreclosure group Moratorium Now!, knows this better than anyone. “We call the press, and they say, give us anything but foreclosures,” he tells me ruefully.Connecting the DotsOn March 31st, some people did manage to make the necessary “arrangements” to save their homes. That included one woman with a Hillary Clinton-style hairdo who had lived on Winthrop Street since the 1960s, but like so many in the working-class sections of the city had fallen behind on her taxes. “They asked, ‘Why didn’t you pay your property taxes?’” she explained as she rested on one of the first-floor benches. “And I said, ‘Because I had a heart attack.’”Last year, she recalled, a neighbor’s home fell into tax foreclosure. A man who lived on the same block noticed the familiar address on the auction list. He bought it back for her, she tells me. “He said to the woman, ‘Pay me back when you can, if you can.’”Detroit is full of similar stories, filled with a stubborn sense of hope. But there are so many more addresses on the foreclosure list than angelic neighbors. By early afternoon that March day, the building still bursting at its seams with thousands of people, the county office conceded its inability to cope and extended the foreclosure deadline another six weeks.“I don’t know if it’s because they’re so damn overwhelmed,” wondered Mary Crenshaw, a sunken-eyed woman who was relieved by the announcement, as it gave her time to wait for a lump-sum retirement payout from British Airways, her former employer. She had come to save her family home in Highland Park, a small city enclosed by Detroit whose once occupied homes sported oak floors and beveled glass windows. Now, more than half of them are empty, lawns overgrown, windows boarded up, the former homeowners having already ridden earlier foreclosure conveyor belts out of the neighborhood.After all, this current tax foreclosure crisis comes right on the heels of the city’s last great displacement: the 2008 housing crash, which descended on Detroit like a tidal wave, sweeping nearly a quarter of a million people out of the city and leaving in its wake tens of thousands of vacant properties.The fact that the city is now threatening to evict a seventh of its remaining inhabitants in a single year, all because of unpaid property taxes, seems like an absurd proposition until you begin to connect the dots: the mass water shutoffs, the shuttering of dozens of public schools, the neglect of fire hydrants in particular neighborhoods, and now this deluge of foreclosures.Looking at the pattern that emerges, you can see that Detroit is not only a city in the midst of a “revival,” as enterprising investors and the national media often claim. It’s true that redevelopment is taking place in some neighborhoods, and city officials do claim that big changes are coming, often illustrating them with colorful documents that look like they were formatted by a team of graphic design wizards from the back of San Francisco’s Google Bus.But that’s just one part of the Detroit story. For the city’s low-income, black, and elderly residents, Detroit isn’t a city on the rise, but one under siege.An Emergency That Never EndsOn a blustery Saturday afternoon just two weeks before the day of the foreclosure deadline, an Emergency People’s Assembly Against Tax Foreclosures was held at Old Christ Church to address this siege. It was one of a set of “people’s assemblies” called to deal with the latest crisis in a city where, in recent years, crises have never been lacking. Before the tax foreclosure assemblies there had been the Emergency People’s Assemblies Against Bank Foreclosures, the Emergency Pack-The-Court Actions to Defend Homeowners from Eviction, the Emergency Town Halls to Defend City Pensions & Services, the Emergency Meetings Against the Emergency Financial Manager, and so on.“Emergency” had, in other words, been the word of the moment for years and years. That invasive sense of never-ending urgency could similarly be seen in the literature of such groups -- in the words always screamingly in capital letters, in the typographical equivalents of exclamation points. When I’d first heard about the most recent event, I was in a meeting with Mike Shane and I said to him, “Over the three years I’ve been visiting Detroit, I’ve never arrived at a time you weren’t holding an Emergency People’s Assembly the following Saturday.”Shane laughed on cue. “Well, yes, that’s right,” he replied. “We’ve been at this since about 2007.”The Old Christ Church that day was shiveringly cold. From the pew behind me came the sound of rustling coats as two children squirmed. Beside them sat their grandmother and grandfather, Lula and Daryl Burke, who had come to describe how their home had been sold at a tax foreclosure auction last year. With the help of the grassroots community group Detroit Eviction Defense, Lula explained, the Burkes had convinced the home’s buyer to sell it back to the family. A little bit of gumption on her part helped, too. As she recalled explaining to the investor who had bought her home at auction, he could try to sell the house to someone else. But before he did that, she planned to strip every last thing out of it. “It won’t have a furnace, a toilet, doors, windows, all the way down to the light switch,” she warned him.On the wall behind the altar three white-robed angels were suspended in mid-frolic, oblivious to the current condition of their once regal city. In front of them stood anti-foreclosure lawyer Jerry Goldberg. “Are we going to allow 62,000 more foreclosures this year?” he thundered, his face growing redder. I later learned that, years ago, Goldberg had sold peanuts down at the old Tigers stadium (now a bulldozed parking lot) and his unrelenting voice had apparently made him very good at it.“No!” he responded emphatically to his own question. “Are we going to allow them to make our neighborhoods into a bunch of ponds?” Perhaps I should have led with this information: in some of the city’s latest flashy Adobe InDesign-ed planning documents, certain of Detroit’s more down-and-out neighborhoods have been transformed into ponds. Or, to be more precise, they have been turned into “water retention basins” that planners believe will offer the Detroit of the future superior management of storm water runoff.Minutes earlier, Alice Jennings, one of the most celebrated social justice lawyers in the city, had explained that, according to Detroit’s planning documents, those retention basins are slated to be built on top of now populated neighborhoods. In other words, ponds are also what we’re talking about when we talk about Detroit’s tax foreclosures.“No!” Goldberg shouted yet again. “We need to stop these foreclosures with a moratorium, a halt! The idea that this can’t be done is hogwash! The Supreme Court held in 1934 that, during a period of emergency, the people’s need to survive supersedes any financial contract! The governor has a responsibility to declare a state of emergency!”His sentences all ended in exclamation points, as his torrent of words resounded off the church’s high ceilings. In an upside-down universe, Goldberg would have made a skilled auctioneer rather than a man desperate to save all those homes and their inhabitants.To be clear, Goldberg isn’t suggesting another of the emergency proclamations that Michigan’s governors have used to impose unelected emergency managers on school districts and municipalities from Detroit to Muskegon Heights. Rather, he’s calling for the governor to declare a state of emergency under Michigan law 10.31, which would allow him to “promulgate reasonable orders, rules, and regulations as he or she considers necessary to protect life and property” -- including, of course, halting the tax foreclosures. In 1933, similar actions allowed Michigan’s legislature to pass the Mortgage Moratorium Act, later upheld by the Supreme Court, mandating a five-year halt on property foreclosures.Winning that moratorium took, among other things, a well-organized national Communist Party, hundreds of worker councils, thousands of eviction blockades, and -- I’d be willing to bet, although I don’t have the archival evidence -- an incredible number of “emergency meetings.”Woe to Those Who Plan IniquitiesBy late afternoon, Goldberg was resting his vocal chords and about a dozen people from the audience were lining up to take the microphone, including Cheryl West, a tiny, gray-haired woman clutching a thick Bible to her stomach. When it was her turn to speak, she began: “I lost my home of 60 years.” There was no trace of bitterness in her voice, just a touch of awe and disbelief. “It’s been quite a journey. Quite a journey.”“Let me give you a little background,” she continued. “My entire family is now deceased. My father was the first African American to teach music in Detroit, possibly in the entire state of Michigan. He worked for the school system. He lived in that very house. He lived there through the 1967 riots and we were right at the hub of where the riots started. My sister was a journalist, and during the riots she was one of the people getting the story out to the media, because she was working for UPI at the time. My sister was on the front page of the London Times, that’s how far her news traveled of the city burning down around us.”Then, after a few more background comments on her life, she opened up her bible. “Since we’re in a church,” she said by way of explanation and began to read from the Book of Micah. She skipped its beginning.“Woe to those who plan iniquity, to those who plot evil on their beds! At morning’s light they carry it out because it is in their power to do it. They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them. They defraud people of their homes, they rob them of their inheritance...”Undoubtedly, she assumed that everyone in the church was already familiar with such “iniquities” and the biblical lines that went with them. After all, in the previous few years, they had lived through the 2008 foreclosure crisis, the imposition of an emergency manager on their city, mass water shutoffs, and significant pension cuts for retired city workers, not to speak of all the evils that had come before.Instead, she read the verses she liked best, the ones that, as she said, God led her to just about the time she lost her home.“You strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care, like men returning from battle. You drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes. You take away my blessing from their children forever.""She paused, then suddenly, in a surprisingly powerful voice, yelled the next line: “Get up! Go away!”The church reverberated with her admonishment. And then, with a smile at her own audacity, she added, “The end.”Shortly afterwards, we filed out of the church. And yet it was not the end. It never is.There is now, for instance, that new deadline -- May 12th -- for residents to get on a payment plan to avoid losing their homes to tax foreclosure. That offers more time for people to navigate the revolving doors of the Wayne County Treasurer’s Office, head up to the eighth floor, then down to the fifth, all in an effort to fight their way off of the city’s conveyor belt to nowhere. And, of course, it gives residents more time to host emergency people’s assemblies aimed at throwing a monkey wrench -- once and for all -- into this assembly line of eviction and displacement.Even if that happened, however, these gatherings, called for in all capital letters and exclamation points, undoubtedly wouldn’t end. They’ve become as much a fixture of this city as the women and men who organize them, the churches that host them, and the neighborhoods whose survival may depend on them. After all, the worst injustice would not be whatever provokes the next emergency people’s assembly, but the possibility of a future Detroit without such gatherings, one in which all these meetings and people are gone, all the stories have been suppressed. Imagine, then, the worst iniquity of all, the one so many are fighting against: a Detroit where once inhabited streets have been submerged in the silence of water retention ponds, where longtime residents have been scattered and displaced by the foreclosure conveyor belt and no one left in the city knows the history of what’s been drowned.Laura Gottesdiener is a freelance journalist based in New York City.

Jeb Bush speaks at the First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit April 17, 2015 in Nashua, New Hampshire. The Summit brought together local and national Republicans and was attended by all the Republicans candidates as well as those eyeing a run for the nomination. (Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f34d220000ba01dd845e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - Facing a recovering economy and a tumbling jobless rate, Republican presidential candidates honing their economic message are trying tap into a lingering sense of insecurity among Americans seven years after the global financial crisis.And some are striking a sympathetic tone with lower-income workers in a way that contrasts with four years ago when Mitt Romney struggled to overcome perceptions that he was largely the candidate of the wealthiest Americans. Then, Republican nominee Romney had the luxury of being able to hammer President Barack Obama with an unemployment rate of more than 8 percent.Now, with the jobless rate at 5.5 percent, the 18 Republican White House hopefuls who gathered this weekend in the key early primary state of New Hampshire faced the challenge of arguing the country needs new economic stewardship even as the worst of the downtown has passed.Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said that simply blasting Obama’s economic policies would not suffice. “We will not win if we just complain about how bad things are,” he told a crowd at a hotel ballroom.Bush, who has yet to formally announce his candidacy, tried to build a message around moving the economy to a firmer standing, arguing that many Americans still feel financially insecure. Economic growth, he said, needs to be at a rate “where people no longer believe that the end is near, that their children will have more opportunities than they have, that they’re willing to take risks again.”Republican pollster Frank Luntz said Bush and other contenders are taking the right tack.“We do not have the full-time jobs we once had. We do not have the upwardly mobile economy that we once had,” Luntz told Reuters. “The public is still afraid that we are one bump in the road away from a serious recession.”The U.S. economy grew by 2.4 percent last year, the largest increase since the depths of the recession in 2010. Bush would like to see the economy hum at closer to 4 percent and frequently points out that the rate of new business formation has dropped steadily since the 1980s and that business deaths now eclipse starts.MIDDLE-CLASS UNCERTAINTYEven as the economy steadily added jobs, wages have remained flat. Earnings grew just 1.7 percent in 2014, according to U.S. government data, well below the 3.5 percent that economists say is needed to reap the benefits of an expanded economy.The public mood remains sour. Sixty percent of Americans in March said the economy was on the wrong track, according to Reuters/IPSOS polling data, although that was an improvement from 71 percent in May 2014.With New Hampshire’s primary still nine months away, the weekend provided an early glimpse at economic ideas that have had little chance to be fully formed. Most of the campaigns have yet to bring on extensive policy staffs.But there is some urgency: In the first days of her candidacy last week, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton made it clear that she will make the plight of the middle class central to her campaign.Some Republicans at the gathering tried to address concern about rising income inequality and the struggles of the nation’s middle class to keep pace with the cost of living.Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry contended that it was unfair that “large corporations don’t pay taxes but single moms working two jobs do.”Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said millions of Americans no longer believe they can achieve financial success.“They’re living paycheck to paycheck. They have what was a great job 10 years ago, but now it doesn't go far enough,” he said. “They literally live one unexpected expense away from disaster.”Rubio, who announced his run for the White House earlier this month, went the furthest in trying to reach voters who aren’t benefiting from the recovery. He talked of the importance of vocational training programs and suggested that college isn’t the right path for all students, especially given the enormous debt load than many end up carrying.He invoked images of less affluent Americans: Not only his father, who worked for years as a bartender, but a person using free Wi-Fi at a cafe to launch a business, or another taking two buses to get to a job. Rubio has proposed a tax plan that he says would make it easier for those of modest means to improve their lives, “so a receptionist making $9 an hour can become a paralegal making $60,000 a year.”Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has proposed a federal flat tax rate and creating “economic freedom” zones for distressed areas such as Detroit and Appalachia, said Republicans had to do more to reach working-class voters.“If you want to win elections, you’ve got to get the people who work for the people who own businesses,” he told the crowd."

I still have the first roll of black and white 35mm film that I developed and the images I printed from it, scratches and all. The smell of developer and fixer from the countless hours I have spent in darkrooms is still imprinted in my brain. Over the years I was able to upgrade my equipment and to this day I always carry a camera. Like everybody else that is into photography, I bought my first digital camera in 2000. I was fascinated by the technology and like a lustful teenager I dumped my Leica M3 film camera for my new digital girlfriend, a Canon. For the next ten years I continued to upgrade from one digital camera to another. The resolution kept getting better and the software that drove the cameras more sophisticated. As an investor and television host I continued to travel the world and captured images that I could have only dreamed about when I was a teenager in my high school photo club. Today I have tens of thousands of photographs from dozens of countries. Last year I was moving some boxes in our basement and I came across one with no label on it. I opened it and there it was, my Leica M3 film camera. I had not held it in over a decade. I picked it up and immediately felt the familiarity of its curves. Shooting with a Leica is like learning how to ride a bicycle, once you know how you never forget. I cocked the camera and to my amazement I felt the resistance of 35mm film advancing through the shutter. There was still un-developed film in it. The camera counter showed 22 images had been exposed so I rewound the film and opened the back. It was a roll of 35 mm Kodak TRI-X ASA 400, the favorite film of my youth. I had no idea what was on that film or even if it would still be good having been in the camera for over a decade. I had dismantled and sold off my dark room many years prior, so I had no way to develop it. I went on the web and searched for a lab that was still processing black and white film. To my surprise there were still several labs active. I brought the roll in and explained to the technician what had happened. He warned me that leaving the roll inside a camera for 6 months was a bad idea, let alone over a decade. The lab said they would process it but made me agree that if it was destroyed by the developer bath it was not their liability. I agreed and left my cell number. A few days later my phone rang, it was the lab. ""You should come in and see this, you are not going to believe what you have here."" I was shooting Shark Tank on the Sony MGM studio lot in LA that day so I had no way to get back to the lab which was on the other side of the country. The technician suggested I should not touch or take the processed negatives out of their sleeve holders, as they were extremely delicate and maybe brittle. Instead they had done a high resolution scan to disk that could be viewed on a Mac. The more he talked to me the more I wanted to see the images. I asked him to email me one. Moments later I felt my phone vibrate and I opened his email. What I saw blew me away. During the years that the film had sat in the camera body the silver nitrate emulsion had begun to break down and had crystalized on the surface of the film leaving ghostly geometric streaks across the image. The pictures looked like they were from another world. They were absolutely stunning. I leaned over and showed my phone to Daymond John who was sitting to my right on the Shark Tank set. ""What the hell is that?"" he exclaimed. Exactly, I thought. The Leica M3 camera that I had jilted over a decade ago gave birth to images unrivaled by any of the thousands of digital images I had taken since. No Photoshop here, this was organic reality. It was karma. It changed my mind about everything in my photographic world. I don't care what anyone says about digital images, they can't rival photographs taken on film, period. Today my Lieca M3 is my number one camera again. I carry a digital SLR too but if I have to choose, I draw the Leica first. Today I favor Ilford HP5 Plus 400 and Kodak 400 TMAX. You can still buy it. I process it at a lab, do a low resolution scan of the roll and archive the original negatives. When I want to make an archival print I go back to the original negative and do a very high res scan with an Imacon Flextight Film Scanner. We print from that. Proof you can keep the soul of film in your work but take advantage of what digital offers. Many Hollywood directors are doing the same thing these days. They shoot their movie on 70mm film and transfer it to digital for the edit. I am not against using digital technology in the photographic arts. Far from it. For example in the 1987 test print made from a traditional old school enlarger of the Armenian Church Worshipers, the partially hidden face on the far left was not evident. The negative was exposed in extremely low light and ""pushed"" in processing but was still very thin. Over 20 years later scanning the same negative with the Imacon unlocked the secret face and changed the feel of the whole image, more mysterious I think. The point is it all starts on film. That is where the soul of the image is born. Encouraged by the ghostly Leica airshow images, I decided to exhibit my work to the public. For the majority of the work I went back to my original negatives and selected images from across 4 decades. To my surprise we sold $97,000 worth of photography the opening night.

I still have the first roll of black and white 35mm film that I developed and the images I printed from it, scratches and all. The smell of developer and fixer from the countless hours I have spent in darkrooms is still imprinted in my brain. Over the years I was able to upgrade my equipment and to this day I always carry a camera. Like everybody else that is into photography, I bought my first digital camera in 2000. I was fascinated by the technology and like a lustful teenager I dumped my Leica M3 film camera for my new digital girlfriend, a Canon. For the next ten years I continued to upgrade from one digital camera to another. The resolution kept getting better and the software that drove the cameras more sophisticated. As an investor and television host I continued to travel the world and captured images that I could have only dreamed about when I was a teenager in my high school photo club. Today I have tens of thousands of photographs from dozens of countries. Last year I was moving some boxes in our basement and I came across one with no label on it. I opened it and there it was, my Leica M3 film camera. I had not held it in over a decade. I picked it up and immediately felt the familiarity of its curves. Shooting with a Leica is like learning how to ride a bicycle, once you know how you never forget. I cocked the camera and to my amazement I felt the resistance of 35mm film advancing through the shutter. There was still un-developed film in it. The camera counter showed 22 images had been exposed so I rewound the film and opened the back. It was a roll of 35 mm Kodak TRI-X ASA 400, the favorite film of my youth. I had no idea what was on that film or even if it would still be good having been in the camera for over a decade. I had dismantled and sold off my dark room many years prior, so I had no way to develop it. I went on the web and searched for a lab that was still processing black and white film. To my surprise there were still several labs active. I brought the roll in and explained to the technician what had happened. He warned me that leaving the roll inside a camera for 6 months was a bad idea, let alone over a decade. The lab said they would process it but made me agree that if it was destroyed by the developer bath it was not their liability. I agreed and left my cell number. A few days later my phone rang, it was the lab. ""You should come in and see this, you are not going to believe what you have here."" I was shooting Shark Tank on the Sony MGM studio lot in LA that day so I had no way to get back to the lab which was on the other side of the country. The technician suggested I should not touch or take the processed negatives out of their sleeve holders, as they were extremely delicate and maybe brittle. Instead they had done a high resolution scan to disk that could be viewed on a Mac. The more he talked to me the more I wanted to see the images. I asked him to email me one. Moments later I felt my phone vibrate and I opened his email. What I saw blew me away. During the years that the film had sat in the camera body the silver nitrate emulsion had begun to break down and had crystalized on the surface of the film leaving ghostly geometric streaks across the image. The pictures looked like they were from another world. They were absolutely stunning. I leaned over and showed my phone to Daymond John who was sitting to my right on the Shark Tank set. ""What the hell is that?"" he exclaimed. Exactly, I thought.

Photo: Joan Marcus   Last season's best off-Broadway musical is now this season's best Broadway musical. Fun Home is the best Broadway musical in years. Don't let the subject matter fool you. You might have heard that the Jeanine Tesori-Lisa Kron musical, adapted from the autobiographical ""graphic novel"" by Alison Bechdel, is about a lesbian cartoonist and her gay father who kills himself. That might not sound like a cheery way to spend a couple of hours, but don't be misled. Fun Home is an emotional roller-coaster ride, a grippingly heartwarming story mixed with some of the most smart and joyful musical numbers presently on Broadway. Alison (Beth Malone) is, indeed, a 43-year-old lesbian cartoonist. We also see her as the pre-teen Small Alison (Sydney Lucas) and the college-freshman Middle Alison (Emily Skeggs). The nature of the narrative that Kron and Tesori have devised--and the beauty of the piece--is that we can see them all at the same time, in the same space, sometimes delivering the same sentence. Small Alison grows up trying to communicate with her decidedly difficult father Bruce (Michael Cerveris); Middle Alison leaves home for college, where (a) she comes out, (b) learns her father is gay, and (c) watches as he commits suicide months later. The adult Alison, meanwhile, struggles to make sense of it all. While the three Alisons are central, Cerveris (of Assassins and Titanic) is the key to the proceedings. As the repressed, unknowable father, he gives an excellent performance so uncharacteristic that some viewers are likely not to even recognize him under the hairpiece. The hidden strength of the show is Judy Kuhn (of Les Misérables and Chess), as the mother Helen. Helen seems almost invisible in this family, her true self having dwindled over the course of the marriage. Late in the show, she is revealed to have been very much aware of the situation all along; but what could she do other than sit at the piano, passively practicing Chopin? ""Chaos never happens if it's never seen,"" she repeatedly notes. Finally comes her song, which illuminates the show. ""Days and Days"" is staggeringly good dramatic writing, and Kuhn--a three-time Tony nominee--is breathtakingly stunning. The cast is rounded out by the two young brothers, Oscar Williams and the cute-as-a-button Zell Steele Morrow; Roberta Colindrez, as Alison's droll college girlfriend; and Joel Perez, as several young men for whom Bruce hungers.   Beth Malone and Emily Skeggs in Fun Home. Photo: Jenny Anderson   The power of the story is enhanced by the songs, which mix passion with humor. Tesori has previously demonstrated her abilities as musical dramatist with Violet and Caroline, or Change, as well as putting food on the table with the less challenging but more popular Thoroughly Modern Millie and Shrek. The Fun Home score is monumental, revealing talent and sensitivity that is sustained throughout the piece. The music blends perfectly with the lyrics of the heretofore non-lyric writer Kron (of Well), whose book and lyrics here are equally exceptional. This is easily the finest theatre score in a decade, by my reckoning since The Light in the Piazza. Tesori and Kron mix emotionally moving numbers with others that simply lift the roof off the theatre. ""Come to the Fun Home"" is a comic knockout; appearing early in what thus far seems to be an overwhelmingly serious evening, the three pre-teens radiate blissful joy as they sing a pretend-TV commercial--in Jackson 5 style--for their family-run funeral home (hence, ""fun home""). ""Changing My Major,"" delivered by Ms. Skeggs in the first throes of passion, is an irrepressible whirlwind artfully crafted with the sort of rhymes an 18-year-old might devise; and ""Ring of Keys,"" in which the Small Alison discovers the meaning of physical attraction, is so gloriously good that you can't imagine Tesori and Kron can top it until they hit you with ""Days and Days."" Chris Fenwick leads a seven-piece band in John Clancy's sensitive orchestrations. Fun Home originated at the Public's Newman Theater--home of the original productions of A Chorus Line, Elaine Stritch at Liberty and Hamilton--where it was wonderfully staged by Sam Gold (Circle Mirror Transformation). Circle in the Square calls for a thoroughly different in-the-round staging, and in undertaking the challenge Mr. Gold has outdone himself: the show has grown stronger, and better. The actors move and turn to face the patrons, of course; but Gold and designer David Zinn (The Last Ship) favor the in-the-round audience by also having the scenery move, rotate, and reappear in different places like cartoon panels. The result is a greater immediacy that enhances the impact of the material. As an added bonus, we can't help but see the thrilled reactions of audience members sitting opposite.   Sam Gold's staging of Fun Home. Photo: Joan Marcus   The transfer, eighteen-months after the Public opening, brings cast changes in the roles of Middle Alison and the two brothers. The original girl, Alexandra Socha, was excellent but so is Ms. Skeggs, who replaced Socha midway through the Public run. Skeggs appears to be younger, more awkward and unsure of her path, which plays very well. The other Alisons reprise their excellent performances, although the 11-year-old Ms. Lucas appears noticeably older and taller than she was in 2013. The boys, too, are just as charming as the earlier pair; the 8-year-old Morrow, dancing and whooping on a fun(eral) home casket while using a spray can of furniture polish as a microphone, is quite a sight. The authors and director have seen fit to cut a favorite song from downtown, ""Al for Short."" Which on reflection is the right choice; we learn the essential information from ""Ring of Keys,"" which has more emotional heft, and there is no room in a brisk 100 minutes to restate yourself. It's highly uncommon, though, for present-day Broadway songwriters to cut an excellent song because they don't need it. Seekers of provocative, invigorating and entertaining theatre--musical or dramatic--will find it at Circle in the Square.

The charismatic but intimidating executive, who now runs The Weinstein Company with his brother Bob after co-founding Miramax in 1979, joined Deadline.com's Mike Fleming Jr. at the Tribeca Film Festival on Saturday for a discussion about his film career. A full house packed Manhattan's School of Visual Arts Theatre, where folding chairs were pulled out to accommodate overflow. Weinstein's pervasive media presence means his legacy is well-documented (read Peter Biskind's Down and Dirty Pictures for some really juicy stuff), but he ticked off an hour's worth of anecdotes from the front lines of film development. Many -- like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon inserting a fake oral-sex scene in their ""Good Will Hunting"" script to ensure producers were actually reading it -- are already the subject of modern cinema lore. Here are nine fresh Weinstein goodies to snack on:1. Weinstein tried to get Quentin Tarantino to do ""The Hateful Eight"" on Broadway. After Tarantino staged a triumphant reading of the leaked script last April, Weinstein encouraged him to take the production to the Great White Way, where he is now a lead producer. ""But in the end, cinema wins,"" Weinstein said after describing the film's shooting process. Tarantino insisted the production use actual snow in Telluride, Colorado, where it is filming. ""Anybody who doesn't believe in climate control or climate change should have been on our set because Telluride is where it snows incessantly. This year it didn't snow,"" he said. ""But I promise you, having seen about 40 minutes of the movie right now, it's special and fun and sharp and new and edgy and good, really good."" Tarantino and Weinstein at the ""Inglourious Basterds"" Hollywood premiere on Aug. 10, 2009.2. Tarantino modeled his Hollywood approach off Clint Eastwood's. Warner Bros. didn't want Tarantino to direct 1993's ""True Romance"" because ""they didn't know who he was,"" Weinstein said, so the studio instead recruited ""Top Gun"" maestro Tony Scott to helm Tarantino's script. Having already made ""Reservoir Dogs"" for Miramax, Tarantino channeled Eastwood's loyalty to Warner Bros. as inspiration. He stuck with Miramax from then on, making it and The Weinstein Company ""the house that Quentin built."" When ""Pulp Fiction"" won the Palme d'Or after premiering at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1994, Eastwood, who served as the jury's president that year, told Weinstein he wanted to give the actor prize to John Travolta, but the festival's directors told him not to show that much affection for one movie. 3. ""Life is Beautiful"" owes credit to ""Mad Max."" Weinstein and Roberto Benigni added narration to the beginning and end of ""Life is Beautiful"" to frame the story after some found its humorous depiction of the Holocaust to be a ""disgrace."" ""We took that from 'Mad Max,' so watch the movie again. We owe George Miller ... because the whole son thing at the end was 'The Road Warrior.'"" 4. Weinstein told Errol Morris he'd hire someone to play him if he didn't give more interesting interviews. While promoting the seminal 1988 documentary ""The Thin Blue Line,"" which Miramax distributed, Weinstein couldn't stand to listen to Morris give radio interviews because he was the ""most boring guy [Weinstein] had ever worked with."" Morris would drone on and on in his responses, so Weinstein sent him a letter demonstrating how to give short, effective answers and informing Morris that an actor would portray him if there were no improvements. Weinstein said Morris ""loved"" the letter, but his only true concern was getting Randall Adams, the film's falsely convicted subject, out of jail. Weinstein rereleased the movie several times in Dallas, where the crime had occurred, and they were ultimately successful. That ignited a social consciousness in Weinstein that he says continued with movies like ""Philomena,"" which addressed the Catholic Church's stance on out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and ""The Imitation Game,"" which sparked a petition to pardon 49,000 British men who were prosecuted for being gay. 5. Weinstein is shocked he got away with depicting Lyndon B. Johnson's Voting Rights Act politics and ""Selma"" didn't. In discussing the alleged inaccuracies leveled against ""The Imitation Game,"" Weinstein said it was even more shocking to watch ""Selma"" (released by Paramount) get pummeled for the same things depicted in ""All the Way,"" the LBJ play that he produced starring Bryan Cranston. ""It was three hours of getting the voting-rights bill done. Johnson is twisting every arm in the room,"" Weinstein said. ""This guy was not Plato or Socrates -- he was a tough senator from Texas who knew how to get a bill passed, so the idea that his people were criticizing 'Selma,' you know, why didn't they criticize us?"" ""We're worse in terms of that,"" he continued. ""I called Bryan and said, 'We got away with this. It's unfair what we got away with that those guys didn't. ... And we won Best Play last year, and Bryan Cranston won Best Actor. Nobody came after us; why did they come after 'Selma'? Makes you think."" 6. Weinstein would prefer five Best Picture nominees. He's always been ""bothered"" by the Oscars' recent decision to stuff as many as 10 movies in the category. If the awards want to be more mainstream, he says the Academy should add a Best Comedy field, like it did with Best Animated Feature in 2001. 7. He and Steven Spielberg did not have the warmest encounter after ""Shakespeare in Love"" topped ""Saving Private Ryan"" for Best Picture. ""Ryan"" began the 1999 Oscar race as the one to beat, but Miramax spent an unprecedented $5 million campaigning for ""Shakespeare,"" ensuring the studio matched or bested every dollar Jeffrey Katzenberg spent on DreamWorks' ""Ryan"" campaign. Years later, it is still cited as one of the most suspenseful derbies in the awards' history. ""When I saw Spielberg later, I don't think it was a lovefest,"" Weinstein said. ""That was a tough one.""  David Parfitt, Donna Gigliotti, Harvey Weinstein, Gwyneth Paltrow, Edward Zwick and Marc Norman at the Oscars on March 21, 1999.8. Weinstein threatened to fire Ellen Barkin from ""Into the West."" Weinstein called Barkin ""so difficult to work with,"" which is fitting given the reputation she'd developed around that time. While working on Mike Newell's 1992 family Western, Weinstein suggested he replace her with the largely unknown Catherine Zeta-Jones. Not wanting to be fired, Barkin asked him to give her one more day. When she returned, she was ""amazing,"" even cooking food for the crew, Weinstein said. ""The quote about that was, 'There's only one diva on a Harvey Weinstein movie: him,"" he said.9. Losing ""Lord of the Rings"" is still his biggest disappointment. Miramax had distributed Peter Jackson's ""Heavenly Creatures"" in 1994, and Weinstein jumped when the director said he longed to adapt J.R.R. Tolkien's series. Weinstein fought hard to secure the rights and make the films for a budget that was consistent with Miramax's $40 million cap. Negotiations began with the Weinstein brothers pitching one film based on ""The Hobbit"" and two inspired by the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. But as budgets swelled and Jackson became increasingly resistant to axing portions of the books, Weinstein continued to battle for the project, at one point attempting to recruit ""Shakespeare in Love"" director John Madden to take over. But Jackson convinced Weinstein to relinquish the rights, and he was able to get New Line Cinema to agree to three costly films. A few years later, Fleming saw Weinstein leave the 2001 premiere of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" looking like his dog had been shot. It remains Weinstein's biggest loss as a project. ""I know he was hurt -- I'm hurt, too -- and we've had a pretty good relationship since,"" Weinstein said of Jackson. Listen to Weinstein's full interview, courtesy of WYNC: "

It may point to a growing sense in the military that momentum favors Hadi.Beginning last week, most of the army divisions along Yemen's eastern Arabian Sea coast evacuated their posts and handed security of their bases and Yemen's Masila oil fields, the country's largest, to armed Sunni tribes.Other powerful tribes followed suit on Saturday within the First Military District, announcing after a huge gathering that they supported Hadi and the Saudi-led military operation, in a move which likely encouraged the commander's decision.""The announcement followed that of the tribes. It would be impossible to oppose their will and continue to live side by side, and there was likely some pressure from Saudi Arabia, which is keen to secure its border,"" Radhi Subaih, a political analyst in Seiyun, told Reuters.Citizens from Hadramawt, Yemen's largest province which stretches from the coast to the Saudi border, are linked closely to the kingdom by family and historical ties.The remainder of Saudi Arabia's border with Yemen encompasses the northern stronghold of the Houthi guerrillas.

38,RELIGION,Can Religion And Politics Mix For Good Rather Than Evil?,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/religion-and-politics_n_7089608.html,,2015-04-19,"WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 07: Shaun Casey delivers remarks after being introduces as the head of the new State Department Office of Faith-Based Community Initiatives in the Benjamin Franklin Room at the State Department August 7, 2013 in Washington, DC. Previously an evangelical Christian outreach coordinator for the Obama Campaign, Casey is a former Associate Professor of Christian Ethics and Director of the National Capital Semester for Seminarians (NCSS) at Wesley Theological Seminary and is the author of 'The Making of a Catholic President: Kennedy v. Nixon 1960' (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7ff61200000c101018be3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK (RNS) Religion and politics are assumed to be a dangerous brew, volatile to the point of murderous. And at least judging by current events in the Middle East and elsewhere, that may well be true.But can this potion be used for advancing peace rather than instigating war?That’s the argument that an A-list panel of experts – including Shaun Casey, special adviser on religious issues at the U.S. State Department – explored on Wednesday (April 15) in a provocative debate at Fordham University that produced some surprising insights.The goal, as author and moderator Eliza Griswold put it in opening “Beyond Extremism: Reclaiming Religion’s Peacebuilding Capacity in an Unstable World” – was to go beyond the easy optimism that says “religion really has nothing to do with the problems of the world right now.”“It’s a safe thing to say in political, journalistic and academic circles,” said Griswold, author of the 2010 book “The Tenth Parallel: Dispatches from the Fault Line Between Christianity and Islam.” “And it’s not true.”The observations grew even more pointed, and intriguing, from there. R. Scott Appleby, dean of the Keough School of Global Affairs at the University of Notre Dame, didn’t mince any words.“Religious communities, including most religious leaders, are not peacebuilders and indeed have little awareness that they are called to peacebuilding, and what it might take to become a peacebuilder,” he said.Appleby, a leading expert on fundamentalism and religion and violence, argued that religion in practice isn’t really about building peace, but rather “trying to build and maintain a flock” and “protecting one’s own religious community, even if that means exaggerating and amplifying discord with neighboring communities.”Appleby’s other three points were just as eye-opening:For example, he asserted that contrary to many claims, “radical Islam is about Islam” and “until this is understood, religious peacebuilding is an empty promise.” He also said that Hindu nationalism, Jewish “irredentism,” Christian “chauvinism” and other forms of religious extremism are about those religious traditions as well, not entirely alien to them.While such manifestations by no means form the core or entirety of religions like Islam, they nonetheless are features of those traditions. And they must be dealt with by building up religious institutions, reducing religious corruption, improving religious education and denouncing extremism in one’s own ranks.Another point: All those lovely interreligious dialogues and ceremonies? They are little more than “the parlor games of those not sufficiently serious about religious peacebuilding, which begins with and should be focused upon intra-religious reform and intra-communal mobilization for peace.”At best, Appleby said, such events are “useful for building solidarity among elite.” But they have “virtually no traction at the grassroots.”In addition, Appleby argued that “well-intentioned” governmental efforts to foster religious communities to promote peace, especially after the 9/11 attacks, have actually “undermined religious peacebuilding, robbing it of its true potential.”Religious leaders have little real influence, he argued, and governmental programs tend to focus on the abstract intellectual or wonky policy aspects of religion rather than what happens on the ground.One exception, Appleby diplomatically noted, was Casey’s work in the U.S. State Department’s Office of Faith-Based Community Initiatives, which he said is attempting to “go deep, not just broad.”For his part, Casey did not dispute Appleby’s critiques. “Anyone who disagrees with you just doesn’t understand what’s going on,” he said.At the heart of the problem, Casey said, “is a global crisis of religious authority” that has unleashed rogue leaders and explosive passions within religious traditions.While acknowledging the shortcomings of governmental efforts to engage some religious communities or contain others, Casey argued that his office on religion and diplomacy – a priority for Secretary of State John Kerry, he said – is trying to reorient U.S. diplomacy to view religion as “always embodied, always in context.”In other words, he said, American diplomats need to be reflexively thinking about how “lived religion” works in the context of each country and region, not how it exists in academia or in a seminary. His office is “trying to inject religion into the DNA of the State Department,” Casey said.“If we are successful, our office will disappear.”By way of rebuttal, veteran journalist and foreign policy analyst Robin Wright argued that her decades of covering upheavals in the Middle East and elsewhere had convinced her that in fact religious leaders are often remarkable peacebuilders. She mentioned Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, for example, as well as St. John Paul II and the Dalai Lama.Wright, a self-confessed “devout agnostic” and author of the 2011 book, “Rock the Casbah: Rage and Rebellion Across the Islamic World,” agreed with Appleby – and disagreed with Casey – about efforts by the U.S. government to work with religious players in conflict zones to enhance peace or advance Americans objectives.“It concerns me because we are so clumsy at understanding other cultures and knowing how to engage in that dialogue,” she said. She said the U.S. becomes “vulnerable to the central flaw of U.S. foreign policy, which is that we always look for mirrors of ourselves” when that is usually not the reality in any given country.The problem, she said, is when it comes to government engagement with religion, “we don’t know how to do it well … and the danger that we do it badly, even at a time when we are well-intentioned, is too high.”In the end, everyone seemed to agree that religions are most likely to become a force for peace when religions themselves reform themselves – which is not a task any government, much less the U.S., can do for them.In the meantime, perhaps the best thing that governments and individuals can do is to work to understand religions and the varieties of religious experience.“There is no such thing as Islam. And there is no such thing as Christianity. And there is no such thing as Judaism,” Appleby said, delivering a final provocation. “There are Islams and Christianities and Judaisms.”"
39,ENTERTAINMENT,9 Tidbits From George Lucas' Tribeca Chat With Stephen Colbert,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-lucas-stephen-colbert-tribeca_n_7093190.html,,2015-04-19,"NEW YORK, NY - APRIL 17: Stephen Colbert (L) and George Lucas speak onstage at Tribeca Talks: Director Series: George Lucas With Stephen Colbert during the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival at BMCC Tribeca PAC on April 17, 2015 in New York City. (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival )",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4b3282600003500826e5d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The chance to see George Lucas discuss his career ranked fairly high in our Tribeca Film Festival priorities, especially with Stephen Colbert conducting the interview. Apparently we weren't alone: The festival sold out one of its largest flagship auditoriums for Friday's hour-long panel, part of the Tribeca Talks series, and spectators lined up with posters and DVDs for the ""Star Wars"" overlord to autograph. Inside, it took no time at all to realize there is very little the 70-year-old Lucas hasn't already been asked about his well-documented career. Even an adept moderator (and ""Star Wars"" obsessive) like Colbert couldn't squeeze out many fresh tidbits from the talkative director, though he did display his signature wit throughout, particularly when Lucas sneezed and Colbert responded by saying, ""May The Force be with you."" These guys! So silly! But even the nerdiest of ""Star Wars"" fans can stand to revisit morsels about the iconic franchise -- and hey, maybe there's even something in here that you didn't already know. Here are nine quickies from Friday's conversation: 1. George Lucas is not a fan of being a celebrity. He's happy to wear sneakers and avoid Hollywood galas, which has prompted some in the industry to liken him to the reclusive Howard Hughes. 2. There's at least one downside to directing ""Star Wars."" ""The one thing I regret about doing 'Star Wars' is I never got to see it,"" Lucas said when asked whether he's anticipating ""The Force Awakens,"" which opens in December. ""I never got that thrill.""3. ""American Graffiti"" started as a dare from Francis Ford Coppola. The duo became pals after Lucas won a scholarship in film school that allowed him to work on a Warner Bros. project of his choosing. He selected ""Finian's Rainbow,"" Coppola's 1968 musical starring Fred Astaire and Petula Clark. (Coppola was 29 when ""Rainbow"" opened; Lucas was 24.) In 1969, the directors opened their own studio, American Zoetrope, which released Lucas' infamous 1971 sci-fi flop ""THX 1138."" (It was a joint venture with Warner Bros., which ""told Francis Ford Coppola and me, ‘We want our money back,'"" Lucas said. In order to pay off that $350,000, Coppola made a little film called ""The Godfather."") Coppola then told Lucas to lay off the experimental ""robot"" stuff, daring him to write a comedy instead. Confident he could do it, Lucas channeled his California youth to write ""American Graffiti,"" which went on to earn five Oscar nominations and become 1973's third-highest grossing movie across North America.4. Lucas is fully aware of what you think about his most recent ""Star Wars"" scripts. ""I'm notorious for wooden dialogue,"" Lucas said, presumably referring to criticism that defined the franchise's second trilogy. Frankly, he doesn't care, largely because dialogue, in his mind, is secondary to visuals and sound. In keeping, he considers ""Star Wars"" a silent film that generates meaning from its movement. ""You could be 2 years old and not understand what anyone’s saying, but still understand the movie,"" he said.5. The only one of Lucas' director friends who supported ""Star Wars"" was Steven Spielberg. Lucas' posse includes Brian De Palma and Martin Scorsese, but Spielberg was the only one who said ""Star Wars"" would be a hit after Lucas screened it for his buddies. De Palma, who released ""Carrie"" a year before 1977's ""A New Hope"" opened, instead asked, ""What the hell is The Force?"" 6. Lucas learned of the ""Star Wars"" momentum from a news report. Alan Ladd Jr. was the producer who gave ""Star Wars"" the green light, and he remained Lucas' only supporter when 20th Century Fox wanted to nix production due to escalating budgets and location snafus. Lucas insisted Ladd wait a few weeks after ""A New Hope"" opened to gauge its performance, once the movie could transcend the fanatics who will show up for any sci-fi flick. A week after the movie hit theaters, Lucas was on vacation in Hawaii when he saw a CBS news story showcasing the fandom that had already erupted -- it was then that he grasped its proliferating impact. 7. But Lucas never wanted to make Hollywood blockbusters. He was interested in experimental films, à la ""THX 1138."" Today, he says he's retired and tinkering around with the type of movies that studios didn't want him to make. ""They’ll probably never get released,” he joked. “I’m just screwing around in my garage.” He can afford to screw around because he worked to secure ""Star Wars"" sequel rights from 20th Century Fox after ""A New Hope"" became a hit. “That’s how I got to be rich,"" he said, smiling.8. As of Friday, Lucas hadn't seen the latest ""Force Awakens"" trailer. And he has no idea what the new movie is about, despite receiving a ""creative consultant"" credit. (He didn't watch the first teaser until almost two months after it debuted.) ""I'm excited, I have no idea what they're doing,"" he said. The original, however, remains a family saga -- his intent was to make a movie about ""the father, the children, the grandchildren.” 9. Lucas thinks Colbert should replace Jon Stewart. ""Don't you think the perfect choice to replace that Jon Stewart fella would have been you? And now you're working at 'Late Show,' where nobody sees you,"" Lucas quipped, to which Colbert responded by saying that he was previously on at 11:30 p.m. and will now be on at 11:35. He never wanted to take Stewart's gig because he would forever live ""underneath his shadow."""

They barge into every discussion about racial issues like belligerent drunks in a bar, arrogance emanating from them like a stench, armed with statistics ""proving"" that Blacks are the most violent ethnic group on earth, shouting ignorance at the top of their lungs and daring anybody to challenge them. Any attempt to engage them in logical debate will result in them parroting right-wing talking points, and if you get the upper hand in an argument, they will almost surely respond with racial slurs before vanishing back into the ether of the Internet like klansmen after a raid. The race troll is one of the nastier lifeforms spawned by the Internet and for a group that's so disdainful of Black culture, they have an unhealthy obsession with it. They leave hateful comments on popular rap videos on YouTube, they make racial slurs against President Obama almost instinctively, and no news story comment section about Black issues is complete without their opinions. If you express outrage at police brutality, they call you Al Sharpton. If you mention America's history of racism and ongoing discrimination, you're told you need to ""get over it"" and to stop ""playing the race card."" They're the online equivalent of Westboro Baptist Church, uninvited, unwelcome, and only interested in spreading negativity wherever they go. I try my best not to engage with them but sometimes they will roll up in the midst of an online conversation to say something hateful and before I know it, I've spent an hour going back and forth with a bigot who only wants to be Twitter famous and leave you angry and annoyed.Being an overt racist is social and professional suicide and the relative anonymity of the web has given bigots a safe place to vent their hate speech. Some of them are people looking for attention anyway they can get it, but I suspect that taken as a whole, they represent a silent, hidden majority, an ugly underworld of racism and belief in white supremacy lurking just beneath the surface of American society. It's very telling that so many trolls use American flag and eagle avatars to hide behind. A lot of them seem to see themselves as ""freedom fighters"", using the Internet as a battlefield in a crusade to restore a bygone America when the voice of the white male was the voice of god, women never advanced beyond the Mad Men era, and people of color had no authority over anything beyond a mop. These are the people who donated over a quarter of a million dollars to Darren Wilson's GoFundMe page in less than a month. In their world, every police killing is justified, every Black person arrested or shot is guilty. And it's deeper than insults. San Francisco is in the process of firing several police officers who traded racist and homophobic messages with each other. Ferguson has a history of public officials making racist jokes from beat cops all the way up to the city council and racist messages by officers on an NYPD blog have recently come to light. When lack of respect is ingrained in people with the power of life and death over the people they disrespect, tragedies happen. America is becoming darker every year. If current population trends continue, people of color will be the majority in the United States in about two decades. For the white supremacist, that coming reality is a nightmare and maybe that's the real motivation for internet race trolls: fear. The fear that the browning of America means that they will have to listen to a rising chorus of voices other than their own and that eventually, they will be drowned out.In the end, race trolling is about insecurity disguised as patriotism and using racist, Bell Curve style junk science to prop up an unsupported superiority complex. It would be laughable, if the consequences of that mentality being taken out into the world weren't so deadly."
