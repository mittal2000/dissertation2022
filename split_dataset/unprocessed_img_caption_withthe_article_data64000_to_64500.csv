0,POLITICS,Senators Looking Beyond Flint On Lead Pipe Replacement,Arthur Delaney and Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-flint-water-crisis_us_56cc6ac7e4b0928f5a6d2eed,Democrats originally proposed legislation targeting only the high-profile corrosion problem in Michigan.,2016-02-23,Sens. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) are negotiating water infrastructure legislation that's been going through some changes. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_10_197_5174_2459%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Since January, members of the U.S. Senate have been negotiating a half-billion-dollar measure to help Flint, Michigan, remove lead pipes that have poisoned potentially thousands of children. That has changed. Senators involved in the negotiation said on Tuesday that their proposal isn't just about Flint anymore -- they also want to help communities that could face a similar fate.Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) told reporters the measure would have a national scope ""so other folks would be able to get some of these resources if they're similarly situated.""Many cities in the U.S. have lead pipes just like Flint's. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates 10 million American homes and businesses receive water from service lines that are at least partially made from lead -- a deadly neurotoxin that can cause a range of health problems, including permanent brain damage in small children.Lead leached from Flint's pipes after the city switched its water supply and failed to control the corrosiveness of the new water. Experts say properly treated water can form a protective barrier inside lead pipes, but the barrier can corrode away if the water's chemistry changes, leading to high levels of lead in the water. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act requires public water systems to take action when lead levels exceed a certain amount. The state of Michigan denied the lead problem until local doctors confirmed the substance had been found in the blood of some children in Flint.Peters and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) cautioned that nothing is final.""We've put some proposals forward,"" Peters said. ""We are waiting to hear back but the discussions continue.""Stabenow said she didn't know if the measure would remain attached to an unrelated energy bill that stalled amid squabbling over the Flint provision.""It's all up in the air,"" she said. ""There's a lot of needs around the country.""The original measure would have provided $400 million in emergency funding for the EPA to help replace Flint's water infrastructure, according to a summary. This would require the state of Michigan to match the funds. The legislation also included $200 million to establish a Center of Excellence on Lead Exposure in Flint.Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) criticized the measure in January, saying it could set a precedent for the federal government helping other places with lead pipe problems.""Given the fact that we have about $19 trillion in debt, I think it’s fair to ask, do we want to have the federal government replacing all the infrastructure put in place by cities and states all across the country?"" he asked.Days after the floor debate broke down, Democrats offered a very different version of their initial proposal, which would have provided states $60 million to secure up to $600 million worth of loans under an existing federal program for water infrastructure financing. A summary said the financing would be available to any state that has received a presidential emergency declaration due to lead.Michigan officials, meanwhile, have been trying to move forward with their own plans to replace Flint's pipes.

Singapore-based artists Li Jun Pek, who uses the pseudonym ""Ink Julep,"" and Jenn Perng have created postcards with artwork that can only be completed with the addition of a round coffee stain from your mug called ""PostCups."" The result? Stains your pen pals will actually love. The pair, who work in advertising and have taken on this project on the side, have come out with 7 different PostCups which are available on Etsy. Their drawings -- when stamped with a coffee stain -- become doodles ranging from a cute panda to a ferris wheel.  Pek, who launched the project with Perng back in January, told the Huffington Post in an e-mail that the coffee-loving pair actually came up with the idea out of annoyance with coffee stains. ""We started out noticing that coffee cup stains are a constant pain in life. Our office desks are white so this is glaringly obvious,"" Pek said. ""We wanted to take that pain of a coffee stain and turn it into something special. Because we're all coffee lovers and every stain is unique."" So the pair got to thinking, and they came up with a way to turn those otherwise irritating marks into something aesthetically pleasing. ""Normal coasters treat stains like a nuisance [that] they need to protect the surface from. So we thought of interactive coasters,"" she explained in the e-mail. ""Something that would create a 'home' just for the coffee stains, where they became desirable. We decided on drawings where the stains became essential to the picture.""We can definitely say these blemishes have turned into a thing of beauty.If you're a coffee addict and you love the PostCups, you can check them out on the pair's Etsy listing here.

2,MEDIA,"Mount Vernon Says It Owns George Washington's Copy Of Don Quixote, Not Glenn Beck",Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/glenn-beck-don-quixote_us_56cc7effe4b041136f1851cb,Conservative host acknowledges his book wasn't purchased the day the Constitution was signed but is a later edition connected to the president.,2016-02-23,Glenn Beck has wielded what he's claimed to be George Washington's copy of Don Quixote at several campaign stops. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56cc7f381500002a000b0842.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- As Glenn Beck has campaigned for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the conservative host has repeatedly wielded a copy of a Don Quixote he claims was purchased by George Washington the day the Constitution was signed.Beck, who has compared Cruz to a modern-day Washington, showed off the book at campaign stops in Iowa last month. ""He wrote two lines [in his diary] on the day of the signing of the Constitution,"" Beck said of Washington during a Jan. 30 stop in Ames, Iowa.""First line: 'Signed the Constitution today.' Second line: 'I pick up my copy of Don Quixote.' This is his copy of Don Quixote that he picked up that day.”""I brought it because here’s the most amazing thing anybody had ever done, but he had such confidence in it,"" Beck continued. ""He knew the brighter days for all mankind -- not just America, all mankind -- were just on the horizon. He had done his job and he could sleep at night.""Beck pulled out the book again in recent days while stumping for Cruz in Nevada and apparently gave it to an audience member to hold.But the museum at Mount Vernon, Washington's Virginia home, says the copy of Don Quixote in question, which Washington purchased in Philadelphia on Sept. 17, 1787, is stored safely in its collection. A Mount Vernon spokeswoman told HuffPost that it's in the rare books vault at the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington, the presidential library in Washington's home. Mount Vernon even displays images of the book on its website. Spain's ambassador gave Washington a Spanish-language version of the book later that same year. A spokeswoman said the Spanish version, too, is stored at Mount Vernon. In a statement to HuffPost, Beck acknowledged the book he's displayed at rallies is not the copy of Don Quixote that Washington purchased on that day. However, Beck said he possesses another copy of the book, dated 1796, from Washington's library.""The lesson that I take from Washington's diary where he says 'Signed the constitution. Bought Don Quixote' is that we are never done in our service to God and Country,"" Beck said. ""I have incorrectly stated that my copy is the copy that Washington purchased the day he signed the Constitution. That version is one of the copies owned and housed in Mount Vernon. I take full responsibility for connecting my book (which is dated 1796) to the book Washington purchased that fateful day of September 17th, 1787. But make no mistake the copy in my possession is from the private library of George Washington.""Experts at Mount Vernon noted that the ownership of the 1796 volume is complicated, and that it's uncertain whether that later edition, owned by Beck, was in Washington's library or was purchased by Washington as a gift for his friend Colonel Tobias Lear. The 1796 copy of Don Quixote was later passed down to Lear's son, Benjamin, who identified it in records as having been received from Washington.A Mount Vernon spokeswoman said it would need to see Beck's copy in person to authenticate it. The copy of Don Quixote isn't the only artifact related to Washington that Beck has shown off at Cruz events in recent weeks. He has also brought out a compass that belonged to Washington, arguing that America needs someone like Cruz who displays the exactness of a surveyor.This article has been updated with comment from Beck and additional information from Mount Vernon."
3,POLITICS,Some States Throw Untested Rape Kits In The Trash. These Survivors Want To Change That.,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/untested-rape-kits-in-trash_us_56cb4e5ee4b041136f17b087,New legislation could prevent critical evidence in sexual assault cases from being destroyed.,2016-02-23,Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) is the leading sponsor of a Senate legislation calling for states to adopt some basic rights for rape survivors.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every six months, Amanda Nguyen has to play a twisted and exhausting game to find her rape kit and make sure that no one destroys it. Nguyen, 24, was sexually assaulted in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in October 2014. Within 24 hours of her attack, Nguyen went to the hospital and asked for a rape kit examination. ""At the hospital,"" Nguyen told The Huffington Post, ""they gave me a bunch of pamphlets and one of the pamphlets said kits will be stored at the Massachusetts police lab for six months, and quote, 'At the end of six months it will be destroyed.'""Massachusetts has a 15-year statute of limitations on prosecuting sexual assault crimes, but the state only requires that untested rape kits be stored for six months. Victims can get an extension, but Nguyen said she had to hunt to find out how. ""It really makes no sense to have 15 years in which the survivors can bring charges against someone, and then to destroy the evidence that's going to be so critical to convicting them, in a six-month period,"" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told HuffPost on Tuesday.Shaheen introduced a bill called the Sexual Assault Survivors Act on Tuesday that would create a right for victims to have their rape kit preserved free of charge for the duration of their state's statute of limitations; the right to be notified of the information found in medical forensic examinations; and the right to get, in writing, the policies governing a rape kit. Her bill attempts to create a ""baseline"" for rape survivors to understand what their basic rights are, Shaheen said.""We need to do a better job of letting people who have been victims of sexual assault know what their rights are and know how to pursue justice,"" Shaheen said.States and local jurisdictions decide how to prosecute sexual assaults, which is why two states next to each other may define rape in different ways and handle cases differently. But Congress is trying to prod more states to require that sex crime victims be told of their legal rights, and to implement policies to test rape kits quicker. Reps. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-Fla.) and Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) gathered 50 co-sponsors to introduce a bipartisan House resolution last year urging states to adopt a ""bill of rights"" for rape survivors, including giving the victim of a sexual assault the right to prompt analysis and results of a rape kit, the right to be notified in writing of survivors' legal rights and the right to a counselor or advocate.The bill authored by Shaheen, which is co-sponsored by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), doesn't create a right to have the rape kit tested promptly, as the House resolution urges states to do. But it does call for a working group established by the attorney general and Secretary of Health and Human Services to coordinate and disseminate best practices on the care and treatment for sexual assault survivors and related forensic evidence.Legislators and state officials around the country have worked in recent years to try to clear a backlog of untested rape kits, spending millions of dollars to do so. But officials in states like Colorado, Kentucky and North Carolina are increasingly disclosing that it's not uncommon for labs to have to trashed untested kits -- in some cases, illegally.Currently, no state provides a right to retain the rape kit until the statute of limitations expires. Only six states and Washington, D.C., provide a right for the prompt testing of a rape kit. ""It's in everyone's interest -- the survivor, the law enforcement officer and the accused -- to not have evidence destroyed,"" Nguyen said. For Nguyen, there was no information provided to her about how to file an extension to prevent her kit from being destroyed in Cambridge. Police provided conflicting information, Nguyen said, including saying that the kit would be stored indefinitely. She then went back and forth between police and the state lab technicians trying to locate her kit. Even when she found it and got the extension on storing it, technicians moved her kit again without telling her. ""If we can track a Domino's pizza, we should be able to track something so critically important for the survivor,"" Nguyen said. The first time that Nguyen asked for written confirmation the kit wouldn't be destroyed with her extension, she was told that she had to pick up a paper copy, and that it could not be emailed or mailed it to her. So, Nguyen had to fly from Washington, D.C., to Massachusetts to get it. ""My life is reoriented to the date of the rape,"" Nguyen said. ""It's quite traumatic and it's totally preventable.""Nguyen, a Harvard University graduate who's also a deputy White House liaison at the State Department, started a nonprofit called Rise to bring attention to the discrepancies in rights for rape victims under state laws. The group has a Change.org petition to bolster support for the Senate bill, which it started working with Shaheen's office last summer to get drafted.Massachusetts is considering its own bill, created after Rise's lobbying, that would require police to put in place a system to track rape kits and would prohibit kits from being destroyed without first being tested. The bill would further mirror what Congress is asking states to adopt as basic rights for rape victims.""Survivors should not have to fight to keep their rape kit from the trash can,"" Nguyen said. Some experts, like Jeff Dion, director of the National Crime Victim Bar Association, agree with Nguyen.""I'm not aware of the public policy rationale behind that rule, except that it keeps them from getting bad press from having a backlog of rape kits,"" Dion said of trashing rape kits. ""It's not good for victims and not good for the system.""Brenda Tracy, who also lobbied in favor of the Massachusetts bill, said this type of legislation would've helped her in Oregon. In 1998, Tracy reported being gang raped, but was hesitant about pursuing charges. The district attorney in Tracy's case failed to tell her the accused men implicated each other in interviews and didn't disclose a wealth of physical evidence, Tracy said. Her rape kit was destroyed without being tested and without her knowledge before the statute of limitations in Oregon ended.Since she first went public with the Oregonian, Tracy said she has become an ""accidental spokesperson"" for legislation to improve sexual assault prosecution laws.""The federal bill is really important,"" Tracy told HuffPost. ""It lays the foundation and the model so that other states can use it. Not every state has someone like me or Amanda to use their stories and step out and push for legislation.""Tracy is lobbying for ""Melissa's Bill"" in Oregon, named after Melissa Bittler, a 14-year-old who was killed in 2001 by a man whose DNA was stored in untested rape kits taken in 1996. ""My story happened 17 years ago, and not only did it happen then, but it could still happen today,"" Tracy said. ""We have made no progress.""""Melissa's Bill"" would require cops in Oregon to pick up a a kit from the hospital within a week of being notified, and then have two weeks to submit the evidence to the crime lab. The lab would be required to store rape kit evidence for at least 60 years. Last year, Tracy also lobbied in favor of a new law that extends the statute of limitations in rape cases from six to 12 years in Oregon.Both Tracy and Nguyen know they're going to have to continue lobbying state legislatures to get more of these rights for rape survivors, but they and Dion of the National Crime Victim Bar Association think congressional attention can speed up the process. ""I think this is just the beginning of some baby step to try and entice states to do the right thing for victims,"" Dion said of the legislation in Congress._______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter covering sexual violence, and is based in New York.

The university, a Jesuit school in Fairfield, Connecticut, offered few details except to say its administration and diversity office are looking into reports of a ""culturally insensitive party"" hosted by students. Fairfield officials told the Connecticut Post they are ""working to understand the details.""Fairfield University junior Iman Jebara told Fox 61 that some of her friends attended the party. She described one photo from the event showing a woman with a ball shoved under a white tank top to mimic a pregnancy, with a caption asking who the ""daddy"" was.But some have responded by mocking concerns about stereotypical costumes, according to screenshots of conversations among students on Facebook. In one post, one student wrote, ""I wore a hot dog costume to this party and now feel that my actions have caused emotional harm to all of the hot dog community. Specifically I would like to apologize to Mr. Oscar Meyer as I did not mean to portray your weiner in a negative fashion."" According to Fox 61, another student wrote, ""I am offended that the ghetto party was turned into a race issue. I know plenty of ghetto white people. #whitelivesmatter, #ghetto&proud.""""It's like Halloween, where I'm dressed as a gangster. Nobody said anything then,"" student Brian Mason told the Connecticut Post, adding that he had dressed that way as a 4-year-old. A university spokeswoman told The New York Times that 78 percent of Fairfield's full-time undergrads identify as white.Rev. Jeffrey P. von Arx, the university's president, said in a letter to the campus Monday that the party's theme ""perpetuated racial stereotypes that have no place in our community and only serve to offend and devalue people.""

9,POLITICS,Harry Reid Trolls Mitch McConnell On Supreme Court Nominees,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-supreme-court_us_56cc6b96e4b0ec6725e3e4a4,"His office released a letter to McConnell, from McConnell.",2016-02-23,"Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), right, has been going after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), left, for saying he won't move forward on any Supreme Court nominee from President Barack Obama .",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_30_2149_1210%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- If a young Mitch McConnell were writing a letter to his older, grayer self about how to deal with Supreme Court nominees, he might tell him to avoid a ""rush to judgment"" and make sure there is ""a heavy burden"" by those who want to reject a president's nominee. At least, that's what Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid's (D-Nev.) office envisions he would say.Reid released a mock letter Tuesday addressed to McConnell, the Republican Senate Majority Leader, from McConnell. It pieces together some of his old quotes, ranging from 1970-2010, where he urges careful consideration and a fair amount of deference to a president's Supreme Court pick. ""Any attempt to deny confirmation on the basis of a philosophy, that is within the mainstream of American political and judicial thought, is an assault on this tripartite structure of government,"" reads the ""letter"" from McConnell, using a 1990 floor quote from the senator. ""It is clear under our form of government that the advice and consent role of the Senate in judicial nominations should not be politicized."" McConnell has said he will block any Supreme Court nominee put forward by President Barack Obama to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died earlier this month. The issue is that a nominee will tip the court's balance away from the conservative majority it previously had. McConnell, and other Senate Republicans, want the next president to make the nomination -- hoping, of course, that a Republican will win in 2016. There has been plenty of trading of old quotes during the current debate. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart wasn't particularly impressed with the latest Reid offering. ""Those poor guys, they’ve been trying desperately to get some attention for that 45-year-old article,"" Stewart said, referring to a 1970 Kentucky Law Journal article by McConnell quoted in the letter. He also pointed that Reid, Vice President Joe Biden, and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have also faced their own hypocrisy charges. On Monday, Biden responded to a comment he made in 1992, when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. At that time, Biden said there should be a different standard for a Supreme Court nominee ""that would occur in the full throes of an election year."" He urged then-President George H.W. Bush to follow the example of ""a majority of his predecessors"" and put off naming a replacement.Democrats pointed out that Biden made those remarks in June, which is closer to the election. And Biden himself responded Monday, saying it was inaccurate to say he opposed filling a Supreme Court vacancy during an election year. ""Indeed, as I conclude in the same statement critics are pointing to today, [I] urged the Senate and White House to work together to overcome partisan differences to ensure the Court functions as the Founding Fathers intended. That remains my position today,"" he said. McConnell again called out Democrats for their own past statements Tuesday morning on the floor.""The words of President Obama's own number two,"" McConnell said, quoting Biden's old remarks. ""What else needs to be said?""""He can read all the statements of the senior senator from New York and the vice president,"" Reid responded in his own floor remarks, ""but never were any nominees held up.""Underscoring that Democrats plan to use GOP obstruction on the Supreme Court in the elections, Reid tied McConnell to GOP presidential candidates Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). ""If they follow the course set by the Republican leader, every one of them will be as responsible as Trump and Cruz for the debasement of the Republican Party,"" Reid said. ""He [McConnell] will join them in what they've done to the party. It will be a new and a much worse Republican Party. Clearly Sen. McConnell's absolutely following that lead of extremists Trump and Cruz. There is no clearer response than the Republican leader's response to the Supreme Court vacancy.""Also on HuffPost:"

""The Judiciary Committee has unanimously recommended to me that we not hold a hearing. I don't know the purpose of such a visit. I would not be inclined to take one myself.""Supreme Court nominees typically make courtesy calls to senators, so that lawmakers can get to know them on a more personal level and question them in a more intimate setting. But on Tuesday, at least five senior Republican senators -- McConnell, John Barrasso (Wyo.), John Cornyn (Texas), Orrin Hatch (Utah) and Lindsey Graham (S.C.) -- said they won't participate in this tradition for an Obama nominee. ""There'd be no reason to,"" Barrasso told HuffPost, when asked if he'd meet with whatever nominee Obama sends to the Hill.""I don't see the purpose,"" Cornyn said. ""Joe Biden. Chuck Schumer. If they were in charge they'd be doing the exact same thing,"" Graham added. ""I'm not going to meet with the nominee. I'm sure they'll be a nice person.""McConnell's comments came after every Republican on the Judiciary Committee signed onto a letter saying they won't give a hearing to Obama's pick. Court nominees have to clear this committee before they can get a Senate confirmation vote, so without action here, literally nothing can happen.""Because our decision is based on constitutional principle and born of a necessity to protect the will of the American people, this Committee will not hold hearings on any Supreme Court nominee until after our next President is sworn in on January 20, 2017,"" reads the letter. It's signed by Cornyn, Graham and Hatch, as well as GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Jeff Sessions (Ala.), Mike Lee (Utah), Ted Cruz (Texas), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), David Vitter (La.), David Perdue (Ga.) and Thom Tillis (N.C.).Flake ducked questions about whether he thought the GOP blockade on Obama's nominee, sight unseen, could blow up in their faces.""I'll let Sen. Grassley, the chairman, talk about it,"" Flake said, walking quickly down a Senate hallway. ""I want to let him talk about it.""McConnell announced his intent to block any Obama nominee soon after news broke of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. He said he wants the next president to choose Scalia's replacement -- hoping, of course, that a Republican will win the 2016 election. ""The overwhelming view of the Republican conference in the Senate is that this vacancy should not be filled by this lame duck president,"" McConnell reiterated Tuesday afternoon. A few senators, however, have broken with this hard-line position and said they'd be willing to look at an Obama nominee. Even under normal order, however, it will be an uphill climb; an Obama nominee would need to get the support of every single Democratic senator and at least 14 Republican ones to get confirmed. Democrats have shot back that it would be unprecedented to not even consider a president's Supreme Court nominee and have vowed to make Republicans pay in November.""The party of Lincoln is becoming the party of Donald Trump,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) responded Tuesday, referring to the divisive 2016 GOP front-runner. He also predicted that Grassley would ""go down in history as the most obstructionist Judiciary chair"" for blocking a hearing.Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), however, said he's confident their strategy of obstruction will pay off. ""Let me just say, we are very comfortable letting the American people speak on this issue,"" the senator said."

Back when he was chief executive of Microsoft, Gates drove his daughter to preschool twice a week because his wife Melinda needed his support, she told The New York Times in an interview published Monday. Gates is the richest person in the world. The company he helped found revolutionized personal computing, and he is now making huge strides in alleviating poverty and curing disease. But back then, he set a powerful example for other working parents in his neighborhood.“Moms started going home and saying to their husbands, ‘If Bill Gates can drive his daughter, you better darn well drive our daughter or son,’” Melinda Gates told the Times. “If you’re going to get behavior change, you have to role-model it publicly.”In the U.S., all the power, prestige and kudos go to the people, like Bill Gates, with the fancy jobs, elite pedigrees and, of course, the most Twitter followers. But Melinda Gates is now drawing attention to a huge group of people for whom our respect and support are long overdue: the many women, and increasing numbers of men, who take on the unpaid work that makes the economy function. “We need to call work what it is -- work -- whether you do it at home or whether you do it out in the labor force, and then give men and women options to choose what they want to do,” Melinda Gates writes in her annual letter addressing priorities of the Gates Foundation, published Tuesday morning.These are the people who spend hours upon hours tending to children and to aging relatives, ferrying them to doctor’s appointments and school, managing schedules and preparing meals. It is overwhelmingly women who do this unpaid work, she says, pointing to some astonishing statistics. Gates calls this “the gender gap no one is talking about.”In developing countries, the costs of the unpaid labor gap are devastating. Women and girls spend an extra five or more hours a day on chores, at the expense of their own education, she writes. The burden of unpaid work is one reason that women are less likely to learn how to read. And without an education or even basic literacy, women and their children are more likely to end up in poverty.The overwhelming responsibilities of unpaid work also keep women out of the paid labor force and hold back economies from growth. This is an issue in developing countries and in places like the U.S., where women’s participation in the labor market has been stalled for years. The effects of the unpaid labor gap are less harsh in our own country, but still worthy of our attention. Thanks to technology, we all do fewer hours of unpaid work than those in developing nations. But women still spend nearly double what men do on chores and child care, working about four hours a day. This burden is a driving factor behind the gender pay gap. In high-paying professions, women who are faced with the dual pressures of work and family responsibilities trade pay for home-work, as Harvard economist Claudia Goldin recently explained in an interview with HuffPost. At the lower end of the economy, women may wind up in poverty in an attempt to care for children and earn a living.One big way to change this inequity is for men to pick up the slack and more equitably share in the burden of unpaid work, Gates writes. “We must recognize that unpaid work is still work,” she writes. “And redistribute more evenly between women and men.”Men increasingly want to do more at home. Millennial fathers are looking for companies that offer them the flexibility they need to more fully participate in their children’s lives. And some progressive companies are paying attention.Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg made a point to take paternity leave, driving home the message that fathers should take time to be at home when they have a new child.And many fathers are now choosing to stay home and look after their children, joining the unpaid labor force.We could all do well to remember that the work of raising kids is extremely important -- even though we so often get the message that paid work is somehow more worthy of acclaim.Public policy also plays a huge role. For example, research has shown that men who take paternity leave wind up doing more child care work down the line.We could also offer more support to those caring for children, including subsidized daycare or even extending the school day so parents can get more done. So much of the coverage of gender equality focuses on inequities at work, but Gates’ letter is a powerful reminder that we need equality at home, too. Until this happens, women will not catch up anywhere. And men will lose out on the very real rewards of caretaking. (Or vice-versa!)“Economists call it opportunity cost: the other things women could be doing if they didn’t spend so much time on mundane tasks,” Gates writes. “It’s obvious that many women would spend more time doing paid work, starting businesses, or otherwise contributing to the economic well-being of societies around the world. The fact that they can’t holds their families and communities back."""

John Kasich said Monday that he was elected to office at a young age with the help of an ""army of supporters"" that included women who ""left their kitchens"" to knock on doors for him.""How did I get elected? Nobody was -- I didn't have anybody for me. We just got an army of people and many women who left their kitchens to go out and go door to door and put yard signs up for me. All the way back, when things were different. Now you call homes, and everybody's working,"" Kasich said at a town hall in Fairfax, Virginia.Kasich was elected to the Ohio state Senate in 1978, before successfully running for Congress in 1982. He was re-elected as a representative eight times, serving until 2001.A woman who attended the town hall, and asked the governor why he signed a bill defunding Planned Parenthood in Ohio over the weekend, suggested his remark about kitchens offended her.""First off, I want to say your comment earlier about the women coming to support you? I'll come and support you, but I won't be coming out of the kitchen,"" she said.""I got you,"" Kasich responded.The governor argued that women would have ample health options in Ohio even though he defunded the health care provider because he objects to abortion.""Are you kidding me? We have robust women's health funding in Ohio,"" he said.“You don't have to be captive to delivering women’s health through a women's health organization that has discredited itself,"" he said of Planned Parenthood.Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for the Kasich campaign, defended the governor's comments about female voters.""John Kasich’s campaigns have always been homegrown affairs. They’ve literally been run out of his friends’ kitchens and many of his early campaign teams were made up of stay-at-home moms who believed deeply in the changes he wanted to bring to them and their families,"" Schrimpf said. ""That’s real grassroots campaigning and he’s proud of that authentic support. To try and twist his comments into anything else is just desperate politics.""Kasich has faced backlash for his remarks about women before. In November, he attempted to explain his experience balancing the budget in Ohio by asking a woman if she had ever dieted. And in September, he got into hot water when he told a story about a note a Latina hotel maid had left in his room.""When I heard John Kasich's latest offensive views on women and our rights, I almost dropped the casserole I was taking out of the oven!"" Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro Choice America, wrote in a statement. ""Women want a president who will support legal abortion, stand with Planned Parenthood, and not confine our accomplishments to those that happen 'in the kitchen.'"" In response to Kasich's comment, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted on Monday, ""It's 2016. A woman's place is...wherever she wants it to be."" CNN's Cassie Spodak later tweeted that Kasich said he agreed with Clinton and would be ""more careful."" On Monday evening, Kasich told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the comment ""wasn't intended to be offensive."" ""The beginning of my campaign for public office, I did town halls, except they were in people's homes. They were at breakfast tables, at evening, when we had coffee and I recruited people. I want to be clear: We had a lot of women that played a major role in my political campaign, political life, and they still do,"" he said. When Blitzer pressed the governor for an apology, saying that women found his comment ""insulting,"" Kasich said: ""I'm more than happy to say I'm sorry if I offended somebody out there, but it wasn't intended to be offensive.""This story has been updated with additional comments.Also on HuffPost:"

As part of its ""Girl Crush"" series, PAPER Magazine brought Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards and ""Girl Meets World"" star Rowan Blanchard together for a discussion on feminism, social media and more.When asked what she thinks Planned Parenthood can provide for people her age, Blanchard, who called Richards one of her ""role models,"" mentioned the health care provider's social media accounts and online presence. Through these, Planned Parenthood provides a space for young people (especially women) to openly discuss and ask questions about their sexual health. As Blanchard pointed out, many young women are shamed for simply mentioning sex and their bodies.""People seriously shame them for it. Girls are getting their first periods, and immediately it's an embarrassing thing that you just want to hide, rather than being a normal thing that you talk about,"" Blanchard said. ""And now that you guys have such a big social media influence, I think that has definitely affected that. Because people have access to the Internet, especially teens.""Richards agreed that social media has had an impact, especially on the way women tell their stories now that ""no one ever would have told in [her] generation.""""Whether it was their own sexual health stories, their own things that have concerned them, the issues they've dealt with as a woman,"" she said. ""It can be a really democratizing force.""The two feminists also touched on subjects like sexual assault and consent and the importance of normalizing such conversations, especially among young people. Blanchard mentioned other empowering members of her generation positively influencing today's young girls by also being vocal about such subjects. When I started talking about them on social media, I noticed that with teenage girls [and insecurity], it comes from a deep place of shame about their bodies, and everything that they're taught from a very young age. I think the new wave of women on social media who are allowing themselves to just be themselves is opening doors for a lot of young girls who wouldn't otherwise have that kind of affirmation to be allowed to be themselves, which is cool.Aside from Blanchard, this ""new wave"" includes young feminists like Amandla Stenberg, Tavi Gevinson and Zendaya who all have embraced the fight for gender equality and have huge followings online (we're talking millions of followers). With each tweet, Tumblr post, Instagram caption and interview, these feminists are proving that age is simply a number and that you're never too young to join the conversation.

Avid cyclist Stephen Lund, from Canada's Victoria, British Columbia, attaches a GPS tracker to himself on bike rides. He then creates incredible artwork by mapping his routes with the help of the app Strava.The biker, who created his first ""GPS Doodle"" in January of 2015, has logged more than 3,000 miles ""drawing"" with his bike, according to Caters News. Lund's doodles include anything from a dinosaur to Darth Vader to Queen Elizabeth II. Lund, who drew 85 doodles in one year alone, explained that he starts by envisioning objects ""like shapes in the clouds,"" on a map of his city, according to his TedxVictoria talk.He then uses Google Maps to create the best routes and types out turn-by-turn directions, Caters News reported. The biker then sets out for his ride while using his Strava app. After the ride, he uploads his GPS data from the app onto the computer, which produces -- what he hopes is -- an incredible work of art on a map, he told CFAX 1070. While the artist has drawn more time-consuming works -- like the ""Mermaid of the Salish Sea,"" which took about 14 hours to create -- he says that doodles don't have to be quite that daunting. One of his drawings, a bunny, took about 41 minutes for him to complete. “What excites me most about GPS doodling is that it takes the intimidation out of creative expression. If you can move, you can doodle,"" Lund said in his TEDxVictoria talk. ""In fact, when I coined the term GPS doodles, I did so because ‘GPS art’ felt a little too lofty and exclusive. Everybody doodles. And anyone can GPS doodle.” The only downside? ""A GPS device doesn't come with an eraser,"" Lund said in his TEDxVictoria talk. ""So I learned early on to ride carefully.""

Before the court got down to business, Chief Justice John Roberts took a few moments to eulogize his departed colleague.""We remember his incisive intellect, his agile wit and his captivating prose,"" Roberts said, reading from a prepared statement. ""But we cannot forget his irrepressible spirit. He was our man for all seasons, and we shall miss him beyond measure.""It was the first time Roberts had spoken publicly about Scalia since the justice died, although he did issue a statement when the news broke.As he began speaking, Roberts pointed to the ceremonial draping on and in front of Scalia's empty seat -- the traditional recognition for a justice who died while in active service.After running through Scalia's biography, which included stints in legal academia and as a government lawyer, Roberts highlighted the ""first and only Supreme Court case"" that Scalia argued.

""What it looks like, is we have somebody just driving around finding people and shooting them dead in their tracks,"" Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas told CNN. The shooting in Kalamazoo is just one of many Obama has addressed during his time in office. Each time, the president has pressed Congress to bolster existing gun legislation -- something lawmakers have repeatedly failed to do.""This is not normal,"" Obama wrote after the Colorado Planned Parenthood shooting last year. ""We can’t let it become normal. If we truly care about this -- if we’re going to offer up our thoughts and prayers again, for God knows how many times, with a truly clean conscience -- then we have to do something about the easy accessibility of weapons of war on our streets to people who have no business wielding them.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sounded like a candidate who, well, hadn't. ""We are gaining momentum,"" Sanders boasted during a rally in Greenville on Saturday. ""This campaign is gaining momentum because we are listening to the American people and we are listening in a way that other campaigns don't.""Most elections contain their fair share of denial, but even by that standard, 2016 has been the ""LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!"" primary, with candidates from both parties cupping their proverbial ears, falling to the proverbial carpet and tucking their proverbial bodies into the fetal position, pretending that everything is hunky-dory. Ted Cruz had his legs cut out from under him when he finished third in South Carolina, with just enough of his evangelical supporters abandoning him for Donald Trump and Marco Rubio to finish a disappointing third -- yet he appeared as confident as ever, saying his campaign ""defied the pundits and produced extraordinary results."" Marco Rubio has finished third, fifth and second in the GOP's first three primaries, respectively -- a record that wouldn't even land him in the NFL playoffs -- and yet he still sounds as triumphant in his election night rallies as someone accepting their party's nomination. ""Tonight here in South Carolina, the message is pretty clear,"" he said Saturday night, without a trace of irony.And when it comes to Donald Trump, most of the Republican campaign's trips along the Kübler-Ross model of grief seems to have stalled on ""denial."" Yet the revolution was alive and well in Greenville on Sunday afternoon. The crowd was bursting with lefty millennial enthusiasm: sleeve tats, pixie cuts and other hipster accoutrements abounded. There were plenty of older fellow travelers, equally intoxicated by Sanders' message of economic fairness and social justice. Chants of ""Feel the Bern!"" and ""BERN-IE, BERN-IE"" punctuated the din of the arena in the hours leading up to Sanders' speech.Listening to the 74-year-old native Brooklynite, it was clear that he and his supporters viewed any talk of lost momentum as utter bupkis. ""This is a campaign that has momentum,"" said the independent democratic-socialist-turned-just-plain-Democrat. ""If you want a candidate who is going to beat Donald Trump, you're looking at him!"" ""Nothing would give me greater pleasure!"" he added. The estimated 5,000 exuberant attendees in the Bon Secours Wellness Arena were digging it. ""Are you ready for a radical idea?"" Sanders asked the arena.""YEAHH!!!!!!!!!""Not exactly a Hillary crowd. Now, a loss by no means portends doom for a presidential candidate, and Sanders supporters still feel confident about his momentum despite Nevada and his South Carolina poll numbers, which have him trailing by 15 percent, according to the HuffPost Pollster average. Supporters point to the upward trends of Sanders' poll numbers in New Hampshire and Nevada and the closing gap between him and Hillary Clinton nationally. ""He's not going to win South Carolina, we know that, but it doesn't change how I believe he'll do on Super Tuesday,"" said Stuart Ruffner, 42, of Greenville. ""He's got some momentum behind him and he's so much closer than anyone thought he would be."" Added Randall Snyder, 49, of Flag Pond, Tennessee, ""He's gaining support as more and more people get to know him. This is only the third state.""""Bernie needs to stay on social media!"" insisted Roberta Grepaly, a retiree living in South Carolina and a self-described ""aging California hippie."" ""That's his best hope!""Even if South Carolina is out of reach for Sanders, a better-than-expected showing would really help his much-ballyhooed momentum. As such, the campaign is making a strong effort to reach out to African Americans, who make up roughly 50 percent of the state's Democratic electorate. Sanders discussed a number of issues of import to that community, decrying mass incarceration, high levels of youth employment and a criminal justice system he called ""broken."" In addition, he was preceded on stage by Ben Jealous, the former head of the NAACP, and actor and progressive activist Danny Glover.""Racism and bigotry is not what this country is supposed to be about,"" said Sanders. Whatever the fallout from Sanders' Nevada loss, his base appears to be keeping the faith with his strategy. ""I think Bernie is doing everything he can,"" said Whitney Frye, a younger attendee. Added Milton Menjivar, 21, of eastern Tennessee, ""Bernie is calculating it just right."""

They won't get those resources in public bathrooms and behind dumpsters in alleys.""Myrick argued that supervised injection facilities have the ability to ""save lives, reduce illnesses and help people kick heroin."" Canada and Europe have brought down their numbers of fatal overdoses using such facilities.""Nothing else has worked,"" Myrick said. ""We can't continue to try the policies that have so badly failed to keep our friends and family alive and healthy.""The Associated Press reported Monday on Myrick’s proposal, which he began crafting a year and a half ago after convening Ithaca's Municipal Drug Policy Committee. In New York, heroin overdoses jumped from 215 in 2008 to 478 in 2012, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heroin use among 18- to 25-year-olds went from 3.5 percent between 2002 and 2004 to 7.3 percent between 2011 and 2013. That’s a 100 percent increase.The complete report, which Myrick will release on Wednesday, incorporates recommendations from the Ithaca Police Department, the local syringe exchange and the Greater Ithaca Activities Center, as well as more than 350 community members, officials and stakeholders. After working in what she described as “close proximity to the ‘war on drugs’” for 25 years, Tompkins County District Attorney Gwen Wilkinson, who helped craft the Ithaca drug report, said that government needs ""a new perspective on public safety.”“Massive amounts of government resources have been expended and millions of people have been incarcerated, with outrageous racial disparities,” Wilkinson said in a statement. “Despite this, drugs are still pouring into our community.”In addition to the supervised injection facilities, Myrick’s drug plan calls for heroin-assisted treatment, which allows careful regulation and controlled prescriptions of heroin for people who have unsuccessfully tried other treatments. The plan also proposes the creation of a 24-hour crisis center, an Office of Drug Policy to centralize the city’s efforts in this area and a youth apprenticeship program to keep kids away from drug use. Taking a cue from Seattle, Myrick’s plan would implement a program known as Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion, giving cops the ability to direct heroin users to counseling, housing or other services instead of sending them to jail. Myrick’s plan has the backing of harm reduction advocates. In fact, about six months ago, community organizers in New York City launched a coalition to push for safe injection sites. (""Everywhere But Safe,"" a documentary released last summer and co-directed by Matt Curtis and Taeko Frost, illustrates the need for such facilities in the state.)Curtis -- who is also one of the founders of the NYC coalition and policy director for VOCAL-NY, a grassroots organization working to end the war on drugs -- called Myrick “brave” for coming forward with such a progressive plan. He said public health officials haven’t rejected such sites in New York City. ""There's an openness to talking about it,” he said. But Curtis noted that activists are still waiting on a public show of support from the mayor and the governor.""Having [New York City Mayor Bill] de Blasio or [New York Gov. Andrew] Cuomo would be really game-changing,"" he said. ""We're clearly not there yet.""Along with Myrick, public health officials and lawmakers from across the U.S. are looking at similar solutions to the opioid epidemic. Seattle’s mayor has expressed an interest in setting up safe injection sites. In early February, Dan Morhaim, a physician who also serves in Maryland's House of Delegates, introduced a bill with similar harm reduction measures. The bill included a version of heroin-assisted treatment.A Boston nonprofit announced plans in November to set up a “safe space” where heroin users would be under medical supervision while they were high. “It’s not a place where people would be injecting,” the nonprofit’s chief medical officer told WBUR, a Boston radio station. “[It would be] a place where people would come if they’re high and they need a safe place to be that’s not a street corner or not a bathroom by themselves, where they’re at high risk of dying if they do overdose.”Robert Childs, executive director of the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition, said safe injection sites are known to reduce the risk of HIV transmission and lead to fewer drug overdoses.There’s also another benefit: They offer a critical opportunity for people battling addiction to be linked to social services and drug treatment. ""It's a good place where you could potentially engage somebody on their mental health, but not in a threatening manner,” Childs said.Multiple studies evaluating the first North American supervised injection facility, in Vancouver, Canada, found that such facilities were linked to a decrease in public disorder, reduced syringe sharing, a rise in safer injecting practices and increased use of addiction treatments.Also on HuffPost:"

The service was dreamed up by members of The Kitchen, an alternative, non-denominational Jewish community in San Francisco and includes items that are curated by a variety of experts -- from San Francisco tastemakers to Facebook's former director of market development, Randi Zuckerberg, who is a member of the Hello Mazel team. The team launched a Kickstarter campaign earlier this month and doubled its initial goal of $18,000 in just one day. It's now the most funded Jewish project in Kickstarter's history. The $45 boxes will ship nationwide in the U.S. and to Canada.Founded in 2011, The Kitchen aspires to be inclusive of seekers at all levels of Jewish knowledge who are looking for ways to engage with their Jewish identity. Yoav Schlesinger, The Kitchen's executive director, told The Huffington Post that the idea for Hello Mazel came from an understanding that people engage with Judaism in different ways. ""The experience of communal prayer or being in a community Shabbat dinner, the hooks that most Jewish communities use, are not necessarily the appropriate entry points or avenues for everyone,"" Schlesinger told The Huffington Post.

The mission of Hello Mazel, and The Kitchen community in general, is to ""break down the barriers that have traditionally served to keep people away."" To that end, while Hello Mazel's boxes will have kosher ingredients, the products won't necessarily be certified kosher by a rabbinic authority. ""People who are keeping kosher are already doing something Jewish. They've already opted in,"" Schlesinger said. ""Our primary market is those people who are not doing that everyday, who aren't necessarily thinking about how to live Jewishly at every moment.""""Instead of asking, 'Who is Jewish,' we want to know, 'Who wants to do Jewish?""

Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) is open to considering President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_206_5516_3225%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), one of the most at-risk GOP incumbents this cycle, has broken with his party and said he's open to considering a Supreme Court nominee put forth by President Barack Obama. ""I recognize the right of the president, be it Republican or Democrat, to place before the Senate a nominee for the Supreme Court and I fully expect and look forward to President Barack Obama advancing a nominee for the Senate to consider,"" Kirk writes in a Chicago Sun-Times oped posted Monday afternoon. ""I also recognize my duty as a senator to either vote in support or opposition to that nominee following a fair and thorough hearing along with a complete and transparent release of all requested information,"" he added. ""The Senate’s role in providing advice and consent is as important and significant as the president’s role in proposing a nominee.""Kirk's comments represent a stark departure from those made by Republican Party leadership. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has warned Obama not to even nominate a replacement for the late Antonin Scalia, because the GOP-controlled Senate will not act on it. McConnell, and the vast majority of his party, argue that the next president should get to choose the nominee -- in hopes, of course, that the next president will be a Republican.But cracks have started to emerge. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), another vulnerable incumbent, initially came out in support of McConnell's position. But since then, he has said he'd be willing to vote on an Obama nominee -- although doing so is still not his preference. Sens. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) have also indicated an openness to looking at a candidate this year. Even if Republicans allow Obama's nominee to get a full floor vote, that nominee will face an uphill battle to confirmation: he or she will need the vote of at least 14 Republicans, as well as every single Democrat and the Independents who caucus with them.Kirk warned Obama against choosing a ""partisan or extreme nominee,"" instead hoping for someone who can ""bridge differences.""""As a 23-year veteran of the U.S. Navy Reserve and as a United States senator, I swore an oath to protect and uphold the constitution,"" he added. ""That oath is to our constitution, not to a party or any one individual, but to the ideals that bind our nation.""Kirk is facing a tough re-election race in a state that leans Democratic and several Democrats are vying to replace him, including Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), the frontrunner. Kirk is also facing pressure from conservatives to obstruct a potential nominee from Obama. Influential conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt has threatened Kirk and other vulnerable GOP Republicans, urging them not to waiver in the Supreme Court fight. ""I know for certain that if Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, votes in any way to advance President Barack Obama's nominee to replace Scalia I will actively support his Democratic opponent,"" Hewitt wrote in a recent CNN op-ed. ""I'd rather lose the Senate majority with a fight over first principles than the Supreme Court of the United States without a fight.""UPDATE: 4:35 p.m. -- Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), the final GOP member of the Judiciary Committee to weigh in, said Monday that he will not support a Scalia replacement this year. Also on HuffPost:"

A push by Chinese manufacturers to expand overseas amid slowing growth in their domestic market may also undercut margins further.In a bid to recapture market share, Samsung launched two new versions of its Galaxy S smartphone and brought in Facebook Inc  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg for a surprise appearance to tout the potential of virtual reality, prompting hundreds of people to rush to the stage to record the moment.LG, which lost money from its mobile business last year as its flagship products struggled, introduced a modular design to its new G5 smartphones that allows users to replace or upgrade functions such as camera and audio independently.It also launched a virtual reality headset and accessories including a drone controller to pair with the G5.Analysts and investors cheered LG's features, which they said were different enough to possibly revive sales, but were lukewarm about Samsung's offerings, saying they only featured incremental upgrades.""I think it's possible for LG's mobile business to recover on its new product launch, since they delivered significant changes with the G5,"" said Seoul-based HDC Asset Management fund manager Park Jung-hoon.""The Galaxy S7, however, doesn't seem to be creating as much buzz,"" Park said.Samsung shares were down 1.3 percent as of 0212 GMT, underperforming a 0.2 percent fall for the broader market <.KS11>, while LG shares were up 3 percent.Revamps could prove key to smartphone makers as 2016 shapes up to be another tough year: researcher TrendForce expects the smartphone market growth to slow to 8.1 percent from 10.3 percent a year earlier.Margin pressures are also expected to intensify for the industry as Chinese manufacturers seek to expand overseas to counter slowing domestic demand.Samsung on Saturday said its mobile payments service, Samsung Pay, will launch in China in March, a month after Apple launched its Apple Pay service in the world's biggest smartphone market.The company fell out of the top five in the world's top smartphone market last year but hopes that its easy-to-use payments service will help it regain sales momentum.""The challenge you have got in the smartphone market is breaking through all that sameness.
