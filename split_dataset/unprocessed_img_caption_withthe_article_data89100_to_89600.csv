Like Bruce Willis, Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey, Jr. and other male actors who've tried their hand at singing (a form often associated with the punctuated speak-song of William Shatner), Duchovny's joined the ranks this week with his debut album, ""Hell or Highwater."" But hold your guffaw, because the two-time Golden Globe winner cannot be easily dismissed. The Princeton and Yale English graduate proved the cynics wrong earlier this year when his first-ever book, novel Holy Cow, became a New York Times bestseller. With an inherent, although not widely known, mastery of language and a deep love for music, Duchovny's poised to do it again--or at least earn a few nods of respect--proving himself to be the unexpected Renaissance man. A ""lifelong rock and roll fan,"" Duchovny says that ""About five years ago, I was just kind of bemoaning the fact: why can't I play guitar,"" he pondered--a thought many can relate to, debating dream projects that don't often materialize. ""I have been wanting to get up and play guitar for a little bit and you know, [I thought] maybe one day I will be able to sing along and play some songs,"" he explained of the spark that led to this project. ""After about a year, or a year and a half [working on his guitar skills], I was like, well these songs that I'm playing are things that I like, they're simple. I'm not saying they are easy... but if I liked the melody, I would just connect them with some chords. I just started doing that and writing was the most natural thing for me--to put lyrics on a melody... Now I'm writing songs.""Known for his starring roles in TV shows like ""The X-Files,"" ""Californication,"" and the forthcoming serial killer drama, ""Aquarius,"" as well as in films, Duchovny shared that as much as his inspiration comes from his own natural curiosity, so does his artistic process. ""I don't know about influences as a musician,"" he said, adding humbly with perspective, ""Because I just can't call myself any kind of musician. I play guitar, but I play it with people who really play guitar. Next to them, I'm not a musician but I can play as I hear the songs come out of me."" Those songs are expressed in a series of 12 tracks with a blend of folk, rock and contemporary singer-songwriter style. While they're unique to Duchovny and mirror his own perceived approach, he actually seems to be influenced by the styles predominant in the '60s, '70s and '80s (Duchovny is now 54), with an ear conditioned by major stars of his generation like a Johnny Cash and Tom Petty. About this, he acknowledged the comparison and added, ""I mean I love Petty. I love Dylan. I love the [Rolling] Stones. I love the Beatles. I don't think I sound like the Beatles or the Stones. I don't know who I end up sounding like, but I can tell you who I love."" An actor who's built a career around generally mild tempered characters with a precision that makes any ""explosion"" of emotion that much more surprising as well as impactful, he admits to a similar energy in real life and parallel in his music pursuits. ""I am more introverted than I would appear to be,"" Duchovny said. ""So, I think that songwriting was a way for me to be more extroverted-introverted... And it was just another way of pushing myself into a new area [and to] express something."" While there are certainly similarities between playing a character, creating a novel built on a fictional story and poetry told through song, Duchovny added that ""book writing is actually more natural than acting because I grew up identifying myself as a writer more than anything else. I never acted or thought of acting. Period."" He says that focus shifted in his late 20s, but believes, ""any kind of personal expression, any kind of creativity from me in my life would have started with words... not the acting and not the [actual] music, but the words of the music, the words of whatever prose I'm going to write. It just feels like that is my natural mode.""Artistry and intention aside though, Duchovny is aware that given the general perception of him as an actor that he's opening himself up to snark, and dismissive criticism. ""I guess in a way that is inevitable but it is like, if people's ears don't give a shit about what somebody does for a living, they're just listening to the songs,"" he said. ""All I ask is that you listen to it. But you know, there is going to be snarky comments. That's just part of the game I guess."" However, ""I'm not saying that doesn't hurt or it's not frustrating,"" he added, yet flipped the coin: ""On the other hand, I get to use [my persona] in another field to get attention for this [project]. If I was just some 54 year old dude who loved some songs and had an album, I wouldn't be able to perform on [NBC's] TODAY show. So I can't complain.""""I know [fans] know me from another incarnation, so I can't turn around and go 'hey, take me seriously'. All I ask is read the book, listen to the album, and then try to form an opinion.""Steve Schonberg is the editor-in-chief of www.CenterOnTheAisle.com."
3,HEALTHY LIVING,Finding My Treatment for Pancreatic Cancer,"Anne F. Glauber, ContributorManaging Partner of Finn Partners, Co-founder of NO MORE, (nom...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/finding-my-treatment-for-_b_7283022.html,,2015-05-15,2015-05-14-1431611195-4368961-Dr.BillIsacoffwithDr.JamesWatson.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-14-1431611195-4368961-Dr.BillIsacoffwithDr.JamesWatson-thumb.jpg,"In the last blog, I wrote about starting treatment with Dr. Isacoff in Los Angeles to find a way to deal with Stage IV pancreatic cancer. Since I live in New York City, Dr. Isacoff introduced me to Dr. Allyson Ocean, who collaborates with him on treatment. Dr. Ocean is an excellent oncologist specializing in gastrointestinal cancers, and she is also involved in research on the use of radiolabeled antibodies and viral therapies for targeted therapy for pancreatic cancer. And Dr. Ocean conveys the perspective that treatment for pancreatic cancer is not rigid, that it has to evolve and respond to reflect an individual patient's needs. In working with Dr. Isacoff and Dr. Ocean, I am being treated by doctors willing to be creative, take risks, and apply the best science as soon as possible. Their approach has made all the difference in how I live today. Dr. Isacoff designed a treatment plan where my medications are given at low doses over a three-week period. This protocol is comprised of several different chemotherapies based on a blood analysis of how my tumor will respond to these therapies. This treatment may not be right for other patients with pancreatic cancer; every experience is individual, but it is working for me. My side effects are very minimal, and I am doing well, experiencing reduction of my disease. In discussing his views on slow dosing, Dr. Isacoff states:Standard chemo for pancreatic cancer is usually given at very high doses, which can prolong the time for patients to recover during which cancers can acquire resistance. By contrast, low doses of continuously administered drugs result in fewer side effects, are easier on the patient, and have been associated with substantial disease reduction.  Here is Dr. Isacoff (on the left, with James Watson, Nobel Prize Winner and discover of the structure of DNA) BARGAINING Dr. Isacoff and Dr. Ocean are using new science to shape my treatment. I know it is a bargaining chip -- so to speak. But I would rather bargain on new science than standard guidelines. First, to help determine the combination of chemotherapies in my treatment, my doctors utilize an innovative protein and blood analysis involving circulating tumor cells to identify the best potential chemotherapy combination for my tumor. Thus my particular combination of chemo therapy is personalized to my tumor's sensitivity to specific medications.   Second, Dr. Isacoff and Dr. Ocean have added synthetic Vitamin D to my treatment. Synthetic Vitamin D was added after new findings were announced in September 2014 from the Salk Institute. Led by Dr. Ron Evans, the research showed that ""the synthetic derivative of vitamin D collapsed the barrier of cells shielding pancreatic tumors, making this seemingly impenetrable cancer much more susceptible to therapeutic drugs."" Clinical trials in synthetic Vitamin D are underway at the University of Pennsylvania for those who have had surgery. New clinical trials in Vitamin D are expected to be funded by The Lustgarten Foundation.Third, for future research outcomes, I have donated tumor cells to support a new research mechanism in pancreatic cancer, called an organoid. Dr. David Tuveson is leading the new Pancreatic Cancer Laboratory funded by The Lustgarten Foundation at Cold Spring Harbor. Dr. Tuveson and his colleagues have developed pancreatic cancer organoids that will provide investigators with living three-dimensional models of tumor tissue to find new ways to detect and treat pancreatic cancer. This advancement was reported in the January 2015 issue of the journal Cell.The aim now is to use the living tumor tissue in organoids to test a variety of treatments that may be helpful to patients in the future. My doctors have connected me to some of the best scientists in the country.Despite these gains, I am depressed and angry.DEPRESSION I am depressed and angry that there are not many top oncologists who specialize in pancreatic cancer and who know how to integrate the latest scientific findings. So, patients and families need to find experts who do exist -- at least consult with these doctors -- to understand how best to utilize new science for their treatments and to learn about the best clinical trials for them. Experts in pancreatic cancer are also more likely to recommend genetic testing to shape treatment. Testing can be critical if the BRCA gene mutation is identified, for example. And, as genomic testing becomes more sophisticated, we need to know how testing our tumors, their mutations, and DNA will help connect us to a treatment that will make a difference for us. We must overcome the conventional resignation even from oncology community -- that very little can be done for pancreatic cancer. This resignation permeates us, and often prevents us from fighting for the best treatments possible. It seems to me that people are settling for recommendations from general oncologists that simply are not working. As Dr. Ocean said to me, ""I still receive a surprising number of calls from oncologists asking for advice, who are using one single drug as the first line treatment. This is not even considered effective treatment anymore, especially in people who are strong enough to tolerate combination chemotherapy. Here is a picture of Dr. Ocean. ACCEPTANCE So, I am at acceptance -- acceptance of the fact that patients and families must drive the action. We must ensure that we are getting the most creative, effective treatments, designed personally for us. As Dr. David Tuveson noted, in describing the potential of the organoid, ""Pancreas Cancer is the most lethal because we have the weakest medications available -- and that's for any form of cancer."" Most of us cannot conduct biologic and molecular research, but we must advocate aggressively for the use of promising new science and publicly demand that this science move quickly into medications that work."

6,RELIGION,How Italians Are Carrying Out Pope's Vision To Serve Refugees,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/italy-refugees-pope-francis_n_7285200.html,,2015-05-15,"Migrants wait after disembarking from the Iceland Coast Guard vessel Tyr, at the Messina harbor, Sicily, southern Italy, Wednesday, May 6, 2015. This weekend saw a dramatic increase in rescues as smugglers in Libya took advantage of calm seas and warm weather to send thousands of would-be refugees out into the Mediterranean in overloaded rubber boats and fishing vessels. (AP Photo/Antonio Calanni)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb800ee2100000001c91f65.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CATANIA, Italy (RNS) Sitting outside the central train station here in eastern Sicily, a 16-year-old who would only give his name as “Simon” hunched his knees up to his chest and wrapped himself up into a ball. With little spoken English, the teenager from Eritrea has taken to miming the way he traveled across the Mediterranean.He was one of around 325 migrants crammed into an overcrowded boat that left Libya earlier this month, only to lose power a few hours into the journey.“For six hours we floated on top of the sea,” he said, explaining how he was kept below deck until being rescued by the Italian navy. Having been stored like cargo by people smugglers, Simon had become sick and was swiftly treated by a doctor.He was first taken to the island of Lampedusa, Italy’s southernmost point, which Pope Francis chose in 2013 for his first official trip outside Rome. During the visit, the pontiff tossed a wreath into the sea to commemorate the untold number of migrants who had lost their lives en route to Europe.Nearly two years later, an estimated 750 migrants died last month in a single shipwreck. Simon and his fellow passengers all survived the dangerous crossing, which has become the world’s most dangerous migrant route.So far this year, an estimated 34,000 people are thought to have arrived in Italy by sea; this week alone, rescuers saved hundreds more. A handful find their way to a center set up by Caritas, the international Catholic charity, in the shadow of Catania’s central train station.After arriving in the city three days ago, Simon found his way to the center, along with other Eritreans. The group had met in Sudan, where Simon says he spent four months before embarking on a weeklong journey to Libya.The friends have joined the stream of migrants who pass through the Sicilian city before continuing their journey to northern Europe. Almost all the migrants who visit the Caritas center have avoided being identified by Italian authorities; European Union laws would make them unable to cross borders if they were identified.Despite the help given by the Italian navy and medics, Simon said he ran away from the authorities to avoid being fingerprinted. Finding himself on an Italian register of asylum-seekers would hinder his journey to Germany, via Milan, where his brother awaits.Filippo Cannizzo, spokesman for Caritas, said the Catania center has become a “place of transit” in recent months. First opened in 2007 to offer food and advice to people living in extreme poverty, the center has welcomed an increasing number of migrants from African countries.Most have just arrived and sleep on the streets, taking refuge in the center during the morning and early evening.Although thousands of Syrians have fled their country’s bloody civil war across the Mediterranean, Cannizzo said none seek Caritas’ help. “Probably because they have more economic resources, and they’re well-organized in the region,” he explained.Eritrean migrants such as Simon say they paid $4,000 each for the journey to Europe, and Cannizzo said those from the east African country are the worst off when they arrive in Catania.All those who pass through the center are offered breakfast and dinner by a small army of Caritas volunteers. The words of the pope, who since his Lampedusa visit has repeatedly highlighted the plight of migrants, have further boosted Sicilians’ willingness to help.“There’s certainly been an impact on the volunteers. As a city, Catania has responded with solidarity. Even in a city where there’s no work, there’s a high level of criminality, in addition to the problems of the migrants,” Cannizzo said.The proof is on the table, where pastries donated by 14 local bakeries are piled high. “In this period of crisis, a lot of people have given donations. The entire food network here is from donations,” said Cannizzo, adding that there are also clothes given for migrants and poor Italians.Last month, Francis met Italian President Sergio Mattarella and thanked him for the country’s commitment to welcoming migrants. But Italy is stretched nearly to the breaking point in dealing with the high number of new arrivals, with immigration centers long since full.Other buildings across Sicily and elsewhere have been used to house migrants, with organizations such as Caritas seeking to offer additional support.Despite the Christian ethos that governs Caritas, Cannizzo is firm in saying there is no Catholic agenda. There is no need for volunteers to be religious, while the cooks are careful to prepare food in accordance with others’ beliefs.“On Sundays we hold Mass; whoever wants to come can, but there’s absolute freedom,” he said. But the pope’s words are not far from Cannizzo’s mind, as he remarks on Francis’ desire to create “a church for the poor.”"
7,GREEN,A Strong Beginning Makes Way for Improved Results: Equality in Climate Finance Mechanisms,"Lorena Aguilar, ContributorGlobal Senior Gender Adviser of the International Union for th...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-strong-beginning-makes-_b_7285372.html,"Climate change is happening now and it's happening globally--it affects everyone everywhere. However, climate change will not affect everyone equally.",2015-05-15,2015-05-14-1431627146-947402-iStock_000003532280Small.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-14-1431627146-947402-iStock_000003532280Small-thumb.jpg,"Climate change is happening now and it's happening globally--it affects everyone everywhere. However, climate change will not affect everyone equally. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states in its 2014 fifth official report, and as countless studies and projects have subsequently affirmed, the impacts of a changing climate will be differential--and gender will be one of the specific factors that determines acute vulnerability and ability to cope. Enabling environments for resilience demand the full participation of women and men alike and the full respect for both women's and men's needs and capacities. Likewise, the financial mechanisms supporting climate change action must be responsive to diverse communities' needs. Historically, climate finance has had limited focus on and benefit for the poorest and most disadvantaged populations within developing countries, and for women in particular. This exacerbates vulnerability and climate injustice, overall reducing the resilience of nations to the impacts of climate change. However, a milestone was achieved this spring when the Green Climate Fund (GCF) became the first multilateral climate fund to recognize women's vital role in the fight to combat climate change--before dispersing funds.The GCF is the first multilateral climate finance mechanism to have a ""gender-sensitive approach"" mandated before operationalization, and as of the March 2015 Board Meeting, it has met those expectations. With the approval of the GCF Gender Policy and Action Plan at the March 2015 Board Meeting, a gender-sensitive approach is now in place before the first round of projects will be approved. This unprecedented approach is now a part of the guiding principles of the GCF governing instrument and support its initiation as a fund that will shift previous expectations for climate finance mechanisms. Research shows that when it comes to solving complex problems or innovating, a diverse group of competent performers almost always outperforms a homogenous group by a significant margin. The more diverse stakeholders are, the more likely it is that they will still succeed in the face of uncertainty and ambiguity because each person categorizes based on his or her background and experience. In the context of climate financing mechanisms, this can mean the difference between a woman as vulnerable and immobilized or an empowered agent of change. Often, due to a wide and persistent web of structural barriers--such as access to land tenure and credit, as well as societal norms, including traditional gendered divisions of labour and limitations for participation in decision-making processes and bodies--women tend to be at a marked disadvantage, particularly in terms of receiving climate financing, yet they are among the most-affected by the worsening effects of climate change. However, smart climate financing can boost the climate response effort while improving women's lives, it can ensure more sustainable, environmental outcomes, and most importantly, it can transform women into change agents in relation to climate change solutions. How will the new gender policy of the GCF translate into improved results for women around the world?Approval of the gender policy and the gender-sensitive approach in the GCF will support the need for gender-balance in the decision-making bodies, but also, and perhaps more importantly, it will drive opportunities for gender to be considered, and responded to, throughout project cycles from planning to implementation, as well as securing methods for monitoring and evaluating the results and learning from these. Women have tremendous knowledge of their local communities and environments, and their invaluable insight and experience can transform national norms. For example, in Thailand, a woman, Wandee Khunchornyakong, is leading her country towards a clean energy future as she runs Solar Power Company Group, the largest solar power generation company in Thailand. Recently, Solar Power Company Group unlocked private financing to build 36 solar photovoltaic farms, accounting for 250 MW of installed capacity. This translates into potential savings of 200,000 tonnes of CO2-equivilent per year compared to Thailand's fossil fuel driven electricity generation.Today, only 0.01 percent of all worldwide grant dollars support projects that address both climate change and women's rights. Women empowerment and access to climate finance leads to better results in adaptation and mitigation efforts, yet mechanisms, including financing, lack accountability measures to ensure that what decision makers develop has a ripple effect and positively impacts the lives and livelihoods of those that the policies are considering. This lack of accountability translates also into a lack of access to the billions of dollars available to those with the greatest need. It is crucial for climate finance mechanisms to support a rights-based architecture by facilitating women's voices and participation in climate finance negotiation fora.The major public climate finance mechanisms all now have gender policies, although a much bigger effort is needed to achieve an effective and equitable global finance regime that truly integrates gender into the institutions and projects. Knowledge and targeted advocacy on gender entry points in climate change finance has increased recognition of gender in the operations of climate finance mechanisms institutionally and within all phases of project cycles. Some recent achievements in this area include the following: • The Climate Investment Funds' (CIF) Trust Fund Committee repeatedly raised gender as a critical issue and undertook a CIF gender review (conducted by GGO), which led to the hiring of a gender specialist and the development of a CIF Gender Action Plan;  • The Council of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) in October 2014 approved a Gender Equality Action Plan, which was developed in a transparent and participatory manner with all GEF implementing agencies, of which IUCN is now a part of, and with particular guidance on gender from the GGO;  • The governing instrument of the GCF includes five gender references, and as of March 2015, a gender policy and action plan in place; and • The Adaptation Fund's policies and guidelines now reference gender considerations, including in project proposals and review criteria.Tackling climate change demands that policymakers and practitioners renew commitments to sustainable development--at the heart of which is advancing gender equality and women's empowerment, and realizing women's rights as fundamental for sustainable development. Additional support is needed to ensure climate finance is available to, and equitably reaches and benefits, communities on the ground. In this effort, attention also needs to be placed on helping ensure that national climate policies are gender-responsive and programs effectively incorporate equity, access, and benefits to both women and men in their design and implementation. GGO, as a co-coordinator of the Climate Finance Working Group under the Global Gender and Climate Alliance (GGCA), endeavors to ensure that the voices and positions of the women and women's organizations selected for this process are included and contribute to advocacy and provisions of rationale. The time for equitable climate action is now. The world is at an important crossroads as different development and climate change agendas are being formulated leading up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (COP) in December in Paris. The new Sustainable Development Goals include a goal to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, as well as a goal to take urgent action in combatting climate change and its impacts. These objectives include numerous gender and climate change indicators across goals in categories including promoting sustainable economic growth and sustainable use of natural resources--recognizing the importance of mainstreaming gender with these components around the world. We cannot combat climate change and its deleterious effects without including gender entry points in climate change financing and increasing recognition of gender in climate finance operations and projects. We at the GGO hope the initiative of the GCF will encourage other climate finance mechanisms, donors, policies, and programs to be forward thinking and work to incorporate gender--as it is fundamental to ensuring all elements of climate change initiatives work to promote equality and sustainable development for our future. A voice must be given to those who previously have been voiceless, yet impacted most significantly by climate change.To learn more about GGO's work, or to explore further issues related to gender and the environment, please visit the GGO website and follow us on Twitter."

The earth groaned as rock and dirt crashed down the hillsides around us, consuming everything in its path. Across the foothills, puffs of dust rose to the sky, marking the collapse of homes into masses of mud and stone.My colleagues and I were in Bhirkot, a village nestled in the forested hills of Dolakha district in northern Nepal. We were preparing for the following day's distribution of shelter and relief supplies to more than 600 families when a massive tremor struck just before 1 p.m. It was quickly followed by another big tremor, measuring 6.8 in magnitude, and dozens of aftershocks.Villagers immediately crowded together in an open field, trying to find safety. Shouts and cries filled the air. Many were terrified that their houses -- weakened by the earthquakes and aftershocks of the past two weeks -- had fallen and taken the lives of their children and loved ones. We all waited in the field for a couple of hours as we tried fruitlessly to make calls to friends, families, and colleagues. The networks were simply overwhelmed. The ground continued to rumble and shake beneath us. As people received word that their houses had collapsed, they began to make their way back up the hills. Many were at least two hours' walking distance from their homes. My colleagues and I needed to reach the district capital, Charikot, which is roughly an hour's drive on a single lane road that snakes through mountains. We got conflicting advice on what to do. Some said the roads were clear and that we should start making our way there before nightfall. Others said we were caught between two landslides, making road travel impossible. Meanwhile, rain clouds darkened the snow-capped Himalayas in the distance.We decided to drive down from the village and see what we could find ourselves. On our way down to the main road, we came across another village, where home after home was flattened. The sound of a woman wailing grew louder and louder.Sitting in a cornfield, surrounded by neighbors and family, sat a woman, tears streaming down her face as she cried to the sky. Her six-year-old son was killed after being buried under the heavy stones that made up the family's home.We soon confirmed that landslides were indeed blocking the road in both directions, giving us no choice but to walk out and meet a car on the other side. Our driver drove us as far as he safely could and then we set out on foot. Boulders and debris littered the winding road as we passed people carrying whatever belongings they had salvaged, trying to find an open space and somewhere they also might receive help.A mile or so later, we reached the landslide that stopped all road traffic from Charikot to Bhirkot. What seemed like an entire hillside had come crashing down. Rock, dirt, and trees were scattered across the road as we made our best to move quickly for fear another aftershock could strike as we were trying to pass.We reached our car sometime after 5 p.m. and snaked our way through the valleys and hillsides on the way to Charikot. While I was relieved not to have to spend the night in the valley, I was overwhelmed by a familiar feeling: the guilt that I have the means to leave, to retreat to comparative safety, while thousands of others have nowhere to go but to sleep in the open, beside ruined homes.Here in Nepal, the needs left by the earthquake on April 25th were already staggering. Hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes, taking with them all that they owned and worked over the years to build. And some, like the bereaved mother we encountered on the hillside today, lost their loved ones. All of that was worsened with the latest earthquakes. Many more families have been left homeless and more people have been killed. And that makes our mission to reach people with relief supplies even more critical.We are now in the relative safety of our hilltop tents, but all around us, thousands of families are huddled beneath whatever shelter they can find, more afraid than ever of the mountains that refuse to stop moving.

He reminded us how America was once a startup, and how today, ""American communities are like startups. Everyone's trying--some are succeeding, some are failing, but Raleigh-Durham is clearly on the right track.""The entrepreneurship scene in Raleigh-Durham (more commonly referred to as ""the Triangle"" by locals) has been succeeding at a rate faster than maybe any metro area outside of DC, New York, and Boston. Companies in the region raised $700 million in funding for growing enterprises in the last year, and in the last 24 months, a square foot area of 200 yards in downtown Durham generated $1 billion in returns for investors. And the government is a great partner--the best idea I've heard of in a while is the state government's ""Try Before You Buy"" startup software demo initiative.We've seen technology entrepreneurs creating prosperity in other communities. Today, though, we saw something different. Leaders are engaging in daily conversation and critical thought around a topic we don't typically hear discussed in startup hotbeds (including Silicon Valley): how this growth can work for everybody in the community.One of the major questions about entrepreneurship in this country remains: will ""The Rise"" include everyone? Whether it's battles in San Francisco over whether tech company shuttles can stop at public bus stops, or the lack of affordable housing in fast-growing ""high-tech"" districts, or the miniscule numbers of venture-backed companies run by women or under-represented minorities, it's critical that the growth of the country through entrepreneurship includes everyone.In my experience, almost nobody in the startup world talks about inclusion. In the past decade, the only San Francisco Bay Area startup investors I have heard even talk about issue are Mitch Kapor and Freada Kapor Klein, whose work at the Level Playing Field Institute is leading the industry, and Dave McClure and the team at 500Startups, who are often viewed as iconoclasts for their views. These folks' discussions are viewed as ""different"" and ""distinguishing,"" but if our country's growth in entrepreneurship is going to include everyone, they need to be the norm.Entrepreneurship advocates promote job creation, and rightly so: but they don't talk about what kind of jobs they are creating or for whom: startup jobs need to employ more than well-educated engineers to increase social mobility and economic opportunity for the country. Investors say ""the best way to get funded by us is through a warm introduction,"" without recognizing that introductions happen through social networks--and the relationships of people who are well-educated, have capital, and come from fortunate backgrounds are usually other people who are well-educated, have capital, and come from fortunate backgrounds. The growth of social networking through technology has in many ways widened the gap between those who have information and resources, not closed it.This can't be the future. As Steve Case said today, ""If we want to remain the most entrepreneurial nation in the world, we have to level the playing field."" Why does the Triangle engage with the issue of inclusion differently than other cities?Perhaps it's because we who grew up in the South is painfully aware of some dark periods in our history with race--and its relationship to inequality and exclusion. Yet acknowledging any problem is the first step towards a solution. I grew up in Atlanta, where we'll be attending Thursday, and my wife grew up outside the South. One of the most noticeable things to her about moving to the South, she said, is how often and openly people talked about race, compared to other parts of the country where she had lived. Perhaps the stark memory of a painful past better equips the South to engage on an issue that the future of entrepreneurship must get right than other regions.To paraphrase today's line from the Southern writer Robert Penn Warren, we didn't have much to say to folks in the Triangle on the front of inclusion, because this is a community that is amazingly self-aware. Today, we saw a community appreciating and celebrating its growth, but additionally, making sure its growth includes everyone. Chris Gergen, an amazing advocate for entrepreneurship in the region since founding Bull City Forward (one of the first entrepreneur support organizations I know of in a Rise of the Rest city) nearly a decade ago, has encouraged Raleigh-Durham's growth, but spent his time and resources over the past several years supporting other areas of the region through his Forward Cities Initiative.Today, Chris showed the Rise of the Rest tour a glimmer of hope as he took Sheila Herring and Erich Broksas of the Case Foundation to a corner of Durham they call the ""60-60"": a corner of Durham that had 60% unemployment and 60% high school graduation rate. Forward Cities built free housing for entrepreneurs (who don't have the personal cash to ""bootstrap""), a co-working space for enterprises that need, but can't afford an office, and a leg forward.Another impressive initiative we saw today was the American Underground, an office building/development built on top of the old tobacco mills of Durham. A five-story building employs 1200 people in companies such as tech rockstars like Windsor Circle, a company Steve Case invested in last year and is one of the fastest-growing companies in the region. Adam Klein, the entrepreneurial leader of the American Underground, has led the development of this remarkable community, and their next initiative is bringing on Talib Graves-Manns as an entrepreneur-in- residence focusing on under-represented entrepreneurs building companies. As Adam and Talib said on the bus, ""Investors say that lack of inclusivity in entrepreneurship is a pipeline problem. Well, you can't solve the problem if you don't do anything to build a better pipeline.""In Raleigh-Durham, we saw a community that appreciates the growth it has had, but still recognizes it has a long way to go. Building companies in communities with high unemployment, with entrepreneurs who you don't typically see at technology pitchfests, and with workforce practices that grow quality jobs is not something that Silicon Valley has been excellent at--yet. But we saw the start of this in Raleigh-Durham today, and if these leaders are successful, they can show us how entrepreneurs can bring the rest of the country along with them.And for the skeptics who think that this can't be done, Steve Case had these parting words that were fitting for the lofty ambitions of Raleigh-Durham: ""When startups pitch, don't think about why they'll fail: think about why they'll succeed.""Note: This blog was cross-posted from Southern/alpha, which is the premier publication covering startups, entrepreneurship and innovation in the South with a focus on high-growth companies and the founders, engineers, investors, team and culture around them.

14,HEALTHY LIVING,When Was Your Last Stupid Bold Move?,"Pat Wadors, ContributorCHRO @ LinkedIn, Mother, Introvert, Writer, Artist, Adventurer...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/when-was-your-last-stupid_b_7284166.html,,2015-05-15,2015-05-14-1431618781-125040-candlelight_wedding_chapel.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-14-1431618781-125040-candlelight_wedding_chapel-thumb.jpg,"A few weeks ago I was being interviewed about being a woman in an executive leadership role, and the interviewer asked me, ""What were your most defining moments in your career?"" Without hesitating, I stated, ""It was when I took advantage of stupid bold moments!"" Since that conversation, I've been reflecting on those times and can clearly see how each one was a significant catalyst to who I am, what I am doing professionally and even who I married. (Yes, even that was a bold moment!)I love those moments! I define a ""stupid bold moment"" as a time when I don't have all the information, my intuition or emotional energy outweighs the data, and I have a short window of opportunity to decide. However -- they only become bold moments when you allow yourself to be open to them and you seize the opportunity. These opportunities offer incredible stretches. They are uncomfortable times. It is a time of bravery. You see the risk of failure as extraordinarily high. You are daring -- willing to ""show up"" even when you don't know the consequences. But you can also glimpse the incredible ""gifts"" those moments could give you. So they are not really ""stupid"" moments but rather significant ""leaps of faith."" Where I envision the future possibilities and the potential upside to be too great to pass up. I believed in in the future. So why are these bold moments amazing and challenging for women in particular? Because remaining inside our comfort zone is thought to be the #1 way that women unknowingly limit their own chances of being promoted.  In my career I must have interviewed over a thousand candidates. It was not unusual for the male to put his ""name in the hat"" for roles he was not yet qualified for based on the job spec. He believed in his future ""potential"" -- not limited by his past successes. I would say less than 15 percent of the women would do the same. Women tend to evaluate themselves on past performance and current skills -- asking themselves, ""Can I do the whole job today?"" This thought process stops many women from taking that next bold move. Getting outside your comfort zone can be challenging. I know. But if you thought of it as an adventure -- would that make it easier for you? Seize the opportunity -- stretch and grow. Reap the rewards -- some that you seek, others that just show up.So as I reflected post that interview on my own bold moments a few memories just jump to mind. At the age of 28 I had talked a pharmaceutical sales leader at Merck into taking a chance on me (an HR manager at the time) and giving me a job in sales. (BTW -- I had neither pharmaceutical sales experience nor a science background.) My rationale: I wanted to have greater business acumen. I convinced him that they needed me. Now here's that bold moment: He asked, ""How serious are you? Would you be willing to move if I gave you an opportunity?""I said, ""Yes! Of course."" (I didn't believe he literally meant what he said...) He then told me, ""Great! Fly out to Los Angeles tomorrow, report to Ray and we will move your stuff."" Wow! Gulp. ""OK! I'm in!"" Goodbye, boyfriend. Quick call to landlord and my dad. Last call to corporate travel -- booked my ticket and never looked back. Result: I stayed in sales for two years, got promoted once, and even though I ended up moving back into HR -- I never left California. That experience not only gave me that business acumen, it helped accelerate my career and it gave me a foundational confidence that I lean on today. Next bold moment on a personal side. Picture the scene: new to California, new to my job... trying to find an apartment. Met an amazing couple and they introduced me to a great guy (FYI: day 2 in CA). We dated for three months -- had a ton in common. One night at dinner he asked me to marry him. I asked ""When?"" He said ""Tonight!"" Gulp! Then he said I was his best friend, that we would be amazing together. Remembering that my mom said she was lucky to marry her best friend, I said, ""Let's go!"" Four hours later -- married in Vegas (not in a wedding chapel with Elvis, in case you were wondering) and am still happily married after 21 years and three amazing kids. Clearly I didn't have enough information for that decision! That decision/bold moment gave me confidence in life and it also provided me with a partner who appreciates and supports my bold moments. My current bold adventure? Joining LinkedIn, speaking publicly and beginning to blog. I'm an introvert. Sharing my thoughts and personal stories in such a public way is scary. Why do I do this? Because I believe that others can learn from my journey, my mistakes and begin to challenge themselves. Now what about you? What have been your bold moments?"

Tune your DVR's and raise your champagne flutes. Here's an exclusive glimpse of Misty Copeland in the new film: Nearly a decade in the works, American Masters - American Ballet Theatre: A History feels more like an eccentric personal meditation, or a love letter to the art form, than a historical trek through the company's 75 storied years. As the talking heads on the film point out more than once, the history of ABT is essentially the history of ballet in America, and with so much vital chronicling to pack into 83 minutes, you'd think the masterful Ric Burns would just get on with it, in chronological fashion. Instead, this turns out to be an erratic, head-spinning meander - punctuated by pearls of wisdom from dance historian Jennifer Homans, choreographer Alexei Ratmansky, critics Anna Kisselgoff and Clive Barnes, current artistic director Kevin McKenzie, dance legends Alicia Alonso, Freddie Franklin, and Lupe Serrano, and by some ravishing slow-motion cinematography, focused on a handful of current ABT principals and soloists. Ballet to the People is not a fan of MTV-style quick-cuts and epic slow-mo in filming ballet, which often rob a work of context and meaning, reducing it to pretty acrobatics. But the slow-motion sequences captured in this film are breathtaking, revealing the ""deep intimacy"" that, in Homans' words, is the province of great ballet. Burns captures the fierce beauty of Herman Cornejo as Le Spectre de la Rose. The unexpected poignancy of Hee Seo's hand slipping lightly out of Cory Stearns' in Romeo and Juliet. We share Seo's ecstasy when Stearns catches her in mid-flight and supports her lightly under the rib cage as she floats around him, as if carried by a breeze. We are tempted to call 911 when a distressed Gillian Murphy tries to escape the clutches of the evil Marcelo Gomes in Pillar of Fire. We root for Daniil Simkin, as he battles his own invisible demons in Everything Doesn't Happen at Once.  Viewers who find all the back and forth between eras and color commentators dizzying are urged to seek shelter on ABT's 75th anniversary website. The succinct, year-by-year timeline you will find there is perforce dry, but a welcome and essential anchor for the company's rich, sweeping history.   Homans' insights are fascinating. ""Rules are a form of power,"" she reminds us, when explaining how ballet evolved in a highly codified manner in the court of Louis XIV. The story of ballet in the 20th century is really the story of the confrontation between Russia and America... of Lucia Chase struggling with the Russians to make an American company, trying to redefine a Russian tradition in American terms... how boring would it be if it stayed an Imperial art? It couldn't, in America!  - Jennifer Homans in American Masters - American Ballet Theatre: A HistoryBurns slyly slips in a quip from Ratmansky who, without naming Homans, rebuts the controversial charge she makes in her admirable and ambitious history, ""Apollo's Angels,"" that ballet has never recovered from the death of Balanchine, the last great master. Elsewhere, the long-winded exegeses on the magic of dance start to pale, and Ballet to the People got the sense that the director was so enamored with the dancers that he couldn't bring himself to edit their giddy commentary. By our reckoning, he could have substituted 15 more minutes of precious archival footage. That back catalog is ABT's unique edge, which Burns largely failed to exploit: performance, rehearsal and tour footage that no other company in the world can match - not even the Russians and the French, who do not boast a similarly expansive repertory. Ratmansky made a point of identifying ABT as the incubator of new, experimental work from all the great choreographers of the 20th century, from the very start of its existence - experiments that not only expanded style and technique, but also the subject of dance, as choreographers like Antony Tudor, Agnes DeMille and Jerome Robbins made works about real people and their conflicts, not just about mythical creatures, noblemen and goddesses. Clive Barnes points out that ABT is the only major company that has never occupied its own theater, a perennial nomad that has brought its groundbreaking rep not just to major cities worldwide, but also to small towns all across America.This being ABT, partisan fans will no doubt whinge over the lack of footage of Makarova, Fracci, Nagy, Kirkland, Gregory, Bujones, Van Hamel, Ferri, and other legendary dancers. (Baryshnikov gets some airtime, having been artistic director for a decade.) The historical focus of this film is on choreographers rather than on individual dancers. Yet the biggest draw at ABT has always been its star dancers: the Russian defectors of the 20th century, the Russian jetsetters of the 21st century, the Cubans, South Americans, and a formidable brigade of homegrown American talent, including matinée idol Ethan Stiefel, and media sensation Misty Copeland. It is mainly the current crop of rising stars who are seen dancing in this film, but celebrating 75 years with so few clips of the stars of yesteryear feels like an egregious omission. Here's hoping that Burns - who had a hand in the epic series The Civil War with brother Ken, and, more recently, Enquiring Minds: The Untold Story of the Man Behind the National Enquirer, a look at America's obsession with gossip and the cult of celebrity - will film a prequel and give some of the legends their due.   Some choices of footage in this film were disappointing. Rather than show us the incomparable Natalia Makarova dancing, or coaching a soloist in a lead role, Burns captures a trifling moment in the studio with young, awe-struck students. Yes, Makarova is charming and impish in this scene, but it hardly rates inclusion when there is so much else of her available in archives. Other snippets of company class and rehearsal are shapeless, suggesting that whoever edited them didn't know what an ""ah-ha"" moment in the ballet studio looks like.Burns serves up plenty of champagne along with the Prosecco, however. The most sublime moment is probably the magnificent splicing of footage from the 1940's of Nora Kaye and Hugh Laing in Tudor's Pillar of Fire with contemporary footage of Gillian Murphy and Marcelo Gomes in the same roles. Similar wizardry is performed with 1940's footage of Alicia Alonso and Igor Youskevitch in Balanchine's Theme and Variations and Isabella Boylston and Cory Stearns in the same roles, as Jennifer Homans in voice over deconstructs the genius of this work. Compared to most ballet companies, both in America and overseas, ABT has come late to movie night. It has released comparatively few filmed performances on DVD, and only recently established a YouTube channel, so far populated with a handful of bland, assembly-line videos with no stamp of originality. It is playing catch up to those companies who have figured out that film and video are essential to building audiences. So this documentary is critical for ABT. What will its legacy be? Kisselgoff identifies ABT as ""a company for dancers who want to dance a broad, mixed rep and extend their talents. The challenge for dancers is how to excel in all the styles"" - especially true for a large company in which leading roles are parceled out among so many that individual soloists get little time on stage to hone their artistry. Ric Burns might find this an intriguing subject for his next love letter."

(Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb67423200000c101012311.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Do you know what the fastest-growing crime in America is? Identity theft, according to TransUnion, a major national credit bureau. The company reports that about 19 people fall victim to identity theft every minute.Identity theft occurs when someone acquires personal data and information by means of fraud or deception, usually for financial gain. The economic impact of identity theft is staggering. Financial losses attributed to this crime totaled $24.7 billion in 2012, as reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.Seniors are often a prime target for identity thieves. In 2013, adults aged 60 and over accounted for roughly 27% of identity theft complaints, according to the Consumer Sentinel Network (CSN). What can you do to guard yourself against scams like identity theft? Here are ten tips to follow. 1. Forewarned is forearmed.   Before doing any business with an unfamiliar organization, do your research. You can find out whether complaints have been lodged against a particular organization by visiting the Better Business Bureau.  Take the time to learn as much as you can about a particular issue or situation before making an important decision. Also, seek advice from people whom you trust, such as personal and professional sources. 2. Stay connected. Living alone or being socially isolated can leave a person vulnerable to fraud. Social isolation is a known risk factor for elder fraud. Stay in touch or stay involved with family members, friends or neighbors. Let them know about pesky calls, junk mail or spam that may make you feel uncomfortable. 3. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If a telemarketer calls you with an offer and says, ""You've won a free prize, but you must pay for postage and handling to receive it,"" or, ""You can't afford to miss out on this high-profit, no-risk opportunity,"" think very carefully before reaching for your wallet or checkbook. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, telemarketers' scripts are often peppered with these trigger phrases.If you're interested in a particular offering, do your legwork. Find out more about the company and the products and/or services it sells.As a general rule of thumb, follow the caveat emptor principle: ""Let the buyer beware.""  4. Don't be intimidated by high-pressure sales tactics. Scammers may manipulate your emotions by using different ruses, such as convincing you to look no further into the transaction. They may use hardball selling techniques to get you to comply, or won't take ""no"" for an answer.According to the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office), these slam-dunk techniques are core components of fraud and are particularly effective in appealing to people's desire to be agreeable. So, don't fall for questionable sales pitches. 5. When asked, don't tell. If an unknown caller requests personal information over the phone and the call wasn't initiated by you, don't be tempted to give out your information. By volunteering sensitive information over the phone, you may unwittingly open the door to a scam artist who could misuse your personal information. 6. If you don't understand a document, don't sign it. If you're presented with a document, such as a contract or an agreement, and you don't fully understand it, don't sign it. Lawyers.com suggests that you do a word-for-word reading of any contract or agreement. If you're like most lay people (non-lawyers), you'll probably get stumped by a document using legalese. Ask your attorney, or a trusted advisor, to help you make sense of a confusing document. 7. Sign up for the National Do Not Call Registry. Register your home or mobile number on the National Do Not Call Registry to prevent unwanted telemarketing calls. The registration process is free and easy. To sign up, go to https://www.donotcall.gov. 8. Use a shredder to dispose of sensitive documents.Shred unwanted personal documents, such as credit card receipts, bank statements, bills, tax documents and so on. If you don't want to handle the chore of document shredding, or it may take you hours to perform this all-important task, consider using a shredding service.9. Learn about different scams and fraud.In my previous blog post, ""What You Need to Know About Scams and Why Scammers Have You on Their Radar,"" some common scams are described. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) furnishes a comprehensive list of common fraud schemes targeted against seniors. This webpage also provides tips on avoiding scams and fraud.StopFraud.gov is an especially good source of information on financial fraud. This website also provides an online mechanism for reporting suspected fraud. 10. When in doubt, check it out. If you suspect that you've been the victim of a scam, address the situation immediately, according to the National Council on Aging.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) encourages people to do a few things if they think they have been scammed. *File a complaint with the FTC. For outside of the U.S., use econsumer.gov. *Go to ftc.gov/idtheft to learn what you can do to guard yourself against scams.  *Report a suspected fraud to your state Attorney General's office. *Ask one of the three credit bureaus--TransUnion, Experian, or Equifax--to place a fraud alert on your credit report.If you've ever fallen prey to some sort of scam, you've experienced firsthand a possible threat to your financial well-being. Protecting yourself against scams starts with awareness and ends with prevention."

For this reason more than anything, we need to be cautious when assessing its quality, ensuring that we to stick to the realities of this new gadget.First and foremost, the ""watch"" isn't really a watch, and by no means is it a timepiece. It's a gadget. Just like the current iteration of Google Glass, Apple Watch is bound to be hugely popular in the developer community; but for most individuals outside of the tech industry, there is no way that an Apple Watch will be able to replace classical timepieces. Why? Classical Swiss timepieces have a brand. They have a culture. They make you feel a certain way. They have emotional significance. Can a smartwatch really replace that Tag Heuer you bought after graduation, that Omega that your father passed down to you, or that Cartier you hope to pass down to your children? Of course not; the technology behind the gadget will be obsolete after only a few years. But what if we could maintain the culture and sentimental value of a classical timepiece while having all the functionality of a smartwatch? What if we could blend new innovative technology while not radically changing the nature of your classical watch? Well there is a startup doing that: MainTool. Based in the Paris and Philadelphia areas, this international startup has developed a patent-pending strap that allows watchmakers to make any of their watches ""smart."" Indeed, MainTool's straps come in all forms and can measure your heart rate, track your footsteps, record your skin and the ambient temperature, and alert you via discrete vibrations. The best part is that you can also install the MainTool strap onto any watch model you already own; thus, you can have all the features of a smartwatch without compromising on design, brand or culture. After all, with MainTool, you still have a Swiss timepiece on your wrist -- ""not a useless, lifeless screen that doesn't even tell the time if it's out of battery,"" (as the CEO describes the Apple Watch).This trend of combining game-changing technology with fashion really does seem to be where the future of tech lies. Apple is pointing to a future where technology companies can charge $17k for gadgets. Tesla is selling $100k luxury cars. Nest is even making your thermostat ""smart"" to give you more luxury in your house. Silicon Valley seems to be pivoting... the inflection point of the fashion tech industry is here. More and more, it seems like innovative tech companies are trying to find ways of embedding game-changing technology into fashion items without altering their ""coolness"" or prestige. As the CEO of MainTool says, ""let's have the tech you want find a way to work around the watch you love."" Fashion-tech is exploding; let's take advantage.All images taken with permission from MainTool----- About the Author:Rajat Bhageria is the author of What High School Didn't Teach Me: A Recent Graduate's Perspective on How High School is Killing Creativity.

She shares many affirmations focused on and about forgiveness and one my personal favorites is the willingness to forgive.Sometimes we're in a situation where the hurt, anger or upset seems too much to let go of and for whatever reason we aren't ready to forgive. This is when willingness is a great bridge.Willingness to forgive opens the door. We don't have to walk through it yet, but it offers us another possibility.Willingness allows us to expand and gives us the potential to move beyond the hurt- in our own time, when we're ready.Willingness is an opportunity for something new to unfold.Without realizing it, we can get attached to pain. It suddenly becomes familiar and ensnares us. Willingness offers a wedge and provides some space between us and the pain. Sometimes, that's all we need, a little space to help us re-direct and refocus.Willingness is a great first step in learning to let go of anger and upset.Here's the thing. The person with whom I'm upset has no idea. He can be walking around happy and carefree while I'm sitting in a place of misery -- unhappy, angry and seething. Who is really suffering? I want this other person to suffer, but the reality is that I'm the one in pain. Forgiveness sets us free from this jail of negative thoughts and feelings.The next time you find yourself face to face with anger about an injustice you've experienced and you aren't quite ready to let it go, ask yourself. ""Am I willing to forgive?"" See if those five words can help open the door to a shift and enable you to begin the process of releasing yourself from the pain.

After all, what are the chances that lightning will strike a specific place even once? Hard to imagine. But twice? I don't think so.I grew up on Little Tree Lane. I kid you not. Quaint little name for a quiet little street. Big lots, well maintained houses, nice neighbors, groups of kids walking to school together. You'd never guess that my house on Little Tree Lane actually WAS hit by lightening. Twice. I think I was pretty young the first time. I know that the lightning hit a light switch downstairs but that's all I know. I had to have been pretty young not to remember because believe me, when you've been where lightning strikes it makes its impression. We're all different. There are things we worry about and things we do not. When you live in a house that's been hit by lightning, you worry less in a storm. You're completely confident that even in a bad storm, the one place that lightning is NOT going to hit is your house. The second time it happened I remember vividly. The crash is deafening. The earth shakes. Hard. The wall is black. Before you even know what just happened, you know you are terrified. My whole life I looked back at those lightning strikes and thought what incredible bad luck that was. And then, a few years after I got married, it all came full circle. I was already living 1,500 miles away at this point. I was far from home and family and my doctors, and I could not get pregnant. We saw different doctors, attempted surgery that could not successfully open my tubes to the point of viability, and were faced with the fact that the only option that could result in my giving birth was IVF, In-Vitro Fertilization. It was a physically and emotionally arduous process, with the depressing statistical chance of a cycle ending in pregnancy at around 15 percent at that time. Our story is a very long story, each element an entire story in itself. I won't go into the whole thing here and now. It's not the kind of story you glaze over either, but here's the basics: the first attempted cycle was abruptly ended by growths on my ovaries. The first full cycle ended in pregnancy. And miscarriage. The second was a pregnancy with twins. The twin that was ectopic, inside that little bit of tube we had opened, could have killed me but emergency surgery in the middle of the night, when my husband was out of town and while the tornado sirens were sounding as I drove myself to the hospital successfully removed that tube. Miraculously my reproductive endocrinologist was able to do it without jeopardizing the other viable fetus. Seven months later lightning struck. Against great odds we had a son. Here's the thing about having lived in a house struck by lightning twice. You end up with a skewed perspective. You know it can happen. Not long after my older son's birth we decided to try again. It's a harder decision than you'd think. We had an amazing gift, did we really want to jump onto that emotional roller coaster again? If not for those lightning strikes on Little Tree Lane all those years ago, I could very well have been a person who believed you beat the odds but once in a lifetime. But as it happens I was not.   My first attempt ended abruptly when the embryos I had frozen were not viable at transfer time. OK, off all the meds and try a full IVF cycle. This one ended in pregnancy.At about 10 weeks pregnant, while back home visiting family, I woke up cramping and in a pool of blood. My reproductive endocrinologist consulted with my former hometown gynecologist, who jumped in despite not having set eyes on me in years. My sister's friend gave me shots twice a day. I was on bed rest. It was a wait and see situation.The following March lightning struck again. We had two sons.I wanted my kids to know the circumstances that brought them to us. They were always told the basics of how we came to have them and how many people we needed to help us. When the boys were little we used to go into that endocrinologist's office once a year. They went to tell her ""thank you for putting me in Mommy's belly."" I know you think that I'm telling you this story but I'm not. I'm reminding me. It's worth remembering. In my life, lightning HAS struck twice. And it has happened... twice.  Karen is a former Director of Social Service and Retail Buyer, now adjusting to a semi-empty nest.

(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb674241f0000390124c587.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Spoiler alert: If you have not watched the Sunday, May 10 episode of ""Mad Men,"" ""The Milk and Honey Route,"" don't read this post.I have never felt as attached to the characters on a television show as I do to the cast of ""Mad Men."" Even before the series began, when I read what it was about and what Matt Weiner had planned for the show, I knew I would love it. From the very first episode I was caught up in the stories of one damaged character after another. Though the pace of the show was initially too slow, once I got used to it I realized that pacing was part of what captivated me -- the little moments that made up each episode adding up to great, big stories.It's a little painful to admit this, but the character I identify most with is Betty. Though I worked for many years part-time and then had a post-college six-year, full-time career before I had my first child, most of my adulthood was (unlike Joan or Peggy) spent as a stay-at-home mom. In Betty -- especially the first two seasons -- I saw a little bit of myself; those long days when toddlers and preschoolers were the only people I talked to, when ennui set in at 3 p.m., when resentment towards my husband, who left each day to go to work, would sometimes bubble up and I'd run out of the house as soon as he walked in the door, headed straight for Barnes and Noble or drinks with friends.When Betty was diagnosed with lung cancer, it was devastating. All I could think about were her three children, motherless (and maybe fatherless). When Sally read her letter -- before she was supposed to read it, of course -- I heard my own voice talking to my young children if something that awful had happened to me. What will become of them, without their mother?The trick of ""Mad Men"" is that we all watch it and see what's being done so utterly wrong by the characters. We judge them for the choices they make with the wisdom of 45 years of history and change that they could never have predicted. While we may do this while watching many films and, to an extent, TV shows, something about ""Mad Men"" for me hit especially close to home, over and over again. Maybe it's because I've been thinking about these characters for seven years, rather than the two hours it takes to watch a movie.I lived those days as a child. In 1970 I was only 8 years old, but those days are as much a part of me as yesterday, even if I can't remember much about them. I can feel the polyester of my mother's blouse, or the scratch of my father's face, late in the day. I can smell the cigarettes, taste the Frosted Flakes, hear President Nixon on television, even if I had no idea what he was talking about. I recognized the wallpaper, the clothes, the cars, the toys. I lived on Long Island, and my father commuted to New York City every day in a suit, just like Don did when he was married to Betty. My mother may not have been angry like Betty was, but she was always running somewhere, doing something, just to ward off the reality of what was happening in her marriage, in her life. The lives Betty and Don and their children lived were as familiar to me as those of my parents' friends who came to our house and drank and laughed and watched Laugh-In and ""Monday Night Football.""I wanted, so many times while watching ""Mad Men,"" to reach through the television and shake them. Stop all the drinking. Stop all the smoking. Pay attention to your children. Be nice to your wife. Don't be racist or misogynistic or anti-Semitic or snobby. Don't lose all that you have, like so many people do. Hold on to it. Don't run away. Don't jump.As horrible as it is that Betty is dying, it was gratifying to hear her tell Sally, in her letter, that she's a wonderful young woman. A few weeks ago, Don told Sally that she is her parents, whether she likes it or not. I am hopeful that Sally got the best of both of them -- though we may never know.My heart breaks for Betty, for Don, for Sally -- and it also breaks for so many lives that were lived in much the same way by people I knew, people who have vanished from my life, whether by death or by circumstance. Most of all, it reminds me that 45 years from now, this day will be archaic and unreal, and I will be a memory. I hope I'm a good one.Previously published on Midlife Boulevard"

Well, that announcement hardly counts as groundbreaking. It's a warning parents have heard as far back as spare the rod, spoil the child. There are several things wrong here.For one, the study garnering all the attention, ominously titled, ""Origins of Narcissism in Children,"" only shows a weak correlation between praise (technically, a praise-prone attitude, ""overvaluing"") and narcissism. It doesn't prove that praise -- of any kind -- ""creates"" narcissists. There's only one experiment that could prove that: assign preschoolers randomly to three groups; in one, parents compliment kids ad nauseum, in the second, they act naturally, and in the third, they portion out praise according to precise guidelines. Then see which of the groups yields the most narcissists about 13 years later. No one's going to do that study even if they could. What's worse, the ""praise"" study, like most narcissism research, assumes that feeling special is inevitably a bad thing. It's not. Feeling too special drives people to become grandiose and arrogant. That's when people demand attention, manipulate others, show little empathy or compassion. They might even become mentally ill. But never or rarely feeling special leaves people so afraid of compliments or special attention they're unsure of want they want or need, let alone how to ask for it. There is actually a healthy middle. Indeed, the latest credible science shows that a moderate degree of narcissism is necessary to be a productive, caring, and happy human being. In kids and adults, feeling a little special is linked to creativity, assertiveness, and leadership. Moderately narcissistic teens have better relationships and survive the constant assaults on their fragile egos--bad grades, dating rejection, losing the big game -- with their self-esteem and confidence intact. Leaders with moderate narcissism are rated as more effective by their employees than those with too little or too much. And in my own research, it's people at the very low or high end of the narcissism spectrum who struggle with depression, anxiety, and the capacity to love. The worst possible outcome of all the buzz around a story like this is that parents start doling out praise like candy because they're worried it'll harm their kids' health. It's not going to do a thing. It isn't telling our kids they're special that sets them on the wrong path. It's telling them they're special only when they do great things. Parking them on pedestals for being varsity league players and bashing them when they don't get straight A's. Reserving compliments only for the most extraordinary moments in their lives. What damages them is making them afraid to enjoy achievement and feel proud, failing to appreciate their gifts, never supporting them in their grand dreams. What really hurts them the most, in other words, is leaving them in constant doubt that they're special to the people they love -- no matter what they do. Succeed or fail. Laugh or cry. Persevere or quit. The psychological term for such unconditional love is secure attachment: the ability to depend on others, ask for help, express the need for closeness, and trust that our loved ones have our backs. It's not measured at all in this study. And yet, it's the kind of love most narcissists don't know how to give or receive. It all about feeling special to the people we love, and that turns out to be the most important -- and healthy -- way to live our lives, whether we're tiny children or full-grown adults. No one wants to feel like a faint flickering light in the vast universe. We all long to feel like the brightest star to someone, in some way, cherished above all others around us. In the movie, A Little Princess, a girl, separated from her father by war, tells the woman looking after her that every daughter should feel like a princess. ""All girls are! Even if they live in tiny old attics, even if they dress in rags, even if they aren't pretty, or smart, or young, they're still princesses--all of us! Didn't your father ever tell you that? Didn't he?"" That belief kept her going through years of heartache and loss -- until she could see her father again. Go ahead and tell your kids they're special as much as you like. Celebrate their accomplishments and let them see the proud gleam in your eyes, but make sure they know you adore them for who they are, regardless of whether or not they win or succeed. Make sure they feel exceptional because you love them and understand them -- their sadness, fears, worries, and even grandest dreams -- and, instead of trampling on people around them, they're bound to feel special enough to tackle life with empathy, passion and joy.

Typical Athos coastlineEver since, it has been one of the holiest places in Christendom, eventually hosting some 20 spectacular centuries-old Orthodox Christian monasteries, some quite small, others resembling little mediaeval towns, virtually all walled in and built like fortresses to resist the predations of pirates in ages past. On inaccessible peaks single hermits' dwellings cling to the precipitous rock face. In all there are some 3,000 to 3,500 inhabitants, including monks and workers. Athos map with monasteries - Ouranoupolis websiteIronically, given the traditional source of its holiness, what is now a 130-square-mile semi-autonomous monastic republic known as the Athonite State, remains out of bounds to women. This may be because Mary is held to encompass all the femininity that Athos requires - or else the fairer sex might distract the monks back to impure thoughts of a little orgy here and there. It's said that even the sheep and goats tended here are only male, but Yours Truly has no intention of scraping around on all fours trying to scope out if this is true. Hens are apparently allowed because they produce eggs.  Entry permit with religion (Jew) notedTo visit what the Greeks call Agion Oros, or Holy Mountain, after the majestic 6,670-foot Mt. Athos that soars above the southern tip, one needs a permit from the Pilgrims' Office in Ouranoupolis, the nearest town, which grants only 100 entries per day, with only 10 allotted to non-pilgrims, and then only for four days/three nights. The monasteries provide free bed and board once you arrive, provided you've booked first. The only access is by boat, generally down the west coast from Ouranoupolis, a pleasant little fishing village surrounded by hills, with bright yellow lemons glistening in its gardens and a square tower on its shore dating from at least 1344, though repeatedly repaired because of earthquakes. OuranoupolisSailing in early April is magnificently free of in-season hordes, and this year the weather was superb, barely a cloud in the sky even if a bit on the chilly side. The monasteries on their bluffs and cliffs are indeed like mediaeval fortresses, the upper floors extending out from high walls in wooden buttressed bays. Some have lofty cranes working on restoration. Monastery landing siteGroves of pines and cypress surround Dochiarou Monastery, and trees overloaded with iridescent oranges abut its walls. Russian Orthodox Panteleimon is particularly notable with its green onion domes and spires.  Dochiarou Monastery Another viewWhole flocks of huge seagulls follow us, hovering, swooping and performing all sorts of improbable acrobatic feats as passengers throw food. Hey, watch out there, that's too close. Agggh, Hitchcock's The Birds! Panteleimon Monastery The birds!Once landed in Dafni, the main port, you can either follow in the footsteps of the famously intrepid British traveller Patrick Leigh Fermor, who did much of his hiking on shanks pony in 1935, or take a bus to Karyes, the capital, and thence onward by minivan. Naturally I plump for the latter, but in my defence, Leigh Fermor was 60 years younger when he did his caper. My stop for the first night is Stavronikita Monastery on the east coast. Leigh Fermor, arriving on foot - of course - from the south, marvelled at its 'wild, feudal and mediaeval' aspect, 'its massive walls running up in lofty windowless bastions to little windows and jutting balconies,' with the 'rough, machicolated belfry of the chapel' showing above the walls. Stavronikita Monastery from afarIt is indeed beautiful, clothed in light-coloured stone with a square tower on a cliff-top aerie. Originally founded in the early 11th century it was abandoned in the 13th because of constant pirate attacks and re-established in the 1530s. A close-upI do partially follow in the intrepid traveller's footsteps, though. In 1935, he made his way from Stavronikita to the large monastery of Pantokratoros, describing the way as 'rocky and wild... running through a thick undergrowth of broom and briar growing so thick at times that it was difficult to make a way through.'When the path turned downhill 'a fast stream suddenly covered it so that the only way down was to spring nimbly from stone to stone.' Pantokratoros MonasteryEighty years on, Yours Truly sets out on the same path. It's a rocky up-and-downer hundreds of feet above the crags and crashing white foam. But now the path is easily defined despite the thick undergrowth, taking about one hour.  They say you can't get lost, but how dare they underestimate me! I can get lost on the way from my bed to the bathroom.  The trail from Stavronikita to Pantokratoros A rivulet still flows over much of the rocky stepping-stone course, which I imagine could provide some nice miniature white water after heavy rain. But I don't get lost. I'm panting quite a bit, though - not from lechery, unfortunately - and I'm springing anything but nimbly from stone to stone. Another view of the trailThe large Pantokratoros Monastery, founded in 1363, is almost at sea level. Its deep pink Katholicon (main church) is in a courtyard graced with gleaming orange mandarin and yellow lemon trees. Within, it is heavy with gold-haloed icons, kissable and much kissed, and doubtless very communicative with little gifts of saliva. Anybody for a bit of Ebola, guys? A close-up of PantokratorosLarge gold candelabra - literally because there's no electricity - and numerous gold baubles hang from the ceiling, giving a glowing impression of richness as a monk intones away. Inside Pantokratoros' walls (no photos allowed inside churches)Back at Stavronikita, dinner at six in the refectory is a simple but tasty 'mess of pottage' - a vegetable soup thickened with rice - eaten on long wooden tables and benches. There are remnants a 16th century fresco of the Last Supper. Church view from PantokratorosAt the end people disappear through a low wooden door, reappearing soon afterwards. I ask whether it's the toilet. Oh, Lordy, Lordy me! It turns out to be a sacred holy of holies with a richly gilt and silvered icon of the Virgin and Child to whom they are giving thanks.At 7.45 there's a half-hour evening service. It's a spectral experience with black garbed monks - there are some 25 here in total - looming out of the candle-lit gloom, their black cylindrical hats playing off the dim outline of painted and haloed saints on the walls under candled chandeliers. Each chanter holds a candle to sing the verses from a large book. View towards Mt. Athos from StavronikitaAt the end, they line up before a wall of silver relics, including a large cross said to contain a piece of wood from the cross Christ was crucified on, and a silver box holding a bejeweled wooden hand. They dip precipitously to one knee, bow and kiss each relic. More Ebola, anyone? Fresco inside walls of StavronikitaIn a side chapel is Stavronikita's best known relic, a 14th century icon of Saint Nicholas lavishly enriched with silver. It's called Streidas (oyster) because it was discovered on the sea bottom with an oyster stuck to its forehead. When the oyster was removed, the saint's forehead bled, so they say. Here, too, there are ample kissings with communicative saliva. No pictures are allowed. Another frescoThere's a morning service at 3 A.M., too, which I will most definitely miss, though two of the pilgrims in the four-bed room go.

Drug lords, gang violence, swine flu ... the combination has translated into a dramatic falloff in this country's appeal for the would-be American retiree.Meantime, Mexico is home to more than a million American expats. They can't all be misguided.They're not. They understand that Mexico is a big country. Some spots don't belong on a list of top retirement havens because of safety concerns. Beyond those localized regions, though, as American retirees have recognized for more than 50 years, Mexico has a great deal to offer. The weather's great. The culture is more familiar than farther south, in Central and South America. You can drive back and forth between a U.S. base and a part-time home in Mexico. And the cost of living is affordable, especially right now with the U.S. dollar up almost 30 percent in the past 24 months and trading currently at about 15.40 pesos.Mexico is not only a big, but also a diverse country, offering great choices for highlands, colonial city, and coastal living. One particularly appealing Pacific coast option is worth a fresh look right now: Mazatlán.Mazatlán boasts almost 20 miles of beautiful beaches bordering the deep blue Pacific. The historic center, undergoing a renaissance, is increasingly popular among tourists, but, in Mazatlán, the beaches reign. The weather in this part of Mexico is ideal during North American winter, with warm but not smolderingly hot days and cool nights, making Mazatlán a great choice for snowbird retirement or a second home in the sun. Thanks to its position as a tourist destination, the resort infrastructure is developed, with good restaurants, cafes, shopping, and nightlife. You can spend a day on the water fishing, boating, diving, or snorkeling, then dine that evening in an elegant Italian or Spanish restaurant.Mazatlán has always had a lot to offer the would-be retiree, but it's particularly interesting right now thanks to its depressed property market, which has yet to recover from its post-2008 fall. Where, specifically, might you think about reinventing your retirement in this sunny, sandy paradise? Here are five top options for embracing beach life Mazatlán-style...  #1: Zona DoradaThis is the main tourist and hotel sector in Mazatlán, dense with shops, boutiques, cafes, and restaurants. Zona Dorada is both fun and convenient, the most walkable area of the Mazatlán metro area.On the other hand, because it attracts big numbers of tourists, Zona Dorada suffers the annoyances that come with them, including ever-present hawkers selling their wares and tour guides chasing you for your business. These things are to be expected when you're visiting a tourist area, but they can become annoying as a resident.However, if you're interested in part-time retirement on the Pacific, Zona Dorada could make sense despite all its tourists and their trappings. This is the most rentable zone in Mazatlán, attracting both international visitors and wealthy Mexicans. If your objective is a part-year beach escape that you're able to rent when you're not using it yourself, your best options could lie in Zona Dorada. You could buy a very rentable one-bedroom, one-bath apartment for less than $200,000 at the current rate of exchange.  #2: The Marina DistrictThe Marina District is an exclusive area built around a well-designed network of waterways, golf courses, and marinas. It consists of some mature neighborhoods and also some undeveloped areas, along with a handful of restaurants and cafes. The southern part of the Marina District is adjacent to the north end of Zona Dorada and convenient to its restaurants, bars, clubs, and shopping. The northern end is more isolated and an appealing option if you prefer more peace and less traffic. Big picture, the Marina District is the top choice for boaters. If you like being around boats, this would be the place to base yourself. Waterfront property in the Marina District sells for much less than oceanfront property. Even if you don't have a boat, you might be tempted by this part of Mazatlán for that reason alone. You could own a luxury-level three-bedroom, three-bath condo that comes with a private yacht club membership for $300,000 at today's exchange rate.  #3 and #4: Cerritos And Nuevo Mazatlán Beyond the Marina District are more tranquil Cerritos and Nuevo Mazatlán with their high-end resort condo developments offering plenty of on-site amenities. The amenities are important because these are not walkable locations. Living in this part of the city, you might want to own a car; it's about 10 minutes' drive from Cerritos to the thick of the Zona Dorada. Cerritos in particular is for you if you want peace and quiet and, especially, if you like golf; the area boasts a great course. This is also a reasonable location for rentals, with good off-season occupancies.In Cerritos, you could own a large apartment, directly on the beach, for less than $250,000.  #5: Malecón I've saved the best for last. Based in Malecón, you'd have access to mile after mile of relatively uncrowded beaches, including the best Mazatlán has to offer. The beach here extends for almost three miles, all walkable and all relatively uncrowded and noncommercial. In addition, located here, you're just a few minutes from Centro Histórico and the Zona Dorada. The northern end of the Malecón area is within walking distance of the area's largest mall, biggest gym, and supermarkets.Note that, in this case, ""malecón"" is a bit misleading. In Spanish, a malecón is a seawall or a pier. In practice, malecón is often used in Latin America to mean the waterfront road or a seafront promenade. In Mazatlán, it's both these things and also a sector of the city that runs along the beach between Centro and Zona Dorada.Related Articles:  Affordable Off-The-Grid Community On Mexico's Riviera Maya CoastXalapa, Mexico Is A Top Retirement Haven With Bargain Basement Real Estate   Best Coastal Retirement Spots In Ecuador, Nicaragua, And MexicoEarlier on Huff/Post50:"

29,SPORTS,The Time Is Now For Bradley Beal,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-time-is-now-for-bradley-beal_n_7259018.html,,2015-05-14,"ATLANTA, GA - MAY 05: Bradley Beal #3 of the Washington Wizards attempts a three-point basket against Paul Millsap #4 of the Atlanta Hawks during Game Two of the Eastern Conference Semifinals of the 2015 NBA Playoffs at Philips Arena on May 5, 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia. NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and/or using this photograph, user is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement.

But with ailing teammate John Wall -- along with Washington's season -- hanging in the balance, the time to become one is now. Beal, the third overall selection in the 2012 draft, is a splendid blend of scoring prowess and lockdown perimeter defense, which I noted three years ago. Most impressive is his prodigious shooting ability, at just 21 years old. In this is third season as a pro, Beal converted 41 percent from 3-point territory during the regular season, reaffirming his position as one of the most feared snipers in the league after fracturing his wrist in October. But his inconsistent play, and occasional lack of aggression, has been perplexing.Wall reflected on this in February, when he caught up with The Huffington Post. ""When you’re a great jump shooter, you can attack the basket a lot,"" Wall said. ""That’s the thing he should improve on, is getting to the free-throw line more.""Wall has become one of the premier point guards in the game today because of his dynamic open floor talent and drastic improvement in pick-and-roll. Meanwhile, part of the issue for Beal actually stems from the fact that he's such a proficient perimeter jump shooter. Moreover, he tends to settle. In fact, the 6-foot-5 combo man only attempted 2.6 free-throws per game this year, slotting him a measly 18th among qualified shooting guards. That number doesn't need to rise to James Harden territory, but Beal's robust offensive ability would be maximized with a more aggressive approach.We got a taste of that approach in the Wizards' Game 3 win over Atlanta, where Beal produced a game-high 28 points and 8 assists. Then again, in Game 4 with Wall once again sidelined from injury, Beal was sensational, totaling 34 points (a playoff career high) and 7 assists. ""I have to grow up,"" Beal said afterward. ""I can't make any excuses. I have to lead the team as best as I can.""Let us also not forget about Beal's phenomenal individual defense on Hawks sharpshooter Kyle Korver, who this season nearly became the first player ever to shoot 50 percent from the floor and from 3, while also connecting on 90 percent from the free-throw line. Despite playing 37 minutes in Game 3, Korver attempted just five total shots, mostly because of Beal's hounding efforts. For the series, Korver is shooting a measly 27 percent from three while averaging just eight points. As my recent profile on the Hawks' offense demonstrates, this is no small feat by Beal. Korver's regular-season adjusted field-goal percentage, which accounts for the extra point earned on three-point shots, is 67.1 percent. That’s just behind Los Angeles Clippers center DeAndre Jordan, who finished the year with an adjusted field-goal percentage of 71.1. To put things in perspective, league MVP Steph Curry finished the season at 59.4 percent.""I guard him differently every time,"" Beal noted. ""Just give him different looks. After the Game 4 loss, he added: ""I hate when he touches the ball, period. It’s not just me. Even if he passes it, I hate when the ball is in his hands, period.""Beal's ability on both ends of the floor makes him a very special prospect and the perfect running mate with Wall. He can do so many different things on the floor, and he can do them with ease. Whether or not he takes the next step seems inevitable, but when that step occurs will determine the fate of the Wizards.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report."

DLD (Digital - Life - Design) is a global conference network on innovation, digital, science and culture which connects business, creative and social leaders, opinion-formers and investors for crossover conversation and inspiration. (Photo by Nadine Rupp/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb169f824000050005544b5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To say that Freeman Dyson is a highly respected scientist is an understatement. Over his 91 years, he has made seminal discoveries in mathematics and physics;written evocatively (and provocatively) on what it means to be a scientist, the role of science in society, and the culture of science; shared the fruits of his imagination about possible future discoveries and their implications for humanity; and generally offered up one fresh and unexpected view after another on topics from space travel to genetic engineering and beyond.By all accounts, he's a modest and funny man, a loving husband and father, and a continued source of inspiration to his colleagues at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies. However, since 2007, he's been purporting to be the voice of ""moderation"" on the topic of climate change. Casting himself in the role of objective, outside observer, he has declared that climate scientists are caught up in their own hype, in love with their own models, and distracting society from ills far more important than climate change.I wish that he were right. It would be swell if climate change were really not a big deal. But he's not, and it is.Dyson is on tour, promoting his new book Dreams of Earth and Sky (2015). On May 2, 2015, he was interviewed by Scott Simon on NPR's Weekend Edition. If the interview is any indication, Dyson's book tour could sow an awful lot of confusion about the scientific consensus on climate change. Here's what Dyson said:""What I would like to emphasize is that human actions have very large effects on the ecology, which have nothing to do with the climate.""True, but where are you going with this? Human activities -- farming, fishing, timber harvesting, urbanization, industrial waste -- all have dramatic and frequently compounding effects on ""the ecology."" Indeed, the fact that ""the ecology"" is under multiple non-climate stresses makes it all the more vulnerable to a changing climate.Carbon dioxide is what we're producing in big quantities and putting into the atmosphere. This happens to be a very good fertilizer for all kinds of vegetation, good for wildlife, good for agricultural production, so it has many benefits.This is one of the most tired and thoroughly debunked climate change denier arguments -- the equivalent of the creationists' ""But where are the transitional fossils?"" argument. Really, how many times do we have to kill these zombies? For a thorough take-down of this persistent misconception, visit Skeptical Science. Or just think about it for more than three seconds. Dyson's paean to carbon dioxide would be appropriate only if CO were everywhere and always the sole limiting factor on plant growth -- which really could only be the case if all plants were grown in controlled environments like greenhouses. Moreover, it would be appropriate only if drought, extreme temperature events, desertification, sea level rise, and all of the other consequences of climate change will have no negative effects on plant productivity. It isn't, and they won't.""And this is something you have together with the climate effects, which are much less certain, so it's a question of drawing a balance.""The ""climate effects,"" on which there is a vast body of scientific research literature, are a lot more certain than the wishful-thinking-at-best benefits of rising CO to plants. Besides, would increased plant productivity due to rising CO really balance out all the other consequences of climate change? After all, what profit a man if he shall gain a few tomatoes and lose a coastal metropolis?I'm just saying I don't understand it and neither does anybody else. I'm skeptical because I don't think the science is at all clear, and unfortunately a lot of the experts really believe they understand it, and maybe have the wrong answer.Really, Professor Dyson? That's the best you can come up with? That's right up there with the ""I'm not a scientist, but..."" line that has become so popular of late with politicians. Actually, tens of thousands of scientists, from multiple disciplines, in a vast number of studies spanning decades, have combined all their data and come to the conclusion -- disturbing as it is -- that the climate is definitely warming, that CO emissions from human activities are responsible, and that the consequences are likely to be both serious and increasingly difficult to prevent the longer action is delayed.Of course [the weather] concerns me, but of course, we don't know much about the causes of those things. We don't even know for sure whether it is more variable than it used to be.A classic bait and switch. The question isn't whether weather is more variable (although there's growing evidence that climate change is contributing to stronger hurricanes and other severe weather events); the question is whether the planet is warming, the sea level rising, and the pH of the ocean falling. The answer is yes; these are all well-established results of the science. Talking about variations in the weather is just a distraction.""I mean the worst disasters were the Ice Ages, and nobody really understands for sure the causes of ice ages...Actually, scientists have a pretty good handle on what caused the Ice Ages. For a fascinating tour through the history of Ice Age science, I recommend an excellent essay posted on the website of the American Institute of Physics. To make a long story short, not only do scientists know a lot about the causes of Ice Ages, they know that we should be entering one now, but human emissions of CO are overriding the natural cycles.So I'm not saying the climate disasters aren't real, I'm merely saying we don't know how to prevent them.By parity of reasoning, he might have concluded, ""So I'm not saying that earthquakes aren't real, I'm merely saying we don't know how to prevent them."" That isn't really relevant, is it? We prepare for earthquakes whether we can prevent them or not. In fact, because we can't prevent them, we are even more obliged to prepare for them. We can -- and we should -- both take what actions are needed to slow the rate of climate change and prepare for the consequences we can't prevent.Not that it will do any good, but I implore Professor Dyson to take a good hard look at the scientific evidence and think again -- especially because his deserved scientific eminence may lead the public to overindulge at his smorgasbord of misconceptions."

A $30 million fine by the Department of Education for falsifying placement data, numerous on-going state probes, a massive sell-off of schools and an abrupt bankruptcy filing that left some 16,000 students in the lurch. The string of accusations has become so large that a number of student borrowers cried enough, stopped paying their federal student loans and demanded the Department forgive those debts under an infrequently-applied clause tucked in the federal government's higher education legislation.Both sides' actions have sparked strong opinions and the two questions on everyone's minds right now are whether borrowers should have those loans forgiven and what kind of role the Department of Education should be playing in all of this.Unfortunately, what seem like clear-cut questions have turned into anything but.First, we're talking two different groups of borrowers. One is the group of students who were still enrolled when Corinthian filed for bankruptcy. These individuals have a clearly defined path toward getting their loans discharged since Ted Mitchell, the undersecretary of education, has pledged to let them have their loans wiped or keep their credits and find another school where they can finish their degree. By some estimates more than 40 percent of these students were within 6 months of graduating. For the other group, the Debt Collective, which has now bloomed to nearly a thousand former borrowers, their cause is being celebrated under some eyebrow-raising questions. Why should federal student loan borrowers be entitled to relief over those who paid out of pocket? Should recent graduates be eligible, even if they're employed? What about students who dropped out? How far back should borrowers be able to claim relief? If Corinthian students are entitled to forgiveness, shouldn't students at any, or every, college?The ambiguity of who technically should be eligible for relief is compounded by the difficulty of staking a claim. Under normal circumstances the Department's standards for discharging federal student loans are remarkably rigid. In this case, even though the Higher Education Act provides borrowers a path to discharge when a college defrauds and violates state laws, the ""defense to repayment"" option has been used so infrequently that the Department really doesn't have firm guidance on how to apply it on such a scale. Worse still, Corinthian may have been tried and convicted in the court of public opinion but it hasn't necessarily been convicted of violating any state laws. Details like these can seem trivial but depending on how they're addressed we could be talking half a million borrowers and $25 billion in redress here and nobody's really even clear where the money would come from. Which is where we are today. Students want blanket forgiveness in light of what seems to be a mountain of evolving evidence that Corinthian engaged in behavior that specifically sought to shortchange students. The Department, recognizing that not every student who ever graduated from a Corinthian school is unemployed or underwater on their loan payments, wants a solution that provides appropriate relief to the appropriately harmed.It's hard to place odds on who should, or will, prevail here. The Department wants a case-by-case path that takes a long view and clearly accommodates a more general set of circumstances than what the Corinthian situation offers. Amongst other things, there's a rightful worry about how an absence of more general guidance can literally open a floodgate of forgiveness claims.What, for example, would prevent a student collective enrolled in an English program at a private nonprofit college from loading up on debt and filing similar claims when they can't find reasonable paying employment? And what about the student athletes at the University of North Carolina? Will the 3,000+ potentially eligible for class action status also all be able to file a defense to repayment claim if the courts find against the university about all of the fake courses provided to student athletes?Student borrowers clearly don't like this solution for the obvious reason; it'll be very difficult for individuals to prove they were defrauded. Even by Corinthian's unarguably poor performance on gainful employment metrics, in nominal terms enough students have completed degrees and found employment that it'll be hard for someone to simply suggest the school failed to keep its part of the bargain. Then there's the concern that a time-consuming, bureaucratic process whose end result may still require loan repayment will discourage borrowers with rightful claims from even undertaking the process.It's not clear how the current stalemate will end. The law doesn't automatically call for loan discharge as much as it charts a path for it in cases where borrowers can demonstrate they've been wronged. While a case-by-case approach may not be desirable from the Debt Collective's standpoint, the fact that the Department seems to be offering such a path puts borrowers who continue not making payments in an increasingly tough position.Still, the concerns borrowers have with case-by-case discharge are not trivial. The Department probably could and should grant repayment and interest-accumulation freezes on the federal loans of any borrower willing to take the time to submit a claim. It would offer student borrowers the flexibility to pursue what might be a time-consuming effort towards a successful claim while giving the Department the flexibility it needs to accommodate a wider array of future problems than those highlighted by the current mess."

I was a small mass of seriousness--a little librarian--completing my assignments early and happily. But my core longed for more, mentally, materially. My wallet was wide enough to fill the well of my needs--food, school, shoes--but not the valley of my whims and wishes. I craved more clothes, more books, more boxes--dainty little tins in which to cherish my dainty little things. My mother occasionally said, ""You like having things for the sake of having them; you have the joy of possession."" I interpreted her comments as compliments: how sophisticated I was, I thought, to be possessed with the joy of possession.After high school, I attended Dartmouth College, a small, liberal arts university with a campus dotted with trees. Each of its classes was an ingredient you were supposed to select, slice, and stir in the pot of your mind, toward the aim of not merely faring but flourishing. Dartmouth urged that for ""bonding"" purposes, its students hike together in small groups for five days before the start of school. I'd never hiked before--because I'd never wanted to, and I'd grown up in city apartments--but I decided to participate because everybody else did. Two hours into my outdoor excursion, however, I realized that it was, as I termed it then, ""the biggest mistake I've ever made.""My backpack felt like a rock strapped to my back, despite the fact that I'd reluctantly unloaded my makeup and chocolates at the insistence of trip leaders. Worse, there was nothing for me to eat: I ate only meat--shunning fruits and vegetables since childhood--and there was no meat, as it would have spoiled over the course of the trip. I decided to stop eating. An even more pressing issue than food was facilities. There were no toilets; we were supposed to go in the woods like chest-pounding cavemen. Finally, there was the wildlife: I felt sure a bear would attack me as I slept. One night, I thought I heard an animal panting and salivating right beside my ear. ""GIVE ME YOUR FLASHLIGHT!"" I yelled at the snoring, sleeping bag-encased form next to me, rattling him awake. I flashed his light everywhere, but there was no bear; there were only my trip members, awake and annoyed. I resolutely avoided the outdoors after that. The rugged life clearly did not suit me.I graduated from Dartmouth with a major in economics and public policy, and a minor in government. Degree in hand, I joined my classmates in a stampede to Wall Street. Wall Street was the money business, the fast track, a meal ready to eat, without the costly condiment of a graduate degree. I felt pleased and fulfilled when an investment bank offered me employment. Investment banks had just one requirement of their young employees. They required that as the moon revolves around earth, employees revolve around work. As an investment banker, I did not work to live, I lived to work. I did not eat to live, I ate to work--and I ate at work. All of my meals--breakfast, lunch, and dinner--I consumed in my cubicle, gobbling them up rapidly so that I could continue typing, calculating, working: a machine in the form of a woman. But I enjoyed it. I liked feeling important. I liked having a paycheck. I liked wearing a suit. I liked racing my fingers across my keyboard and my eyes across my computer screen. Every morning, I awoke like a golden retriever puppy salivating to start the day, unfazed by my seventy-hour work weeks. Wall Street was where I was meant to be, I felt. Until I was let go. The American economy began hemorrhaging immediately after I joined, starting with the subprime mortgage sector. The pain spread outward, until the entire financial system convulsed in its throes. Investment banks decreed that it was no longer profitable for them to continue to feed the small fry they'd lured into their nets with baits of bonuses. So they cut the nets. They laid off hundreds of thousands of employees. After two years of living in my cubicle, I was forced to leave it. I planned to apply for roles at other financial firms, but after a break. I'd worked nonstop on Wall Street, taking not even one sick day, and I thought a break would recharge my battery and help me recommence with renewed intensity. During my break, I read books. I contemplated life. Since I had plenty of time on my hands, I also decided to volunteer at a farm, imagining that the experience would be an adventure. I contacted a dozen organic and small farms with an enthusiastic offer of free assistance toward the production of their food. I was sure they'd be thrilled and grateful; most of them were cold and uninterested. Only one--an organic dairy farm--accepted my ambiguous offer, and only under one condition: that I volunteer with them not for a week at the most, as I'd hoped, but for two weeks at the least. I reluctantly agreed to the duration. The dairy farm reluctantly agreed to supply accommodation.I'd devoured the Little House on the Prairie books as a girl, and my mental image of organic farms resembled the pastoral, prairie-like setting of the books. I imagined that my farm stay would be both an education and a vacation, and that, shortly after, I would return to the prosperous world of suits, spreadsheets, and skyscrapers. I had no idea what I was getting myself into.Excerpted from Sonia Faruqi's Project Animal Farm: An Accidental Journey into the Secret World of Farming and the Truth About Our Food (July 2015).
