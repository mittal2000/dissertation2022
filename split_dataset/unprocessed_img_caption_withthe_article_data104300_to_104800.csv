Then, the logic goes, Obama will have willing and faithful partners to pass something, anything, in a Congress long mired by partisan gridlock.But can the president ""poison a well,"" to borrow the phrase, that's been poisoned time and time again? According to the GOP, Obama has done so repeatedly, on just about every initiative he has tried to push through Congress. Washington is swimming in poisoned well water, and has been for years.The Democratic opposition research group American Bridge on Thursday compiled a list of the many times Republicans have warned that Obama would ""poison the well"" in Congress.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), on Obama taking credit for a deal on immigration principles reached by a bipartisan group of eight senators in January 2013.""[Obama] may have even set back the cause a bit.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), on the president's 2012 executive order on immigration.""He’s been a political cheerleader on this, and he’s poisoned the well.

According to the National Retail Federation, retail spending over the Thanksgiving weekend fell for the first time in at least seven years. The group estimates that total spending over the holiday weekend fell to $57.4 billion, down 2.7% from a year ago despite significant sales and discounts at most major retailers.

That's down from the 23.5 percent of holiday shoppers who said they would shop on Thanksgiving Day last year.The NRF polled 6,593 people, 61.1 percent of whom said they plan to shop either Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend. Based on the poll, the NRF expects 140.1 million Americans to shop throughout the course of the weekend, which is down slightly from the 140.3 million expected last year.The decline comes as more and more of the nation's biggest retailers prepare to kick off their holiday shopping sales on Thanksgiving Day, instead of the following day, known as Black Friday.Considered the biggest shopping weekend of the year, Black Friday and the days around it have grown into a giant turf war for the nation's brick-and-mortar stores, all struggling to stave off the effects of a sluggish economic recovery and facing fierce competition from online retailers.Kmart plans to kick off its Black Friday sales at 6 a.m. on Thanksgiving Day, and stay open 42 hours straight. Most Walmart stores will be open all day on Thanksgiving as well, with Black Friday deals starting at 6 p.m.Jeff Shelman, a spokesman for Best Buy, recently told The Huffington Post that the electronics retailer began stretching its Black Friday shopping into Thanksgiving Day last year after noticing it was losing shoppers to competitors who opened earlier on Thursday.""The reality is, customers have shown that they want to shop on Thanksgiving evening, and we want to be there to serve those customers,"" Shelman said.Deisha Barnett, a spokeswoman for Walmart, said the nation's biggest retailer is ""cautiously optimistic"" about Thanksgiving weekend.""Competition is definitely heavy out there,"" Barnett said. She did not disclose how many shoppers she expects to come out on Thanksgiving this year.Last year, sales on Black Friday actually fell 13.2 percent compared to 2012 because more shoppers were coming out on Thursday. Stores generally count on holiday shopping for a huge portion of their annual sales. In recent years, however, this aggressive push has come under scrutiny from shoppers and workers who accuse large retailers of waging war on Thanksgiving -- a day, like Christmas, when stores have historically remained closed. Many low-wage workers now have to sacrifice the holiday to staff store openings that are generally pretty chaotic, and sometimes even dangerous. That said, retailers maintain that Thanksgiving weekend has become the ""Super Bowl"" of the retail industry, and that employees generally are pretty excited to work. "

A Rolling Stone article by Sabrina Rubin Erdely, published Wednesday, describes a woman, known only as Jackie, who says she attended a Phi Kappa Psi fraternity party in the fall of 2012, when she was a freshman. Jackie was there as a date of one of the brothers, according to the article. The article alleges that Jackie was led to a bedroom at the party where she was sexually assaulted by seven men. According to the article, the assailants yelled at one man who penetrated Jackie with a beer bottle, ""Don't you want to be a brother?""Jackie did not disclose the alleged assault until the following spring, at the end of her freshman year, when she spoke to a university dean in charge of student misconduct, according to Rolling Stone. She declined at the time to press charges, but the dean offered to be available should she change her mind. UVA did not place the fraternity under investigation until September 2014. UVA President Teresa Sullivan said in a campuswide email Wednesday that Erdely's article contained ""many details that were previously not disclosed to University officials."" ""I have asked the Charlottesville Police Department to formally investigate this incident, and the University will cooperate fully with the investigation,"" Sullivan wrote. She added: ""I want to underscore our commitment to marshaling all available resources to assist our students who confront issues related to sexual misconduct. Our dedicated Student Affairs staff devote countless hours to educating and counseling our students on issues regarding their health and safety, and they stand ready to assist whenever students need help.""The university refuses to disclose any statistics about how it punishes sexual assault, but it did not expel any students for that reason between 1999 and 2011, and it's unclear how many expulsions, if any, have taken place since then.UVA is one of 88 higher education institutions currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights over concerns about how they handle sexual violence, federal officials confirmed to The Huffington Post on Thursday. When members of the UVA Board of Visitors, the university's governing body, asked administrators during a September meeting if the school was under any federal investigation regarding sexual assault, Dean of Students Allen Groves said yes, but downplayed it as a ""standard compliance review,"" Rolling Stone reported. That exchange be heard at 35:15 in the video below:Groves also called the investigation a ""normal review"" and a ""routine compliance review,"" and said the OCR had already completed the bulk of its on-campus work. Administrators, he said, were waiting on federal officials to ""close the review.""UVA did not respond to a request for comment Thursday about Groves' remarks.Federal officials, meanwhile, have taken pains to emphasize that a compliance review is more severe than an OCR probe based on a complaint. Compliance reviews are deeper, encompass more concerns and ""are not random audits of schools,"" Education Department officials have said.In a statement Wednesday, Phi Kappa Psi's national office said that while it was taking the allegations ""very seriously,"" it was ""important to note"" that no criminal charges have been filed against any member of the UVA chapter. The organization also said it is conducting its own review of the alleged incident, and that it will cooperate with any investigations undertaken by other agencies.Need help?

This means, that in this very auditorium, almost every single one of you knows someone who has been sexually assaulted."" Marc Rich of interACT stated to a student audience at Stanford University. Sexual assault is real. It's on my campus, it's on your campus, and it's time to take action. When we chose to attend our respective universities, we chose them as the places where we could define our experiences as adults. We chose them, knowing that these were the worlds in which we could learn and forge new relationships, explore our passions, and find out who we truly are. We chose to become a part of our universities' cultures, and ultimately their histories, for all to look back upon and examine. As students, we work hard. We are ambitious, and time is always of the essence. We must remember, however, that we are human beings, not human doings. In our communities -- local, national, international -- we need to look out for each other. We need to say something. We need to do something. We have a responsibility to respect the friends, the classmates, the strangers, and the people who surround us every day. Because, with every judgment or decision we make, for every action we take or choose not to take, an individual's life can change irreversibly. Sexual assault is not just a crime; it is a gross violation of our human rights. As the conversation about sexual violence ignites on the national platform, small-scale, university-focused efforts are the key to impacting sustainable change. It will take transparency, enforcement, public awareness, and community support to combat this longstanding issue. Ultimately, taking action to bring the community together is the biggest, most impactful intervention, and we all have a role to play. We must all step up to take charge of different initiatives in a creative manner at our respective universities. This past Friday, November 14, the ""Stanford, It's On Us: We Will Not Standby"" theater program, one of the many national events in the ""It's On Us"" campaign, sought to empower students through an interactive theater performance about bystander intervention featuring the renowned theatre troupe interACT from California State University Long Beach. Students arrived together in excited and chatty groups of ten or more. Over 250 students signed in prior to the program, and participation during was enthusiastic. Learning how to intervene in sexual assault situations in theory sounds simple -- direct, delegate, distract -- yet in practice, it's not always so clear. interACT demonstrated to students the nuances of these complex situations by allowing them to perform their interventions on stage alongside the trained actors. Prevention education for sexual assault is complicated. Creative, interactive programs such as these have the potential to make a difference. So I encourage you, fellow students, to be aware of your power. Be bold. Try something new. One thing's for sure--silence is not the answer.Tanvi JayaramanFor more information about the It's On Us campaign, please see http://itsonus.org/."

Leticia Van de Putte on Wednesday night announced that she was running for mayor of San Antonio and would not finish her term at the Texas Capitol.Van de Putte, who first announced her candidacy to San Antonio news outlets, told The Texas Tribune that she was moving ahead with her decision to return to the Senate until she began receiving calls from political and community leaders asking her to run for the city’s top office instead.“I was ready for the new challenges and ready to work with our new lieutenant governor and my colleagues just like I always have,” Van de Putte said. “I’m going to terribly miss that, but I’m answering the call and the outcry to come home and to continue my public service in the city of San Antonio.”On Thursday, she is expected to send a letter to Gov. Rick Perry declaring her intent to resign, giving Perry the ability to call a special election. To ensure Democrats don't have one fewer Senate member when the legislative session begins on Jan. 13, Van de Putte intends to only vacate her seat once the special election's winner is sworn in. Republican Lt. Gov.-elect Dan Patrick, who handedly defeated Van de Putte this month, could try to remove the chamber’s requirement that a two-thirds majority agree to bring legislation to the floor. Democrats currently hold 11 seats in the 31-member body. If Van de Putte vacates her seat before it is filled, the Democrats would be unable to block legislation if all members voted on party lines.In the mayoral race, Van de Putte will face state Rep. Mike Villarreal, who announced his candidacy in May after Julián Castro left the office to become the U.S. secretary of housing and urban development.Van de Putte and Villarreal are both longtime members of the Texas Legislature who have been politically intertwined since Van de Putte set her eyes on moving to the Senate after nine years as a state representative. That’s when Villarreal succeeded her in that House seat, though she backed his opponent in the race.Van de Putte’s entry into the mayoral race has been rumored for some time. She was previously mentioned as a possible candidate for the mayor’s office. She quickly sought to quiet those rumors, saying during the summer that she would run for mayor “under no circumstance.”“When asked some time this summer would I consider, I was so focused… on the position of lieutenant governor and winning that race that I said, ‘Absolutely not. It’s not entering in my mind’,” Van de Putte said. “I didn’t even think about it.”After speculation about her future political ambitions resurfaced last week, Villarreal said he was expecting to pick up an opponent in the race.“We knew this wouldn’t be a cakewalk. Running to be mayor of the seventh-largest city in the country is not a coronation, and it shouldn’t be,” Villarreal said, adding that Van de Putte reached out to him earlier this month before publicly acknowledging that she was being mentioned as a potential candidate for mayor.Van de Putte said she hadn’t spoken with him since then, adding that his candidacy was not a factor in her decision.With Villarreal also resigning his seat in the next legislative session, San Antonio will see two special elections to fill both of their posts. State Reps. Trey Martinez Fischer and José Menéndez both expressed interest last week in pursuing Van de Putte’s Senate seat if she were to step down. San Antonio City Councilman Diego Bernal and public relations consultant Melissa Aguillon have both set their sights on Villarreal’s seat.This article originally appeared in The Texas Tribune at http://www.texastribune.org/2014/11/19/van-de-putte-resigning-run-san-antonio-mayor/.Also on HuffPost:"

But not all can or will take those steps, and transgender identity is not dependent upon medical procedures.Yet while many societies have become more accepting of gay, lesbian and bisexual communities, transgender campaigners fear they still have a long way to end discrimination.Hundreds of transgender people are killed every year and many live in constant fear of abuse, assault and alienation.""The lack of understanding of our humanity is actually killing us,"" said Keisling, who began the transition to Mara about 20 years ago, having told friends and family of feeling like a female since childhood.She spoke to the Thomson Reuters Foundation ahead of the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance on Nov. 20, which commemorates those killed in transgender hate crimes.Trans Murder Monitoring (TMM), a project coordinated by non-profit association Transgender Europe, said 226 transgender people were murdered in 28 countries worldwide over the 12 months to September this year.A year before the figure was 238 while there have been at least 1,612 reported murders in 62 countries since 2008.MOST MURDERS IN LATIN AMERICAMost of the murders of transgender people that TMM recorded this year occurred in Latin America: 113 in Brazil, 31 in Mexico, 10 in Venezuela and 9 in Honduras, as well as murders in 10 other Latin American countries.In the United States 10 transgender people were killed, while TMM also recorded murders in Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Uganda, among others.Despite the continued violence, Crystal Ann Gray, director of United States Transgender Advocacy, said recent legal reforms were providing greater protection for the transgender community.New York City officials last month announced they would try to change the law to let transgender people alter the sex on birth certificates without having to prove they had had surgery.In September the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for the first time filed lawsuits against companies in Florida and Michigan for allegedly violating sex discrimination laws by firing transgender employees based on their gender identity.""In many states, there is still an outdated mindset from times of slavery and civil war, but in time, there will be more court cases and rulings going in favor of transgender people,"" Gray told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.LANDMARK RULINGS WORLDWIDESimilar landmark rulings have taken place in conservative countries where LGBT issues challenge the religious and social status quo.This month a Malaysian court gave transgender Muslims the right to cross-dress, overturning an Islamic law ban.In October, Kenyan activist Audrey Mbugua won a landmark case when the high court ordered the national examination council to change her name and remove ""male"" on her academic certificates, which had proved an obstacle to finding work.While gender rights are improving in many countries, 21 nations in Europe - which saw seven transgender murders last year - require transgender people to undergo sterilization before their gender identity is recognized.Transgender Europe said only 35 European countries legally recognize a transgender person, while 14 provide no legal recognition at all.While attitudes towards transgender people and the laws affecting their rights differ from country to country, Keisling believes the global transgender community is ""educating their friends and families about it what means to be transgender.""Citing the example of Laverne Cox, the American actress and LGBT advocate who plays a transgender person in the TV drama ""Orange is the New Black,"" Keisling said such high-profile figures had helped to highlight the issue of gender identity.Yet Keisling said she did take issue with transgender advocates on panel discussions and interviews on television who described themselves as ""ordinary people like everybody else.""""Ordinary people don't ever have to examine and figure out who they are, then go out knowing they could lose everything, including their life. Transgender people are not ordinary in any sense of the word, we're much tougher than that,"" she said. "

After the two worked together as members of the Compass Players, a predecessor to Second City, they formed the improvisational comedy duo of Nichols and May in 1958, launching both of their careers.Their skits were incredibly memorable and influential, earning the duo a Grammy award, their own show on Broadway and other accolades. Perhaps their best known bit is the “Mother and Son” skit, in which May plays the relentlessly nagging mother of an aerospace engineer.There is also the classic “$65 funeral” skit, as performed here on Jack Paar’s show.And, of course, their water cooler routine.Nichols died suddenly on Wednesday at the age of 83."

Since the Aug. 9 shooting death of the black 18-year-old by white police officer Darren Wilson, protesters have invested their time decrying the killing as an illustration of racial inequities in the nation's policing. Now, thousands from New York to California and points overseas are investing their money _ in staggering amounts, as contributions to Brown's family and Wilson. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ddc2210000d601c9679d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the grand jury's decision on whether nor not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson loomed, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon told a TV reporter ""he's preparing for peace and war.""What the governor did, in the tense uncertainty preceding the decision, was pre-declare a state of emergency and activate the Missouri National Guard to help contain the possibility of violent, anti-police protests. He also appointed 16 people, including several of the protesters, to a newly created ""Ferguson Commission"" to recommend solutions to the racial problems plaguing that community, which the killing of Michael Brown last August made unavoidably apparent.Meanwhile, gun sales at local shops are through the roof and the local Klan is stirring, distributing fliers warning protesters that they've awakened a sleeping giant. America, America...Before we proceed further, let's stir in a little Einstein: ""We cannot solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them.""That level of thinking -- the political, governmental and media consensus of who we are -- is blind and deaf to history and locked into us-vs.-them thinking. Security, whether domestic or international, is a game played against presumed and, often enough, imagined enemies. Thus, prior to the governor's decision to call out the Guard, the FBI had issued an intelligence bulletin warning local officials that ""the announcement of the grand jury's decision ... will likely be exploited by some individuals to justify threats and attacks against law enforcement and critical infrastructure,"" according to the Washington Post.If nothing else, this sort of consciousness remains utterly unaware of its own contribution to the trouble. As law enforcement ups its level of militarized authoritarianism, it agitates the elements predisposed to regard it as the enemy and seek its humiliation and defeat. This is a small segment of the protesters, but no matter. Preparing for war requires, first of all, an oversimplification of the social context in which the preparers operate. Once this is accomplished, the warnings become self-fulfilling prophecies.In other words, what matters is that there's an ""enemy"" out there. The preparation essentially creates the enemy, especially when the power imbalance is enormous, e.g.: federal, state and local government, plus maybe half the general population, vs. distraught, impoverished community residents.What doesn't matter is that the protesters want profound, nonviolent change, not an excuse to trash local convenience stores. For instance, the Don't Shoot Coalition, which formed in the wake of Michael Brown's shooting and has coordinated protest efforts since then, recently issued 19 ""rules of engagement"" in anticipation of the grand jury verdict. Rule no. 1: ""The first priority shall be preservation of human life.""Other rules include: ""Every attempt should be made to communicate with protesters to reach 'common sense' agreements based on these protocols, both ahead of time and at the scene of protests.""And: ""Police rank and file will be instructed to provide every latitude to allow for free assembly and expression, treating protesters as citizens and not 'enemy combatants.'""At the very least, what we do not need, in the wake of the terrible wrong of an 18-year-old's killing, is a dismissive oversimplification of the community's reaction to it. On the other side of the issue, we need infinitely more than an indictment and, ultimately, conviction and punishment of the police officer who did it. That is to say, what matters here is not the fixing of personal blame (or lack thereof), but the acknowledgment of systemic and historic wrong of monumental proportions and -- at long, long last -- a momentum of social healing that doesn't end prematurely.The United States of America is a nation founded on slavery and the conquest and slaughter of the indigenous peoples in its way. It's also a democracy, sort of -- originally for white, male property owners -- which, over two-plus centuries, has expanded its recognition of who qualifies as a human being and who, thus, can be a full participant in the political process. The country's sense of exceptionalism exceeds, by a wide margin, the good it has brought into the world. Oh well. That's no excuse to quit trying. The possibility of who we can become -- a healed, connected people, an invaluable force for global salvation -- is worth our endless effort to realize. And maybe the Ferguson Commission has more than a perfunctory contribution to make to such an achievement.What I know is that we cannot define our social brokenness in terms of good guys and bad guys, which is always so tempting. Alexis Madrigal, writing last August in The Atlantic about UCLA's Center of Policing Equity, which has investigated police behavior and racial disparity in dozens of police departments in the U.S., made an interesting observation to that end: ""When staffers from the Center of Policing Equity go into a police department, they talk with community advocates, police officers, and the people of the city--all of whom provide important information about law enforcement behaviors. What they find is communities who have for generations felt like they're not being policed but occupied. And yet, at the same time, they find the 'vast majority' of police officers and executives trying to do the right thing.""The ""level of thinking"" that has caused immeasurable harm within and beyond our national borders -- that killed Michael Brown -- begins with a conviction that the enemy is out there, waiting to get us. If we had the courage to look beyond this fear, what we would see, perhaps, is not an enemy but someone almost indistinguishable from ourselves.Robert Koehler is an award-winning, Chicago-based journalist and nationally syndicated writer.

Hundreds of LGBT activists particpated in the rally to demand equal social and human rights for their community and stop social discrimination.

Tragically, we can cite numerous examples: the 2012 assassination of LGBT activist Erick Alexander Martinez Avila in Honduras; the brutal 2013 murder of Eric Lembembe, an activist and openly gay man in Cameroon; and just weeks ago, the sickening murder of Jennifer Laude, a trans woman in the Philippines. In addition, there are the countless nameless cases -- the depressing statistics in numerous reports by local and international human rights groups, as well as the United Nations. Commonly, those responsible for the violence are rarely brought to justice. Prosecutions occur only (when they do) after long and sustained pressure by LGBT activists who are putting their own lives and liberty at risk in this cause.Yesterday, the United Nations sought to remedy this situation. The U.N. General Assembly's main committee dealing with human rights adopted an updated version of a biannual resolution to demand justice for all killings based on discriminatory grounds, including murders motivated by a person's real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. Only one country voted against the resolution--the Pacific island of Kiribati, although its no vote was later sought changed to ""abstain."" The 2012 version of the resolution had had 35 cosponsoring countries--this year, it had almost twice as many, at 63.The vote reflects an evolution in thinking that has become a broad consensus among the world's nations: No one should be killed because of who they are, and murders and extrajudicial killings should be promptly and independently investigated.This view alone, though, misses an important nuance of the process around the resolution's adoption. During the negotiations over the resolution, a group of countries led by Egypt and Saudi Arabia proposed to eliminate language referring to the groups of people who, research shows, are most at risk of being killed. The text these countries wanted to delete made reference to those subject to racially motivated violence; persons belonging to national or ethnic; religious and linguistic minorities or those targeted because of their sexual orientation or gender identity; persons affected by terrorism or hostage-taking or those living under foreign occupation; refugees; internally displaced persons; migrants; street children; members of indigenous communities; human rights defenders; lawyers; journalists; demonstrators; and those targeted for reasons related to ""honor.""On the surface, it might seem reasonable to eliminate specificity in a resolution dealing with extrajudicial killings writ large. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and others, argued that getting rid of the specific groups in the text would open it up for a broader interpretation. Experience shows otherwise. At IGLHRC we know full well that unless people targeted for violence because of real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity are explicitly included in protection efforts, they will be left out. This is for example clear in a new publication by IGLHRC and its partners, MADRE and the Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq. The publication, When Coming Out is a Death Sentence, exposes grave human rights violations and brutal violence against LGBT Iraqis, where killings based on sexual orientation and gender identity go unpunished. Last June, for example, two adolescent boys thought to be gay were killed and beheaded in Baghdad, their heads tossed in the garbage. No one has been prosecuted.Justice is often equally elusive for the other categories mentioned in the resolution adopted yesterday at the U.N. Therefore, last week, 30 human rights organizations joined together to protest elimination of the specific language, sending a direct plea to all U.N. member states to protect the right to life for all through voting against the proposal from Egypt and others.Fortunately, the plea was heard, and the proposal to eliminate targeted protections was rejected by an 82-53 vote.Importantly, the real target of the proposal was not the list as such, but rather just one subgroup within it: individuals killed because of real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. This became very apparent in the debate preceding the vote on the resolution and the proposed change, in which a small handful of countries desperately attempted justifying why they would eliminate protections for human rights defenders and those under foreign occupation just to avoid extending those same protections for LGBT populations. Let us be clear. What Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the 51 other countries who voted to exclude vulnerable groups from the resolution were saying, is that some people don't deserve justice. Those people include Erick Martinez, Eric Lembembe, Jennifer Laude, and countless other LGBT persons and activists killed because of who they are. The U.N. resolution sends a signal across the world: no matter who we are, who we love, or where we live, we deserve justice."

Secret recordings made by former New York Fed supervisor Carmen Segarra also portrayed the bank as cozy with major institutions like Goldman Sachs.In testimony prepared for the Senate hearing but released on Thursday afternoon, Dudley said ""it is undeniable that banking supervisors could have done better in their prudential oversight of the financial system"" in advance of the financial crisis.But changes made since then, including increased capital requirements and improved supervision, have made the system safer, he said.Lawmakers in Congress have proposed legislation to tighten their oversight of the central bank, including a bill to make the New York Fed chief a presidential appointment requiring Senate confirmation.

Mellon Auditorium on November 19, 2014 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Teresa Kroeger/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c153260000350082c64c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- New Republic publisher Chris Hughes began his speech Wednesday night at the very beginning. In front of Washington’s political and media elite, he recalled the first line of the Nov. 7, 1914, inaugural issue: “The New Republic is frankly an experiment,” it read. While acknowledging the magazine's past, Hughes didn't dwell on it. Hughes, who made his fortune as a Facebook co-founder and purchased the storied politics and culture magazine in 2012 at age 28, seized on that line to suggest the spirit of experimentation is “the driving force behind the survival of this institution.” He reiterated a commitment to The New Republic’s journalistic traditions before a black-tie gathering of attendees, including many who had worked at, written for, or sparred with the argumentative magazine's editors. But as its current steward, Hughes said, it was also his duty to “shake things up, to experiment, and to build a better, stronger institution as a result.”“To preserve and strengthen institutions like this one, you have to change them,” Hughes said. “You have to take risks and do things differently. You have to experiment.”How much Hughes intends to experiment with The New Republic had been a topic of great anxiety among staff leading up to the centennial gala, according to sources who declined to speak publicly about the magazine’s inner workings. Some staffers are concerned that The New Republic's tradition of narrative journalism and criticism -- the type of work heralded Wednesday night -- will be devalued in the pursuit of increased Web traffic. Some questioned whether Hughes and Guy Vidra, who recently came from Yahoo News to become the magazine’s first CEO, envision the magazine as more of a tech startup than the political and cultural publication it has always been.The speeches seemed to underscore different viewpoints within the magazine. Hughes and Vidra spoke more of innovation and digital growth. Editor Frank Foer honored predecessors who helped shape the magazine's legacy and highlighted its idiosyncrasies. Literary editor Leon Wieseltier, who has run the culture pages for decades, spoke of the magazine's core principles and warned against worshiping the future, which he said, “will soon enough be the present.”About 12 hours before gala attendees began gathering for cocktails, Capital New York reported on rumors that Foer may soon leave the magazine. Later, Politico reported on the internal tensions over the magazine's direction. Hughes declined an interview Wednesday night, telling HuffPost that his speech was his only on-the-record remarks for the evening. But Hughes did speak to The New York Times for an interview pegged to the centennial gala. “Today, I don’t call it a magazine at all,” Hughes told the Times in an article published in Wednesday's paper. “I think we’re a digital media company.”Hughes’ remarks are a departure from two years ago. Back then, he spoke often of putting resources into the perennially cash-strapped magazine so it could compete with The New Yorker, The Atlantic and The New York Times Magazine. During his first staff meeting in 2012, Hughes pledged to uphold the magazine's tradition of longform journalism. In Wednesday’s Times interview, Hughes and Vidra said they envision boosting the magazine's current audience of around 5 million unique visitors to ""tens of millions,"" while broadening to topics that ""travel well"" online.Hughes touted the magazine’s digital growth during his speech. After a 40-minute stem-winder from former President Bill Clinton, Vidra similarly spoke of the need for “innovation and experimentation.” The speeches by Foer and Wieseltier focused less on online metrics than on The New Republic's characters and uniqueness. Foer described arriving at the magazine to find a photograph of Michael Straight hung on the bathroom wall, an “act of intentional hostility” against an editor in the 1940s and '50s later found to be a Soviet spy. “To work at The New Republic is to have the old photos on the wall shout at you and to have the right -- the obligation even -- to shout back,” Foer said. “To work at The New Republic is to be instantly inserted into a century-long conversation about ideas, to be placed in an argument without end.”Foer asked past New Republic editors in attendance –- Michael Kinsley, Hendrik Hertzberg, Andrew Sullivan, and Charles Lane –- to stand up for applause. He spoke of how his New Republic colleagues “burn with curiosity,” “breathe ideas” and “write with their bones.” Foer concluded by raising a glass to the magazine's staff, past and present. In the next speech, Wieseltier described The New Republic as a “precious realm of freedom and intelligence and conviction” and “a sanctuary of a high intellectual and journalistic aspiration.” The magazine’s writers, he said, are ""obstreperous patriots and creatures of first principles who regard critical thought as a sacred task."" He acknowledged New Republic staffers being disruptors and innovators, but also “stewards and guardians and trustees.”And Wieseltier closed with a stirring reading of Walt Whitman’s ""Passage to India.""""Ever sound, the cry with thee O soul,” he read. “The Past! the Past! the Past!”"

As the Internal Revenue Service contemplates new rules to illuminate “dark money” in politics, a little-known nonprofit group is fighting back using money traceable to billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, drug makers and the cable television industry.The group, American Commitment, received 87 percent of its $13 million in funding between 2011 and 2013 from three Koch-connected nonprofits: the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the Center to Protect Patient Rights and Free Enterprise America, according to tax filings reviewed by the Center for Public Integrity.The Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce — which has been called “the Koch brothers’ secret bank” by Politico — has given $6.4 million to American Commitment, including $140,000 in 2013, according to tax records.The Center to Protect Patient Rights — headed by Koch-connected political consultant Sean Noble — contributed about $4.8 million to American Commitment in 2012.And another Koch network group headed by Noble, Free Enterprise America, contributed $103,000 to American Commitment in 2011 — nearly half of the $216,500 American Commitment reported raising that year.Meanwhile, additional tax records show two major trade associations are also among American Commitment’s donors: the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, both of which share policy positions with American Commitment.In 2013, PhRMA contributed $50,000 to American Commitment. That’s up from the $25,000 the drug lobby group gave in 2012. And the National Cable and Telecommunications Association has contributed $20,000 to American Commitment — $10,000 in both 2012 and 2013.As a “social welfare” nonprofit organized under Sec. 501(c)(4) of the tax code, American Commitment is not required to publicly disclose its donors, even though it overtly supports political candidates.But separate IRS filings show the bulk of American Commitment’s money has come from these nonprofits, which are legally required to disclose grants they provide to other nonprofit organizations.American Commitment itself disclosed, as required by law, that in 2013, it received between $100,000 and $150,000 each from four unnamed donors.Together, those four donors — one of which appears to have been the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce — accounted for half of American Commitment’s $1 million in income last year, according to records filed with the IRS earlier this week.Led by Phil Kerpen — a veteran of Americans for Prosperity, the Club for Growth and the Cato Institute — American Commitment has vigorously opposed efforts to force donor disclosure on social welfare nonprofit groups.It has derided liberal politicians for what it calls “shameful efforts to amend the Constitution to empower politicians to regulate political speech” and “backdoor regulatory efforts to limit the First Amendment at federal agencies.”Earlier this year, after the IRS unveiled a proposal to regulate politically active nonprofits organized under Sec. 501(c)(4) of the tax code, American Commitment co-wrote a letter to the agency’s commissioner calling for the new rules to be “withdrawn and abandoned.""According to its website, it’s also helped thousands of people flood the inboxes of their lawmakers with the message: “Don't let the IRS gut the First Amendment!”Given its involvement in elections, American Commitment ranks high among social welfare nonprofits that would be affected by any new IRS rules governing so-called dark money — cash from publicly undisclosed donors used to boost or bash political candidates.Ahead of the 2014 midterms, American Commitment promoted Republican U.S. Senate candidate Thom Tillis of North Carolina in radio ads. In 2013, it backed Republican U.S. Senate candidate Steve Lonegan in his race against Democrat Cory Booker. And Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was among politicians American Commitment supported in 2012.Campaign finance reform activists for years have called upon the tax agency to take a more aggressive stance regarding politically active nonprofits, which gained the ability to fund advertisements explicitly calling for the election or defeat of lawmakers in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision in 2010.Groups such as Crossroads GPS on the right, which was co-founded by GOP strategist Karl Rove, and Patriot Majority USA on the left, which is run by allies of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., have proliferated — all while legally keeping their donors’ names secret.The IRS — which, earlier this year, postponed a public hearing on its highly contentious plan — has vowed to issue a new draft of proposed regulations for social welfare nonprofits in early 2015.Industry lobbying groups such as PhRMA and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association have also found an ally in American Commitment.One of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association’s top issues: opposing “net neutrality” policies that would regulate the Internet like a utility — a move the trade group says would be “disastrous.”American Commitment’s Kerpen, meanwhile, has argued that “regulating and taxing the Internet is obviously a terrible idea.”Joy Sims, a National Cable and Telecommunications Association spokeswoman, declined to comment about the group’s donation to American Commitment.American Commitment further describes itself as “committed to fully repealing” President Barack Obama’s health care law and replacing it in a way that “empowers patients and doctors” and unleashes “American ingenuity and creativity to cure diseases.”Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for PhRMA — which supported the passage of Obama’s Affordable Care Act but has also funneled money to groups like American Commitment that want it scrapped — said the trade group often gives out money to “organizations that share PhRMA’s goals of improving the quality of patients’ lives” and “supporting the discovery of new treatments and cures.”Other donors to American Commitment remain unknown — exactly how the group wants them to be.“Protecting the privacy of our members is critical to their core First Amendment rights of free speech and free association,” Kerpen wrote in an email to the Center for Public Integrity.According to its new tax filing, American Commitment also doled out $135,000 to four other nonprofit groups. The top beneficiary: the Iowa-based American Future Fund, which received $65,000.In recent years, the American Future Fund has spent tens of millions of dollars advocating against federal lawmakers, including about $81,000 in late 2013 against Rep. Collin Peterson, the ranking Democratic member of the House Agriculture Committee.Like American Commitment, it has done so without disclosing its funders."

Balloons emblazoned with the word ""RAPE"" decorate a horrific birthday party.The footage was shot last year, but Manson's reps told Pitchfork that it was not part of a music video or a specific Manson-related project. ""Manson did not direct this, shoot it, nor was it for a Marilyn Manson video or outtake footage made by him or to be used by him with his music,"" Manson's rep said to Pitchfork. Del Rey, Manson and Roth's reps did not respond to immediate request for comment when contacted by HuffPost Entertainment.Back in 2012, Del Rey and Manson were spotted together at restaurants and awards shows. Manson has also cultivated a friendship with Roth over the years, and even attended Roth's Passover seder.
