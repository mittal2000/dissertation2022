Israel has apologized for its lethal raid on the Mavi Marmara activist ship and agreed to pay out $20 million to the bereaved and injured.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577100241500002a0073cb5a.jpeg?cache=14Kn5lZ1qo&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"JERUSALEM/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Israel and Turkey on Sunday reached agreement to normalize ties, senior officials from both countries said, to end a rift over the Israeli navy's killing of 10 Turkish pro-Palestinian activists who tried to sail to the blockaded Gaza Strip in 2010.A formal announcement on the restoration of ties and the details of the agreement were expected on Monday at 1000 GMT by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in Rome, and Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim in Ankara.""We reached an agreement with Israel to normalize bilateral relations on Sunday in Rome,"" a senior Turkish official said, describing the agreement as a ""diplomatic victory"" for Turkey, although Israel has not accepted to lift the Gaza blockade, one of Ankara's three conditions for an agreement.The once-firm allies had been quietly mending fences in trade and tourism since their leaders held a conciliatory telephone call in 2013 and negotiations have intensified over the past six months to pave the way for a mutual return of ambassadors.Netanyahu traveled to Rome on Sunday to meet U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Israeli and Turkish officials were also in the Italian capital to finalize the deal.Israel, which had already offered its apologies - one of Ankara's three conditions for a deal - for its lethal raid on the Mavi Marmara activist ship, agreed to pay out $20 million to the bereaved and injured, the Israeli official said in a briefing to Israeli reporters traveling with Netanyahu.Under the deal, Turkey will deliver humanitarian aid and other non-military products to Gaza and carry out infrastructure projects including residential buildings and a hospital in the area, the senior Turkish official said. Concrete steps will be taken to address the water and power crisis in the city.A senior Israeli official said senior foreign ministry diplomats from both countries would separately sign parallel agreements on Tuesday.The deal, politically touchy for both countries, could pave the way for lucrative Mediterranean gas deals and a diplomatic reprieve from Turkish troubles with next-door Syria and Europe.The rare rapprochement in the Middle East, bitterly divided over Syria's civil war, has been largely driven by increasing security risks with the rise of Islamic State and as both countries seek new alliances amid a polarized region.Israel demanded that its military officers and government officials be indemnified against prosecution on war crimes allegations. The Israeli official said the money would be paid after Turkey's parliament passed legislation on the issue.Turkey's Islamist-rooted President Tayyip Erdogan had cast himself as guardian of Palestinian interests and engaged Hamas, the faction that controls Gaza and is on the terrorist blacklists of Israel and Western powers.A 2011 report commissioned by U.N. Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon upheld the legality of the Gaza blockade, which Israel says is needed to stem Hamas arms smuggling. The U.N. inquiry also faulted Israel for its marines' use of lethal force as they stormed the Mavi Marmara and brawled with activists on the deck.Separate to the agreement, the Israeli official said Erdogan would instruct relevant Turkish agencies to resolve the issue of missing Israelis in the Gaza Strip. Israel says Hamas is holding the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the 2014 Gaza War and believes two civilians are also missing."

Accordingly, many aren't quite sure what to think about the results. While 33 percent of Americans approve of the U.K.'s decision to leave the EU, and 32 percent disapprove, the plurality, 35 percent, aren't sure. Just one-third of the U.S. public has strong feelings either way.Republicans, though, are all in favor of Brexit. Fifty-nine percent say they support the move, in contrast to just 17 percent of Democrats and 32 percent of independents.President Barack Obama and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had urged Britain to stay in the EU, but said last week that they respected the results of the referendum. Donald Trump, the GOP's presumptive nominee, offered unreserved praise for the decision, drawing parallels with his own campaign. “Basically, they took back their country. That’s a great thing,” he told reporters.Similar partisan divides are evident in Americans' views of their own country's role in the world. A near majority, 49 percent, say the U.S. should pay less attention to problems overseas and concentrate on problems at home. Just 38 percent say it's better for the future of our country to be active in world affairs. Democrats are evenly split on the merits of an active foreign policy agenda, with an equal 45 percent choosing each option. Republicans, however, lean toward the more isolationist option by a 23-point margin, 58 percent to 35 percent.Democrats say by a 30-point margin, 56 percent to 26 percent, that the number of newcomers from other countries largely strengthens American society, while Republicans say by a 58-point margin, 75 percent to 17 percent, that it threatens traditional American customs and values.Views on trade have long defied traditional partisan divides: In May 2015, Republicans and Democrats were about equally likely to say that free trade was good overall for the U.S. Since then, both free trade and immigration, have been favored punching bags of the Trump campaign. Now, while Democrats say by a 26-point margin that free trade agreements between countries are more of a good thing than a bad thing, Republicans see them by a 12-point margin as more of a negative.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted June 27 through June 27 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

9,BUSINESS,How Brexit Fits Into The New World Order,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brexit-populism_us_576d7ccbe4b017b379f5dd46,"What if the U.K.'s vote to leave the EU is not an isolated incident, but part of a populist trend that warns of more to come?",2016-06-27,"An infographic of global risks, according to Citi's Vox Populi report from January.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57703a6e2200002e00f830c7.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Britain's vote by a slim margin last week to leave the EU wasn't supposed to happen. On the morning of the vote, polls gave ""leave"" only a slim chance of winning. Unexpected as it was, the Brexit referendum wasn't an isolated incident. In fact, it fits into a larger global narrative of populist uprisings destabilizing the status quo. Back in January, a team of analysts from Citi put together a huge report on this new world order. The report referred to the risk of deviating from the political status quo ""vox populi"" (the ""voice of the people"" in Latin). Citi uses the term to mean populist movements and new upstart political parties on the edges of the spectrum, coupled with non-existent global economic growth and governments that are unable or unwilling to do much about the increasing inequality.This means that various popular movements, like the Brexit campaign in Britain, Donald Trump here in the U.S., far-right parties in Europe, such as Marine Le Pen's National Front in France, and even resistance to the rush of migrants from the Middle East into Europe, are inter-connected. (Syria's civil war, remember, began during the Arab Spring uprising.) Essentially, these sorts of movements destabilize the status quo, and therefore are likely to destabilize global markets. Related or not, on a more fundamental level, the authors of the report see a great power vacuum in the world. The U.S. is no longer as powerful as it once was, particularly since the Iraq War boondoggle. Europe is too politically fractured to assert what potential power it may have. China is too focused on growth and regional concerns to police the world. Russia is, well, Russia. Without a global balance of power, the authors see a greater risk of political destabilization everywhere. (This is known as a ""realist"" view of international relations.)There's a global sense of economic stagnation, which governments have largely been incompetent at fixing. The middle class and working class are seeing increased inequality and fewer good job opportunities. For that, they blame globalization. Everything comes together ""in an environment where global growth is stagnating while public expectations remain high and government capacity to effect positive change through reforms is low,"" the Citi authors write.Brexit is a warning that these are issues that are not going away. Current global leaders seem rather ineffectual at dealing with them. Agree or disagree, this is what the capitalists are afraid of."
10,POLITICS,Donald Trump Adviser Insists Campaign Is Doing Just Fine,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-paul-manafort_us_576ff4b7e4b0f1683239d9d2,What polling and organization problems?,2016-06-26,Paul Manafort of the Donald Trump campaign says their organization isn't lagging behind Hillary Clinton's.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576ff50b1500002b0073ca42.jpeg?cache=CNUAi1sRYQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Paul Manafort, a top adviser to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, denied on Sunday that the campaign has anything to worry about, despite two recent polls that show Trump lagging behind Democrat Hillary Clinton and despite the GOP candidate having a far less established campaign structure than his rival.Chuck Todd, host of NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" asked Manafort whether he would acknowledge that Trump's campaign is outmatched by Clinton's in organization and in the polls. ""No,"" Manafort said. ""Because what you're trying to do is compare an 800-person organization in Brooklyn of Mrs. Clinton's with an integrated system of the [Republican National Committee] and the Trump campaign, which doesn't appear on a FEC report.""Manafort dodged the question of the poll numbers. Clinton leads Trump by 12 points -- 51 percent to Trump's 39 percent -- in a Washington Post/ABC News poll released Sunday. The poll also found that nearly two-thirds of Americans think the businessman is not qualified to be president. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey released Sunday found a smaller lead, with Clinton ahead of Trump by 5 points in a head-to-head matchup. But Manafort's comments on organization were less a dodge than a straight-up denial of reality. Clinton's campaign has hundreds more staffers than Trump's and is integrated with the Democratic National Committee, while Trump's reliance on the RNC could pose a problem if the committee chooses to focus more of its attention on races other than the presidential campaign -- a real risk given the tense relationship between the Trump campaign and the national party leadership. Clinton's campaign also has significantly more money, particularly when party committees and supportive super PACs are included.Trump fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski last week as his poll numbers dropped, and Manafort hinted that more shake-ups are to come in the form of hirings as soon as this week. He also made a head-scratching statement about Trump's involvement in the organization of his own campaign. ""We have a candidate who doesn't need to figure out what's going on in order to say what he wants to do,"" he said. ""Our campaign is organized, we're ready, we're going to have a good convention and we're confident that we are not behind the Clinton campaign. They're muscle-bound, we're not."" Manafort had to spin even more when asked about Trump's comments after last week's Brexit, when Britain voted to leave the European Union, leading to plunges in the U.S. stock market and the British pound. Trump was in Scotland at the time to promote his golf courses, and said amid concern about the economy that the vote -- which has been seen as a dismaying sign of racial division in the U.K. -- would be good for his profits because more people would travel to his resorts.The Clinton campaign put out an ad on Sunday criticizing Trump's Brexit comments as evidence that he only looks out for himself. Asked to respond, Manafort said the ad was ""an example of the tone-deafness of the Clinton campaign.""""The American people care about what is going to happen to their lives, about change, and the issues of Brexit -- this kind of phony ad -- doesn't address those things,"" he said. ""Hillary Clinton is ignoring the reality because she's part of the establishment. She can't get away from the fact that she's part of the problem.""Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

McConnell twice declined on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday to say straight out that Trump is qualified to be president. ""Look, that will be up to the American people to decide,"" McConnell said. ""He won the Republican nomination fair and square. He got more votes than anybody else against a whole lot of well-qualified candidates. So our primary voters have made their decision as to who they want to be the nominee. The American people will be able to make that decision in the fall.""Sixty-four percent of Americans believe Trump is not qualified to be president, versus 37 percent who say Democratic presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton is not qualified, according to a Washington Post-ABC poll released Sunday.It's been difficult to nail down Republicans' positions on that question, particularly as many of them have distanced themselves from Trump amid his numerous controversial statements -- which have included saying he would profit from a recent vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union; renewing his call to keep Muslims out of the U.S. (a ban he now says would apply only to Muslims from ""terror states""); responding to the deadliest mass shooting in American history by patting himself on the back for past statements on terror threats; implying that President Barack Obama supports terrorists; and attacking an American judge for having Mexican parents. After ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos asked McConnell whether he thinks Trump is qualified, the top Senate Republican said he sees it as a good step that the candidate is using a prepared script more often. ""I think there's no question that he's made a number of mistakes over the last few weeks,"" McConnell said. ""I think they're beginning to right the ship; it's a long time until November. The burden obviously will be on him to convince people that he can handle this job."" He added later that Trump needs to ""catch up and catch up fast"" on fundraising for his campaign, after dismal finance numbers came out last week.McConnell said earlier this month that he hoped Trump would select a running mate with more experience and knowledge than himself, ""because it's pretty obvious he doesn't know a lot about the issues."" Democrat Tom Perez, the current Labor secretary who has been floated as a potential vice presidential pick for Clinton, unsurprisingly had an easier time answering the qualification question.

The planned drinks menu is said to feature only beer and wine.The first location will open this October in Eastchester, New York, about 30 miles north of New York City. It will also offer a bocce court, a fire pit and outdoor seating, The Journal News reports.Similar stores will appear at the Galleria in Edina, Minnesota; at Palladio in Folsom, California; and at One Loudoun in Ashburn, Virginia.""We wanted to create a better bookstore,"" Jaime Carey, Barnes & Noble's president of development and the restaurant group, told Fortune. “We think they’re going to drive traffic to the store and [be] keeping them in the store longer.”Carey noted that many Barnes & Noble locations already have cafes that feature Starbucks sweets, sandwiches and beverages.""We said, let’s have a much better food experience frankly,"" Carey said.The retailer appears to be taking a page out of Starbucks' own playbook. The coffee chain in 2014 began offering ""Starbucks Evenings"" at select stores, featuring wine, beer and hors d'oeuvres.Barnes & Noble's news came just a day after the retailer reported a drop in sales in its fourth quarter report. Though the company's stock price took a tumble the same day its fiscal earnings were reported, it rebounded following the announcement of the concept stores and two executive appointments. The company, which touts itself as the nation's largest retail bookseller, operates 640 stores in 50 states."
14,POLITICS,"Donald Trump Would Push Debt To Highest Level In U.S. History, Report Says",Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-debt_us_57701efbe4b0dbb1bbbae2c9,Making America great again -- by running up huge IOUs.,2016-06-26,"Debt as a percentage of GDP, for the two major presidential candidates and under current law.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5770277b1500002b0073ca5f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s policy agenda would quickly push the national debt to its highest level in history, according to a new report.The analysis, which the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget published Sunday evening, represents one of the first serious efforts to assess how electing Trump or his chief rival for the presidency, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, might affect federal finances over time. Rather than focusing on individual policy initiatives -- like Trump’s call to abolish the estate tax, or Clinton’s pledge to help working parents pay for child care -- this new analysis takes into account all of the candidates' proposals to date, in order to assess how they would alter the federal budget and, ultimately, the amount of debt that the public holds.It was not an easy task for the committee’s researchers, because Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, barely talks about policy. When he does, he's frequently vague or inconsistent. But the few proposals that Trump has actually described publicly made it possible to construct a rough analysis and compare his agenda with the more detailed proposals from Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. The resulting contrast was stark. As the report demonstrates, the election doesn’t simply present Americans with a choice between a politician who disparages entire ethnic and religious groups and a politician who preaches the virtues of diversity. It also offers a choice between a candidate who'd create vast new deficits for the sake of some highly questionable tax cuts -- and one proposing a more modest agenda of expanded government programs, with added revenue that would cover nearly all of their cost.The centerpiece of Trump’s agenda is a series of proposed tax cuts, including new breaks for businesses and reductions in individual rates, that past studies have shown would disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans. The committee’s researchers, working from estimates by the (also nonpartisan) Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, determined that, taken together, the tax cuts would add something like $9.25 trillion in new debt over the next 10 years. (For these and other projections, committee researchers produced three separate estimates to generate a range of possibilities and then used the one in the middle for their main analysis.)Other items on Trump’s agenda, including his promises to overhaul veteran services and repeal the Affordable Care Act, would add a few hundred billion dollars to that total. With no significant new revenues or spending cuts to offset these costs, and with the higher interest payments that so much new borrowing would require, the cumulative impact of Trump’s agenda would probably be around $11.5 trillion in additional federal debt over 10 years, the committee’s researchers found. The number itself doesn’t mean a whole lot. The U.S. has carried significant debt going all the way back to the 1790s -- when, at the urging of Alexander Hamilton, the fledgling federal government assumed liabilities that the states had incurred during the American Revolution and its aftermath.What matters, instead, is the size of the debt relative to the rest of the economy, measured as Gross Domestic Product. That figure indicates how many resources society must divert from current priorities, like education or defense or retirement programs, in order to pay for past borrowing.And it’s debt-to-GDP ratio where the impact of Trump’s agenda may be most arresting. According to the committee’s researchers, Trump’s agenda, if enacted, would push the ratio of federal debt to GDP from its current level of 75 percent all the way up to 127 percent.The previous peak was around 110 percent, and that was during the 1940s -- when the necessities of fighting a world war called for unusually large borrowing. Trump has yet to explain why his agenda would justify so much additional debt.Of course, Clinton would also add liabilities to the federal ledger. Specifically, she has proposed an array of new programs, including tax credits to offset out-of-pocket medical costs and new federal assistance with college tuition, that would significantly expand the size and scope of the federal government. All told, according to the committee’s analysis, Clinton’s agenda would have the federal government laying out an additional $1.4 trillion in new spending over the next decade.But the amount of federal money Clinton would commit to these new programs is just a fraction of the amount of federal money that Trump would dump into his tax cuts. Many of Clinton's proposals, including the ones that focus on early childhood, hold out the promise of much greater economic returns in the future. Last but not least, Clinton has actually called for raising taxes on the wealthy -- and has identified enough specific increases to raise $1.25 trillion in revenue and offset most of her new spending initiatives. As a result, the committee’s analysis finds, Clinton’s agenda would place the ratio of debt-to-GDP at around 87 percent by 2026. This is more or less where that ratio is headed anyway: If current policy stays exactly the same, the debt-to-GDP ratio would reach about 86 percent by 2026, projections suggest.The committee’s report was careful to point out that at 87 percent, the debt-to-GDP ratio after 10 years would still be higher than its present level of 75 percent. That’s a big problem, the committee says, given that an aging population is likely to push the cost of government services, particularly health care programs, much higher in the future. Current projections suggest that if the government's fiscal trajectory does not change, debt-to-GDP ratio could exceed 130 percent by 2040 -- a level that would also be well above the previous historic peak.“To date,” the report says, “neither former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton nor businessman Donald Trump has put forward a plan to address the national debt.”But fiscal projections beyond the immediate future are notoriously unreliable, and mainstream economists disagree over precisely what constitutes an ideal debt-to-GDP ratio, or whether an ideal ratio even exists. A lot depends on how much of the debt is financing current needs, rather than investments that will (hopefully) yield a more productive economy in the future.Meanwhile, the report makes clear which of the two major candidates would require vast new borrowing and which one wouldn't. “Mr. Trump’s proposals would massively increase the debt,” the report says.On that, there isn't much debate among mainstream experts.“The difference between [Clinton and Trump] is indeed stark,” Henry Aaron, a widely respected Brookings economist who did not work on the committee’s analysis, told The Huffington Post Sunday. “One candidate shows determination to, at least, keep debt under control. The other is utterly indifferent to it.""Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Lawrence HurleyWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is due on Monday to issue its first major abortion ruling since 2007 against a backdrop of unremitting divisions among Americans on the issue and a decades-long decline in the rate at which women terminate pregnancies.The court's decision on whether a Republican-backed 2013 Texas law placed an undue burden on women exercising their constitutional right to abortion is one of three remaining cases for the court to decide on Monday, the last day of its term. The other major one involves whether the justices will overturn the corruption conviction of former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell.The last time the justices decided a major abortion case was nine years ago when they ruled 5-4 to uphold a federal law banning a late-term abortion procedure.Americans remain closely divided over whether abortion should be legal. In a Reuters/Ipso online poll involving 6,769 U.S. adults conducted from June 3 to June 22, 47 percent of respondents said abortion generally should be legal and 42 percent said it generally should be illegal.Views on abortion in the United States have changed very little over the decades, according to historical polling data.There has been a long decline in the U.S. abortion rate. The most recent data, from 2011, showed that there were an estimated 1.1 million abortions that year at a rate of 16.9 per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion policy and supports abortion rights. The rate had peaked at 29 abortions per 1,000 women in 1981, the group said.""We know that the recent abortion declines were primarily due to declines in unintended pregnancies. Improved contraceptive use is likely the key driver of the declines in both unintended pregnancy and abortion,"" said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the institute.The Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide in its landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling.The law in Texas, one of a number of conservative states that have pursued restrictions on abortion, requires abortion doctors to have ""admitting privileges,"" a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. It also requires clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities.The court is evenly divided between liberals and conservatives following the February death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. The court could split 4-4, which would leave in place a lowercourt's decision upholding the law.In the Reuters/Ipsos poll, Americans were nearly evenly split on whether they backed laws like the one in Texas, with 43 percent generally opposed and 41 percent generally supportive. The poll had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of about 2 percentage points.(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)"

Still.After Britain's historic vote to leave the European Union, there is no indication that a so-calledBrexit will happen soon. It maybe never will.Prime Minister David Cameron, who is resigning, has said he will not take the formal step to an EU divorce on the grounds that his successor should. Because the referendum is not legally-binding, some politicians are suggesting a parliament vote before formally triggering Brexit.A petition on the UK government's website on holding a second referendum has gained more than 3 million signatories in just two days.European leaders, facing the biggest threat to European unity since World War Two, are divided over how swiftly divorce talks should start. Paris wants haste and German Chancellor Angela Merkel is urging patience. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he wanted to ""start immediately"".And on Sunday, Scotland's leader said Scotland may veto Brexit altogether. Under devolution rules, the parliaments of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are required to consent to any EU divorce, according to a report by the House of Lords.Most British politicians agree such a decisive 52-48 win for Leave in the referendum means a divorce must happen. Anything less would be a slap in the face of democracy.""The will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered,"" a choking Cameron said in his resignation speech, which marked the most tumultuous end to a British premiership since Anthony Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez crisis.Still, the upswell of chatter - #regrexit is trending big on twitter - over whether Britain might be able to reconsider speaks to the disbelief gripping this continent in the wake of a vote that has unleashed financial and political mayhem.Sterling has plunged, and Britain's political parties are both crippled. Cameron is a lameduck leader, and the main opposition Labour party on Sunday attempted a coup against its leader, with nine top officials resigning.""The kaleidoscope has been shaken up not just in terms of our relationship with the EU but in terms of who runs our parties, who governs the country and what the country is made up of,"" said Anand Menon, Professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at King's College London.""It is very hard to see where the pieces are.""ARTICLE 50The law provisioning an EU member country's exit from the union is Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty that is effectively the EU's constitution. It has never been invoked before.Before the vote, Cameron had said Article 50 would be triggered straight away if Britain voted to leave. Over the weekend, several EU officials also said the UK needed to formally split right away - possibly at a Tuesday EU meeting.But officials of the Leave campaign - including former London mayor Boris Johnson - are stepping on the brakes. They say they want to negotiate Britain's post-Brexit relationship with the EU before formally pulling the trigger to divorce.European officials and observers say such a deal is unlikely, especially considering the thorny issues involved.For example, it is unlikely that the EU would grant Britain access to the single market - key to allowing Britain trade goods and services in the EU - without London accepting the free movement of EU workers. But the biggest issue for those who voted to leave the bloc was limits on immigration - something the Leave campaigners promised.DIVIDED UKOn Sunday, a petition to call for a second referendum was gaining supporters, reaching 3.3 million signatories by the afternoon. David Lammy, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour Party, said it was within parliament's powers to call a second referendum and urged that it be done.Perhaps the most vocal resistance to a British exit is coming from Scotland.Scotland, a nation of five million people, voted to stay in the EU by 62 to 38 percent, compared to the 54 percent in England who voted to leave.Under the United Kingdom's complex arrangements to devolve some powers to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, legislation generated in London to set off an EU divorce would have to gain consent from the three devolved parliaments, according to a report by the House of Lords' European Union Committee.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the BBC on Sunday that she would consider urging the Scottish parliament to block such a motion. It is not clear, however, whether such a scenario would ever materialize or be binding. Sturgeon's spokesman later said that the British government might not seek consent in the first place.Moreover, Sturgeon is simply laying out the groundwork for a new referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom --something the first minister said was ""highly likely.""WITHDRAWALWhile there is no precedent for Article 50, the House of Lords has discussed how any Brexit would work. In May, it published a report after consultations with legal experts.In the report, Derrick Wyatt, one of the professors involved, said that while it would be politically difficult, the law allows the UK to change its mind after invoking Article 50.""In law, the UK could change its mind before withdrawal from the EU and decide to stay in after all,"" said Wyatt.(Editing by Alessandra Galloni)"

(Reuters) - Firefighters have begun to contain a wildfire in central California that has killed at least two people and destroyed 200 structures, fire officials said on Sunday, as six other blazes burned in the state in an already intense wildfire season.The fire known as Erskine, about 110 miles (180 km) north of Los Angeles, smoldered over a wide area on Sunday after melting steel and reducing homes to ash in an intense conflagration on Thursday and Friday.The Erskine fire was 10 percent contained after charring 36,810 acres, or nearly 60 square miles, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said, adding it was expected to be contained by Thursday.California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for Kern County. In addition to the 200 destroyed structures, 75 homes have been damaged.""Two fatalities have been confirmed. Additional fatalities are possible due to the extreme fire behavior during the initial hours of the incident,"" the Kern County Fire Department said in a statement on Sunday. Investigators were studying a third set of charred remains to determine whether they were human.More than 1,700 firefighters were working on the fire at the southern end of the Sierra Nevada range.Hundreds of people from more than 10 communities were evacuated as Erskine spread rapidly on Thursday and Friday as winds drove it south and east from the Lake Isabella reservoir.""I got out just as the flames were at my back fence,"" said Terralyn Lehman, who is staying at a campground with her mother and her dog after their home in South Lake was destroyed.She and her mother were awoken by the sound of a propane tank exploding.

When I went to investigate, my friend reassured me that the child was not being exorcised, as I had feared, but was having her hair braided. This is Burkina Faso, a small, poor, landlocked West African country, and no one I know here would deny that the child’s pain is necessary for the beautiful results it produces. If you have never had an African woman braid your hair, I can tell you that it is very painful, and takes hours. Sleeping that first night is difficult, and the headache can last for up to two days. Needless to say, it isn't good for your hair either. It is extremely rare to see a woman in Burkina Faso elect to wear her hair natural. From the age of a couple of months old a girl's hair is either coiffed, in a state of being coiffed, or in the uncomfortable middle ground between coifs. By the time most Burkinabe girls hit 15, their hair line is already starting to recede. Even my hair dresser, who has been responsible for the fate of more heads than a guillotine, has no idea how to make use of the shea butter or coconut oil found in abundance here. Natural hair is neither desired nor encouraged to grow to its full potential.So why did I come back from visiting my family in America fully natural? I am a biracial adopted child, and I grew up in a family of straight-haired women. My curls are nearly as tight as a West African's and just as uncooperative. Dealing with my hair growing up was a steady battle; my weapons of choice the comb, bobby pins, relaxer and enough daily product to drown a small herd of wholly mammoth. Despite these tried and true methods, my efforts were sometimes inadequate against the thousands of tiny strands fighting guerrilla warfare all over my head. I have always struggled with my self-image because of my hair, even when it was relaxed, so cutting it was a big deal. You might expect Burkina Faso to be the perfect place for a lost child of the African diaspora to find her ""roots,"" but the reception I received upon my drastic cut was less that warm. Some scowled. Some gasped. Others laughed. I did my best to face down the negativity. I resisted constant offers have my curls braided and ducked women who offered to take a broken-toothed comb to my hair.I am particularly interested in the question of hair because Burkina Faso is not unique in its hesitancy to embrace natural locks. Despite the recent trend in the United States for black women to cut off their treated hair, a quick look at popular culture will tell you the Americans aren't loving natural black hair either. Look at Kerry Washington in Scandal, or Nichelle Nichols in Star Trek or even that paragon of black female power Beyoncé. Tyra Banks once did a show where she asked black girls as young as 5 what kind of hair they'd like to have, and without fail they all selected the straight blond wig from the array of hair styles that sat mounted before them on mannequins. Having been not-so-subtly bombarded with the idea that long straight or wavy hair is what makes a woman beautiful, it was no surprise to me when I consciously felt men's eyes pass over me more readily when I went out to a bar after my cut. The idea of “good hair” is not the only sickness colonialism left behind in Burkina Faso: lighter-skinned women are considered more beautiful than their darker sisters, and faux Western style jewelry is preferred to African-made accessories. But most importantly, coiffed hair seems to be a prerequisite to beauty. There is an aversion I have seen women exhibit to being too much their natural selves, and despite the fact that many aspects of beauty here are uniquely African, the distaste for natural hair is no more Burkinabe than French fries are French.When I finally did relent to having my hair braided, I was immediately aware of the difference. Men looked at me more. Women gasped and complimented me when I approached saying, ""Now you are well-coiffed!"" One girl covered her open mouth with her hands and said ""Elena, you have become beautiful...""I don't know what that means, I wanted to say to her. Your perfect black skin, dark eyes and the way you carry 70 lbs of water on your head and swing your hips is stunning. Your tight curls and perfect bone structure should be immortalized in marble. Your natural curls are beautiful, every last unruly one. ---This post is part of HuffPost's My Natural Hair Journey blog series.

Despite these tried and true methods, my efforts were sometimes inadequate against the thousands of tiny strands fighting guerrilla warfare all over my head. I have always struggled with my self-image because of my hair, even when it was relaxed, so cutting it was a big deal. You might expect Burkina Faso to be the perfect place for a lost child of the African diaspora to find her ""roots,"" but the reception I received upon my drastic cut was less that warm. Some scowled. Some gasped. Others laughed. I did my best to face down the negativity. I resisted constant offers have my curls braided and ducked women who offered to take a broken-toothed comb to my hair.I am particularly interested in the question of hair because Burkina Faso is not unique in its hesitancy to embrace natural locks. Despite the recent trend in the United States for black women to cut off their treated hair, a quick look at popular culture will tell you the Americans aren't loving natural black hair either. Look at Kerry Washington in Scandal, or Nichelle Nichols in Star Trek or even that paragon of black female power Beyoncé. Tyra Banks once did a show where she asked black girls as young as 5 what kind of hair they'd like to have, and without fail they all selected the straight blond wig from the array of hair styles that sat mounted before them on mannequins. Having been not-so-subtly bombarded with the idea that long straight or wavy hair is what makes a woman beautiful, it was no surprise to me when I consciously felt men's eyes pass over me more readily when I went out to a bar after my cut. The idea of “good hair” is not the only sickness colonialism left behind in Burkina Faso: lighter-skinned women are considered more beautiful than their darker sisters, and faux Western style jewelry is preferred to African-made accessories. But most importantly, coiffed hair seems to be a prerequisite to beauty. There is an aversion I have seen women exhibit to being too much their natural selves, and despite the fact that many aspects of beauty here are uniquely African, the distaste for natural hair is no more Burkinabe than French fries are French.When I finally did relent to having my hair braided, I was immediately aware of the difference. Men looked at me more. Women gasped and complimented me when I approached saying, ""Now you are well-coiffed!"" One girl covered her open mouth with her hands and said ""Elena, you have become beautiful...""I don't know what that means, I wanted to say to her. Your perfect black skin, dark eyes and the way you carry 70 lbs of water on your head and swing your hips is stunning. Your tight curls and perfect bone structure should be immortalized in marble. Your natural curls are beautiful, every last unruly one. ---This post is part of HuffPost's My Natural Hair Journey blog series.

He only hesitates when he's asked to go completely under. (We don't wonder why.)Though his style of entry was impressive, it's worth noting how long he soaked for.""Ryan stayed in the pool for roughly 20 minutes and didn't notice any significant changes to his skin or hair other than feeling really sticky,"" Maksimuk told The Huffington Post via email Sunday. ""But he said his skin felt very smooth in the pool.""The backyard where the scene was filmed suffered a different fate, however.""The cola was all dumped out in the grass and then thoroughly washed with water, however, a horrible smell still reeks in the backyard a week after disposal,"" Maksimuk said. Of course, its seems no video by TechRax is complete without the destruction of some kind of technology.So, as if to spark a nuclear war in the video's comment section, TechRax's crew intentionally crashes a DJI Phantom 4 drone into the pool. The camera watches as the four-figure toy sputters in the liquid and dies.""That is what my youtube channel revolves around; technology destruction,"" Maksimuk defended. ""It is something that is a part of every one of my videos.""And the sensationalism appears to work (just check out his iPhone destruction videos).

In a joint letter to World Bank management, the signatories requested that the final draft of the World Bank safeguards package be publicly disclosed at the same time that it is shared with the Board for review. This would allow them to discuss the content with their elected representatives before the World Bank Board seeks out the final opinions of member governments. The letter makes clear that civil society is still very much engaged in the policy review, the outcome of which will determine the environmental and social standards to which both the Bank and its borrowers are held. ""As we are all aware,"" the letter reads, ""the new safeguard policy will have enormous implications for human rights and environmental integrity in Bank-sponsored development.""World Bank Management's responses to the letter indicate that it recognizes its obligation to disclose the final draft policy. According to the World Bank Access to Information (AI) Policy, operational policy papers prepared following a public consultation process must be disclosed after submission to the Board and before the approval date. Unfortunately, loopholes in the AI policy will allow the final safeguards draft to be deliberated internally within a Board subcommittee, even though the entire Board will likely be privy to/involved in these negotiations. By the time the draft is officially submitted to the whole Board, a consensus will likely be more or less reached. So far, Bank Management has not shown willingness to prioritize public interest in the document and publish it at the same time it is shared with government shareholders. True transparency requires that information is disclosed in such a way that stakeholders can meaningfully affect change. The World Bank, which uses public money to fund policies and projects that affect the poorest and most vulnerable, should be the leading global example. Instead, it continues to hide behind loopholes for the sake of efficiency and expediency. Many of the organizations that endorsed the letter have been following the review of the safeguards policies for the past four years. They have submitted detailed and lengthy written comments, given impassioned statements at global consultation meetings, and have even peacefully taken to the streets to make their voices heard. Caption: Civil Society organizations protesting World Bank's human rights policy protections in front of World Bank HQ in Washington DC/April 2015 (Photo credits: Natalia Margolis)Why? Because weakened safeguards at the Bank would mean weakened protections for those who most often experience the 'externalities' of development projects. While their governments boast increases in private investment and energy exports, communities suffer displacement, pollution and loss of livelihoods. Strong safeguards help prevent them from falling victim to development's dark side. According to letter signatories, ""The ultimate decision on this policy will see the best result if it is taken in a fully transparent and informed manner."" The fight for strong safeguards can only continue if civil society's engagement in the review of the policy is legitimized in this last crucial stage. And that means the Bank needs to look past the loopholes and disclose the draft when civil society inputs can still have an impact.

35,SCIENCE,A sea slug changed my life,"Laura Faye Tenenbaum, ContributorSenior Science Editor at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-sea-slug-changed-my-lif_b_10594882.html,,2016-06-26,2016-06-21-1466531273-239519-2454_LT_004768px90.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-21-1466531273-239519-2454_LT_004768px90-thumb.jpg," This underwater photo of a sea slug was captured with a close-up lens in Monterrey, Calif., by my first SCUBA instructor, Thomas Chapin circa 1985.At 8 p.m. after a long day of work in the Houston humidity, Derek Rutavic, manager of the NASA Gulfstream-III that will head back to Greenland this fall, and I were in the back of the plane singing One Direction's ""Drag Me Down"" over the high frequency radio system. It was stifling hot, getting dark and we were tired and hungry.But Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) Principal Investigator Josh Willis and Project Manager Steve Dinardo, too busy to take off their sweaty fire retardant flight suits, were troubleshooting electronics at two racks of computers, and they'd asked Rutavic to get on the headset to find out if the headset noise was interfering with the high radio frequency data signal the ocean science probes were sending back to the plane. Rutavic sat on an empty science probe container, while I lounged on one of the sofas singing along in awe of the amount of hard work this team was putting in.We'd been up early, flown multiple test flights, worked through lunch. And all of this after days and days of maintenance, and weather delays, and more hard work after more hard work. Earlier in the day, NASA T-38 supersonic jet pilot Bill Rieke flew mind-bogglingly close to the G-III to photograph the science probe deployment and determine if the technique of launching the probes through a hole in the bottom of the plane would succeed. And yes, it did. But that success merely signaled the OMG team to continue working.And I understood exactly why this team kept going, kept moving, kept pushing on into the evening, regardless of being tired and hot and hungry. I knew exactly why they decided to keep working on the challenge. They chose to push through because they'd found something to care about, and that's always more important than our difficulties and problems. When we focus on what we really care about, we get busy doing something, even in the face of trouble. And that's how science works.Lessons from a sea slugI first learned to care about the natural world around me during my junior year in college. I was in an oceanography course and we were studying sea slugs. (Yes, sea slugs.) A sea slug changed my life. Before then, I'd been, like many people, disengaged and uninterested in science. In third grade, someone came to our classroom and told us we could be the first female astronaut, and I remember thinking, ""No, I couldn't, not me.""And now? Even though I have a job at NASA, I still feel like I don't belong in the world of science. I feel more comfortable around athletes and artists than I do with a bunch of Ph.D.s. Maybe it's some poorly defined stereotype that I've somehow bought into or some preconceived notion of how someone who does science is supposed to behave.But those sea slugs taught me that I cared more about the natural world than I cared about the struggle of not fitting in or the challenge of the work. They appeared so delicate, small and defenseless, and I identified with that. They helped me feel connected. Noticing them forced me to wonder what else I'd start to notice if I slowed down enough to pay attention. And that connection to the natural world helped me stay committed to science, even when it was hard, even when there were problems, even when I felt like running away.Sure, scientific experimentation, just like much of real life, includes problems, troubles, obstacles and difficulties almost every day. And while it's true that someone, somewhere has to troubleshoot something every step of the way, we can also be excited about the effort. The OMG team understands that problems and hard work are not the exception, they are the norm. They are part of accomplishment. And it's totally possible to thrive on these difficulties and challenges.Look, we could be setting the world on fire right now, not by burning fossil fuels, but by our burning desire to understand our environment. Because the whole point of this experimental mission is to find out how quickly the warmer waters around Greenland are melting the second-largest ice sheet on the planet. It's major; it's dire; it's intense. It's one of the most important issues of our time.And sitting there in the back of that plane made me think about how we, as individuals and as a society, have to find something in this world to care about. We have to find something in this world that is more important than our challenges and problems.And you? I hope you decide to find something to care about. I hope you find something that's important enough that you're willing to push through your struggles, your fears and your problems to just do the work.Find out more about Oceans Melting Greenland.View and download OMG animations and graphics.Thank you, LauraOceans Melting Greenland is part of NASA Earth Expeditions, a six-month field research campaign to study regions of critical change around the world.This post originally appeared on NASA's Earth Right Now blog."

The group won the Record of The Year, Song of the Year and Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for ""Not Ready to Make Nice""; and Best Country Album and Album of the Year for ""Taking The Long Way"". REUTERS/Mike Blake (UNITED STATES)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3d839250000360038c91a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dixie Chicks are down to Earth honest and talented musicians who are not afraid to speak their minds. They spoke the truth in 2003 about the misguided directive by our former president to enter the never ending war in Iraq for nothing more than a lie and perhaps for some profit that the common Americans will never benefit from. How many young soldiers had to perish in this faraway land while we keep losing the battle for love and honesty on the home ground? Regardless of the backlash they faces then, Dixie Chicks are more grounded than ever and they still speak of love and courage and they make beautiful emotional music that still moves me. They sing about everyday men and women in America; contributors to the economical turn-wheel, to the creators of the great vastness of the kind behavior and acceptance, creators of the self-reliance and hard work and about the owners of their own destiny. They sing about the open spaces of the beautiful American lands and those who love to explore it and cherish it, not use it for greed and power. They sing about lonely soldiers who go away never to return, fighting for someone's ideals which are masked as fights for freedom; these young eighteen-year-old boys who've barely lived to end up perishing without being properly kissed or loved. Their music and their presence is a reminder for the immigrant in me why I loved America in the first place. They paint a picture of America that I knew before coming here in 1998. They describe my friends who I met in Bosnia, Americans volunteering at the Youth House, teaching young children who were growing up in the Bosnian war about chess and computers, about love and hope. Ted (I do not remember his last name) was a guitar playing hippie student who I had a crush on. He was an embodiment of the romantic free spirited American love stories that I dreamed about. Even though I don't know where he is now, I bet he is still kind, loving, forgiving and free spirited. These chicks stick to their views and do not apologize for their beliefs. This is the most important trait of America to me. Speak your mind even if your belief is not a popular one. It's very brave and very dangerous of Dixie Chicks to trudge through the sticky mud of ""patriotic bashing"" they received and are still receiving. However, their actions will be beneficial to the generations down the road who will recognize the contributions they are making to the American music. After ten years of departure of the band from the public eye (at least in the trio form that they are known for) they were back on the stage to perform for their loyal fans in Hartford's XFinity theater on June 18th, 2016 as a part of their worldwide tour. Their loyal fans were tailgating, wearing cowboy hats and boots as symbols of what Dixie Chicks once were (and still are to a degree). And then there was a crowd of older and younger fans that looked pretty conventional to me, and the two immigrants to the left of the stage. We sang the songs, visual stage and the screen were top notch. And there were the chicks, unapologetic, making fun of the current presidential race, giving props to the loss of Prince and then inviting us to love in the wake of the Orlando attacks. These girls have come long way from the bluegrass band from Texas. They are a true all American band now and proud of it. "

You seem to have confused the horrific actions of some who claim to practice Islam, with the actual teachings of the faith. In regards to the massacre of 49 people at a gay bar in Orlando you recently posted on your Facebook page, ""What Omar Mattan did was following the teaching of the Koran."" That's just not true. The Quran prohibits such heinous actions, as Islamic organizations and scholars have consistently proclaimed. I grew up Catholic but left the church for a variety of reasons. When I started my family, I studied a lot and chose to follow Islam. The things you are saying about Islam do not match what I've learned. You've said ""They (Muslims) hate the God of the Bible, and they hate those who follow Him"". But the Quran refers to Jews and Christians as ""People of the Book""; they are those who have received revelation from God; the same God that sent revelation to Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. (Peace be upon them all). The Quran says ""Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve"" 2:62 You've said ""If you're an American, they hate you whether you're a liberal or conservative."" However, there are over 3 million American Muslims; we are part of the fabric of this country. American values are in keeping with Islamic values; such as the idea that all men are created equal and freedom and justice for all. There are people around the world who are angered by America's foreign policies, but that doesn't mean they hate what our country was founded on. You've said ""They want you to be subject to Sharia law and the god they worship."" There are absolutely no instances of Muslims trying to institute Sharia law in America. The Quran says ""There is no compulsion in religion"". (2:256) You've said ""Women of the world, Islam wants to put you behind a veil of horror."" And ""Honor killings are a practice of Islam"". Although it is true there are women in majority Muslim countries that are treated appallingly, it is in spite of Islam, not because of it. People take things out of context in order to justify following their pre-Islamic barbaric customs. Islam actually granted women rights hundreds of years before they were granted in the West: such as the right to own property, to an education, to participate in public discourse, to choose their spouse, to get a divorce, and many others. You've said ""The god of Islam requires followers to die for him."" And ""The Koran teaches followers of Islam to kill and destroy nonbelievers."" That is not an accurate interpretation of what the Quran teaches. Yes, there are people who take Islamic teachings out of context to justify committing heinous acts for their own geo/political gains, but they don't represent Islam any more than the KKK represents the teachings of Christianity. What you are saying about Islam is dangerous for Muslims, America and the world. Your words fuel hate towards the other and become recruiting tools for terrorist organizations.We live in a country of diverse people with different ideologies and religions, yet we are founded on the principal of uniting for the common good, ""E Pluribus Unum"". We can't do that if we look at people who are different than we are with hate. I pray you will agree to meet with me so we can listen to each other. I think we can both agree that God is love and love conquers hate, let's use that as a starting point.

Get Everything You Can for FreeSo, let's talk a little bit about making your time more enjoyable on board the ship during ""Fun at Sea"" days.Yes, that's what Carnival Cruise lines calls the days you spend on the ship while traveling between ports.We got to experience 2 ""Fun at Sea"" days on this last cruise and let me tell you that you need to be ready for them.You have to remember there are 3000 other ""less than considerate"" passengers on the same ship as you, sharing the same amenities as you and trying to do the same things you are without falling over each other. This could be war !!Overall, these were fun and relaxing days but there is one critical thing YOU NEED TO PREPARE FOR..................TOP 10 CRAZY CRUISE TIPS FOR BABY BOOMERS#7 ""Save the Deck Chairs""Forget ""Save the Whales.""When you are on a luxury cruise ship and it's a ""Fun at Sea"" day your battle cry from the time you wake up should be ""Save the Deck Chairs.""That's Right !!!It's a battle. It's war. It's a life-size game of chess with 3000 players and winner takes all. Don't be bashful or afraid to make a sport of it. See how many you can save at once. See how long you can save them for. See how creative you can be in placing items on the chairs to persuade other passengers from not trying to take your ""saved"" chairs.Be aggressive, pugnacious, determined and industrious. Don't worry about drawing a little blood or breaking a few bones. All's fair in love and deck chairs.A day without a deck chair is like a day without sunshine. You wander aimlessly around the ship looking for a place to put your towel and flip flops. Where are you going to put your frosty cold adult beverage? Even scarier, how is a waiter going to find you to serve you a frosty cold adult beverage if you don't have a saved deck chair?I'm just kidding.For sanity's sake I am going to repeat that: I'm just kidding !!! No blood and no broken bones please.Here's how I came to understand the deck chair game. The first ""Fun at Sea"" day we got up late, ate a leisurely breakfast and then headed back to our cabin to change into our swimming/sunning attire for a restful day on deck laying in the sun reading and sipping on frosty cold adult beverages. Who knew what we would encounter when we first walked out into the pool area at 7AM that morning?Well, when we hit the main Lido deck it was a mad house.Every freaking lounger on the main deck as well as the next two decks up was already in some primitive state of being ""reserved"". By reserved, I mean there were towels and books and bags and hats and t shirts and coffee cups and debris and all kinds of personal belongings left on them.Many of them had the top parts folded forward.Some were tied together with towels and women's scarves. I observed endless ""shell-game"" schemes whereby uncaring groups of guests monopolized multiple deck chairs for their own use.These people (usually just one or two pre-appointed family members or friends) ""monopolized"" anywhere from 3 to 8 deck chairs, placed towels and personal crap on some of them, and moved the sun shades to be in the middle of the lot.They then moved the personal items on the deck chairs around and alternated lying amongst the different chairs in their ""campsite.""Two people with 6 to 8 deck chairs.It was quite a task.....and fun to watch.You would think that common courtesy should preclude cruise passengers from this type of behavior.Not so much.I remember when we first boarded the ship we saw signs near the pools and on the sides of the sun decks that stated that loungers could not be ""reserved"" and  ""if they were left unattended for over 40 minutes they were to be forfeited.""Well, were we innocent and naive?It appears that regular cruisers (aka ""Chair Hogs"") know that they can get away with getting up before the sunrise and throwing their crap on the most desirable loungers to save them.Then they go back to bed or go eat breakfast or whatever they wish knowing that they have squatter's rights on their loungers all freaking day. So, on this first day we wound up on the topmost deck at the back of the boat next to ""kiddie land"" where the wind blows strong and the waiters seldom tread. We still had a fantastic day in the sun but it would have been nice to be closer to the action.We're social animals you know.............So we had to learn quickly. On the second ""Fun at Sea"" day we were up at the crack of dawn to secure our loungers just like the rest of the shameless rabble. At 5AM we found 2 nice chairs right by the main pool and close to a bar. We placed our snifty ""Carnival Cruise Lines"" duffle bags on a the chairs.Hey,we may cheat like everyone else but at least we are loyal marketers for the ship we are on. We also tied red bandanas to the chairs and decorated them even further with towels, old magazines, water bottles and even a pair of my dirty socks.Hey, I'm a huge advocate of good manners and almost always try to exhibit behaviors that separate me from the animal kingdom but in this case you could tell it was eat or be eaten. Why fight it? Become part of the game I say !!! Besides, what else are you going to do on your ""Fun at Sea"" day? Hope to find a couple of open loungers at the back of the boat on the upper most deck and brave the wind and screaming children? Then, every hour or so, take the 10 minute trek down to the closest pool to cool off and then work yourself back into a dripping sweat returning to your chairs in the exiled part of the ship. Or, even worse, you can walk around the deck all day pretending you are looking for someone. I say fight for your right of relaxation and shout to the high seas ""Save the Deck Chairs!""Guess what?After some research upon returning home, I discovered that the Carnival Cruise Line as well as most major lines actually have a written policy to prevent this type of behavior.Hooray for them.Here's what I found on the website CruiseCritic.com.Carnival Rolls Out New ""Chair Hog"" Enforcement Policy Fleet-wideWritten by: Cruise NewsSeptember 1, 2012.  ""After testing a new deck chair policy aboard Carnival Breeze, Carnival has decided it is a success and will begin using the program on all ships. The new policy will have attendants patrolling the open decks, looking for deck chairs that are unoccupied but have the usual territorial markings of the infamous deck ""chair hogs"" - a pool towel, a paperback book, a pair of flip-flops, and similar items - tossed on the chairs so the miscreants can go on about their day and have a deck chair (or several in the case of some inconsiderate families) waiting for them when the time suits them. These chairs will have a sticker with the current time attached. As attendants patrol they will look for chairs that have been vacant for 40 minutes based on the sticker time. In these cases the personal items will be gathered up and secured at the pool attendant station.""For the well mannered traveller or the weak at heart that is really good news.......on paper.For us ""gamers"" that news just makes us more excited.While on our last cruise, we saw absolutely no indication of this policy being enforced nor did we see any ""attendants"" (or ""pool butlers"" as us high class well mannered travelers like to call them) actually watching how long chairs were being reserved. But, the fact there is actually a policy giving us reason to aggressively try to embarrass the ""chair hogs"" of the world is great news.Here's what I foresee us doing on future cruises to support the Carnival ""deck chair"" policy and civil obedience in general:1. Sporting watches - really big watches worn on both wrists so you can point to them when ""chair hogs"" leave their chairs to do something else.2. Handing out large day glow stickers with time stamps on them that the passengers can place on ""reserved"" chairs used to pinpoint ""chair hogs""3. Wearing T shirts on deck during ""Fun at Sea"" days that state : ""There's no place here for Chair Hogs.""With my advanced social skills, I could even see starting ""Barney Fife"" types of citizen patrols to police the pool deck areas.Everyone can be armed with water pistols.Like I said earlier, let's make a sport of it.Have fun and ""Save the Deck Chairs."""
