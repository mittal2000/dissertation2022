Why has the State Department not joined Europe's diplomats in publicly demanding her immediate release from jail?,2014-12-30,"BAKU, AZERBAIJAN - DECEMBER 28: Streets are lightened ahead of the new year in Baku, Azerbaijan on December 28, 2014. (Photo by Resul Rehimov/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e1863c000018010dfc88.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the American ambassador to oil-rich Azerbaijan opened a veterinary laboratory in the small town of Goygol earlier this year, the U.S. embassy put out a press release to commemorate the landmark event. When Azerbaijan's government detained the country's most prominent investigative journalist earlier this month, barely a whisper was heard from America's diplomats. Khadija Ismayilova, whose investigations into corruption cases involving the ruling family of the Caspian nation have won her an award for 'Courage in Journalism', has faced persecution by the authorities before, most notoriously when they tried to blackmail her by secretly filming her having sex and threatening to post the footage online. (She refused to back down, and the footage was promptly released onto the Internet.) In what a recent Washington Post editorial called ""the latest example of how Azerbaijan has become a bleak dystopia for human rights and democracy"", she was locked away on the Kafka-esque charge of ""incitement to commit suicide."" According to data released earlier this month by the Committee to Protect Journalists, Azerbaijan is the second-worst persecutor of journalists worldwide. On a per capita basis, it jails over twice as many journalists as Iran does, and 28 times as many as get locked away in China, leading one observer to dub the forthcoming 2015 European Games in Baku the ""Gulag Games'. The Council of Europe's Secretary General promptly called for her immediate release. A representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, an outfit generally known for couching any criticism in cautious diplo-speak, bluntly condemned the move as ""nothing but orchestrated intimidation, which is a part of the ongoing campaign aimed at silencing her free and critical voice."" Amnesty International denounced the charge as politically motivated, adding that:Dissenting voices in the country frequently face trumped-up criminal charges, assault, harassment, blackmail and other reprisals from the authorities and groups associated with them. Law enforcement officials regularly resort to torture and other ill-treatment of civil society activists, with impunity.While fellow journalists have launched a dedicated 'Free Khadija Ismayilova' campaign that is gaining strong traction on Twitter, America's diplomats have been keeping a conspicuously low profile. When I contacted the U.S. State Department asking about formal statements made in Ismayilova's defence, a press officer could only provide me with a single item, the transcript of the December 10th session of State's daily media briefing. On that occasion, a reporter asked about Ismayilova's case, and a State Department spokesperson explained that:""[W]e're very concerned by the arrest and pretrial detention of Azerbaijani journalist Khadija Ismayilova. We're deeply troubled by increased restrictions on civil society activities, including on journalists, in Azerbaijan. We are increasingly concerned that the government is not living up to its international human rights commitments and obligations. We urge the Government of Azerbaijan to respect the universal rights of its citizens and allow them to freely express their views. Azerbaijan will be best able to ensure its future stability and prosperity by allowing a more open society. We have, of course, raised the increased restrictions on civil society and freedom of press at multiple levels in both Washington and abroad with the Government of Azerbaijan officials. I don't have anything specific as it relates to this individual case.""One week later, Tom Malinowski, the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, also commented on Azerbaijan's tightening of the screws. During a brief interview, he spoke of ""very serious discussions at high levels"" and warned that the country's ""crackdown on civil society"" was jeopardizing its bilateral relationship with the United States. However, he did not specifically refer to Ismayilova's case.Why are America's diplomats not speaking out loudly and clearly on Khadija Ismayilova's behalf? Why has the State Department not joined Europe's diplomats in publicly demanding her immediate release from jail? One possible explanation is that many former U.S. diplomats now have close financial ties to Azerbaijan. For example, former ambassador to Azerbaijan Matthew Bryza today sits on the board of AzMeCo, an Azerbaijani company working in the oil and gas sector. He seems to have switched effortlessly from representing Washington's interests in Azerbaijan's capital Baku to representing Baku's interests in D.C. For example, following Azerbaijan's farcical presidential elections of 2013, Bryza -- identifying himself only as a former diplomat and Atlantic Council think tanker -- wrote in an op-ed that ""a reformist wind may be blowing"" and that ""positive changes are underway."" Challenged about his commercial ties in the petro-dictatorship famously lampooned as 'Absurdistan', Bryza told the Huffington Post that much of his time as ambassador had been spent on human rights issues, including ""trying to get journalists out of jail."" Apparently, he managed to do so without alienating his host government. In 2011, he was presented with the Leadership Award of a D.C.-based Azerbaijani lobby group, the US-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce (USACC), for ""exceptional leadership in promoting the development of bilateral relations between the United States and Azerbaijan."" Bryza is not the first U.S. ambassador to walk through the revolving door after his Baku posting. One of his predecessors, Stanley Escudero, did exactly the same thing, and is busily doing business in Baku to this day. And sharing a place with Bryza on USACC's diplomatic roll of honor is former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, who used to be co-director of the lobbying group. While still in office, Armitage described Azerbaijan's late dictator -- and father of the present dictator -- Heydar Aliyev as ""a man greater than the life itself"". It remains unclear to what extent the State Department's near silence on Khadija Ismayilova's detention is due to string-pulling behind the scenes by former diplomats who now have financial ties with Baku's regime and thus a vested interest in discouraging any rocking of the bilateral boat. Indeed, Azerbaijan's frequent junkets for top U.S. decision-makers might may play an even greater role. ""The direct money to politicians in trips and gifts matter more. Azerbaijan gives visiting VIP politicians diamond encrusted watches and other nice baubles which they don't report,"" commented an observer of the region who asked not to be named.As Khadija Ismayilova begins her third week in jail, her supporters will be watching closely to see whether any of the American politicos who took part in an especially controversial junket to Baku will now re-wrap their gifts and speak up on her behalf.Disclaimer: This blog was written in a private capacity, and exclusively reflects the author's own personal views.

After all, who doesn't want to show off six-pack abs in a new bikini Memorial Day Weekend?Like many Americans, I'd sign up for a gym membership in early January and stop going after a couple of weeks. I tried yoga for a few months in 2010, but I was mentally focusing too much on my to-do list to care about maintaining the downward dog position. Yup, I quit that, too. At 31, I've been at both ends of the scale. My pediatrician put me on a strict diet when I was 8 -- he forbade any processed and fried foods because my cholesterol was skyrocketing. During my anorexic teen years, my weight plummeted to around 60 pounds. My Cuban exile parents acknowledged their ignorance about my ""American disease,"" as they called it, and it paved the way for me to starve myself in secret. As a result, I spent most of 1997 -- including Easter and my 14th birthday -- in an eating disorder hospital in Northern New Jersey with a nasogastric tube pumping high-calorie supplements into my body because I wasn't gaining weight fast enough.  I was around 75 pounds when this photo was taken during Christmas 1996. My weight plummeted to around 60 pounds by the time I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and hospitalized three months later. Photo: Â©Magaly Pacheco-CusidoI finally recovered in 2000, but I haven't weighed myself for more than a decade because I'm fearful that seeing the number on the scale could trigger a bad relapse. Still, I usually can gauge if I'm maintaining a certain weight (I was 118 pounds back in 2004) based on my dress size, which typically fluctuates between a six and an eight.That changed in 2012 when I was diagnosed with asthma and had to take some steroid-based medications. The diagnosis coupled with the fact that I switched birth control pills caused me to swell two sizes. By the end of that year, I was at my heaviest, but it still wasn't enough for me to put down Cuban delicacies like pastelitos de guayaba y queso (Cuban guava pastries) or get up from the couch and go for a run.  At my heaviest, during the summer of 2013. Even size 12 clothes were fast becoming tight around my waist. At the end of 2014, I'm back down to my old size eight dresses and skirts. Photo courtesy of Carmen CusidoFast forward to early February 2014, when a good friend began a rigorous fitness boot camp program at JCF Health & Fitness in Jersey City, N.J. and encouraged me to attend with her. To say that fitness boot camp -- and prolonged physical activity in general -- was outside my comfort zone is an understatement, as I confessed in a LinkedIn blog a few months back.During my first one-hour session, I was sweating, sprinting, lifting weights and performing sit-ups and burpees (full body aerobic exercises where one begins in a standing position and then drops down to a squat position before jumping back up and clapping once at the end). By the end of the night, my face was ashen my stomach was gurgling and I was about to black out. It brought back uncomfortable memories from the late 1990s when I'd frequently faint after weekend-long fasts and spending several hours on a treadmill to burn off a bagel. But with some gentle nudging from my friend, I resolved to return for a second session and a third and soon after, I signed up for a year-long membership with JCF Health & Fitness.  Pictured on my 31st birthday in May 2014. After several months of fitness boot camp sessions I'm at my most confident and healthiest. Photo: Â©Magaly Pacheco-CusidoOur instructor Daris Wilson inspires us to push ourselves even when we're ready to give up. You can always do another burpee. You can ""dig deep"" and run fast when your body is screaming at you to slow down and jog. The intensity of boot camp works for a type-A personality like mine because there's no other option than to focus on the present (How many squat jacks do I have left? Let me save some of that energy for the high knees and butt kicks).  ""Get your mind right"" is one of Wilson's most-used phrases. He asks that we remove the obstacles we create in our minds and replace them with long-term goals. Two of the goals I accomplished in 2014 were to replace processed foods and carbohydrates with fresh vegetables and home-cooked meals. I also opted not to become obsessed with exercise (I've gone to no more than three sessions a week for the past 10 months). And there was another unexpected life accomplishment: I participated in the City Challenge Obstacle Race with several wonderful and strong women and men who are part of the JCF family.  Completing the City Challenge Obstacle Race in Jersey City, N.J. on May 17, 2014. Photo courtesy of Carmen CusidoEvery time I run a little faster, stay in an exercise a little longer or otherwise ""dig a little deeper,"" like Wilson likes to say, I'm becoming physically and emotionally stronger. I may not have the sick-pack abs yet, but I finally have confidence in my body and a desire to continue with my fitness goals. For folks who are unsure about how to start an exercise program in 2015, find a workout buddy and seek plenty of encouragement and guidance from friends. It's more than just about getting a bikini-ready body (though that's nice, too). It's about starting a lifelong commitment to health and fitness.---If you're struggling with an eating disorder, call the National Eating Disorder Association hotline at 1-800-931-2237."

Aiyana was killed while she slept on a couch by a Detroit police officer accused of handling his gun recklessly during a frantic search for a murder suspect in 2010. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae04581f00002e0122d426.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"2014 has been marked by massive protests decrying the failure of the justice system to charge officers for killing unarmed black men. And there have been urgent calls for the recognition of black humanity as well as an outpouring of profound sympathy for the mothers and families of those slain men. One wonders whether this amounts to an added layer of trauma for the mothers of murdered black daughters whose deaths don't rate high enough for the nation's outrage or the black community's collective mourning. Few seem to care about the mother of Aiyana Stanley-Jones, the 7-year-old Detroiter killed by white officer Joseph Weekley during a botched police raid on her home. So far attempts to punish Weekley have stalled. Meanwhile, the deceased's father has been sentenced to 40 years in prison on a murder charge. News footage of Charles Jones' sentencing shows Lyvonne Cargill, the mother of Je'Rean Blake, 17, reading a statement to the court about her suffering and loss. Even in the brief clip, her grief is palpable. But the pain of Dominika Stanley over the senseless loss of her baby girl, Aiyana, is also unimaginable. Hard to suffer, too, is the crushing weight of isolation and alienation as the world responds to tragedies like that of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown Jr., and Eric Garner to the exclusion of the loss of black women's and girls' lives. Indeed, we can't breathe. Also, we can't wait. Angela Helton, Rekia Boyd's mother, told a reporter that her child touched everyone she came into contact with: ""She loved everyone. My daughter, I'm going to miss her very much."" Boyd, 22, was killed by an off-duty Chicago police officer. She was unarmed. Her brother Martinez Sutton, too, was visibly bereft as he and his mother and a number of local supporters protested outside the officer's home in 2012. For Yvette Smith's identical twin sister, a part of her is gone. Yvonne Williams told reporters, ""I wish I could have that back, but I can't. I just want justice for her."" Bastrop County, Texas, Deputy Daniel Willis gunned down Smith, 47, in February 2014. Responding to a 911 call about a domestic dispute possibly involving a gun, when Smith opened the door, a deputy shot her in the lower abdomen and side, killing her. Initially the authorities suggested Smith didn't heed their orders and had a weapon. Both allegations were retracted. Willis, no longer a deputy, was indicted by a grand jury in June. Admittedly, the indictment is itself a small victory, but it's likely cold comfort for her loved ones.A scouring of local news sources is often the only way to learn about the cases, struggles, concern and grief of mothers of murdered black females. Roughly 20 percent of unarmed black victims of fatal police violence are women. That number is based on the NAACP Legal Defense Fund's tweeted list of unarmed blacks killed by police and also my own limited research, as I added a few cases, like that of Tanesha Anderson. Anderson, an African American, 37, died two months ago, shortly after Cleveland officers cuffed the unarmed woman and, according to her family members, slammed her to the pavement.The voices of black mothers, like those of their slain daughters, remain largely silenced. But they need to be heard because the potential threat of authorized, lethal violence is a reality for all in the black community. Moreover, hearing the voices of grieving mothers of slain daughters only strengthens the movement to halt state-sanctioned anti-black violence. It also continues the cause for making black lives matter by valuing the humanity of black women and the families and supporters who do actually mourn them.Images of Rekia Boyd's brother during the national day of protest on December 13, 2014, show him wearing a hoodie with a picture of his slain sister with these words: ""CPD Took My Life, But Not My Voice."" Let's make protecting black women's and girl's lives and voices a reality in 2015. Maybe if we do, we will lose fewer of them to violence."

Now, as you may recall, this past Halloween marked the Elsa-pocalypse as late-night hosts joked: ""Drink if you see an Elsa come to your door!"" (Raise your hand if you got tipsy handing out candy.) It was, indeed, Elsa, Elsa everywhere! In fact, half of my daughter's preschool class dressed up as Elsa. My daughter actually didn't dress up as Elsa this year, but a quick jaunt to Target and I found the iconic pale blue costume half-off. (Yeah!)Again, we were to attend not one but TWO Frozen-themed birthday parties in one weekend. Can you feel the intensity burning? A quick note about toddler/preschool birthday parties: if you have kids this age, you know what to expect. If not, well, it's pretty much chaos. CHAOS! Picture this: several Elsa's running around the backyard screaming ""Let it Go!"" Add a bouncy house, cupcakes, make-shift photo booth, face-painting, magic wands / swords -- and it's a supremely exciting, exhausting event.What I didn't expect was that each party would have a real-life Elsa appearance.(Wait... a what?)A. Real. Life. Elsa.(Yes, apparently it's a thing.) At the first party the real-life Elsa was in FULL character. I mean, she could have been straight out of a Disney park. My mom friend shared with me the following exchange when life-size Elsa appeared at the door.Real-life Elsa (perfectly braided wig, flowing dress with a loooong train): ""Good afternoon,"" she said whimsically. ""Thank you for inviting me to your palace!""My mom friend: ""Sure, come on in... the kids are out back. Can I get you anything?""Elsa: ""No thank you, your Majesty. I ate earlier in Arendelle.""My friend: ""Mmmm-kay, Got it. We're going full character. Okay, this way, Elsa.""Upon seeing real-life Elsa, the little girls naturally screamed and started asking a zillion questions -- to which ""Elsa"" had all the answers:""Because my magic powers only work in Arendelle,"" and ""Yes, there is no stronger bond than that of a sister!""When it was time to sing Happy Birthday, real-life Elsa turned to my mom friend and asked, ""Your Majesty, in which KEY should we sing?""Dumb-founded, my friend cracked a smile and nudged her hubby, asking him to choose. Hubby: ""Um, D? "" My friend: ""Sure, let's go with D.""Elsa: ""Excellent choice!"" Again, the first ""Elsa"" knocked it out of the park. I was a believer. She was COMMITTED -- I mean FULL ON character. Granted, I haven't been back to Disney as an adult (yet), but if this is indicative of how devoted they are to their personas, I can see how it warrants a two-hour wait. (Kinda.)The next day we were getting ready for our second Frozen-themed birthday party and we were having a difficult time getting motivated. (Well, maybe it was just me.) Right off the bat, we were running 30ish minutes late. Then, to make matters worst, as I finally buckled the kids into the car and started driving off... we heard a thump, thump, thump. (Please let that be a hubcap rolling off, I whispered). Nope. It was The Present. As in... The. Wrapped. Birthday. Present. (That apparently was still on the roof of my car.) Crap.Pulling a quick u-turn, I punched on my hazard lights, holding up the traffic behind me. Throwing open the door, I ran out in front of my car. Drivers behind me compassionately watched on, praying for what lie in the road. I bent down and scooped up the silver present, shoving it triumphantly in the air. I HAD SAVED the present! It hadn't been flattened! Momma had saved the day! And thaaaaaat's when I started laughing uncontrollably. Like doubled over, can't-catch-your-breath-side-ache-laughing. The absurdity of it all came crashing down. I felt relieved yet humiliated. Had I just stopped traffic to save a present??  Yup. Apparently so. ""Let it Go"" hummed distantly in my mind... And so we set off. When we finally arrived to party number two, I re-told the story to the host, who graciously laughed and comforted me with a ""Honey, we've all been there..."" side hug. Honestly, if you're going to 1) show up late, and 2) bring a present that looks like it's been gnawed by wild animals, it's best if it's for another 4-year-old's party, right? (After all, we've all been there before.)  So that's the story of my two back-to-back Frozen-themed birthday parties. Was the second real-life Elsa as fantastic as the first? Not really. Did it matter? No way. My daughter had a BLAST at both parties. She loved getting dressed up. She also TRULY believed that she had met real-life Elsa and fortunately never asked details like, ""Why doesn't Elsa remember me from yesterday?"" or ""How did she have time to go back to Arendelle?"" And so, dear readers: should you ever find yourself at back-to-back weekend birthday parties (and you will) and should they happen to be Frozen-themed (and they will)... be prepared to possibly see a life-size Elsa. And when you do... LET IT GO. (Oh, and make sure NOT to leave your present on top of your car.) xoxo-------------- Jennie Sutherland lives in Austin, Texas, with her husband and their two young daughters.
