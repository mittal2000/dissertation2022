Peterson, the 2012 NFL MVP, was suspended without pay for at least the remainder of the 2014 season on Nov. 18 for violations of the league's Personal Conduct Policy after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor charge of reckless assault for using a wooden switch to discipline his 4-year-old son.With support from the NFLPA, Peterson appealed that suspension, which indicated he could not be considered for reinstatement until April 2015. After the denial of his appeal by NFL-appointed arbiter Harold Henderson on Friday, Peterson told ESPN that he had considered real estate and a bid for the 2016 Olympics in the 200-meter and 400-meter events as fallback options.""I've considered retiring from the NFL,"" Peterson told ESPN. ""I still made $8 million dollars this year. I've thought about getting back into the real estate [business in Texas] I'm already in. That's something I've been interested in, something I'm involved in. I've thought about getting back into that. I've thought about going after the Olympics -- you only live once. It might be time for me to pursue that, as well. I love playing football, don't get me wrong, but this situation is deeper than that. For me, it's like, 'Why should I continue to be a part of an organization or a business that handles players the way they do? Making money off the field anyway, why not continue to pursue that (Olympic) dream and pursue other dreams and hang up the cleats?'""Peterson has been an elite NFL player since being drafted out of Oklahoma in 2007, but lining up alongside world-class sprinters would be a very different challenge for the 29-year-old. ""Peterson is delusional if he thinks he has any chance of being a track and field Olympian,"" wrote Michael David Smith of ProFootballTalk on Saturday. ""Yes, Peterson is very fast by the standards of a normal human being, and even by the standards of an NFL player. No, Peterson is nowhere near as fast as an Olympic sprinter. If Peterson is serious about trying to qualify for the Olympics, he’d have a better chance at a more specialized sport like the bobsled.""In a statement issued shortly after Peterson's appeal was denied, the NFLPA indicated that the fight over Peterson's suspension was not over:The NFLPA expected this outcome, given the hearing officer's relationship and financial ties to the NFL. The decision itself ignores the facts, the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement. This decision also represents the NFL's repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players. Our union is considering immediate legal remedies.Citing an unnamed person with direct knowledge of the situation, the Associated Press reported that Peterson will continue his fight to return to football by filing a complaint against the NFL in federal court as early as Monday. Peterson participated in the Vikings' opening game of the 2014 season before being indicted in the child injury case on Sept. 12. The Vikings then placed him on the Exempt/Commissioner’s Permission list on Sept. 17, barring him from team activities until his legal proceedings were resolved."

The situation was looking bleak in the area of Luhansk, where the government and the pro-Russian rebels were at a standoff. The UN reports, Within Luhansk oblast, reports from NGOs continue to identify food needs within institutions-especially for the disabled and other long-term patients. To date, food supplies have been scarce, and replenishments are unreliable from the already-stretched local community.Both government forces and the rebels were letting the convoy go through. But there was another obstacle close to their destination, a partially collapsed bridge. It was another casualty of war. Trucks could not pass. In the snow, aid workers, civilians and hospital staff carried the goods by hand across the broken bridge. Noelle Wright of IRD reports the unloading of supplies took 6 hours. But these were supplies that were desperately needed. Wright says, ""Patients were starving and there was an urgent need for heaters, warm clothing, blankets, and hygiene items."" This is what war is. Its cruelty goes beyond the battlefield and into communities. Even the young, the sick and the disabled feel the pain. Often it's through the scarcity of basic goods. War means hunger and cold. With Ukraine's conflict, close to a million people have been forced from their homes. Some have fled into neighboring countries. Many others are still within the conflict zones. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization says that food reserves are pretty much gone from these parts of the Eastern Ukraine. This is a region that been under siege for so long, they do not have anything left to fall back on. Aid agencies like the WFP have been called into the Ukraine for the first time in their history. WFP will try to feed 120,000 war victims over the next 6 months. The UN food agency is already providing food vouchers to displaced persons. This allows people, who have little or no money, to buy food from shops in the host community. This also helps the shop owners, who are also reeling the from the economic tragedy of war. But if the war in Ukraine does not end soon, many more will need food and other aid. WFP is already stretched to the limit feeding victims of the wars in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. They are short on funding for their Ukraine mission. More fighting will not resolve anything in the Ukraine. It could though lead to famine, if there is an escalation of fighting. We have seen this in Syria, where people have died not just from shelling, but also from malnutrition during the almost four years of civil war. If a peace agreement and withdrawal of military forces could be reached in Ukraine, reconstruction could begin. People's livelihoods and homes could be rebuilt with enough help. The Ukraine can still be saved. Or it could plunge into chaos. That is the choice leaders from both sides will make in the coming days, peace or war and hunger."

Professional athletes have worn ""I Can't Breathe"" messages in protest of a grand jury ruling not to indict an officer in the death of a New York man. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7764224000050005706b8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last Saturday, during the Chicago Bulls' pregame warmup against the steaming-hot Golden State Warriors, Derrick Rose wore a T-shirt displaying the words ""I Can't Breathe."" It was a reference to the recent non-indictment of a NYPD police officer in the choking death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, in Staten Island. Garner's last words were ""I can't breathe.""""That night we talked about how we supported [Rose],"" teammate Tim Flowers told The New York Times. Rose and Flowers were childhood friends who grew up together on the South Side of Chicago. Flowers added that ""wearing the shirt was an important thing to do,"" calling it ""a responsibility."" Rose's effort to bring awareness to the ongoing issue of unarmed black men dying at the hands of police officers trickled down to the rest of the league, with many players following suit over subsequent nights. Even Kobe Bryant, who is often ridiculed for not publicly stating his opinions on major issues, partook in the demonstration along with some of his Lakers teammates. But this is now LeBron James' league, and there isn't a name that permeates our sports experience like his does. Both James and Kyrie Irving also decided to make a statement, wearing ""I Can't Breathe"" T-shirts over their jerseys prior to their conference matchup against the Brooklyn Nets. After the game James was asked his reason for wearing the T-shirt, and he responded, ""It was a message to the family. That I'm sorry for their loss, sorry to his wife. That's what it's about."" He went on to say, ""I think everybody else gets caught up in everything else besides who's really feeling it, and that's the family. That's what it's about.""Those statements aren't easy to hear. For once, LeBron James -- the anti-Michael Jordan in every way, no matter how much we try to compare the two -- sounded very Jordan-esque. It appears that James was more interested in playing it safe, unwilling to ruffle the feathers of his corporate sponsors and brands.By wearing the shirt he was making a statement just like his signature ""tomahawk"" dunk. However, his post-game press conference offered a different sound byte -- echoing his 2011 NBA Finals appearance. He was fading into the corner, scared to bring out the brute presence and talent he casts on his opponents on the court. He backtracked, only looking at the killings of unarmed black men from a surface-level perspective. One can't wave the baton of injustice and represent the voice of the unheard yet retract his or her true sentiments when under judgment and pressure from others. James knows that by wearing the shirt, he was carrying the weight of a culture and a community that is systemically treated as inferior through the education system and the prison-industrial complex. To James' credit, he has been very vocal on a number of social issues, most notably on the Trayvon Martin killing when he and his then-teammates posed for a photo with their hoodies covering their heads. He is widely admired in is hometown of Akron, Ohio, as a person who constantly gives back to his community and leads by example. However, in this particular instance James dodged. Toward the end of his post-game press conference, one of the reporters asked James if there was a larger message, beyond what he'd just said, that should be considered. Sounding almost frustrated, James responded, ""How much larger can it be than to just pay respects to the family?"" LeBron James usually expresses his opinions on social issues, particularly those dealing with his own community, a little bit better. But when it comes to the topic of Eric Garner, I hope he will revisit his perspective."

The execution of black men and forgotten black women by white police officers, and the failure of justice first reemerging in Ferguson and now in New York City, have poured salt into the festering wound of systemic racism that has marred America's history.They have also been painful for me to watch as an Indian-American immigrant who was brought to this country as a child. This is now my adopted country. Although I was not born here, I found my voice here, found the music of my childhood here, and fell in love here. America is now home in ways that India can never be.And yet, I cannot be at home in this nation. How can I, in a land where my white brethren routinely kill my black brothers and sisters? Watching this bloodletting compels me to ask what are the obligations of those who are neither black nor white in this fratricidal country? Should we stay out of the fray, mindful of the marginality that comes to many of us because of our status as immigrants?As a Christian, I am guided by the prophet Jeremiah's words to Judah's exiles in Babylon: ""Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon ... Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.""If God calls an exilic people to work for the well being of their captors, then I too am bound to work for the welfare of this land. But how can this country be well so long as this centuries old racial divide violates the American body politic? Those of us of other hues must make labor with African Americans in order to free America from its captivity to white supremacy.This country has been largely kind to South Asians in ways that it has never been to its black citizens. African Americans have been enslaved, tortured, lynched and now criminalized, victimized by the New Jim Crow prison-industrial complex, and shot dead by police at 21 times the rate that whites are.After 9/11, Muslim communities came under suspicion and have been subjected to aggressive policing. After 9/11, Sikhs have been violated by hate crimes and even by mass murder as in the case of the Oak Creek Gurdwara shooting. The reach of white supremacy is long, and South Asians too have felt its sting.But there can be no question of symmetry; any suggestion of equivalence between the sufferings of South Asians and African Americans would be invidious. After all, agents of the state routinely execute African Americans whereas Sikh Americans have been killed by isolated white supremacists.Over recent years, I have watched as some have held up the success of the Indian American community to say that the United States is a land of opportunity in which anyone, regardless of race, can make it. The point of this discourse is explicit: see, South Asians have made it here so blacks have only themselves to blame for their own predicament.When South Asians like Dinesh D'Sousa speak in this fashion, they accept the status of ""honorary white"" and its attendant privileges; this status is offered on the condition that we keep silent about race and accept our compliant role as a ""model minority."" Some of the most successful members of the Indian community have accepted this devil's bargain -Governors Bobby Jindal and Nikki Haley, for example - and have been handsomely rewarded. The best that Governor Jindal can spout after Ferguson is the stale and deadly rhetoric of color-blindness and victim blaming:""A young man is dead - this situation is truly a tragedy and our hearts go out to his family ... Some have used this as an excuse for lawlessness, arson and destroying property, but that is not the answer ... I do not care what pigmentation anyone's skin is. Justice is color blind, God is color blind, and I believe we all should be color blind.""To talk about God's color-blindness and his in a country that kills according to color is an exercise in complicity.South Asians of conscience have a special obligation to speak out when we see uniformed officers snuff out black lives without consequence. Our histories are interlinked because African-Americans and Indians have fought together to forge a global nonviolent struggle to liberate those that W.E.B. Du Bois called the ""darker races of the earth.""The pain of the African-American community should bring South Asians of conscience to grief, frustration and rage, not least because we know we are in this country because our black brothers and sisters marched, fought and died to make this country a more just and inclusive nation. The Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, and the Immigration and Nationality Act passed in 1965. The latter Act struck down race-based immigration quotas that prevented Asians from entering the United States. Without the work of Rosa Parks, Bayard Rustin, James Lawson, Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker and Martin Luther King, Jr., without Montgomery and Selma, our communities of color would not be here. The struggles that made 1964 possible also made 1965 possible.The Civil Rights Movement was itself the fruit of the shared spiritual yearnings of African-Americans and Indians. Therefore, South Asian immigrants are under historical, moral and spiritual obligations to refuse offers of white privilege and join in solidarity with African-Americans. We must remember the long conversation between W.E.B. Du Bois, Benjamin Mays, Howard and Sue Bailey Thurman, Mordecai Johnson and B.R. Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi that sought to bind together our peoples in a common struggle for justice in India and the United States.Next semester, Cornel West and I will co-teach a course on Gandhi and King at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. The course will explore the transmission of ideas and energies and the long enduring bond between the United States and India, between African Americans and Indians. That connection includes what Gandhi learned from American abolitionists and Quakers through Tolstoy, who learned about the promise of nonviolence in part by a close study of the American scene.When an African American delegation led by Howard Thurman and his wife Sue Baily Thurman visited Gandhi, Gandhi famously and prophetically said to Dr. Thurman, ""It may be through the Negroes that the unadulterated message of nonviolence will be delivered to the world."" We seek by our work to advance Gandhi's hope.We are also committed to this course because we want to learn again with our courageous, justice-seeking students about the transformative power of radical and disruptive nonviolent resistance, a power that young black leaders are demonstrating again in the streets of Ferguson. We believe strongly that South Asian Americans and African-Americans must bind ourselves together to bring the promise of nonviolent resistance to bear on the work of healing the American soul of the cancer of racism.This piece was originally published here.

(AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e0c0200000f90101d62c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Early Friday evening Sen. Elizabeth Warren took to the Senate floor and gave a plain-spoken, barn-burning speech that could make history and put her into serious contention to be the next President of the United States.There are only a handful of political speeches that have such historic impact. Barack Obama's keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention comes readily to mind. It's what catapulted an obscure Illinois state Senator into the national limelight and put him on the path to becoming President.Warren's Senate speech was different, but just as electrifying.Obama's rhetoric was lofty, high-minded, and general, with a feel-good unifying message that there's no blue America or red America but only the United States of America.Warren's rhetoric is more down to earth, substantive, and frankly, angrier, unafraid of calling out by name the institutions--the big banks and Citigroup in particular--which tanked the economy, cost millions of Americans their jobs and homes, were bailed out with half a trillion dollars of taxpayer money, and then used their fortunes to buy Congress and make it more likely they'll be bailed out again. Moreover, she was unafraid to take on the President of her own party, and the numerous members of his administration drawn from Citigroup and other big banks through the endless revolving door between Washington and Wall Street.Here's the heart of Warren's speech:Democrats don't like Wall Street bailouts. Republicans don't like Wall Street bailouts. The American people are disgusted by Wall Street bailoutsPlease take less than 10 minutes of your time to watch the speech below. Like Obama's 2004 Convention speech, it was an historic speech, a potentially game changing speech. It catapulted Warren from a potential nuisance to Hillary Clinton's coronation as the Democratic nominee to someone who could foreseeably win the nomination and even the Presidency.It transformed the conventional wisdom about American politics that the main divide is between left, right, and center, when it is really between pro-corporate and anti-corporate. Her declaration that neither Democrats nor Republicans (meaning the voters, not the Washington politicians) don't like bank bailouts rings loud and true. Tea party supporters don't like bailouts and crony capitalism any more that progressives do.The conventional wisdom is that to win white working and middle class voters, politicians need to move towards the center, meaning towards a more corporate approach. But in a world of growing inequality, stagnating wages, and a fading belief that with hard work your children can have a better life than you had, that may no longer be true. Hillary Clinton represents the old politics of the status quo and accommodation to Wall Street's power. Her husband's Treasury Secretary was former Goldman Sachs exec Robert Rubin. After leading Pres. Clinton's effort to dismantle the half-century old Glass-Steagel prohibition on government-insured commercial banks engaging in risky speculative bets which enabled the creation of financial megaliths like Citigroup, he went on to earn $126 million as a senior executive for Citigroup and brokered Citigroup's ½ Trillion Dollar bailout. His protégé, Timothy Geithner became Barack Obama's Treasury Secretary where he opposed breaking up the big banks who had cratered the economy.Elizabeth Warren represents a new politics in which, by challenging the power of the oligarchy, she has the potential of reclaiming the white working class for Democrats and uniting them with the coalition of professionals, single women, gays and minorities who elected Obama. She is the first major national politician in decades who is willing to openly challenge the power of the Wall Street oligarchy, in the manner of Franklin Delano Roosevelt who declared, ""They are unanimous in their hate for me -- and I welcome their hatred.""With the increasingly dominant power of big money in politics, could Warren defeat Clinton, Inc. and then go on to defeat what is likely to be the near unanimous support of the Wall Street and corporate elite for her Republican opponent? It's hard to say. But the nation is in too much trouble to settle for a Democratic or Republican candidate of the corporatist status quo. If there's any hope, it's that once in a while the power of organized people can defeat the power of organized money. Elizabeth Warren represents that hope and it's the only thing worth hoping for.Watch Warren's 9:43 second speech below. If you're fed up with the power of Wall Street and the big banks, it will inspire you. And even if you aren't, watch it for its importance as a model of historically transformative political rhetoric."

China consistently reminds its people of the 1937 massacre in which it says Japanese troops killed 300,000 people in its then capital.A postwar Allied tribunal put the death toll at 142,000, but some conservative Japanese politicians and scholars deny a massacre took place at all.Ties had deteriorated sharply over the past year following Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine honoring war criminals among Japan's war dead.

Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) told The New York Times that the annual trip is a sanctuary for the president, who spent most of his childhood in Hawaii. “One of the reasons that the president, I think, likes it here is that he can have a sense of normalcy, even within his security bubble,” Schatz said last year. “He can still feel, perhaps, like he did when he was a teenager, just for a few moments at a time.”Last year, the only holiday surprise from the Obama family came when the president and his daughters returned to D.C. after two weeks, and Michelle Obama stayed in Hawaii. At her husband's suggestion, the first lady went to Maui ahead of her 50th birthday to spend time on Oprah Winfrey's 17-acre estate."

Which will it be: a unified, determined opposition or junior partners to a more powerful GOP?The determined opposition was on display when Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) declared Wednesday that they would do whatever they could -- short of shutting down the government -- to strip a Wall Street giveaway from the so-called cromnibus bill.It reared up again Thursday when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) delivered an impassioned plea on the House floor to oppose the bill over provisions that chipped away at the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and campaign finance limits.Pelosi's stand nearly won, almost killing the cromnibus during a procedural vote. The handful of Democrats who had intended to let it go through changed their votes, and every Democrat backed their leader.""I'm giving you the leverage to do whatever you have to do,"" Pelosi later told her caucus in a closed-door meeting. ""We have enough votes to show them never to do this again.""But then came the matter of final passage of the bill, and Pelosi said her members should vote their consciences. For 57 House Democrats, their inner voices told them to take what they could get from House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and let the Republicans have their goodies, too.Some questioned the fate of Democrats in a GOP-controlled Congress if they were willing to cave now, while they still control the Senate. ""If you let them bully you on this, they're for sure going to bully you on immigration and they're for sure going to bully you on the Affordable Care Act,"" Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told HuffPost in an interview Friday. ""At what point do we say no?"" ""I don't want to speculate what's going to happen next year, but I think the American people want us to stand tall and oppose a right-wing Republican agenda, which is designed to protect the wealthy and the powerful,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with the Democrats. Sanders then called the anti-Dodd-Frank provisions ""disgusting"" and a ""disaster.""   Asked whether he was concerned about the precedent set by giving in, he said, ""Yes. How's that for a short answer?"" Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, feared the cromnibus was only the beginning.""I think the special interest groups, particularly the Wall Street banks, are salivating at the thought of the new Congress and want to park themselves under the mistletoe when it comes to this bill,"" Durbin told HuffPost. ""And I have real problems with it.""For many lawmakers, the inclusion of riders favoring big banks and wealthy donors was the first front in a brewing battle over the soul of the Democratic Party.Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) implored his colleagues to take a stand during the caucus meeting ahead of the vote, according to members in the room. His message: ""If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything."" Waters argued that the failure of Thursday's rebellion in the House is the perfect example of what happens when Democrats break ranks.""It's the old politics of fixing things around the edges so that you can feel better, rather than putting up a strong fight and getting ready for next year so that people understand that we're not going to stand for them to insert into certain bills all of the stuff they can't get legitimately,"" said Waters, who ran her own effort to whip up votes against the bill. ""It's a matter of our Congress getting stronger.""There are dangers in pursuing the purist path. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) led Republicans into a revolt against an earlier government spending bill unless it defunded Obamacare. When the plan went horribly awry, the freshman senator was subsequently marginalized.But in the current battle, Waters, Warren and their allies have neither asked for a ransom to fund the government nor said they were willing to trigger a government shutdown. If there's a ransom being demanded, it's the Dodd-Frank changes, which amount to another attempt by Republicans to extract concessions from Democrats in order to keep the government open. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), another vocal foe of rolling back Dodd-Frank, was visibly perturbed when a reporter asked if he was concerned about drawing comparisons to Cruz. ""Nobody's ever compared me to Ted Cruz. That's not really a concern, sorry,"" Brown said.Like many of his colleagues, Brown defined the cromnibus battle as a matter of principle. And he said it was up to President Barack Obama to be the standard-bearer of Democratic priorities as the party prepared to lose its Senate majority.""It means the president's going to engage. It means the president's going to stand strong and stop them from wholesale or piece-by-piece dismantling of Dodd-Frank,"" Brown said.But Obama appears to have other ideas. Looking ahead to two years with a hostile Congress, the president has shown a willingness to partner with Republicans if it means getting things done. The omnibus was no exception -- the White House relentlessly worked the phones on Thursday and even tasked White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough with going to the Hill to sell Democrats on the legislation.The White House tried Friday to downplay talk of a schism between the president and Democrats like Pelosi and Warren. ""It's the view of those of us here at the White House that this is a difference over tactics, not a difference over principle,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a press briefing. Not even all House progressives seem to think constantly manning the bulwarks is the right course. ""I think on issues like [gutting Dodd-Frank], yes, I think we can maintain that unity,"" said Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), one of the chief deputy whips in Pelosi's leadership operation. But he also hopes both sides can treat each other better than they have.""We'll see when we get back,"" Welch said. ""Obviously they've got the numbers, and my hope, my preference, for next year is that Republicans won't be arrogant in victory and Democrats won't be bitter in defeat. There's a lot of work we have to do."""

Washington Convention Center on October 25, 2014 in Washington, DC.

Back then, my community was deeply troubled by FBI harassment, the government's use of ""secret evidence"" to detain individuals, and profiling of Muslim or Arab-looking individuals at airports around the country.Working with then Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Bill Lann Lee, the Department of Justice convened a series of meetings, some chaired by Attorney General Janet Reno, others by Holder, that provided us with the opportunity to address each of these concerns. Holder was responsive. Subjective airport profiling diminished, meetings were organized between FBI field offices and leaders of the Arab American community, and, after a case-by-case review, most of the 23 Arabs who had been held on ""secret evidence"" were released.When he ran for president in 2000, George W. Bush tried to exploit lingering bitterness with profiling and ""secret evidence"" in an effort to court the Arab American vote in Michigan. Once elected, Bush proved to be a disappointment. These practices stayed in place and then, following the terror attacks on 9/11, Bush and his Attorney General, John Ashcroft, threw caution (and the Constitution) to the wind, unleashing an unprecedented assault on civil liberties. The Patriot Act gave law enforcement expanded authority, as did a series of executive actions that resulted in massive profiling campaigns in which thousands of individuals of Arab descent were targeted.Initially, there were round ups and deportations of over 1200 (we will never know the exact figure because after reaching 1200, the DOJ stopped releasing numbers). This was followed by a series of ""call ups"" in which recent arrivals from Arab and Muslim countries were ordered to report to immigration officials to be registered and questioned. This program was so poorly conceived, badly executed, and arbitrarily administered that, within the affected communities, panic was widespread. In the end, thousands were ordered deported -- in many cases despite the fact that they had complied with immigration requirements, were married with children, or were students in degree programs. Arbitrary use of airport profiling resurfaced, with individuals actually being ordered off of planes simply because they were ""Arab-looking"" and their presence had caused other passengers to feel uncomfortable.It was during this period that the DOJ under Ashcroft issued ""profiling guidelines,"" cynically claiming to ban the use of this practice but doing so with a national security loophole that provided justification for the continued use of profiling against Arabs and Muslims.Following those nightmare years of civil liberties violations at the hands of the Bush Administration, we were relieved when Constitutional lawyer Barack Obama was elected president. Obama promised a government that would be guided by transparency and accountability, due process, and respect for constitutionally protected rights. We were further heartened by the appointment of Eric Holder as Attorney General.From his earliest days in office, Holder indicated that changing the ""profiling guidelines"" was one of his priorities. Years dragged on with no action and just a few months ago, Holder met with a group of civil liberties advocates, telling us that this issue remained a personal priority, that he was close to a decision, and that he saw action on this matter as an important part of his legacy.This week, the new guidance was finally issued. It was more than a disappointment; it was an outrage. Instead of ending Ashcroft-era profiling, the new guidance opened new loopholes.Reading through the new guidelines, one detects a note of misdirection. It begins by declaring that ""Biased practices...are unfair, promote mistrust of law enforcement, and perpetuate negative and harmful stereotypes. Moreover--and vitally important--biased practices are ineffective...[and] simply not good law enforcement.""The new guidance then expands the characteristics that law enforcement cannot use for profiling in ""traditional law enforcement"" to include: race, ethnicity, gender, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity. It then immediately pivots, allowing law enforcement to ""consider"" these same characteristics to be used in cases of national security, immigration enforcement, or ""authorized intelligence activity"". Unlike the old guidance, the new guidance explicitly exempts ""interdiction activities in the vicinity of the border"" and ""protective, inspection, or screening activities.""Just look at this one example cited in the guidance that defines when profiling is permitted:A terrorist organization that is made up of members of a particular ethnicity sets off a bomb in a foreign country. There is no information that the organization is currently a threat to the United States. To gain intelligence on the evolving threat posed by the organization and to gain into its intentions regarding the US homeland and US interests, the FBI may properly consider ethnicity when developing sources with information that could assist the FBI in mitigating any potential threat from the organization.In other words, if you are Lebanese, Palestinian, Syrian, Iraqi, (I could go on, but you get the picture) you can be fair game for law enforcement.The guidance also explicitly allows for ""mapping"" -- that is creating community profiles of where persons of Arab descent live, shop, pray, and gather. This ""mapping"" program recalls and, therefore, legitimates the even more shocking practices instituted by the NYPD.As FBI Director Comey noted this week, the new guidance ""will have no effect"" on his agents' behavior. It might even be argued that they make it worse, not only because the new guidance is in some ways worse than the Ashcroft loopholes, but because they were issued by an Administration which we had hoped would make real change.Rereading the entire guidance, the only part with which I can agree is the opening line which makes it clear that profiling is bad law enforcement that wastes resources, destroys trust with important communities, and is, at best, ineffective.We have just been shocked by the report on torture which established that by engaging in this practice, the U.S. received no useful information that contributed to national security. The same can be said for profiling. The DOJ and DHS have been challenged to provide one example where the ""mapping,"" ""call ups"", or airport profiling either stopped a terror attack or yielded useful information that improved national security. They haven't answered, because they can't.As Senator Richard Durbin, a long-time critic of profiling, noted, ""The Justice Department pledged to right this wrong, but this new guidance falls short... I've pushed the Administration to put an end to racial profiling for over a decade, and after reviewing these new rules this fight will continue."" Follow @AAIUSA for more."

But little will change because the our governing class has no intention of ending the senseless War on Terror that makes such atrocities inevitable.Half of Washington claims to be ""Shocked! Shocked!"" by the revelations. The other half is asking, ""What did you think was going on?"" The latter have a point. That detainees were being subject to waterboarding, sleep deprivation and beatings has hardly been a secret to the world for the last ten years. The practice of rectal feeding was news to most of us, but not, apparently to the Justice Department prosecutors who closed down their investigation of the CIA in 2012, and say they found nothing new in the Senate Report. The Senate Committee itself had been briefed by the CIA starting in 2002. The Report claims that the Committee wasn't given the full details, e.g., they didn't know that waterboarding was meant to simulate drowning! Barack Obama tells us that these acts were ""contrary to who we are as a people."" But who we are as a people is what we do as a people -- and what we allow leaders to do in our behalf.In the wake of the report, politicians and pundits -- even some on the right -- tell us that we must make the CIA accountable. But the CIA is accountable; it does what it was established to do --- the secret dirty work. Not just torture. We apparently are a people appalled at waterboardings, but not assassinations or drone missiles that blow women and children to pieces because our state-of-the-art intelligence mistook a family wedding for a gathering of ISIS militants. Yes, some wars are justified. But the interminable US military intervention in the Middle East makes neither moral nor strategic sense. Rather than make us safer, it is a system for producing suicide bombers who hate America. So we turn to the CIA to protect us -- but please, most of us would really rather not hear the details.The president has already made clear he is not going to prosecute, or even fire, anyone for violating US and international laws against torture. Certainly, no one is going to demand an explanation from George W. Bush, who authorized it. The only person connected with the interrogation program charged with a crime was a CIA whistleblower now in prison after Obama's Justice Department prosecuted him for leaking classified information. Nor will the CIA's secret budget guesstimated at $15 billion be cut. Nor will there be a diminution of its expanded mandate from intelligence gatherer to clandestine para-military strike force. Nor is it likely that the US Congress will be any more diligent in its oversight than it has been.The result is predictable. Terms may be redefined, techniques modified and outsourcing done more carefully, but the torture of human beings will be resumed. After all, there's a war on, and people charged with ""winning"" it are expected to do whatever they think works. With impunity now established for those who ordered the torture and those who did the work, even Obama's ban on specific ""harsh methods"" will likely be overridden by a future president who has not promised it in his winning campaign. By frightening the electorate with the specter of another ""9/11"" the national security apparatus will continue to have public support for whatever they say has to be done. Despite the evidence that torture rarely ""works"" and is often counter productive, polls show Americans approve its use if there is any chance it could help prevent another 9/11 or Boston Marathon. That these attacks were a result of US intervention in the lives of societies we don't understand gets lost in the hysteria. As long as we are committed to this senseless War on Terror, the CIA will be asked by Presidents to do dark deeds. And to keep those deeds dark, so we can avoid facing up to ""what kind of people"" we are becoming."

The hardline Islamist insurgents run their own courts in parts of the country and consider the official judiciary to be corrupt.Heavily fortified Kabul has seen multiple attacks in recent weeks, including several on army buses and a suicide bomb that killed a German citizen in a French cultural center during a performance of a play that denounced suicide attacks.Fatalities and injuries among Afghan security forces and civilians peaked this year to the highest point since the U.S.-led war began in 2001, as foreign forces rapidly withdrew most of their troops from the interior of mountainous nation.About 5,000 Afghan police and soldiers have been killed, and more than 1,500 civilians were killed in the first half of the year. A rump of about 13,000 foreign soldiers will remain in Afghanistan next year, down from a peak of more than 130,000.Fighting has extended long beyond the traditional summer season, with the Afghan government also inflicting heavy casualties on the Taliban. The army and police say they killed more than 50 militants nationwide in the past 48 hours.The Taliban have been fighting a guerrilla war ever since their 5-year regime was toppled. They now have a strong presence in most of the provinces surrounding Kabul. BAGRAM BLASTJust outside the city and close to the U.S.-run Bagram airfield, the Taliban detonated a roadside bomb on Friday night, hitting a convoy of foreign troops and killing two soldiers.The blast left a 3 meter (10 feet)-long blackened fissure in the road, a Reuters witness said. Helicopters buzzed overhead on Saturday morning.""Two International Security Assistance Force service members died as a result of an enemy forces attack in eastern Afghanistan on Dec. 12, 2014,"" a coalition press release said on Saturday.The Bagram attack came two days after the United States closed a prison that held foreign detainees on the airfield, which is in Parwan province, the only province adjacent to the capital that is usually relatively peaceful.It also followed a NATO air strike on Thursday that killed five people in the same province. Afghan officials said the casualties were civilians. The coalition said it was investigating the allegations, but that they were identified from the air as militants before the ""precision"" strike.
