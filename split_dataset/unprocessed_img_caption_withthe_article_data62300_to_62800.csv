0,POLITICS,Jane Sanders Says Bernie Has Always 'Been On The Right Side' Of Immigration,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jane-sanders-bernie-undocumented-immigrants_us_56e5be4ce4b0b25c918243f8,"She said criticism from Clinton's camp ""has been consistently distorted.""",2016-03-13,"Jane Sanders, whose husband is Democratic presidential candidate and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), visited Arizona ahead of its primary.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jane Sanders, the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), said Sunday that opponents are distorting the facts when they say her husband came late to the issue of immigration. ""That's not true,"" she said in a phone interview from Phoenix. ""Everything that Congress has been involved in, he's been on the right side of the issue. And immigrants are dealing with the same kinds of economic difficulties that everybody has been dealing with."" She traveled to Arizona on Friday ahead of its March 22 Democratic primary, and on Monday plans to meet with undocumented families and visit the infamous tent city jail run by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who is ardently against unauthorized immigrants and has endorsed GOP front-runner Donald Trump.Immigration has become central to the 2016 primaries, both on the right, as Republicans fight over who will crack down hardest on the undocumented population, and on the left, where Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are battling over who is more pro-immigrant. The issue is especially important in Arizona, where polling has put Clinton in the lead. Latino voters make up nearly 22 percent of the electorate in Arizona -- more than in any state but New Mexico, Texas and California.Clinton and her supporters have argued that she is a longtime advocate for undocumented immigrants and that Sanders largely stayed out of the issue or even impeded progress -- including by voting against a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2007. He later voted for reform in 2013 and includes it as part of his platform. ""I think the criticism from the other side has been consistently distorted on every issue,"" Jane Sanders said. ""If I were to answer every time that they said 'Bernie wasn't there,' we would be spending all our time doing that.""She pointed out that Clinton said in 2014 that children coming to the U.S. from Central America ""should be sent back"" while Sanders was advocating for them to stay. (Clinton argues she was only saying asylum law should be followed.) Both candidates promised at a debate on Wednesday that they would not deport children or undocumented immigrants who were not criminals or security threats.Along with meetings related to immigration, Jane Sanders planned to visit Oak Flat -- Apache land that her husband is aiming to protect from mining interests -- later Sunday. On Saturday, she visited Native Americans on the Hopi Reservation and the Navajo Nation. She said she spoke with them about problems with access to health care, grocery stores and education.Sanders said she expects the campaign will do well in Arizona generally and with Latino and Native American voters, who she said were very interested ""in hearing about real solutions."" ""They take their responsibility as citizens very, very seriously,"" she said. ""And we really respect that, and are pleased that we had the opportunity to meet with various groups and actually have real discussions about how to improve the quality of life for the average person, instead of focusing on just the top one percent.""

Families and children clad in Trump gear munched on pizza and enjoyed ice cream, giving the venue somewhat of a carnival vibe. It was a far cry from Friday’s skirmishes, nor did it require U.S. Secret Service members to hurriedly encircle the candidate after a man rushed the stage, as occurred at a rally earlier in the day in Dayton.Still, the presidential hopeful’s nearly 40-minute-long speech was interrupted seven times by protesters, some of who shouted “Black Lives Matter,” the slogan protesting violence toward African Americans. Trump claimed they were organized by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who denied the allegation later in the day.""These are Bernie's people,"" Trump said, repeating the charge after each successive protester was led out of the room. “They have no voice. It’s a Bernie person. Hey, Bernie, get your people in line!”Trump further blamed the Chicago protesters for the violence that occurred Friday night, warning that the incident would only gin up his supporters to hand him a “resounding victory” in Tuesday’s primaries.""Yesterday in Chicago we had a little bit of a problem. We were not allowed to exercise our First Amendment rights,"" he said. ""It just makes all of our friends and supporters more angry.""""My people aren’t violent,” he added, to huge applause. “It’s these people that come in.”Friday’s violence prompted condemnations from Trump’s rivals, even those who have been hesitant to criticize the brash businessman in the past. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), whom Trump criticized heavily during Saturday’s rally, accused the real estate mogul of fostering a “toxic environment” at his events. A visibly disturbed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Saturday that Trump’s rhetoric reminded him of “third-world strongmen” and further seemed to back away from his vow to support the future GOP nominee, whoever he may be. And Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said that Trump's campaign “affirmatively encourages violence.”But the calls for civility fell on deaf ears at Trump’s rally in Cleveland. If anything, according to Trump's fans, the protesters had no business being there, and some even deserved a punch in the face.“Those people come to get punched,” said Ed Honeywill, a 60-year-old wearing Harley-Davidson gear who sells car stereos in Pittsburgh. “Those people come to object to what’s going on. We didn’t ask for them to come. We’re here having a meeting. And they want to come disrupt it? They deserve what they get. They brought that upon themselves when they walked in that door, that hell might break out. And it did. What did they think was going to happen?” Susan Dzomba, a resident of suburban Cleveland, said Friday’s incident nearly made her cancel her plans to attend Saturday’s rally. But, she said, another culprit was to blame.“People are nuts. The world is crazy,” she said. “I don’t think he’s out of control at all. If anything, I think the media’s out of control.”Other Trump supporters said they saw a more sinister -- if not outlandish -- scheme at the heart of Friday’s violence in Chicago.“That was all staged by the higher-ups in the Republican Party, because they’re afraid of Trump,” said Jeff Marshaus, 53. “You won’t get the top names coming out saying it, but they don’t want Trump.”Marshaus, who works as a truck driver in Cleveland, added, “Trump can’t control it. He’s just one person. It’s not like he’s saying go out and do this. We’re all individuals. He can’t control everybody.”After a week marked by violence on the campaign trail -- a black protester was punched in the face at a Trump rally in North Carolina on Wednesday -- Saturday’s event was something of a return to normalcy. But tensions were still high. At one point before Trump made his entrance on stage, a loudspeaker played a recording warning not to “harm or touch” protesters, drawing boos from supporters.Outside the exhibition hall, long after Trump had finished speaking, groups of attendees fiercely argued with anti-Trump protesters, many of whom carried signs reading “Dump Trump.” Police encircled the area on foot and horseback in case of skirmishes. Some Trump supporters shouted at black protesters, creating a particularly ugly scene.“Go back to Africa!” yelled one man dressed in camouflage clothing.Another man trailed the black protesters as they dispersed, taunting them with, “I like your hair! Nice weaves!""At one point Honeywill got in on the action, getting into the face of a young black college student.“Get off welfare!” he screamed, before adding, “Dogs!”A short distance away from the main group of quarreling supporters, two men angrily shouted at each other over whether America was turning into Nazi Germany.Elisabeth Weems, a black college student who demonstrated inside and outside the exhibition hall, described her experience.“It’s terrifying. I was really reluctant to go in because I wasn’t exactly sure, with the notoriety of Trump supporters in these rallies,” she said. “It’s almost the same feeling of an undercover black person walking into a Klu Klux Klan rally and feeling like you’re going to be exposed and feeling like you’re in this atmosphere of hatred and negativity.”Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Now weakened by the state polls, she must seek their backing again later this week to seal the deal.In Baden-Wuerttemberg in the southwest, a CDU stronghold for more than 50 years before turning to a Green-led coalition with the SPD in 2011 after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, the Greens came home first with 32.5 percent. The CDU took 27.5 percent, according to exit polls on the broadcaster ZDF.Even more damaging for the CDU was the result in Rhineland-Palatinate, the state of former chancellor Helmut Kohl.There, the CDU's Julia Kloeckner, who had positioned herself as a candidate to succeed Merkelone day, lost out to Social Democrat (SPD) incumbent state premier Malu Dreyer. The SPD won 37.5 percent of the vote to the CDU's 33 percent, the ZDF exit poll indicated.In Saxony-Anhalt, the CDU remained the biggest party on 30.5 percent, but the AfD grabbed 21.5 percent, even surpassing the SPD, Merkel's coalition partner in Berlin. It was the first time the AfD had become the second-biggest party in any regional state.Already represented in five of Germany's 16 regional parliaments, the anti-immigrant party campaigned on slogans such as ""Secure the borders"" and ""Stop the asylum chaos"".Turnout in all three states was much higher than in 2011, rising by 5.7 percentage points in Baden-Wuerttemberg, by 9.7 points in Rhineland-Palatinate, and by 11.8 points in Saxony-Anhalt.(Additional reporting by Joseph Nasr and Tina Bellon; Writing by Paul Carrel and Madeline Chambers; Editing by Kevin Liffey, Angus MacSwan and Peter Graff)"

""#SaveSyriasChildren like 5 years old Ayman* who loves playing football as much as Cristiano Junior,"" he wrote. As a Save the Children global artist ambassador, Ronaldo wanted to make sure attention remained on the Syrian civil war, which is entering its fifth year. “Cristiano Ronaldo understands how vulnerable children are at that age,” Save the Children President and CEO Carolyn Miles said in a statement.“With Ronaldo’s help, we can keep the focus on the children of the Syrian war, many of whom have known nothing but war their entire life.""The organization said Ayman (whose name was changed to protect his safety) was born before the civil war began and was affected so much by the conflict that he never spoke. ""He saw and heard things that no child should see, from armed men breaking down doors, to dead bodies lying in the street to sirens going off at all hours,"" Save the Children said. Now living in a refugee camp on the Jordan border, Ayman was eventually able to enroll in Little Hands, a Save the Children-supported kindergarten.""There, he began to speak -- through the help of a caring teacher, his supportive parents and a love of soccer that blossomed,"" the organization said. Ronaldo, who has been a global ambassador since 2012, has been using his star power to keep attention on Syrian children. After a Hungarian camerawoman was seen on video last September kicking and tripping up fleeing Syrian migrants as they fled a Hungarian holding camp, Ronaldo invited the father and son who had been tripped to a Real Madrid match.Before the match, Ronaldo's fellow Real Madrid teammates wore T-shirts reading ""professional football for the refugees.""""After five years of this conflict, we don’t want the world to forget the children,"" Miles said after Ronaldo's photo. ""They shouldn’t have to pay the price for the world’s inaction."""

(Read in your best Chris Crocker voice). The Kids' Choice Awards on Saturday night might have been an all-ages affair, but the aftermath on Twitter was decidedly PG-13. After Zendaya took home the award for favorite female TV star -- an orange blimp, mind you -- she found herself in something of a Twitter feud with actress Julie Klausner. The ""Difficult People"" star felt it was necessary to comment on the 19-year-old's appearance, and did so by referencing Giuliana Rancic's controversial remark last year about Zendaya smelling ""like patchouli oil."" The next morning, Zendaya responded to Klausner's tweets, informing the actress that she ""will write another paragraph to educate you as well,"" as she did last time around. Considering how ""Fashion Police"" basically imploded after the Rancic debacle, it might've been best to end the conversation there. But alas, Klausner doubled down on her stance, launching into a Twitter rant after tweets from Zendaya fans accused her of body shaming. Klausner wrote that she ""will never stop criticizing celebs who perpetuate dangerous beauty standards.""Read her tweets below. Considering Zendaya made sure to talk about the importance of positive programming for young people during her acceptance speech, this kind of attack seems pretty unwarranted. ""To all the parents out there, thank you for allowing me to be a role model for your children,"" she told the audience. ""I really, really do not take that for granted.""Watch her speech below. "

21,HEALTHY LIVING,6 Things Worry-Free People Do To Avoid Stress,"Kayla Matthews, ContributorHuffington Post blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/6-things-worry-free-people-do-to-avoid-stress_b_9375958.html,"There are plenty of other things you can do to become less of a worrier, but this is a good place to start. After all, the worst thing that can happen is you take some extra breaks, get in better shape and make your life a little easier.",2016-03-13,2016-03-03-1457025718-3555761-stressfreepeople.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-03-03-1457025718-3555761-stressfreepeople-thumb.jpg,"It might be amazing to think about, but not everyone is stressed all the time. Those people who aren't always stressed aren't necessarily peaceful monks either, but normal people with similar pressures and expectations that you and I have. So what's the difference between the stressed and the nonstressed?You could say that stress has become a badge of honor in today's society, and if you aren't stressed, you aren't busy enough, but that's probably not it. Really, these are just people who have figured out how to deal with their stress more effectively. The good news is that you can do it, too.Figure Out What Causes Your Stress and Find a Better Way to Handle ItYou don't always have control over what happens to you, but you can always control how you handle it. You can't avoid meetings at work, deadlines or the pressure that comes with a family, but you can change how you view these things.You can practice reframing those problem areas. Try thinking about how neat it could be to explain to your co-workers what you've been doing, or how wonderful it is that you have enough food for your family, even if the dishes pile up. The ability to reframe how you view certain situations can change a stressful event into a joyful one.Be MindfulThere's a difference between being mindful and being watchful. Anxious people tend to be watchful, waiting for something to go wrong. Mindful people are simply aware of what's going on, both externally and internally. More than that, though, they're focused on the present so they're less likely to get caught up in a chain of what ifs. Stay present and focused on what's going on around you, and you'll find there's less time to worry and more time to be happy. It takes practice though, so make sure to take time to do it.Make a Conscious Decision to Have More FunHaving fun can take some work. It's easy to sit on your couch and watch Netflix all day, but it's hard to save up the money to go skydiving on the weekend. Just because it's hard, though, doesn't mean it's impossible, or that it's not worth it.You don't have to go skydiving. You can join a local dodgeball team or find a garden to volunteer at. This isn't just fun, it also provides an opportunity to connect with other people. That lowers your stress hormones, which means if you get stressed, they won't already be built up in your system. This lowers your overall anxiety.Take Many MinibreaksSolid, long breaks aren't always possible, but a couple of five-minute breaks throughout the day are. Taking those moments gives you opportunities to breathe and reevaluate your mental state is important. It gives you a chance to consider how you're feeling and keep track of your stress levels. Try and avoid using technology for these breaks, since that's an extremely simulating activity, instead of a relaxing one.ExerciseThe benefits of exercise are far and beyond just slimming down. It does wonders for your mental state as well. This isn't just a ""Legally Blonde"" idea either, where endorphins make you happy - although they do. From a scientific point of view, regular exercise decreases your body's sympathetic nervous system reactivity. In layman's terms, it means your less likely to get stressed by unexpected occurrences, and can handle anything life throws at you.When you're starting an exercise routine, remember, no one enjoys the process of working out. It's supposed to be hard and sweaty. It's the feeling you get after working out that's addicting.Eat Well but Avoid Fad DietsDiets suck. They're restrictive and that tends to be their downfall. If you're never allowed to eat doughnuts, you usually want doughnuts. However, if you make conscious decisions to just eat better, you feel good about your choices. Plus, this seriously cuts down on feelings of deprivation and wanting to binge eat during a diet. If you want a piece of cake, wait five minutes. If you still want the cake in five minutes, have the cake!There are plenty of other things you can do to become less of a worrier, but this is a good place to start. After all, the worst thing that can happen is you take some extra breaks, get in better shape and make your life a little easier.This post originally appeared on Productivity Theory. "

(Photo by Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb936511f0000400225904e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""I'm a unifier,"" said Donald Trump, the odds-on favorite to be the Republican Party's nominee.This, coming from the man whom a simple Google search with his name yields countless stories that characterize him as quite the contrary. Commonly referred to as a divider, a bully, bombastic, someone who embraces scaremongering, is erratic, thin-skinned and a ticking-time bomb, I'm not sure it's conceivable that a statement from ""The Donald"" could be further from the truth.Now, in a perfect world, these descriptions would give credence to the reality that such a candidate was in no way electable to the local School Board -- let alone President of the United States.That's precisely the problem, because 2016 is anything but perfect, or even close to predictable.As it's been exhaustingly reported, political gravity and conventional wisdom simply just don't apply to Trump.Why? Nobody can yet answer such a question. In fact, since the inception of Trump's campaign back in June of 2015, it's been bewildering the brightest political minds in America.The unorthodox campaign that he is running comes at a time when American's are seemingly more frustrated with Washington and the status quo than nearly any other period in modern history.He's brilliantly capitalized on this deep anxiety people are feeling and has built a movement around it. This Trump coalition is comprised of a far-reaching spectrum of voters. It encompasses evangelical and Tea Party Republicans, moderates and die-hard conservatives, Reagan Democrats, young people, Independents and more. His movement also stretches across every corner of the U.S., from the west to the deep south, and from New England to the industrial midwest.The depth and breadth of Trump's appeal, both ideologically and geographically, should amplify and intensify the ringing of alarm bells for Democrats as the November election creeps closer by the day.Unlike the 2016 Democratic primary election, Trump's candidacy has led to soaring voter turnout, reflecting numbers that Democrats generated in 2008 with the historic battle royal between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.Bernie Sanders, who is competing against Clinton this time around, claims that he's constructing a ""political revolution"" to take on the establishment. The challenge for Sanders and Clinton alike, is that there's no evidence to prove that such a revolution, in terms of turnout, is being crystalized on the Democratic side this cycle. While it's true that Sanders has amassed tremendous support from young people and Independents, his numbers among these demographics far underperform those of Obama's from 2008. As for Clinton, she isn't breaking new ground by expanding the Democratic primary electorate. Instead, she's merely turning out traditional Democratic primary voters to run up the delegate score against Sanders in order to capture the nomination.This turnout dynamic, arguably due to an enthusiasm gap that differentiates Republicans from Democrats this primary season, is only one hurdle that Democrats face when gearing up for the general election.Another hot-button issue that cuts across party lines and which may play a pivotal role in determining who triumphs in the general election, is trade. At a time when so many American's are insecure about the economy, trade is a topic at the center of Trump's isolationist economic policy that helped propel him to a commanding victory in a rustbelt state like Michigan. It's a state where tens of thousands of jobs were shipped overseas due to international trade deals like NAFTA that were supported by President Bill Clinton. In much the same way as Trump, Bernie Sander's used the issue of free trade in Michigan as a wedge issue to separate himself from his opponent. The move helped Sanders secure himself a jaw-dropping, come-from-behind win in the state.Why will this issue matter? Because in a presumed Trump and Clinton general election matchup, this potent issue can potentially put historically blue and purple rustbelt states in jeopardy for Democrats. Yes, I'm talking about Michigan, but also states like Pennsylvania and Ohio as well.As we look further towards the general election, beyond issues like turnout and trade that may cause Democrats heartburn, today's polling data should also be a major point of concern.Rather than provide analysts with a sneak peak of what's likely to happen on election day with pinpoint and precision-like accuracy, polling this cycle has been all over the map.On the GOP side, in Iowa, Trump was poised to trounce Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Instead, he came in second and only one point ahead of Rubio. On the Democratic side, Nevada was supposed to be a dead-heat between Clinton and Sanders, yet Clinton pulled off a decisive 6-point win.After Iowa, countless pundits hypothesized that 'The Donald' would reach a ceiling of no more than 35% of the vote in any state. Since then, he's proven nearly every one of these polling predictions wrong. For Democrats, last week in Michigan most polls had Clinton up by roughly 20-points over Sanders. Then, in a shocking upset, the Vermont Senator prevailed, stunning everyone in the political universe, especially pollsters.All these points illustrate the fact that polling this cycle is enormously volatile.So when we look at last week's NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that found just 25% of all voters nationwide had a positive opinion of Trump, while a significant 64% viewed him negatively, we need to take it with a grain of salt.Democrats should do the same when examining head-to-head match-ups with Trump versus Clinton or against Sanders where both Democrats clobber the Republican frontrunner in almost every poll released to date.Whether it's the explosive, bizarre and feather ruffling nature of his unpredictable candidacy, the potency of his positions that can transcend party, or the fickleness of polling this cycle -- the evidence is clear: Democrats must take this megalomaniac named Donald Trump very seriously."

The far right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the big winner of the elections. But that is also the only really clear lesson so far. Why the AfD has won and, more directly related, at whose expense, will remain unclear until more detailed individual-level voter studies become available. In the first reports the emphasis is on the gains of the AfD and the losses of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of Chancellor Angela Merkel, seeing the rise of the anti-immigrant AfD as the backlash to her Willkommenkultur (welcome culture) toward the Syrian refugees. Yet, while it is true that the CDU lost in two of the three states, they only lost big in one. In fact, the three state elections seem to be at least as much guided by state politics as by federal politics.As a quick background to this new upstart in German politics, the AfD was founded by a group of mostly conservative economists in 2013. It was a soft Eurosceptic party, supporting European integration but opposing the Eurozone. The first election results were encouraging, including 4.7% in the 2013 federal elections (just under the 5% threshold) and 7.1% in the 2014 European elections. But like all parties to the right of the CDU before them, the AfD was soon 'infiltrated' by far right activists, including supporters of the Islamophobic street movement Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (Pegida). Internal pressures came to a blow at the party meeting in 2015, where conservative party leader Bernd Lücke was replaced by the far right Frauke Petry, who made the AfD practically into the party political representative of the broader Pegida movement (without having a formal partnership). In this first significant test for the new far right course the AfD achieved its biggest result in Saxony-Anhalt, the only state in the former East to contest elections this weekend. According to ARD predictions the far right party will win 24 percent! Interestingly, the CDU, which governs the state in a Grand Coalition with the center-left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), loses only modestly in Saxony-Anhalt (-2.8%). The big losers are the SPD (-11.3%) and the far left Die Linke (The Left), which loses a staggering 8.0% in opposition. The extreme right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) also seems to have lost much of its 4.6% of 2011.In the two western states the successes of the AfD are fairly similar, but the losers are strikingly different. The rich southern state of Baden-Württemberg presents the classic pattern: the far right AfD wins big (14.9%) at the expense of the center-right CDU (-12%) and the center-left SPD (-10.4%). However, Baden-Württemberg didn't have a Grand Coalition of CDU and SPD but a red-green coalition of SPD-Greens. And the Greens were the second biggest winners this weekend, becoming the biggest party with 30.5% (+6.3%).Finally, in Rhineland-Palatine the AfD won the least, though still 11.7%, and the main parties lost the least: opposition party CDU lost 3.2% and governmental party SPD won 1.1%! Here the Greens did pay the price for governing (with the SPD), losing two-thirds of its 2011 electorate and falling from 15.4% to 5.2% (-10.2%).In short, the three state elections were, first and foremost, state elections. While the across-the-board gains for the AfD are clearly a federal signal, it goes much too far to see these three elections as an anti-Merkel or anti-Willkommenskultur result. Moreover, these three elections don't make the AfD the fourth party in Germany. First of all, the AfD will undoubtedly have a hard time keeping its parliamentary factions together, as most far right parties in Germany. Second, the AfD is more generally heading for even stronger internal discord, as the new leadership of Frauke Petry has to walk a fine line between increased state pressure - emphasized by a new procedure to ban the NPD - on the one hand and increased pressure from extreme right forces on the other. Third, this is the height of the refugee crisis, with almost everyone in Germany (and Europe) criticizing Merkel. Next federal elections are still over a year away and it id doubtful, though not impossible, that the refugee crisis will continue to have such high salience in late 2017."

Here are some critical things to watch out for.Belittling. Sometimes it's necessary for bosses to deliver feedback about your performance that isn't easy to hear. But some of them give you the strong impression that they enjoy it. They don't just give you important feedback, they relish the act of putting you in your place--even more so if they have an audience. While you don't necessarily want a boss who can't deliver tough feedback, you definitely don't want to work for someone who enjoys criticizing and blaming. If that's the kind of boss you have, get out quickly, for the sake of your health.Temper tantrums. Like everyone else, bosses have bad days.

If you hear your boss yelling down the hall, and instead of thinking 'What in the world is going on?' you're thinking 'Here we go again,' then it's time to move on.Unreasonable expectations. Some bosses see their employees the same way that young children see their teachers--as having no identity outside of their work. They can't quite wrap their minds around the importance of family obligations, hobbies, or anything else outside of the office that doesn't serve them.

I still do, and I have my own series set at a fictional Michigan university. I usually got one and sometimes two boxes of books every month to sort through for my column. Time after time, I'd be captured by a book and then a smart character would do something really dumb. Like the chic woman investigating a murder who walked into a nasty dark alley in super-high heels. Of course ""fem jep"" (a woman in danger) is a trope of crime fiction, but the author was forcing a smart character to do something idiotic for the sake of the plot. Or all the people going down into dark cellars without flashlights even though serial killers were after them.The same thing happens in movies, over and over. I just rented The Gift. A couple has moved from Chicago to the West Coast and there's a good chance they're being stalked by the husband's high school buddy who seems weird. His nickname back then actually was ""Weirdo.""So the wife, played by Rebecca Hall, is cutting up a cucumber in her kitchen, all alone, and she hears a noise in her long narrow house which has lots of enormous windows perfect for spying. She puts down the knife and leaves the kitchen calling out ""Hello?"" Granted, she's previously had a nervous breakdown, but her thought processes are not scrambled now. And she's been a successful designer with her own business.For the sake of the plot, she's been made deliberately stupid and careless at this point, and while what happens next moves the story forward, it compromises the suspension of disbelief. I've seen this scene play out over and over in movie thrillers, and read it too: People hear noises in houses where they should be alone and they ask, ""Hello? Is anybody there?"" What the hell could they be expecting? FedEx?Given how attached everyone is to their smart phones, it's far more reasonable for the character to call 911 right away, which does also happen in films and ups the tension in a very different way.I've stopped reading books and have shut off movies were the characters were too dumb too often. Here, it wasn't totally egregious, so I kept watching.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has faulted Donald Trump for the disruption Friday night’s Chicago rally, denying that his campaign had organized the protest against it.Sanders issued a stinging rebuke on Saturday to the Republican presidential front-runner for noting that some of the protesters that disrupted Trump’s rally “represented Bernie, our communist friend.""The Democratic presidential candidate interpreted the remark as insinuating that he or his campaign had been directly involved in the protest.“As is the case virtually every day, Donald Trump is showing the American people that he is a pathological liar,” Sanders said.“Obviously, while I appreciate that we had supporters at Trump’s rally in Chicago, our campaign did not organize the protests.”Trump had said at a campaign stop in Dayton, Ohio, on Saturday that Sanders supporters were among the protesters at Friday's rally. It is unclear if he meant to suggest that Sanders had organized the protest.Chicago-based supporters of Sanders have, in fact, taken credit for playing an outsize role in the protests.But Sanders argued that Trump’s bigoted rhetoric is what inspired the massive protests in Chicago and smaller demonstrations at previous campaign events.“What caused the protests at Trump’s rally is a candidate that has promoted hatred and division against Latinos, Muslims, women, and people with disabilities, and his birther attacks against the legitimacy of President [Barack] Obama,” Sanders said.He also blamed Trump for acts of violence against protesters. “What caused the violence at Trump’s rally is a campaign whose words and actions have encouraged it on the part of his supporters,” Sanders added.Trump responded on Twitter early on Sunday morning, insisting that Sanders was lying and suggesting he would soon retaliate by sending his supporters to protest Sanders' campaign events.Sanders' Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton also condemned the unrest at the Trump rally in Chicago, though she did not mention the real estate mogul's name.“The divisive rhetoric we are seeing should be of grave concern to us all,” Clinton said in a statement. “We all have our differences, and we know many people across the country feel angry. We need to address that anger together.”“All of us, no matter what party we belong to or what views we hold, should not only say loudly and clearly that violence has no place in our politics, we should use our words and deeds to bring Americans together,” she added.The former Secretary of State pointed to the successful campaign to remove the confederate flag from the South Carolina statehouse in the wake of the massacre at a predominantly black church in Charleston, South Carolina, as a “model we strive for to overcome painful divisions in our country.”This story has been updated to include Donald Trump's tweet on Sunday morning."
32,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Wants To Bring Back The '90s Economy. Here's What She's Missing.,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-1990s-economy_us_56e1ee56e4b0860f99d8675d,It's all about the Federal Reserve.,2016-03-12,"Then-first lady Hillary Clinton in May 1998, a period of booming job growth.

Clinton hasn't said how she'll choose Federal Reserve Board governors or otherwise indicated how she would like the Fed to act.“You know, at the end of the '90s, we had 23 million new jobs. Incomes went up for everybody,” Clinton said at the Univision-sponsored Democratic debate this week in Miami. “We were talking earlier about what needs to be done for Latinos and African-Americans. Well, we were doing it by the end of the '90s. Median family income went up 17 percent. For minorities, it went up even more.”As Clinton accurately pointed out, the economy created more than 23 million jobs from 1993 through the end of 2000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- a period that spans Bill Clinton’s presidency.Widespread wage growth followed robust job creation as high demand for labor forced employers to raise pay to compete for workers. As a result, median household income rose nearly 15 percent in 1999 from its low point in 1993.Demand for labor was so high that the gains reached workers on the lower end of the earnings spectrum -- something that was virtually unheard of since the early 1970s, and has not been replicated since. As Clinton noted, the booming job market was especially beneficial to workers of color, particularly African-Americans.By 2000, black unemployment had fallen to 7.6 percent, the lowest rate in recorded history, according to an Economic Policy Institute analysis. The median wage for blacks rose even faster than for whites, propelling a higher percentage of African-Americans into the middle class than in any economic recovery since 1982.It's understandable why Hillary Clinton is pitching her presidency as a return to the halcyon 1990s.But Clinton neglects to mention that the economy cannot grow to the levels it reached in the 1990s if the Federal Reserve does not permit it.When the Fed raises the benchmark interest rate, it deliberately puts downward pressure on the job market to head off a rise in prices.In the late 1990s, Fed Chair Alan Greenspan repeatedly refused to raise the interest rate, which many economists say is what ultimately permitted the unemployment rate to dip below 4 percent in 2000.The mostly liberal economists who laud Greenspan for staying out of the way during that growth period argue that the Fed's restraint was a rare bright spot in a decades-long trend of the central bank unduly prioritizing inflation concerns over job creation.Hillary Clinton, however, hasn't said whether her aim to recreate the days of job growth and wage growth would influence who she appoints as Federal Reserve Board governors.The economy section of Clinton’s campaign website, subtitled “a plan to raise Americans’ incomes,” does not mention the Fed at all.A spokesman for Clinton’s presidential campaign did not respond to a request for comment on how the Fed fits into Clinton's economic agenda.The president has the power to appoint the seven Fed board governors, including the chair, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. The governors occupy the Fed’s 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, which is responsible for adjusting the key interest rate. Two governors' seats have remained empty in recent years as the Obama administration has struggled to get the Senate to confirm appointments.Some analysts have criticized the Obama administration for not pushing harder to fill the vacancies. The openings mean that the five seats reserved for the unelected presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks have more influence over monetary policy than they otherwise would.The Fed bank presidents tend to have close ties to the financial community, which has an interest in tamping down inflation. Four regional Fed presidents have worked for Goldman Sachs, for example, including William Dudley, who is currently on the FOMC. (Dudley, as president of the New York Fed, has a permanent seat on the FOMC, while other regional Fed presidents alternate serving one-year terms.)Josh Bivens, research and policy director of the Economic Policy Institute, said he would ""love"" for Clinton to speak out about prioritizing filling the two vacant seats on the Fed Board of Governors.""She could even talk about it in terms of the late 1990s,"" Bivens said. ""There are reasons to feel warmly about that period and a big part of that is the Fed did not take away the punch bowl too early.""Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, and co-author of the book Getting Back to Full Employment, lamented Clinton’s reticence on the topic.“If the Fed is not on board, they are going to have a hell of a time,” Baker said. “What are they are going to do if the Fed is raising interest rates?”Clinton has not weighed in on the Fed’s decision to raise its key interest rate in December.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Clinton’s rival in the Democratic presidential primary, condemned it, arguing that the Fed should wait until unemployment is below 4 percent.It was not an especially radical stance. Lawrence Summers, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, who nearly became Fed chairman in 2013, opposed the Fed rate hike on similar grounds.The Fed Up campaign, a coalition of grassroots groups mobilizing low-income workers to push for progressive Fed policies, emphasized the rate hike's disproportionate impact on African-Americans and Latinos.The endemic difference in employment opportunities for black people and white people of comparable education levels points to widespread racial discrimination in the job market. A Fed that keeps interest rates low -- erring on the side of full employment rather than inflation -- is essential, Fed Up and many economists argue, because when demand for workers grows to a certain level, employers can no longer afford to discriminate based on race.The other problem with using the late 1990s as an economic model is that the era’s jobs boom was driven in large part by an unsustainable stock market bubble. The Fed’s refusal to put on the brakes was nonetheless a good thing, according to many economists, because it reflected the right balance of job growth and inflation. The stock market bubble, they say, could have been avoided through other means, such as better regulation.But it does mean that the engine of growth cannot be recreated as easily as Clinton sometimes implies.The most ambitious piece of Clinton’s job creation plan is a five-year, $275 billion investment in infrastructure. Bivens called Clinton’s plan “pretty good, not small potatoes.” But he said he doubted it would be enough to counter the gap in demand for goods and services left over from the recession, and the depressing effect of forthcoming Fed interest rate hikes.Baker expressed a similar view. He also argued that reducing the U.S. trade deficit with countries like China by prioritizing their currency devaluation policies during trade negotiations would spur high-value job growth.Ultimately, Clinton may be able to benefit from Americans’ fond memories of a prosperous economy if she embraces the complexity of the 1990s.“I would love to see the late 1990s loom a lot larger in policy discussions -- both the upside and the downside,” Bivens said. “The upside is that it showed we can have full employment without inflation reaching dangerous levels. And the downside is that it showed we need a stronger foundation for economic growth.”"

Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) was giving a talk at a Federalist Society luncheon in Washington when protesters stood up and began chanting, ""Do your job!"" -- a reference to Republicans' refusal to consider a Supreme Court nominee from President Barack Obama. It wasn't long before organizers started ripping the signs out of their hands as they chanted. One attendee shouted that the protesters were ""fascists"" and, a moment later, yelled, ""Beat 'em up!""Layla Zaidane of Generation Progress, the left-leaning group that organized the protest, said the reaction from some of the attendees was “shocking.” “We knew what we were walking into, but the language, threats and aggressiveness were unexpected and disappointing,” said Zaidane. “We were called Nazis and fascists just for speaking up and asking the senator to do his job.”At one point, someone who appeared to be a luncheon organizer tried to yank a sign out of a protester’s hands, but she pulled it back and it tore. She kept chanting and the organizer walked away.A request for comment from The Federalist Society was not immediately returned. Hatch spokesman J.P. Freire did not immediately respond to a request for comment, though he tweeted about the clash.When it was all over, Hatch sat down and, for kicks, signed some of the protesters’ abandoned signs.Below is a longer clip of the protest.

Trump said on Twitter.The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of speech and assembly. The Chicago rally came ahead of five primary elections on Tuesday, including contests in Ohio and Illinois.Trump rival, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, cast wide blame for what he called ""third world"" images out of Chicago, from the protesters to the media, with his harshest criticism directed at Trump.""This is a frightening, grotesque, and disturbing development in American politics,"" he said, speaking to reporters before a rally in Pinellas County, Florida.John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio who is also running for president, told journalists before a campaign event in Cincinnati on Saturday that Trump has created a ""toxic environment.""""And that toxic environment has allowed his supporters, and those who seek confrontation, to come together in violence,"" he said.

Thousands are stranded in the Idomeni refugee camp on the Greek Macedonia border, pictured above, after several countries shut their borders. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e338c4150000ad000b1c50.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. This week, we speak with The Guardian's migration correspondent Patrick Kingsley about the EU-Turkey plan on the refugee crisis.As borders across Europe slammed shut to migrants and refugees this week, European Union leaders reached a provisional deal with Turkey to stem the flow of people fleeing to the continent.The proposal outlined on Monday in the Belgian capital Brussels says all migrants who travel from Turkey to Greece will be returned to the Turkish nation. However, for every person sent back to Syria, one Syrian already in Turkey would be resettled in a European country. In exchange, Turkey is seeking more aid to cope with their refugee crisis, visa-free travel for Turkish citizens to Europe and to speed up country's application to join the EU. Leaders intend to discuss the plan further next week.The plan immediately raised concerns across Europe. Filippo Grandi, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, said the blanket return of migrants to Turkey might not be legal under international law protecting refugees. Human rights group Amnesty International called the plan a ""death blow to the right to seek asylum.” Journalists facing a crackdown in Turkey worried the EU might be ""turning a blind eye"" to the country's human rights abuses to secure a deal on refugees.Meanwhile, the border closures have stranded thousands of migrants in Greece. Some say they have no other choice but to keep trying to reach a place of safety and dignity.The WorldPost spoke to Patrick Kingsley, The Guardian's first migration correspondent, about the proposed deal. His book The New Odyssey: The Story of Europe's Refugee Crisis includes reporting from 17 countries along the European migration trail last year. It will be published in May.Do you think the EU-Turkey plan will deter migrants and refugees from making the journey to Europe? If this plan goes ahead -- and that’s a big if -- it could act as a deterrent. The EU are saying that under the term of the plan, people arriving on the Greek islands from now on will not only be sent back to Turkey, but sent to the back of the queue for resettlement. However, it would be a deterrent only along that route [from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea.] There are many other routes that people can try. If the plan goes ahead, we can expect a rise in irregular migration towards Europe via other routes over the coming months, including via Bulgaria, Italy, Spain, perhaps even through the Black Sea towards Ukraine. The lesson we have learnt about migration over decades is that if you close one route, another opens up, and more and more people still come. For example, when it became difficult to get to Spain via the Canary Islands, people tried to reach Europe via Libya, and when Libya became hard, people came via Greece, and when Hungary’s fences closed, people went via Croatia. Would you expect some people to still try to come via the Aegean Sea, even if this plan was implemented?I think there will be a decrease in the numbers of people crossing, but that’s not hard given that the numbers are currently so high. I think we’ll see fewer and fewer families, who are the majority of the flow at the moment -- more than half are women and children. That will change because the routes will become more physically demanding and more expensive, making it harder for parents to pay for children to come. It will be harder for husbands to pay for their wives to come. I don’t think it’s going to end migration to Europe, however. Is the proposal to return all migrants arriving in Greece back to Turkey feasible?It’s going to require trust from the EU and Turkey. I’m skeptical that both sides are going to believe that the other is really going to uphold this deal, given the lack of trust in the past.It’s also very tough to send back such a high number of people. How are you going to return tens of thousands of people? How are you going to house them in the meantime? How are you going to deal with the legal challenges? There’s severe logistical challenges that have to be overcome. Is it legal to return migrants to Turkey en masse?I think it’s pretty clear it is illegal, because it goes against the U.N. convention on refugees, and against the EU’s own legislation. There’s also the overriding ethical point -- that these kind of international treaties were created in the aftermath of the Second World War, by quite enlightened statesmen who felt that no matter the administrative and financial cost, there are some values that are worth upholding, otherwise we end up back where we were in the 1930s. I think we have to think long and hard as a society about returning to those political nadirs. What does this proposal mean for non-Syrians, such as Afghans and Iraqis, seeking asylum in Europe?It makes things far worse for people who aren’t Syrian. Under the terms of this agreement, if you’re Syrian at least you still have the hope of being resettled in Europe. It says nothing about Iraqis and Afghans. It’s suggesting that if you come from any country other than Syria your reasons for claiming asylum are not as valid. Obviously that’s incorrect. People could be fleeing from Mosul in Iraq, or someone in Afghanistan who worked for the Americans is fleeing the Taliban as a result. We are saying these people are de facto less worthy of our help than people in Syria, and that’s clearly wrong.In practical terms, it will mean that they will create different routes in other places, creating a big problem six months to a year down the line. We may appear to have cleared up the situation in the Aegean Sea, but then there will be another hot spot opening up somewhere else. Does that increase the dangers of the journey, as the route shifts again?It drives more people towards smugglers, which puts them more at risk. The reason why we had this semi-formalized, almost humanitarian corridor through the Balkans -- until this week -- was in the aftermath of when 71 people were found dead, putrefying in the back of a truck on an Austrian motorway. We can expect more of these kinds of things if you close down semi-legal route into Europe. Did Turkey get too much from the EU in return, as the current proposal stands?I don’t think what they have been offered is a massive deal for Turkey. They have been offered some money, which is helpful when you’re trying to deal with a refugee crisis of half a million people, but its not the be-all and end-all. They have a promise of some kind of new visa regime -- which is going to be welcome in Turkey, but it’s not going to help them cope with so many refugees, and its not even clear if Europe is really going to deliver on this.What would really help Turkey would be if there was a large scale resettlement program bringing refugees directly from Turkey to Europe and the rest of the Western world. I’ve heard lots of talk about that, and it may yet happen. But that’s not part of this deal. The proposal may not even increase resettlement. It’s been called ""one-in one-out"", but it’s really none-in none-out, because if it succeeds in deterring Syrians from fleeing to Greece, there will be no obligation to resettle the Syrians in Turkey.It seems like the failure to provide legal routes for resettlement was the ""original sin"" of the migrant crisis.The original sin of the crisis was the Syrian war. But it is not widely understood how much the absence of a mass resettlement scheme played a role in creating a crisis of this scale. Because Western countries did not set up a significant resettlement scheme within five years of the war starting, this created an environment in which it was inevitable that large numbers of people would eventually make their way to Europe in this very chaotic fashion. Western countries may have calculated there was a choice between resettlement, and no migration at all. Whereas in reality, if these types of conflicts go on long enough, the choice is between chaotic migration or orderly migration. This was a real strategic error by Western governments two or three years ago. They thought they could get away without taking anyone to Europe, but people came anyway because they were fed up with spending five years in countries in the Middle East where they didn’t have the right to work, access to education, a safe life or the kind of future that they are afforded under the terms of the Geneva Convention. Their situation showed no sign of abating because the war in Syria is getting worse, and the situation in Turkey has remained the same. Once they realized that if they took a boat to Greece and made their way through Europe they could claim asylum and get their rights as refugees under the Geneva Convention, it becomes a pretty obvious choice.From your reporting over the past year, what do you think would be a more ethical and effective European response to the migration crisis?Europe needs to step up mass resettlement schemes. While this is going to require great administrative and financial efforts, as far as I can see there’s no alternative to it. People are going to try and come anyway, and the sooner we can try and manage that process, the easier it will become. If you create resettlement schemes, people feel like there is a point to staying put in the Middle East, because in the long term this might lead to them being given a safe and legal passage to the West, and then they don’t have to risk death in the rolling seas. There is also an advantage to Western governments of resettlement schemes because at least they can decide when people arrive, where they will go, and can screen people in advance to weed out anyone who they think might be a potential terrorist. For example, Canada’s resettlement program has allowed the country to prepare, as people arrive at specific times to specific places. Germany can’t currently do the same because they don’t know who’s coming, when they’re coming or where exactly they’re coming. Once people who might have gone in a more chaotic fashion decide to stay in their countries in the hope of being resettled in a more orderly fashion, everyone wins. Refugees win because they don’t drown. And Western countries win because they don’t get people turning up in droves in an unmanageable way.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

On Friday night, the Canadian band (made up of Emily Haines, James Shaw, Joshua Winstead and Joules Scott-Key) rocked the stage at the Hammerstein Ballroom as part of their ""Pagans In Vegas"" tour. The show marked their first concert in New York City since last summer. From the moment they played the first few chords of ""IOU"" off their 2003 debut album, the crowd -- myself included -- knew they were in for a good show. As lead singer Emily Haines jumped around on stage, the crowd jumped along with her, pumping fists in the air and shouting the lyrics back at her. After four high-energy songs, including ""Help I'm Alive"" and ""Cascades"" -- for which Haines emerged like a rock goddess, wearing a flowing neon cape lit up by the set's black lights as a wind machine blew her blond hair back -- she broke into an a cappella version of ""Raw Sugar."" At one point, the band brought up a group of audience members to help them sing ""Dreams So Real,"" adding a little extra soul to the dystopic synth track. Haines even had one of the women on stage sing the final lyrics (""Baby wherever you are // baby whatever you do // Faster than you think // time staggers on"") herself. The band continued, playing a diverse variety of songs from their six-album discography including ""Combat Baby,"" which also got the a cappella treatment, ""Gold Guns Girls"" and ""The Shade,"" which ended the set. Then came the impressive encore, during which the band performed a stripped-down version of ""Gimme Sympathy"" and finished things off with ""Breathing Underwater.""For the entire show, it was clear the band was happy to be playing in New York again, and their loyal fans welcomed them back with open arms. The sound was polished, the light show was great and the energy, from both the band and the crowd, never faltered. To put it plainly, Metric knows how to rock -- and their fans love them for it. "

The WorldPost spoke with her in the wake of the recent crackdown on media in Turkey. Turkey is being shaken by a number of crises at once -- from the massive influx of Syrian refugees, the fight with the Kurds and now the crackdown on free expression, including the seizure of the country's leading paper, Zaman. What is going on?Turkey is going through a deep, dizzying, dangerous social and political transformation. So much is happening so fast there is no time to stop and think and analyze. Abnormalities have become the new normal.Turkey's ruling elite from President [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan's AKP, or Justice [and] Development Party, has been confusing ""democracy"" with ""majoritarianism."" Democracy is not only about the ballot box and the number of votes. That's only one of the essentials. Democracy is also about rule of law, separation of powers, a free, diverse media, freedom of speech, women's rights, minority rights. In all these respects, Turkey has been sliding backwards sadly. It is a very polarized country between those who are staunch supporters of Erdoğan and those who are against him. We have become a society of anger, paranoia, intimidation. And artists, writers, academics -- people who have been trying to build bridges so as to promote coexistence and peace -- know that they have lost big time.Is there a link that ties all these crises together?Turkish society is becoming more conservative and patriarchal while the state is becoming more authoritarian and patriarchal. These two processes are deeply related. A recent Pew research [survey] showed that half of the Turkish society thinks it is not okay or legitimate to criticize the government publicly.

The WorldPost spoke with her in the wake of the recent crackdown on media in Turkey. Turkey is being shaken by a number of crises at once -- from the massive influx of Syrian refugees, the fight with the Kurds and now the crackdown on free expression, including the seizure of the country's leading paper, Zaman. What is going on?Turkey is going through a deep, dizzying, dangerous social and political transformation. So much is happening so fast there is no time to stop and think and analyze. Abnormalities have become the new normal.Turkey's ruling elite from President [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan's AKP, or Justice [and] Development Party, has been confusing ""democracy"" with ""majoritarianism."" Democracy is not only about the ballot box and the number of votes. That's only one of the essentials. Democracy is also about rule of law, separation of powers, a free, diverse media, freedom of speech, women's rights, minority rights. In all these respects, Turkey has been sliding backwards sadly. It is a very polarized country between those who are staunch supporters of Erdoğan and those who are against him. We have become a society of anger, paranoia, intimidation. And artists, writers, academics -- people who have been trying to build bridges so as to promote coexistence and peace -- know that they have lost big time.Is there a link that ties all these crises together?Turkish society is becoming more conservative and patriarchal while the state is becoming more authoritarian and patriarchal. These two processes are deeply related. A recent Pew research [survey] showed that half of the Turkish society thinks it is not okay or legitimate to criticize the government publicly. Anyone who dares to express a critical opinion is labeled as a ""traitor"" or a rotten apple.Critical-minded people are lynched on social media, demonized in pro-government newspapers, intimidated from all sides.

And when somebody complains about it, the law enforcement have to come and supervise. They do it to everybody and they're doing the right thing,"" Millan told People.A change.org petition signed by more than 10,000 people on Friday called Millan's methods inhumane, saying he ""used the pig as a bait for the dog all for 'entertainment' purposes."" It asked Nat Geo WILD to cancel his show.Millan, 46, who found fame through his ""Dog Whisperer"" TV show that has been broadcast worldwide and who has sold millions of books about his techniques, said he disagreed that he used the pig as bait to provoke the dog, and that Simon and the pig ""became best friends"" and the dog was no longer aggressive to toward pigs.In a follow-up segment, which was aired later in the episode, Simon is seen co-existing peacefully with a group of pigs, a chicken and other animals.A representative for Millan confirmed his comments given to People. The Department of Animal Care and Control in Los Angeles County did not return Reuters' requests for comment.The American Humane Society said it had received complaints about the episode, and called the incident ""abuse"" in a statement.Nat Geo WILD, a unit of 21st Century Fox, on Friday rallied around Millan and said that a clip from the episode that was shared online ""caused some concern for viewers who did not see or understand the full context of the encounter.""""The pig that was nipped ... was tended to immediately afterward, healed quickly and showed no lasting signs of distress.... As a result (of Millan's work) Simon did not have to be separated from his owner or euthanized,"" it said.(Reporting by Jill Serjeant in New York and Piya Sinha-Roy in Los Angeles; Editing by David Gregorio and Sandra Maler)"

After several days with no luck, it seemed as though the president would go home empty-handed. In an attempt to ensure that did not happen, Roosevelt's hunting guides tracked down a bear, tied it to a tree and summoned Roosevelt. But as the Theodore Roosevelt Association writes on its website, the president ""took one look at the old bear and refused to shoot it. He felt doing so would be unsportsmanlike. However, since it was injured and suffering, Roosevelt ordered that the bear be put down to end its pain.""The incident was depicted in a now-famous cartoon by Clifford Berryman, published Nov. 16, 1902, in The Washington Post. And soon after, a Brooklyn, New York, candy store owner and his wife created the first “Teddy” bears. The rest, as they say, is history. And today, more than a century later, the stuffed animals remain one of the most popular children's toys.“President Theodore Roosevelt would have really enjoyed why we are gathered here today,” Jewell said during a ceremony at Louisiana's Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge. ""Working together across private and public lands with so many partners embodies the conservation ethic he stood for when he established the National Wildlife Refuge System as part of the solution to address troubling trends for the nation’s wildlife.""Louisiana black bears once roamed Louisiana, East Texas and western Mississippi, but their population was reduced to around 150 by the time they were listed in 1992. Today, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that 500 to 750 bears live across the species’ range with breeding populations that are expanding. “This is a terrific comeback story that reflects the dedicated work of so many people from throughout Louisiana,"" Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-La.) said in a statement, ""and I’m excited that our beloved Teddy Bear will be here for the next generation of Louisianans to enjoy.""So go ahead, give your Teddy a bear hug. "

He doesn’t quite remember what happened, but he thinks that he tripped and fell face down into the snow. He lost consciousness and remained that way for the next 12 hours. He stopped breathing. His heart stopped pumping blood. When paramedics pulled him from the snow, they declared him dead.Here’s where the luck comes in. Jason Smith’s body temperature dropped below 68 degrees, which put him into a state of hibernation. The emergency personnel transported Smith to a nearby hospital where the staff performed CPR. After another couple hours, doctors filled him up with new, oxygenated blood. His heart resumed beating. After a two-week coma, Smith woke up. He’d lost his toes and his pinkies to frostbite, but his brain had miraculously survived intact.Or perhaps it was not a miracle. After all, hypothermia is now frequently used in hospitals in the treatment of heart attacks. Doctors have known for some time that lowering the body’s temperature can help it recover from trauma.Many countries today find themselves in Jason Smith’s face-down-in-the-snow predicament. Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, and Somalia are all suffering massive trauma, in this case as a result of armed conflict and outside intervention. Having fallen into the category of “failed states,” they are all practically DOA, at least as functioning entities.It’s always possible that a miracle cure — a robust peace treaty followed by some form of nation-building — will end the bloodshed in these countries and gradually knit their disparate parts back together.But I wouldn’t count on it.In some cases, the wars will just continue, as they have in Afghanistan and Iraq ever since the celebrated application of U.S. shock-and-awe tactics. Missions can be declared accomplished, and expeditionary forces withdrawn. But Pandora’s horrors cannot be so easily reboxed. We’ve gotten accustomed to wars that have finite terms, like the American Civil War or World War I. But at one time conflicts stretched across generations, like the Hundred Years’ War between England and France. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq could conceivably last that long as well.If they’re lucky, such conflict-ridden states might endure the same intermission that Jason Smith experienced. The wars won’t end. They will just be frozen, the temperature of the conflict brought down through a succession of ceasefires. At some point in the future, these failed states might be brought back to life, perhaps when some of the trauma has healed or the infections of hatred have subsided. In this best-case scenario, the countries involved might lose some extremities — a Crimean pinkie, for instance — but they will be fortunate to have pulled through the worst of it. On the other hand, these countries might fall apart no matter how long their deep freeze lasts, just as all those hopeful immortals who’ve opted to bury their dead bodies in tanks of liquid nitrogen will never likely thaw back to life.This raises a fundamental question about the current world situation. It’s become commonplace to speak of the global war on terror as a “forever war.” But perhaps the problem runs a great deal deeper.Perhaps we are no longer able to end any wars.The Elusive PeaceThe quintessential frozen conflict of our era is over 60 years old.The Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice. No peace treaty marked the end of combat.In other words, for more than 60 years, the war between the two Koreans has been in a state of suspended animation. North and South have exchanged artillery fire, clashed at sea, and maintained a nearly non-stop war of words during that period. At any point, up to and including the current period of deteriorating relations, the war could have turned hot. Yet for the most part, Koreans in North and South have gone about their separate business, often inured to the trauma of having their peninsula torn in two.Frozen wars are not the same as cold wars. After all, the United States and Soviet Union never actually fought against each other, not directly at least. A frozen conflict, meanwhile, is one that was once hot and has since iced over.The term “frozen conflict” has been most often used in conjunction with wars on the Russian periphery — in Moldova, Georgia, and now in Ukraine. In all three cases, separatists backed by Moscow carved out their own semi-autonomous regions — in Transnistria, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and now the Donbass. The fighting has largely tapered off. The separatist regions have been recognized by only a handful of other states. These are stand-offs with no easy solutions in sight.It’s not just a post-Soviet problem. Look at the map through this lens of “frozen conflicts” and you see that much of the world has fallen into this crevasse. Many of the world’s hotspots are in fact in a deep freeze: Kashmir, Israel-Palestine, the Taiwan Strait, Burma, Nagorno-Karabakh, South Sudan, southern Thailand, northwest Pakistan, eastern Congo, eastern Saudi Arabia.In fact, it’s very difficult to find a peace that is as clear-cut and durable as the one that prevailed between France and Germany after World War II or that exists today between the United States and Vietnam. The war in Bosnia ended in 1995 with the Dayton Accords. Angola ended a 27-year conflict in 2002. The conflict in Aceh ended in 2005. The Sri Lankan government brought an end to the civil war in that country (though largely through brutality rather than diplomacy).Elsewhere, peace has been elusive. Ethiopia and Eritrea still squabble over disputed territory. The Turkish government and Kurdish separatists, after having apparently achieved a peaceful rapprochement, are now renewing hostilities. The Colombian government and the major rebel group FARC were supposed to sign a peace agreement this month, but it now looks like that won’t happen. Virtually everywhere else that conflict is ongoing, diplomats have failed to cajole the warring factions into signing peace treaties.Steven Pinker may well be right about the declining levels of violence in the world. But there hasn’t been a corresponding increase in sustainable peace. We’ve frozen our devils in place in the hopes that the better angels of our nature will one day wing into sight to save us from ourselves.Exhibit A: Syria.Syria and BeyondIt would be premature to list Syria as a frozen conflict.The ceasefire brokered by the United States and Russia has only been in place for about two weeks — since February 27. It doesn’t apply to areas under the control of the Islamic State or the al-Nusra Front. And since Turkey considers the Kurdish rebels in Syria to be terrorists and Russia often classifies any group opposed to the government of Bashar al-Assad in similar terms, the very term “ceasefire” lacks substantive meaning. According to some estimates, 135 of people have died during this period of suspended hostilities — and that’s only people in the area covered by the ceasefire. Elsewhere in Syria, another 552 people have been killed. And the number of civilian casualties has increased in the last couple days.At several points during the Syrian conflict, it seemed as if Assad was on his way out, defeated by anti-government rebels and the Salafists of the Islamic State. When Russia intervened on the government’s side, it managed to achieve exactly the same outcome as in Ukraine, bolstering a beleaguered minority determined to dig in its heels. Stalemate is a key ingredient of a frozen conflict.Of course there was no guarantee that Syria could have avoided a frozen outcome if Russia had stayed out of the conflict. The divisions in the country — ethnic, confessional, ideological — ensure that it will be very difficult to recreate any version of the old Syria in the future. The hatreds run deep, violence has become endemic, and outside actors have too many contradictory objectives to find a satisfactory resolution.The situation in Syria demonstrates the sheer difficulty of reaching peace in today’s world. There are five main reasons why peace is so often beyond our grasp.The world is awash in weapons. The volume of major weapons transfers went up 16 percent between 2010 and 2014 compared to the previous four-year period, and the United States is the leading driver of the $76 billion industry. Arms supplied to one faction often end up in the hands of its enemies, making arms embargos and targeted weapons transfers nearly impossible. And just as we have an explosion of shootings in the United States because of the availability of handguns, wars are much more likely to start, continue, and resist resolution because young men continue to have access to truckloads of sophisticated weaponry.Both international and regional institutions are weak. The United Nations and regional bodies like the African Union are too weak to force combatants to lay down their weapons, too weak to provide enough peacekeepers to enforce a ceasefire, too weak to provide sufficient funds to rebuild conflict zones and ensure that strife doesn’t return. Such institutions remain weak in part because:Superpowers like the United States and would-be superpowers like Russia and Turkey are determined to achieve their goals by force. The United States continues to practice a la carte multilateralism, supporting only those international efforts that intersect with its national interests. As long as Washington continues to rule by drone, forget about a robust international rule of law and the institutions required to uphold it. And don’t expect other countries to do anything other than follow the leader.States are weaker too. Thanks to the prevailing orthodoxy of neoliberalism — and its requirements to privatize, restrict government “interference” in the economy, and cut back on welfare provisions — states have fewer nation-building levers at their disposal and therefore command less loyalty from their citizens. Consequently,Particularism is flourishing. Ethnic nationalism and religious fundamentalism have greater appeal in the absence of strong consolidating ideologies. In many countries, ideologies such as Arab nationalism, Marxism, and liberal democracy have all failed to secure peace and prosperity. It’s no surprise, then, that people are turning to ideologies that are far narrower in scope and audience.Twenty-five years ago, the Cold War ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Thereafter, we were supposed to embark on a path of peace and prosperity. But somehow, we lost our way. We tripped. We fell. And now we find ourselves, like Jason Smith, face down in the snow. If we’re lucky, we’ll get pulled out in the nick of time, our various traumas frozen in suspended animation. We will have lost something in the process, but we will survive.But we may not be lucky. Despite our fine words and the efforts of hardworking diplomats, we may no longer be able to end wars. Live by the sword, die by the sword — and there are no medical miracles that can save us from that terminal illness.Crossposted with Foreign Policy In Focus"
