(AP Photo/Jessica Hill)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e8b02100005002c96b02.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Democratic senators unveiled legislation Friday night to repeal the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, a sweeping 9/11-era war authorization that never expired and that President Barack Obama is now using to justify the U.S. military campaign against the Islamic State.Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced the bill. It would terminate the 2001 AUMF in three years and clarify that Congress ""never intended and did not authorize a perpetual war"" by passing that authorization. Their legislation comes days after Obama sent Congress a new AUMF tailored to the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIL or ISIS. While his proposal calls for limits on duration and ground troops, it does nothing to rein in the 2001 AUMF -- the same authority Obama has been using for the past six months to fight ISIS. That means, regardless of whether Congress passes his new AUMF, the old authorization's broad war authority remains available to Obama and future presidents.""By leaving in place the 2001 AUMF, Congress could be authorizing a state of perpetual war and giving this President and future presidents a blank check to keep America at war,"" said Cardin.As a candidate and as a president, Obama talked about the need to move the nation away from endless war -- and specifically to do away with the 2001 authorization. The fact that his AUMF proposal didn't attempt to rein it in has drawn criticism from Democrats demanding a stop to open-ended wars.""It just doesn't make sense for us to keep looking for ways we can use a 13-year-old bill for the authority to go after terrorist groups that didn’t even exist when the bill was passed,” said Murphy.The full text of the bill is below:Title: To sunset the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force after three years. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,"

Grabar-Kitarovic has been one of the most loyal cadres for the HDZ since the early 90s. She publicly defended Prime Minister Sanader in 2008, at the time when he was embezzling millions of dollars.

During Karamarko's intelligence and interior ministry stints, Croatia's official passports were given to Balkan criminals. Tomislav Karamarko, was hand-picked by Mr. Sanader to immediately replace the Minister of Interior after the mafia-style assassinations of a lawyer's daughter and media leaders in the center of Zagreb in October 2008. The only result of the investigations under Mr. Karamarko's authority was that a homeless person was jailed for allegedly killing the lawyer's daughter.

The authoritarian Tudjman proudly promoted and executed the idea of having some 200 Croatia's families own the entire economy.

While engaging in rampant corruption, politicians have blocked judicial reforms, interfered with the judiciary, failed to strengthen the rule of law, encouraged a dysfunctional economy, held fraudulent elections, and brought the government debt down to junk status.

In his many books, Mr. Radovic had exposed political corruption and unexplained wealth of top state leaders, including then interior minister Karamarko and a military general Cermak. Extortion charges against Mr. Radović were brought by Ivan Cermak, a plumber turned Croatia's general, and alleged war-profiteer whose wealth, including a chain of 63 gas stations, has been investigated by journalists and anti-corruption activists but ignored by Croatia's authorities.

Italy shut down its Mare Nostrum search-and-rescue operation last October and it has been replaced by a more limited EU border control mission, Triton.The weather has improved since the beginning of the week, the coastguard said, opening the way for migrant boats to set off again from Libya, where the breakdown in law and order has allowed people-smugglers free rein.The U.N. refugee organization UNHCR says at least 218,000 migrants crossed the Mediterranean by boat last year and 3,500 lives were lost.This week's deaths have renewed focus on the European Union mission. Unlike its predecessor, Triton does not have a specific search-and-rescue mandate, and limits its border control operations to the waters near the Italian coast.

""It's a grind. I don't think people really understand that families are affected by playing football, your whole schedule, your life,"" Robinson said later in the interview.

And like, maybe other things are becoming important to him.""""Has he had enough football? You can't ask him that right after the season because your body is telling you ‘yes,'"" he added. ""Right now you just have to let him wait it out, see how the offseason goes, let him get his body right again and then you will see if he wants to come back or not.""Robinson’s comments came two days after Seahawks general manager John Schneider made similar comments on the same radio station. “Whether or not [Lynch] wants to play next year, I can't answer that,” he said. “I don't know if he knows at this juncture.”""It's hard for these guys. This is a long season,” Schneider added. “We've played a lot of football these last two years and especially the way this guy runs the ball, it's taxing on his body and so he has to reset himself and get in that mind-frame of, 'Okay, I'm ready to get moving here again and get prepared for another season of this.”Lynch is under contract to make $5 million next season, although there are rumors the Seahawks have offered Lynch an extension that would bump his 2015 salary above $10 million.

""All of you know that we must avoid advocacy in our news coverage and that our ethics guidelines impose constraints on participation in political activities,"" Baron wrote in a memo obtained by The Huffington Post. ""However, we can be advocates for press freedom and for the freedom of our colleagues.""It's unknown what charges the Iranian government has brought against Rezaian, a highly regarded Iranian-American journalist and the Post's Tehran bureau chief. The Post reported that ""the charges against him are cloaked in secrecy, with little public information beyond a statement by authorities that he is accused of acting beyond the scope of journalism.""Most major news organizations, especially legacy outlets like the Post, have strict rules against reporters taking on advocacy roles or endorsing political positions. But when it comes to matters of press freedom, and defending colleagues jailed simply for doing journalism, news organizations have typically been more lenient. Last year, Al Jazeera launched a worldwide campaign calling for the release of three of its journalists in Egypt. As of Friday, all three have been released.The paper, of course, is reporting on Rezaian's ongoing ordeal, and Baron said those covering the story should not sign the petition. Baron did not immediately respond to an email regarding the Post's decision. He signaled in his memo that staffers could share the petition on social media, and many of them tweeted links to it throughout the day.So far, over 100,00 people have signed on. ""The voices of many thousands of individuals calling for justice can do nothing but help Jason’s cause,"" Baron wrote of the petition, ""and it allows us to state clearly that we stand united on his behalf."""

If confirmed, Lynch would replace Attorney General Eric Holder, who announced his resignation in September after leading the Justice Department for six years. The 55-year-old federal prosecutor would be the nationâs first black female attorney general.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is celebrating the week leading up to Valentine's Day by reintroducing a bill that would penalize married same-sex couples who move to his home state or any other state that does not recognize same-sex marriages for state purposes.Cruz's bill would require federal authorities to treat as single any same-sex spouse living in any of the 13 such states, thus disqualifying them from 1,000 different marriage-related benefits in areas ranging from Social Security to federal taxes to copyright to veterans' benefits. Most cruelly, if a gay woman in, say, Texas were to marry someone from another country, Cruz's bill would require her to pick up and move to a state that recognizes same-sex marriage in order for her wife or stepchildren to immigrate to the United States.As a Canadian-born U.S. citizen, Sen. Cruz should be intimately aware of how important family status is under U.S. immigration and nationality law. In fact, the vast majority of legal immigrants to the United States qualify on the basis of family relationships.Sen. Cruz claims to be concerned that federal recognition of same-sex marriages is interfering with each state's right to define marriage for itself, but clearly, his real problem is with a federal definition of marriage that he personally dislikes.I say this because the anti-gay definition of marriage in the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) required federal officials to ignore same-sex marriages even in states where they were celebrated, yet Cruz never had a problem with this apparent infringement on states' rights before the U.S. Supreme Court gutted DOMA in United States v. Windsor. In fact, he once defended DOMA against ""specious"" attacks citing states' rights. Now just such an argument is so important to him that he'd force Edie Windsor (the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case) to pay $363,053 more in federal estate taxes if she were to move from New York to Texas, and any gay Texan who marries a Spaniard to move to a state like Virginia if they want to live together.The meaning of ""equal protection"" under the U.S. Constitution is highly disputed in general. Yet the idea that a U.S. citizen should have to migrate to another state in order to live together with his husband and children seems to be an example of what Justice Kennedy might call ""a denial of equal protection of the laws in the most literal sense.""Fortunately, Sen. Cruz's ""State Marriage Defense Act"" is unlikely to become law anytime soon. Yet it is a good example of the kind of chaotic reaction the U.S. Supreme Court eventually could unleash if it upheld anti-gay state marriage laws in the case it will hear later this term.

In order to effectively live life, I need to be willing to change the way that I relate with myself, with others, and the world. The person that I was before will no longer suffice in the world that I want to live in today.My journey to recovery is chronicled here.For me, part of the way that I can amend my past behavior is to take care of my health. I neglected it for so many years and did so much damage to my mind and body that today I strive to live a different way of life. I can't change the way I behaved in the past or the decisions that I made, but I can do something better today, something different. I no longer have to disregard my health and can choose to make it a priority today.I smoked cigarettes on and off starting when I went to college. Today, I choose not to smoke. I used to sit on the couch and eat gallon containers of Cold Stone ice cream and barely go outside. Today, I pay attention to the foods that I eat and actively try to make exercise a part of my life. I used to pollute my body with too much alcohol and too many drugs. Today, I don't.Even though eating well and exercising may seem like a positive thing, for someone with an addictive nature such as myself they can just as easily become a negative. It has happened more than once that these things became my new drug and doing them was actually detrimental to my well being.While I was living by myself and attending pharmacy school, I became fixated on the outside being an accurate representation of how I was doing on the inside. I have found that the worse I am feeling on the inside, the harder I concentrate on fixing the outside. If I look ok to you, then you will think I am okay.I exercised obsessively and monitored everything I ate. I counted calories and denied myself anything I deemed ""indulgent."" I would find myself doing squats and lunges in the middle of the night because I couldn't sleep and would tell myself I didn't ""do enough"" earlier that day.Looking back, I realized that the time I looked the best on the outside was also the time when I felt the worst about myself on the inside.A few years ago I had similar behavior creep back into my life. I had picked up running again and had joined the gym. As time went on, I started pushing myself to run farther each time and would feel tremendous guilt if I missed a gym class. I kept a separate calendar just for running and made sure that each week the number of miles was increasing.This is how I suffered my first injury that took me out of commission for two weeks. I was hurt and I pushed myself to keep going and doing more until my body did what my mind and my willpower couldn't do. It broke down.It is imperative that I remain vigilant as to the motivation behind my exercise and eating. If I am not paying attention to the way that I am feeling, I can start to think that fixing up the outside will somehow fix the inside. It has taken me a long time to realize that the two do not correlate.For me, health means much more than its physical definition. It is emotional and spiritual as well. As I have hit these bumps along the way it has become evident to me that my health is ever evolving and will only improve it I put the effort in. Health is progress, not perfection. It is doing a little more than I did yesterday and not beating myself up for taking steps back. This post first appeared here at Erin's Inside Job."

The shock we receive results from people immediately imagining working with their own mate -- a nightmarish thought for many. For those couples in shock, work and home-life succeed because they are separate...but when you have your own business, they are very much intertwined. We used ""muse"" to describe our connection in our 2014 wedding vows, as we both look to each other for inspiration and motivation. And while we make a great team, sharing the stresses of business with your spouse can be really freaking intense too. To strike balance, we try to create time to enjoy being a couple...even if it's just cuddling up together with a cocktail at the end of the day. Recently, we elevated our couple time to a relaxing and romantic spa weekend at the JW Marriott Desert Springs. The beautiful resort which embraces the aesthetic of the surrounding Sonoran desert, boasts the luxury Spa Desert Springs, named on Conde Nast Traveler's ""Hot List."" After a sun-drenched afternoon spent lounging by the adults-only salt water spa pool and an al fresco lunch from the wellness focused bistro, we enjoyed a couple's treatment. The Revive treatment room is designed for two. The flicker of candlelight and two massage therapists welcomed us into a cozy oasis complete with massage tables and a hydrotherapy tub. And because it was Victor's birthday weekend, we were treated to champagne and chocolate covered strawberries...a blissful and welcomed break from our busy lives. All within a short drive from Los Angeles."

And to do so is a shame to feminists everywhere.",2015-02-13,"U.S rapper Azealia Banks performs on the main stage at Wireless festival in Finsbury Park, north London, Saturday, July 5, 2014. The first festival took place in June 2005 and was staged in Hyde Park. (Photo by Joel Ryan/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafd664260000cf0081624e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I am a feminist. I am also a gay man. And as a gay male feminist, I take direction from my feminist women counterparts who have first-hand knowledge of what it means to be the subject of misogyny. Likewise, I expect women to take notes from my experiences with homophobia, specifically male homophobia, and the use of the word ""faggot"" or ""fag."" This dynamic is not always perfect, but it is a symbiotic relationship of two demographics who have at least the capability of empathizing with each other's respective struggle against hegemonic masculine rule.Enter Azealia Banks. During her initial foray into the topic of what it means to use the word ""faggot,"" many gay men including myself, gave her the benefit of the doubt. Based on the context clues of her lyrics, her bisexuality and the quality of her art, I had faith that after the noise relented, her reason and understanding of the immensely painful emotion that ""faggot"" represents would be apparent. But after doubling down on her use of the word and justifying it by saying she is a feminist, the chance for her to show an ounce of compassion for the men who have been traumatized by this word has come and gone. In case you are unfamiliar with Azealia Banks' take on the word, here are her thoughts on the subject. There are tons of tweets, Instagram posts and articles detailing her opinion of gay men, gay white men and her affinity for the word ""faggot."" But the root of her argument is this:""A faggot is not a homosexual male,"" she tweeted. ""A faggot is any male who acts like a female. There's a BIG difference.""Discriminatory slur words are not created by the people who they are used against, but by the prejudicial thoughts and actions of others who hate them because of prejudice. After these words are created, however, the people who these words were used against forever own them. And the defendants in the case, or anyone not a part of the discriminated group, are never allowed to rewrite the words history to change it's meaning or minimize it's impact.Azealia Banks does has one excellent point amid the cacophony of bullshit she keeps spewing. The word ""bitch"" is a negative word used that was historically used to demean women. It is one of those obvious things that so many people, myself included, failed to realize. And in the spirit of feminist progress, it is a great discussion to pose to gay men. If Azealia Banks or anyone else is truly hurt by when a gay man affectionately says, ""Hey, bitch"" or jokingly says, ""Bitch. please,"" then this is a discussion we need to have. But, based on the copious amounts of shit she has slung in the faces of homosexual men, specifically white homosexual men, it would appear that her intentions bear some malice. Any minority should understand how it feels when someone tries to belittle your experience with discrimination. Growing up in rural Texas, I heard so many people try to justify their racist use of the n-word by redefining it. ""A (n-word) isn't a black person, it is someone who is low class. Anyone could be an (n-word)."" This flimsy justification failed to cover up the perpetrators inherent racism. And Azealia Banks' twisted attempt to redefine ""faggot"" as a feminist doesn't exempt her from homophobia. She most definitely said homophobic statements, which is inexcusable whether she identifies as bisexual or not. She has demonstrated hateful comments about gay men, and I hope I am wrong, but it would appear as if she is not going to stop anytime soon.Just as a gay man cannot redefine the word ""dyke,"" a woman, whether heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, has no right to use ""faggot,"" especially in the name of feminism. And to do so is a shame to feminists everywhere. As a male feminist, I am all ears when it comes to how I can be better when it comes to respecting women, including my choice of words. But to Azealia Banks, please shut the fuck up, because you will never be able to redefine ""faggot"" to fit your twisted idea of what feminism is."

(Craig Sjodin/ABC via Getty Images) ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb60084200000e50000f51d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kerry Washington's InStyle cover is set to hit stores Friday, but the yet to be released issue has already generated quite a bit of debate. Washington's visibly lighter appearance on the cover has upset a number of super fans, even prompting a response from the magazine and Washington herself.But in the pages behind the controversial cover, Washington gives her take on her character's influence on women.In the issue, the 38-year-old actress explains to InStyle the differences between her personal red-carpet fashion choices to that of Olivia Pope's. Over the years, Washington's award-show wardrobe has consisted of daring colors, patterns and cuts. Most notably a crop top ensemble she donned while pregnant for the 2014 Screen Actors Guild Awards. As for Pope, Washington said, she ""sticks to a more neutral palette in pastels by designers like Dior, Ferragamo and Escada."" Fashion choices, which have become the inspiration for The Limited's 'Scandal' collection. ""Olivia's had a huge influence"" Washington continued. In fact, she explained, ""After the first couple of episodes aired, people started posting on Twitter things like 'I have a job interview today, and I'm trying to dress like Olivia Pope.'"" And why wouldn't women want to channel Olivia Pope's fierce style to help land that prospective job? Pope is known for her attention commanding designer power suits, classic cardigans and detailed blouses. Her wardrobe has become the subject of articles, Pinterest boards, and blogs viewed by women who want to duplicate her flawless style in their line of work.The considerable amount of interest shown by fans in Pope's wardrobe continues as Washington once again teams up with The Limited for the Spring ""Scandal"" collection. But it's not just her ensembles the young women, who tune in every Thursday with their glass of wine in hand, admire. It's the confidence, assertiveness and strength she projects.""The Olivia Pope Affect""Scandal's creator Shonda Rhimes has been credited for ""breaking barriers"" for casting the first black female to play a lead role on network television in 40 years. Washington plays a well-educated, complex, career-driven political fixer that defies race and gender stereotypes.Some question if the show's success is an indicator that we are in a post-racial television era. But the ""Olivia Pope Affect"" doesn't stop there. The character has become a cultural icon and role model for women of all color. In a time where women are the breadwinners in nearly half of American households and 61% of millennial women aspire to one day hold a managerial position, Pope has become the quintessential career women.Women want to dress like her, have her job and ""handle"" life's everyday challenges just like her. And it wasn't limited to the first couple of episodes either. Young women regularly post on social media their desires to channel Pope for prospective job interviews or in their current roles. Pope's impeccable problem solving skills, assertiveness and unapologetic demeanor are traits that attribute to her success as a fixer. However, these qualities are typically not viewed positively when displayed by women. Yet, she is revered by those around her. The absence of the stigmas, associated with women in leadership, from the show allows ambitious female viewers to embrace their own leadership traits without the fear of sacrificing their likeability. Over the years, women have made considerable progress in the workplace but they still don't compare when it comes to holding top managerial positions. Yes she is fictional, but for 60-minutes out of the week Pope inspires millions, who admire her ability to take command and yield fast result all while remaining composed, to do the same in their careers.The character Olivia Pope is not without flaws. Her affair with a married man who happens to be the President of the United States is questionable at the least. But when it comes to her career, the show's protagonist is driven, efficient and powerful with achievements ranging from CEO of Pope & Associates to being a former White House advisor. So despite the moral gray area that is her love life, Pope is a transformative character that has played a significant role in defying traditional depictions of women on network television."

And it has done its job.",2015-02-13,"FILE - This Nov. 30, 2011 file photo shows television host Jon Stewart during a taping of ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" in New York. The 18th edition of ""Bartlett's Familiar Quotations,"" has just been released, the first for the electronic age and a chance to take in some of the new faces, events and catchphrases of the past 10 years. General editor Geoffrey O'Brien says he has expanded upon the trend set by his predecessor, Justin Kaplan, of incorporating popular culture into an anthology once known for classical citations. Shakespeare and the Bible still reign, but room also has been made for Steve Jobs, Madonna and Michael Moore, Justin Timberlake and Jon Stewart. (AP Photo/Brad Barket, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4a3c63c000066000cab95.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the news broke Tuesday night that longtime Daily Show host Jon Stewart would be leaving his post in the coming months, the level of trauma on the internet was palpable. Some expected topics arose, within hours -- minutes, even -- of the announcement trickling out. Why would Stewart leave now? What's his plan? Who should replace him? Could the next Daily Show host be a woman? (Of course). Is this an elaborate ruse for Stewart to take over the NBC Nightly News? (Of course not).The public conversation over the past two days has been so Stewart-centric that the retirement news effectively pushed NBC anchor Brian Williams's suspension off of social media's front pages. Part of that is the shock; we knew the other shoe was about to drop with (on?) Williams, but Stewart's departure was known only to Comedy Central brass before it was revealed to his studio audience. Part of it is how meme-worthy the parallels between the two hosts truly are (""fake newsman speaks truth, real newsman spins lies,"" some post on your Twitter timeline probably read). Breaking at the same time, it seems that Stewart's announcement was top news even in the halls of Congress:So much of the sadness and confusion associated with the loss of the great Jon Stewart is the sense that Stewart was (and is) a wry and stalwart truth-teller, breaking apart the fictions of the 24-hour cable news machine. And he's been great at that. Until his protégé Stephen Colbert perfected a character that fully embodied that machine, Stewart was the best in the business. Colbert exited for greener network pastures, safe in the knowledge that he'd accomplished his mission. And while a Stewart-hosted Daily Show could have stood as an important cultural institution for many more years, it's safe to say that Stewart finished the job as well.At the risk of saying some vaguely negative things about Stewart (which, at one time in my life, I would have sworn never to do), I would argue that the trauma and confusion is misplaced. We don't need Jon Stewart anymore. It's going to be okay.It's strange that this thought first dawned on me on Tuesday, mere hours before news of the retirement broke. I had caught up on this clip from Monday's show, in which Stewart issued his much-anticipated response to the Brian Williams scandal.It's beautiful in its simplicity, and one can only admire the way in which Stewart and his writing staff pivot away from the media pile-on, focusing instead on the news media's tendency to pick and choose which truth claims are worthy of microanalysis (and often getting it wrong). Excellent point, Jon, and particularly interesting in light of its ties to the Iraq War, coverage of which has provided some of the show's richest material over the years.But there's the rub. This is a point that The Daily Show has made, consistently and expertly, for well over a decade. We get it. Is there any way this point can be made any better?It's telling (and exciting!) that so many of Stewart's acolytes have used The Daily Show as a proving ground, apprenticed in its satirical tone, and then moved on to fascinating, often profound work. There's Colbert, of course. Larry Wilmore's The Nightly Show is surely doing Stewart proud, using his platform as a conversational springboard for all manner of issues that are frequently underrepresented. The critical response has been positive; the ratings will come. Then there's John Oliver, whose Last Week Tonight on HBO has quickly become the standard-bearer for satirical TV news. Rather than target issues of news framing and ethics (Stewart's purview), Oliver systematically deconstructs institutions the news often fails at critiquing, everything from beauty pageants to the pharmaceutical business.While each host's focus may vary, these shows advance the fundamental mistrust The Daily Show has in the American news media, while retaining trust in their audience. These programs assume a level of intelligence and engagement that few other shows expect in their viewers. Stewart took the reins of The Daily Show as a goofy parody of local news, and turned it into something smart, influential and useful. It transcended mere entertainment. And it has done its job.Comedy Central is surely scrambling right now, debating not just about host candidates, but about what a future Daily Show should look like. For viewers, the possibilities are tantalizing. Under a new host, the show could satirize the trappings of celebrity. It could re-assume a Colbert-like posture of political (dis)engagement. Maybe it's even time to return to something resembling Craig Kilborn's sarcastic takes on entertainment news and soft-focus human interest pieces.No matter what, though, Stewart's retirement doesn't leave a void. He's savvy enough to see that new voices, new topics, new perspectives have arrived, and that's largely thanks to him. Stewart got the ball rolling 16 years ago; let's see where it goes."

Really.It was in 1993 that we got our first perfectly clear, evidence-based elucidation of the list of modifiable factors that account for the slings and arrows of outrageous medical fortune most common in modern societies: heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, respiratory disease, obesity, and so on. The paper in question, called simply ""Actual causes of death in the United States,"" took the obvious out of the shadows, and into a spotlight. The obvious was: diseases aren't causes, they are effects. What we really want to know, so we can fix what's broken before rather than after all hell breaks loose, is: what causes the diseases that cause the premature deaths?The answer in that seminal paper by Drs. McGinnis and Foege was a list of ten modifiable factors -- most modifiable by each of us individually, all modifiable by us collectively -- that together accounted for all of the premature deaths each year in the United States, but for a rounding error. Even more impressive in terms of opportunity, the influence of the factors on that list was incredibly front-loaded. The first three factors -- tobacco use, poor diet, and lack of physical activity -- accounted for 80 percent of the premature deaths all on their own.The mandate for action began in 1993, but it did not idle there. A consistent, incredibly compelling, ongoing drumbeat of publications eve since (1) has reaffirmed this revelation beyond all doubt or debate. The example of the Blue Zones has shown this all truly can work in the world as it is, at the level of whole populations.We truly do know the simple, actionable fundamentals of lifestyle as medicine associated with an 80 percent reduction in all chronic diseases at the population level, and that same 80 percent reduction in personal risk for all such diseases over a lifetime. We know how to prevent most premature deaths in the modern world. We know how to add years to life, and life to years.Imagine bequeathing to our children and grandchildren a world in which chronic diseases were not getting ever more common and occurring at ever younger age -- but in which, 8 times in 10, they didn't happen at all. That phone call about an ominous diagnosis or some calamity affecting a loved one -- never comes.The obvious question is: why only imagine it, since we have the knowledge to make it so?There are, of course, many reasons why what we have known for more than 20 years has not been translated into what we routinely do, and the phenomenal blessings that would result. There are many reasons why knowledge isn't necessarily power.I will focus on just one for now: only Horton heard the Whos.The reference is, I hope, clear to most. It refers to the famous Dr. Seuss story, Horton Hears a Who. I'll avoid excessive detail for the sake of all who do know it, but here's the gist:Tiny, human-like creatures called Whos, living on a world the size of a dust speck, are going to be destroyed because no one can hear them. No one except Horton, an elephant with customarily large elephant ears, and correspondingly exceptional auditory acuity.Spoiler alert: the Whos are saved, just before being boiled to extinction in Beezle-Nut oil. What saves them? A chorus.The Whos, shouting ""we are here!"" are heard only by Horton, as the other animals work to cure Horton of his auditory hallucinations by boiling the dust speck that is the Whos' home world. Horton rallies the Whos, with help from the mayor of Whoville, to join their voices into a common chorus. And in a moment of triumph, when the last Who -- a young lad obliviously bouncing a yo-yo as the world ends -- joins his voice to the chorus, the Whos are heard loud and clear by one and all, and they are saved. Everything changes.Call me Horton. Or maybe I am a candidate for the mayoralty of Whoville.There is a massive, amazing, globe-spanning, world-changing consensus among experts in lifestyle medicine and all variations on that theme about the fundamentals necessary to prevent 80 percent of all chronic disease and premature death -- but hardly anyone can hear it. The problem in our case is not want of huge ears, but a huge amount of competing noise.It is the job of scientists to ask new questions. But our culture uses the incremental advance of science not to answer new questions, but to question every answer. Why? Money, presumably.If we, the people, are forever confused about the fundamentals of a health-promoting dietary pattern, there is a new fad diet to sell every day, or at least every week. If there is a never-ending parade of quick-fix diets, there is a never-ending parade of morning show segments and magazine articles about those diets. If every new study is distorted and exaggerated to suggest that it puts everything we thought we knew up until yesterday into question, it propagates perennial doubt, distrust, and confusion. Doubt, distrust, and confusion make for an excellent sellers' market. So sell we do: books, magazines, airtime, and the promise of our own vitality and a dramatically better future for our kids. We sell them all.No one of us, no matter our credentials, credibility, or following, can be heard clearly enough above this din of seeming discord to fix it. No one of us alone can help everyone understand that while we may ask different questions, focus on different issues, and even prioritize different details -- the world's leading health experts live and eat far more like one another than any or us lives and eats like the ""typical"" American. When it comes to the basic care and feeding of ourselves and those we love, we are more alike than different. Even at the extremes -- say, passionate vegans and ardent Paleos -- diets are still more similar to one another than either is like what's all around us: multicolored marshmallows as part of a complete breakfast.I am proposing a solution, for perhaps a selfish reason. I simply can't stand to look on as we bequeath to our children and grandchildren a lesser medical destiny than they deserve, and could have. I can't stand the idea of checking out after decades of railing against an unnecessary loss of years from life and life from years, never having been heard well enough to make any meaningful difference. I can't stand the idea of leaving behind the very mess I have devoted my life and career to trying to fix.And I don't think I need to stand it; I just need help to fix it.The proposal, then, is a True Health Coalition -- a vast, diverse, global chorus of voices rallying around the affirmation and better use of what we know for sure about lifestyle as medicine. At the tip of that spear puncturing through the din and the discord is a Council of Directors, a global assembly not only representing a who's who in public health, preventive medicine, fitness, nutrition, health media, and more -- but a team of apparent rivals into the bargain. A group that comes together to defend the profound importance of common cause on common ground, while allowing still for our very varied devotion to different trails, and particular questions.In an ongoing effort right now, I am calling on my most esteemed colleagues the world over to join this Council. I am inviting you to join the Coalition. If so inclined, please email Susan Benigas, Executive Director of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine and manager of this -- the GLiMMER Initiative -- at sbenigas@lifestylemedicine.org. Just your contact information with ""sign me up to the THC"" in the subject line, and we will add you to our list-serve and keep you updated.With the strength of unity, a signal of what we truly do know can rise above the din and discord. That, in turn, can help put a mighty wind in the sails of such efforts as the Blue Zones Project, aiming to help turn the cultural patterns that support the longest, healthiest, happiest lives into replicable blue prints -- so the rest of us can enjoy just such blessings. But the first step is a chorus, crying out the neglected consensus, above the profit-driven din and apparent discord.We know -- we truly know -- how to prevent 80 percent of all chronic disease and associated premature death. Someone is either going to turn that knowledge into the power of action and opportunity, or else we and our kids keep paying for the status quo with years lost unnecessarily from our lives, and life lost unnecessarily from our years.If not now, when?If not us... who?-finDavid L.
