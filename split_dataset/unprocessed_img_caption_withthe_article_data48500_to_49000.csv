1,POLITICS,California Lawmakers Vote To End The Tampon Tax,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-tampon-tax_us_57618206e4b05e4be8606b5d,"The bill would eliminate the sales tax on menstrual products, saving women an estimated $20 million annually.",2016-08-18,"If the governor signs the bill into law, California women will be able to buy tampons sales tax-free. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5761822a1500002a0073aaf0.jpeg?ops=crop_15_175_3985_2472%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"California’s Senate passed a bill Thursday banning menstrual products from being taxed, marking a major step toward ending what’s known as the “tampon tax.” The same bill unanimously passed in the Assembly in early June. It now heads back to the Assembly for final approval, and then to Gov. Jerry Brown (D), whose office declined to say if he will sign the bill into law or not. The measure would save California women an estimated $20 million annually, and has the support of the state’s tax board. California is one of 39 states where tampons, pads and other similar items are not classified as necessities and are thus subject to sales tax, unlike many other medical products. The legislation, introduced by state Assemblywomen Cristina Garcia (D) and Ling Ling Chang (R) earlier this year, would exempt menstrual products from the state sales tax. The bill’s proponents argue that items like tampons are not simply “feminine hygiene products,” but a medical necessity for women, and that subjecting the products to sales tax is a glaring example of gender inequality. “The state of California should not be in the business of putting a tax on half the population because they were born as women,” Garcia told The Huffington Post in April. “Fundamentally this is about gender equity and leveling the field,” Garcia said in a statement after Thursday’s vote. “Every month, for 40 years of our lives, we are taxed for being born women. Every month of our adult life we are taxed for our biology. Every month we are told our periods are a luxury, while also being told they are something to be ashamed of and we must hide. Let me be clear, on biology, periods are not luxuries and they are definitely not something women should be ashamed of, period!”Several other states have passed or are considering bills taking on the tampon tax. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) says signed a bill exempting tampons and pads from state and local sales tax. Similar efforts are underway in Michigan, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Ohio. Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) has taken the fight to the federal level, introducing a bill that would allow women to purchase menstrual products using flexible spending accounts, in which employees set aside pretax dollars for certain health care expenses. She also persuaded FEMA to add tampons and pads to the list of essential items that homeless shelters and other aid organizations can purchase with federal grant money. The fight even got a nod from President Barack Obama, who was asked about the issue during an interview with YouTube personality Ingrid Nilsen. “I suspect it’s because men were making the laws when those taxes were passed,” he said. “And I think it’s pretty sensible for women in those states ... to get those taxes removed.”Amid all the momentum, there have also been some roadblocks. In Utah, an all-male panel voted down the Hygiene Tax Act, which would have exempted tampons, diapers and other products from sales tax. And in Tennessee, a bill looking to lower the sales tax on these types of products was voted down in a mostly male subcommittee. Nevertheless, Garcia plans to move forward with other bills to make tampons less of a burden for low-income women, such as measures leading to funding for homeless shelters and free tampons at schools.

2,POLITICS,The Justice Department Is Going To Stop Using Private Prisons,Ryan J.

The memo was first reported by The Washington Post. “Private prisons served an important role during a difficult period, but time has shown that they compare poorly to our own Bureau facilities. They simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources; they do not save substantially on costs; and as noted in a recent report by the Department’s Office of Inspector General, they do not maintain the same level of safety and security,” Yates wrote in the memo.Stock prices of the country’s two biggest private prison companies ― Corrections Corporation of America and GEO Group ― nosedived by nearly 25 percent Thursday morning. Other big players in the industry ― including Emerald Correctional Management, Management & Training Corporation, Community Education Centers and LaSalle Southwest Corrections ― are privately held companies.Yates’ announcement follows the release of a damning report issued last week by the Justice Department’s Inspector General that found privately run prisons “incurred more safety and security incidents per capita than comparable BOP institutions.” The private prisons currently hold about 22,000 federal prisoners, around 12 percent of the total federal inmate population. They mostly house undocumented males with fewer than 7.5 years left on their sentences.“While an unexpected need may arise in the future, the goal of the Justice Department is to ensure consistency in safety, security and rehabilitation services by operating its own prison facilities,” Yates wrote in a blog post Thursday.Read the memo: Alexander C.

3,POLITICS,Baltimore Cuts Ties With Neo-Nazi Lawyer Hired To Defend Police Department In Misconduct Case (Update),Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baltimore-police-neo-nazi-lawyer_us_57b511e8e4b095b2f5427fa6,The termination came after it was reported that city attorney Glen Keith Allen appeared to be deeply involved with neo-Nazi groups.,2016-08-18,"Glen Keith Allen, who works in the Baltimore City Law Department, was defending the Baltimore Police Department in a lawsuit over police misconduct.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b51335180000ad02bcb79e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Baltimore city solicitor has terminated a contract with an alleged neo-Nazi who worked in the Baltimore City Law Department. Glen Keith Allen is a longtime supporter of the neo-Nazi National Alliance, according to an investigation by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Allen was defending the Baltimore Police Department in a 2015 lawsuit filed by Sabein Burgess, a black man who was imprisoned for 19 years before being released and having his charges dismissed in 2014. Burgess claims officers fabricated evidence in order to send him to jail for a murder he didn’t commit.On Thursday morning, Baltimore City Solicitor George Nilson told The Baltimore Sun that city officials were investigating the allegations brought against Allen. The mayor’s office released a statement later Thursday that said Allen’s one-year contract with the city’s law department has been terminated.“Mr. Allen was fully vetted at the time of his hire ― and of course had decades earlier been professionally and character tested upon his admission to the Bar,” the statement said. “None of the historical facts and alleged facts recently publicized about Mr. Allen’s political views and affiliations were disclosed or discussed when his contract was agreed to. The Law Department does not as a general practice question it’s hired or contract attorneys about their political views.”The SPLC has financial records dating back to 2002 that appear to prove Allen is deeply involved with neo-Nazi groups. “Allen’s history with organized racism and anti-Semitism is deep. Records obtained by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) show he was a dues-paying member of the National Alliance for years,” the report says. “Allen was also a subscriber to the NA’s racist publications, purchased entrance to a Holocaust denial conference the group held and bought a Holocaust denial DVD the group sold.”Allen, according to the SPLC, has contributed to the American Eagle Party National Committee and is possibly the vice chairman/parliamentarian or attorney for the NA.A damning report from the Justice Department released last week shows that Baltimore police officers routinely abused residents’ civil rights, performed unconstitutional searches, failed to hold cops accountable for misconduct and, in some cases, were told by supervisors to target black residents and “lock up all the black hoodies.” Baltimore has been in the national spotlight since April 2015, when 25-year-old Freddie Gray suffered a fatal spinal cord injury in police custody ― a death widely viewed as one caused by police misconduct. “Baltimore’s Litigation and Claims Practice Group is arguably one of the most aggressive and successful defenders of police misconduct in the country,” the SPLC’s report says, before pointing to extreme lengths the office will take to avoid paying settlements in these cases. Baltimore paid out around $12 million in police misconduct cases between 2010 and 2014, according to a 2015 Wall Street Journal analysis. Civil rights violations, alleged shootings, beatings and wrongful imprisonment brought on the most expensive payouts.Read the entire investigation on the Southern Poverty Law Center’s site.This post was updated after city officials terminated Allen’s one-year contract following an investigation into the allegations."
4,POLITICS,Donald Trump And Evan Bayh Lead In Indiana,Nick Bayer,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-evan-bayh-indiana_us_57b4a883e4b095b2f541ff16,"The GOP presidential ticket leads by 9 points, but Bayh could pick up a Senate seat for Democrats.",2016-08-17,Former Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) entered the Senate race hoping to turn Indiana blue after Democratic nominee Baron Hill dropped out of the race in July.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b4a9a5170000ae02c73cd2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new Monmouth University poll out Wednesday shows Republican nominee Donald Trump keeping a safe distance from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Indiana ― something that shouldn’t come as a surprise since 54 percent of the state’s likely voters surveyed approve of the job Gov. Mike Pence, Trump’s running mate, is doing in office.Among likely voters, Trump leads Clinton 47-36 percent in a three-way race, with Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson securing 10 percent of the vote. Another 6 percent say they would vote for someone else or are unsure about who they would support in November. “Pence is likely boosting the GOP ticket’s prospects here, as Indiana voters really don’t like either of the two presidential nominees,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute in the poll release. “In fact, their favorability ratings are among the lowest the Monmouth University Poll has found anywhere we’ve polled.” In this poll, only 33 percent of Indiana voters admitted to having a favorable view of Trump while 54 percent hold an unfavorable opinion of him. Clinton’s ratings are slightly worse at 28 percent favorable and 62 percent unfavorable. But while the presidential race numbers might not be shocking, the races for both Senate and gubernatorial elections are a reason to take a closer look at Indiana this year.There’s good news for the Democrats in the Senate race. The new poll shows former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh has a 7-point lead over Republican candidate Todd Young in the race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Dan Coats. While Bayh takes 48 percent of those surveyed, Young claims 41 percent and Libertarian Lucy Brenton wins 4 percent. Another 7 percent are reportedly undecided.After Bayh announced his intention to re-enter the political ring in July, Democratic nominee Baron Hill decided to drop out of the race, reportedly to give Democrats a better chance of winning the Senate seat up for grabs in November. Bayh served as governor of Indiana from 1989-1997 and spent two terms as an Indiana Senator between 1999 and 2011.The Monmouth poll finds that 46 percent of likely Indiana voters have a favorable opinion of Bayh, while only 19 percent have an unfavorable opinion and 35 percent say they have no opinion. Despite having represented Indiana’s 9th District in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2011, Bayh’s Republican challenger, Todd Young, seems to be less well-known than the former Senator. Only 29 percent report having a favorable opinion of Young and 15 percent say they have an unfavorable opinion of him. However, the majority of likely voters ― 55 percent ― say they have no opinion of Young.  As Pence takes the stage with Trump, the race to fill his seat is closer than ever, according to the Monmouth poll. This most recent statewide poll, the third in a series of Monmouth surveys, shows Republican Lt. Gov. Eric Holcomb nearly tied with Democratic former legislator and 2012 gubernatorial candidate John Gregg. With Holcomb at 42 percent and Gregg at 41 percent, Libertarian Rex Bell takes 4 percent while 13 percent remain undecided. The Monmouth University Poll was conducted from Aug. 13-16, 2016, and has a margin of error of +4.9 percent."

(Reuters) - Liz Cheney, former Vice President Dick Cheney’s eldest daughter, claimed victory late on Tuesday in Wyoming’s Republican primary race for the state’s lone U.S. House of Representatives seat.Unofficial early results by 10 p.m. (0400 GMT) showed Cheney with 26,363 votes in the nation’s least populous state. State Senator Leland Christensen was running a distant second, with almost 15,000 votes, while her six other Republican competitors each held fewer than 12,000 votes.“I’m honored by the trust Wyoming Republicans have placed in me to serve as our next Representative in Congress,” Cheney said in a statement.The Casper Star-Tribune newspaper called the race late on Tuesday night.Wyoming is a reliably red state, with the Republican primary winner all but assured of a general election victory in November.Cheney’s apparent victory comes two years after she launched an unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat that saw her withdraw from the race early.She drew criticism from some establishment Republicans two years ago when she ran against popular incumbent Senator Mike Enzi and was labeled a “carpetbagger” for having only recently established residency in Teton County, one of the country’s wealthiest zip codes, in a state widely populated by working-class miners, oil, and gas workers.She said a family health crisis prompted her to withdraw.Cheney, 49, is a lawyer who worked in the U.S. State Department while her father was vice president.Her campaign has received strong financial support from former high-ranking government officials, such as former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and former White House political adviser Karl Rove.Cheney campaigned as a “strong conservative voice for Wyoming,” promising to protect the state’s pivotal coal industry, defend gun rights, and generally work “to reverse President Obama’s devastating policies.”"

Veolia changed its corrosion control methods at the treatment plant after it was hired in 2014 to assist the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority. Peduto says Veolia made this change, which he has called a “procedural error,” without the approval of the state’s Department of Environmental Protection.Veolia is also currently under fire for potentially playing a role in a water crisis in a city about 300 miles away: Flint, Michigan. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette filed a lawsuit against Veolia earlier this summer, saying the company had “basically botched” the task it was hired to perform — address water safety in the city. Schuette alleges that the company, along with a second firm, worsened the situation.Veolia, which earns $33 billion in annual revenue, has called these claims “false, inaccurate and unwarranted” and accused Michigan of deflecting its own responsibility in the crisis. Pittsburgh has ended its contract with Veolia. It has also reverted its corrosion control methods to be what they were before Veolia changed them.Still, activists say the damage has already been done. Lead levels in Pittsburgh’s water have been slowly rising since 2001, which the PWSA has blamed on its aging service line infrastructure increasingly leaching lead into its customers’ water. Average observed lead levels climbed 7 ppb between 2001 and 2013, the last time EPA-required tests were commissioned. The levels spiked that same amount — from 14.8 ppb to 22 ppb — over the last three years alone.When lead levels surpass 15 ppb in more than 10 percent of homes, water providers are required by law to begin replacing at least 7 percent of their lead service lines annually. The PWSA has begun that work, but a major question remains: Who will pay for it? The PWSA has said it will cover the cost of replacing the portions of water lines made of lead, or lead lines, that it owns. However, the utility says its responsibility ends at homeowners’ property lines, putting homeowners on the hook for replacing the part of the line delivering water into their houses. That could run between $3,000 and $4,000 per home, according to local media reports.Homeowners are not required to replace lead lines on their property. When asked whether assistance could be provided to utility customers who want to make the replacement but can’t afford to, the Pittsburgh mayor’s office directed a question to the PWSA. A utility spokesman did not respond to the question.Asking homeowners to pay to replace lead lines on their properties is fairly typical, said Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech civil engineering professor who helped expose the Flint crisis. Still, he described PWSA’s plan as “very disappointing and non-productive.”“The law is explicit, in stating that PWSA has to control corrosivity of water contacting customer plumbing,” Edwards wrote in an email. “They have undeniably failed to meet that obligation. Rather than admit that and help their customers avoid the health threat, they’d rather blame their customer for the problem.”Also, a growing body of research from Edwards and others indicates that partially replacing a lead line could do more harm than good because it tends to dislodge free lead present in the part of the pipe that remains. At best, partial line replacements are associated with not changing the situation at all; at worst, they’re associated with heightened lead levels.“Frankly, doing nothing is preferable to doing a half-pipe replacement,” Edwards said. As the PWSA works to identify and catalog its lead lines, it is digging them up and alerting customers if they have lead lines serving their homes. The utility is also offering free in-home lead testing to its customers, but some Pittsburgh residents have reported having trouble getting assistance.  The PWSA is facing second round of mandatory lead testing before the end of the year, with results set to be reported in January.Kara Kaufman, press secretary at the Boston-based nonprofit Corporate Accountability International, says Veolia, not homeowners, should at least partially foot that bill. CAI has also been critical of Veolia’s activities in Flint.“It’s absolutely an outrage that individuals should be expected to bear the financial burden of a problem they played no direct role in causing,” Kaufman told The Huffington Post. “This is a problem caused by a series of changes to corrosion control methods brought about by a multibillion-dollar corporation.”Veolia sees things differently. In a statement provided to HuffPost, the firm described its partnership with PWSA as successful and distanced itself from any claims that it made the city’s water less safe. The company specifically noted that it “did not and would not under any circumstances prioritize cost savings ahead of effective corrosion control methods.”“During the partnership, Veolia helped PWSA realize substantial financial benefit from revenue and efficiencies, institute financial controls that limited spending and increased accountability, and identify opportunities for operational efficiencies that have a direct impact on the utility’s bottom line,” the statement continued. This problem of high lead levels in water is certainly not limited to Pittsburgh or Flint.While the EPA sets its action level at 15 ppb, no level of lead exposure is considered safe. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says children are most at risk for the harmful effects of lead, which include brain and nervous system damage and hearing and speech issues, as well as learning and behavior problems.Some 10 million Americans receive water from service lines that are at least partially composed of lead, according to the EPA. Fully replacing all those lines would cost an estimated $30 billion.There are more cost-effective, short-term solutions to the problem for concerned residents, like point-of-use filtering systems on faucets and pitchers or relying on bottled water. But a long-term fix to the problem remains elusive.Some communities are addressing the complex issue in creative ways, said David Dzombak, a professor in civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.He noted that Madison, Wisconsin, fully replaced its lead service lines while reimbursing homeowners for half their cost. And water professionals in Lansing, Michigan, have honed techniques that make line replacement faster and a bit cheaper, PublicSource.org reported this month. Whether Pittsburgh will be inspired by such efforts remains to be seen.“The approach is evolving,” Dzombak said. “Communities that have been working on this problem for a while have developed knowledge and techniques on the technical side.“What Pittsburgh will do, I think,” he added, “is to be determined.”"

We think the jury got it wrong.”Stewart had testified in his own defense. He was one of 107 people accused of insider trading since 2009 by prosecutors under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. His trial was Bharara’s first since a 2014 appellate ruling narrowed the scope of insider trading laws.Prosecutors said that from 2011 to 2014, Stewart provided his father Robert tips about five mergers, including INC Research’s acquisition of Kendle International Inc, so his father could make lucrative trades before the deals were announced.Robert Stewart, 61, in some instances had a friend he met working at a real estate firm, Richard Cunniffe, conduct trades in his own accounts, because of concern he was too close to the source, prosecutors said.The trading enabled the elder Stewart and Cunniffe, 62, to make $1.16 million, prosecutors said.Robert Stewart, an accountant in Long Island, was sentenced in May to a year of home detention after pleading guilty in August 2015.Cunniffe pleaded guilty in May 2015. Previously, prosecutors said, he secretly recorded Robert Stewart saying his son criticized him for not trading on a tip he handed him on a “silver platter.”Lawyers for Sean Stewart acknowledged he spoke with his father about companies involved in mergers, but said he did so while discussing his work, and that Robert Stewart betrayed him by trading on the information.“I never gave my father information so he could trade on it,” Stewart testified.While jurors heard recordings of Robert Stewart, he did not testify at trial, after he invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination following a subpoena from his son.The case is U.S. v.

The left and right are coming together around an issue that once seemed solely the province of progressives and feminists: paid parental leave.The latest sign of this growing consensus came on Monday when a Republican-backed think tank, the American Action Forum, offered up a new idea for how the U.S. could implement paid maternity, paternity and caregiver leave. More surprising, the new plan is structured like an entitlement ― a government benefit for lower-income Americans of the sort that small-government, deficit conscious conservatives typically detest.Progressive groups hailed the new idea as a sign the issue was gaining wide traction, even as they emphasized it didn’t go far enough in covering middle-class workers. “We’re very encouraged and welcome the discussion the proposal initiates,” said Judith Lichtman, a senior adviser at the National Partnership for Women & Families. “[Paid leave] is a political and policy imperative that leaders have to address whatever their ideological bent.”The Atlantic, which first reported the proposal, called it “a significant moment in the debate over paid family leave.”Authored by Ben Gitis, the forum’s director of labor market policy, the plan offers up to 12 weeks of paid leave to the working poor and is modeled on the already successful earned income tax credit, which helps lift millions out of poverty. Gitis limits its availability to those making under $28,000. The most you could get for taking time off is $3,359.“I think [paid leave] could be something that transcends the aisle but it’s a question of how to get there,” Gitis told The Huffington Post, emphasizing that his plan more than any other is aimed specifically at the most needy workers.Gitis isn’t the first conservative with a plan for paid leave. Over the past year or so, the issue has increasingly come up on the right, as polls have shown that a majority of Americans would support such a benefit. Fifty-five percent of Republicans surveyed by the Associated Press last year said they supported paid time off for workers, compared with 67 percent overall and 82 percent of Democrats.Republicans have floated a tax credit, via the Strong Families Act, for businesses that offer leave. Marco Rubio talked up a similar plan when he was running his failed campaign for president. Ivanka Trump noted her father’s support for paid leave at the Republican convention, but the Republican nominee has not addressed it. Other Republicans in Congress have floated bills that would let workers use overtime to fund their paid leave.Gitis says the current proposals on the right would be inadequate or ineffective. He touts his proposal’s low cost, but he does not specify how the U.S. would pay for such a benefit. He also leaves open the possibility that it could be broadened to include more workers.“We just put the idea out there and see what people think,” he said, adding that the group has sent its proposal out to people on the Hill but hasn’t heard much back yet.Gitis’ group bills itself as center-right, but its hardcore Republican bonafides are clear: Founded by former Republican Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota and GOP donor Fred Malek, who runs a private equity firm and has advised or worked for several GOP presidents, including Ronald Reagan. The forum is run by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economic policy adviser to George W. Bush and former director of the Congressional Budget Office.Gitis himself has previously authored papers arguing that unions are bad for economic growth and that increasing the minimum wage leads to job loss ― positions more common on the GOP side.The United States is the only developed country in the world that does not have guaranteed paid maternity leave; instead, federal law offers 12 weeks unpaid time off for employees at companies with 50 or more workers. The lack of paid leave leads many women to return to work just a few weeks after giving birth or to simply leave the workforce. Lack of leave contributes to the stubborn gender pay gap. Researchers have found women who take little leave are at higher risk for maternal depression, which has devastating effects for mothers and children. On the left and right there are a few proposals on how to fix this. The Family Act ― a bill floated by Congressional Democrats that’s currently stalled out ― would provide for leave through a small payroll tax paid for by workers and employers. It’s supported by Lichtman’s group, among other progressive groups.Right now only 12 percent of workers in the United States have access to paid leave through their employer ― and most of those workers hold higher-paying jobs. Over the past couple of years, more and more elite U.S. companies have been stepping up and giving more paid leave to their workers, including Facebook, Netflix, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. Gitis emphasized that his plan was intended to help those struggling at the bottom, for whom a pregnancy or a family member’s illness can have a devastating financial impact. About 9 percent of workers who take time off to care for a family member end up on public assistance, according to Labor Department data.If you’re a full-time worker earning the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, you’d get $3,359 for leave under Gitis’ plan. That’s $1,000 more than that worker would get under the Family Act. Raising the minimum wage would seem to put far more money in these workers’ pockets. However, Gitis said this wouldn’t necessarily help workers who need leave, arguing that it could endanger their jobs and that the rise in pay wouldn’t help when they took time away from work.He also noted that his plan ― which targets far fewer people ― would cost between $2.7 billion and $31.6 billion per year. The Family Act, he said, could cost at least $85 billion; the National Partnership for Women disputes that number, saying Gitis is using the wrong factors for his estimate. The group says its benefit would cost about $26 billion, entirely funded by the payroll tax.“The Family Act is intended for everyone. This is more a low-income assistance program,” Gitis said.Conservative groups contacted by The Atlantic were quick to dismiss the proposal. “This is social engineering through the tax code,” Andy Roth, of the ultra-conservative Club for Growth, told the publication. He said that paid leave should be left up to the states.A few states already have paid family leave. Most recently, New York passed a law that would provide workers with 12 weeks paid time off, and it’s set to take effect in January 2017.Representative Cathy McMorris-Rodgers (R-Wash.) seemed more open to the possibility ― though she didn’t endorse it, she told The Atlantic: “Proposals like AAF’s open the door to new conversations.” "

22,POLITICS,The Unhappy Campaign Of Paul Manafort,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-manafort-unhappy-campaign_us_57b490f7e4b0edfa80daabf5,He overestimated his own skill set and Donald Trump’s sanity -- and underestimated his enemies and the political danger of his Ukraine ties.,2016-08-17,"Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's campaign chairman, told The Huffington Post in May that “This is not a hard race,” but things have changed since then.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b492c51700001108c73c79.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― This spring, as he was becoming chairman of Donald Trump’s campaign, Paul Manafort told friends that the candidate knew all about his work for foreign leaders and thought the criticism he received for it was a “badge of honor.” That was May. Now, in the heat of August ― after a series of investigative reports on Manafort’s activities in Ukraine ― he is on the losing end of a power struggle in the Trump camp.The Republican presidential nominee has not stepped forward publicly to defend Manafort, and it’s not clear whether Trump knew that Manafort’s work might have had an unregistered (and therefore, potentially illegal) U.S. lobbying component.Manafort may stay on as campaign chairman, but the operational power has shifted elsewhere.The Ukraine implosion comes at the end of a particularly chaotic month, even by Trump standards, in which the campaign Manafort was ostensibly running committed mistake after mistake and plummeted in the polls.Many of those mistakes were of the candidate’s own doing ― but they begged the question of whether Trump was being managed at all. Meanwhile, the campaign’s lack of a ground game, trips to non-competitive states and steady streams of Republican defections begged the question of whether Manafort was up to his job. His enemies within the Trump circle, let by ousted campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, never thought so. Consistently, and often publicly, they worked to undermine whatever real authority Manafort had.In an interview with The Huffington Post in late May, a confident-seeming Manafort bragged prematurely about his success. “This is not a hard race,” he said, citing Trump’s blue-collar appeal and Hillary Clinton’s unpopularity. Trump would not need to put a woman or minority on the ticket and would not need to significantly change his message or methods, just cut down on unforced errors and do a good job in the fall debates.But on Manafort’s watch, the race has turned into a difficult, if not impossible, one.Why?For one, Trump remains unmanageable, especially when advised to rein in his pugilistic, if not deliberately offensive, campaign style.Manafort had reason to know this from the start ― and reason to know that his advice would be ignored.The taco bowl incident, trivial though it was, is one example. On Cinco de Mayo, Trump happened to be eating a taco bowl for lunch at his desk in Trump Tower. Manafort was in the office with other aides when a member of the family suggested they tweet a picture of Trump enjoying his “Mexican” lunch.Manafort politely suggested that this might be seen as condescending and cautioned against it. The tweet went out. Trump himself was delighted by the resulting controversy. “The people who were offended were people we wanted to offend,” he later said.A super-confident bearing is essential in Manafort’s main trade, which involves advising foreign authoritarian leaders on how to win elections using old-style American tactics.But the fact is that Manafort, as shrewd and capable as he is, never managed a presidential campaign, or any high-level American campaign effort. He is a master of conventions and delegate counting, which is an insiders’ game. He is not an outward-facing message, media and U.S. voting expert.And the leading authority on social media and politics in the Trump campaign is Trump himself.“Paul’s knowledge, such as it is, is about 20 years old,” said a longtime adviser to Trump, who declined to be identified and is not in the Lewandowski camp. “He doesn’t know the new demographics or the new media.”Manafort is not known as a debate prep expert, either, which is why Roger Ailes has and will continue to informally advise Trump on debate strategy and other messaging matters.Manafort has not dismantled ― has not been able to dismantle ― the early staff that Trump assembled with Lewandowski, and Trump refused to help him do so.Rather, the GOP presidential nominee maintains a floating array of power centers around him. His office can be crowded with sub-groups vying for attention, undercutting each other. He plays them off against each other, which allows him to keep his options open and deny chain-of-command responsibility that a hierarchy would impose.The almost casual circumstances of Manafort’s hiring added to the uncertainty of who ran what. Trump had known him for years (Manafort has a condo in Trump Tower), and Manafort was recommended to Trump most forcefully and effectively by their longtime mutual friend, international businessman Tom Barrack.Manafort is donating his services as chairman. It’s not clear why, except that it gives both him and Trump a reason to part ways if that ever becomes necessary.Now, it may be.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

They are never eligible to be resettled in Australia.Some asylum seekers have spent years in the camps, which have been criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups, with numerous reports of abuse and self-harm amongst detainees, including children.Some in PNG are unhappy with the prospect of hundreds of asylum seekers being resettled into their country and there have been reports of asylum seekers being attacked by locals.“Both Papua New Guinea and Australia are in agreement that the centre is to be closed,” Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O’Neill said in a statement.“A series of options are being advanced and implemented. It is important that this process is not rushed out but carried out in a careful manner.” There was no mention of a closing date.Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, who met with O’Neill on Wednesday to discuss the camp, reiterated Australia’s position that it would not accept any of the refugees detained in Papua New Guinea.“It has been the longstanding position of this government to work with PNG to close Manus and support those people as they transition into PNG or return to their country of origin,” Dutton said in a statement.“Our position, confirmed again today with PNG, is that no one from Manus Island Regional Processing Centre will ever be settled in Australia.”The announcement came after a newspaper published leaked documents detailing more than 2,000 incidents of sexual abuse, assault and attempted self-harm, reported over two years at the Nauru detention centre.The harsh conditions and reports of systemic child abuse at the camps have drawn wide criticism at home and abroad.Australia says the policy is needed to stop asylum seekers dying at sea on the dangerous boat journey from Indonesia to Australia. Hundreds of people died attempting the trip in the years before the policy was put in place.The move was immediately welcomed by refugee advocates.“Nearly a thousand men on Manus have already lost three or more years of their lives locked up in limbo for no good reason,” Elaine Pearson, Australia director for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.“They’ve endured dirty, cramped conditions, inadequate medical care and violence. Finally, it is time to let them move on with their lives in safety and dignity.” "
