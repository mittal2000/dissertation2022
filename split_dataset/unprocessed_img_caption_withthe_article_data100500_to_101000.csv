Major banks would be protected by the banking union.The German government in Berlin could not be reached for comment.It is still unclear how a euro zone member country could leave the euro and still remain in the European Union, but Der Spiegel quoted a ""high-ranking currency expert"" as saying that ""resourceful lawyers"" would be able to clarify.According to the report, the German government considers a Greece exit almost unavoidable if the leftwing Syriza opposition party led by Alexis Tsipras wins an election set for Jan. 25.The Greek election was called after lawmakers failed to elect a president last month. It pits Prime Minister Antonis Samaras' conservative New Democracy party, which imposed unpopular budget cuts under Greece's bailout deal, against Tsipras' Syriza, who want to cancel austerity measures and a chunk of Greek debt.Opinion polls show Syriza is holding a lead over New Democracy, although its margin has narrowed to about three percentage points in the run-up to the vote.German Finance Minister Schaeuble has already warned Greece against straying from a path of economic reform, saying any new government would be held to the pledges made by the current Samaras government.

You worked really hard. You deserve chocolate, right? Sure, but it might not be all that wonderful.A new study published in the American Psychological Association's Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition suggests that although stress makes us crave rewards and motivates us to obtain them, the reward doesn't actually give us that feeling of intense pleasure we'd anticipated.For the study, conducted at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, researchers recruited 36 university students who described themselves as chocolate lovers and split them into a stress group and a non-stress group. To induce stress, members of the first group had to put one hand in ice water while being observed and videotaped. Members of the non-stress group put their hand in lukewarm water.Participants from both groups then had to press hand grips for the chance to smell chocolate, and researchers measured the amount of effort they put into it. Those in the stress group worked three times harder squeezing the grip, suggesting they really wanted that reward. But they reported enjoying the aroma no more than those in the non-stress group.Although participants were only working to smell the chocolate, the results say something about the disconnect between the strength of a stressed person's cravings and the reward in giving in to those cravings.So why do we want certain foods when we're stressed out? According to a Harvard Mental Health letter, it all has to do with cortisol, a hormone released when we're under stress. ""[C]ortisol increases appetite and may also ramp up motivation in general, including the motivation to eat,"" the letter reads. ""Once a stressful episode is over, cortisol levels should fall, but if the stress doesn't go away -- or if a person's stress response gets stuck in the 'on' position -- cortisol may stay elevated.""If any of this sounds familiar to you and stress-eating is not in your 2015 plans, try implementing mindful eating tips like eating more slowly, paying attention to flavor and silencing distractions like TVs and smartphones. h/t Science Of Us"

The 49ers couldn't have asked for a better drama filled season that began with arrests, rape charges and dismissals. Aldon Smith was arrested over the summer, Colin Kaepernick was accused of rape and Ray McDonald found himself out of a job after being investigated for another assault case.Smith served his time, Kaepernick was exonerated and another team will pick McDonald next year. But for Harbaugh, no one saw that coming. He accepted a head coaching job that will net him in a class of highest paid college coaches. The University of Michigan's timing was perfect. At the helm of Owner Jed York, Harbaugh didn't make the Super Bowl so it was tie to move on.""We compete for and win Super Bowls,"" said York. ""That's our only goal. We don't raise division championship banners. We don't raise NFC Championship banners. We raise Super Bowl banners. And whenever we don't deliver that, I hope you will hold me directly responsible and accountable for it.""In his four years as head coach, Harbaugh led the 49ers to two NFC Championships and the Super Bowl. How is this not enough for a team that hadn't made it to the playoffs since 2002. Every players dream is to win a Super Bowl but when reality sets in, it's only a few teams who get that opportunity. Three consecutive years of making it to the playoffs is an accomplishment.San Francisco has begun their search for a new coach, in the meantime players are in limbo. Hard to believe the 49ers thought this process through because they have no idea who that person will be. Some guys are at the end of their contracts, DT Justin Smith is said to be thinking about retiring and RB Frank Gore is uncertain that the team will bring him back.""It's a business,"" Gore said. ""I wish Coach Harbaugh the best. He's a great coach. My best years, they were with him as a team. He was here and we won. I still love the game and I can still play. I feel great. I want to play again, I want to play next year."" Photo by Univ MichiganMany fans wonder why the sudden need for a new head coach and not a new Offensive Coordinator. The 49ers host the 2016 Super Bowl next year. Was this something both the owner and GM talked about in their decision to part ways with Harbaugh? There wasn't one player that express to having Harbaugh back next season. ""I'm going to miss him [Harbaugh],"" said OL Aaron Lynch. ""He did a really good job here but it was one season where it didn't all come together.""""Harbaugh taught us to always fight no matter what,"" RB Carlos Hyde said. ""My rookie year here reminds me of my freshmen year in college. I didn't play that much, then I got injured and lost our coach. It all happened again this year.""  Harbaugh kept it classy in the end as best as he could. He avoided questions pertaining to the assumed rift between he, York and GM Trent Baalke. While everyone assumed he wanted out early in the season, it appeared to have been a situation with senior management that led to his dismissal. While the players explained they understand it's a business many would've have preferred to keep their head coach.""We had philosophical discussions and when we sat down, we just couldn't come to a place where we thought moving together was the best for either party,"" said York. It was a conversation that took place over a decent amount of time to figure out what's best for everybody involved.""""This isn't a rebuild situation, this is a reload situation,"" Baalke said. The changes that were made last offseason were supposed to be the cherry on top to a perfect offense. What happens now? A new head coach can change that. But Baalke reiterated that any new changes to the team will go through him not the next head coach. He certainly has his hands full in the upcoming months not only with finding a new coach but keeping the roster in tact as well as making changes to improve the offense.Right now there are no front runners in becoming the 49ers new head coach. Baalke who was promoted to GM in 2011 did a good job with putting a good team together thus far but this offseason might be his biggest challenge yet. Though it appears to be a simple solution to York and Baalke it looks as though San Francisco will be starting from scratch to get this team back to playoff contention.""I'm the quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers until they tell me different,"" said Colin Kaepernick. ""Looking forward to finding out who they're going to bring in and what we're going to be working on. But, as far as me, I'm going to continue to work.""""We played for it every year,"" Harbaugh said in regarding the Lombardi Trophy. ""That's the way we looked at it every time we took the field. Been a tremendous thrill. One of the great thrills of my life. Be forever proud of what we accomplished."""

The cleverly titled class, ""Psy-feld,"" allows third and fourth-year medical students in the hospital's psychiatric rotation to discuss the psychopathology of the episodes and characters. Tobia has even created a massive database of all 180 episodes with teaching points for each.""You have a very diverse group of personality traits that are maladaptive on the individual level,” Tobia told NJ.com. “When you get these friends together the dynamic is such that it literally creates a plot: Jerry’s obsessive compulsive traits combined with Kramer’s schizoid traits, with Elaine’s inability to forge meaningful relationships and with George being egocentric.”Tobia is clearly in tune with how younger generations absorb and learn from pop culture today. He has another class where students watch the Coen brothers' 1996 film ""Fargo"" and live-tweet the characters' potential disorders. The methods seem to be working.

The news agency spotted Kim apparently wearing a wedding ring in official photos from Jan. 1, when she accompanied her brother on a visit to a North Korean orphanage, and a ""reliable source in China"" confirmed her new marital status to the agency. An official at South Korea’s Unification Ministry told Reuters that the report could not be confirmed.Kim, who is in her late 20s, wields considerable influence as the deputy director of the ruling party's propaganda unit. She is believed to be close to her brother and has become increasingly visible in North Korea's official media. Choe, reportedly in his early 30s, is the son of powerful party official Choe Ryong Hae. The elder Choe has held several top positions under Kim Jong Un and previously under his father, Kim Jong Il, and Choe's family has long ties with the ruling dynasty, according to the research site North Korea Leadership Watch. Despite rumors that he was caught up in Kim Jong Un's purge of senior officials in 2014, Choe Ryong Hae continues to play a prominent diplomatic role. He took part in a rare delegation to South Korea in 2014 and met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow as Kim's official envoy. It was not immediately clear whether his son Choe Song also works for the regime. The reported marriage may help both families consolidate their power after the turbulence of last year, when Kim had several top officials executed. Agence France Presse notes that the union already appears to have helped Choe Ryong Hae ""secure his position within Kim's inner circle."" Bloomberg writes that the marriage ""would add to signs the Kim family is tightening its grip on power in North Korea.""The notoriously secretive rulers of North Korea are unlikely to elaborate on the wedding tale anytime soon. However, the reported union has caught the attention of U.S. intelligence analysts try to decipher the repressive regime's power dynamics, according to The Christian Science Monitor. “If you’re looking for where this third generation is going, you now have a new key power couple who will shape the direction of North Korea,” Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, told the newspaper.

(AP Photo/Seth Perlman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb318c12600003600820764.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As some wit tweeted a few months ago, the American electorate wants legal pot, higher minimum wages, and the most conservative Congress ever.At any rate, the newly legislated higher wage floors in states and cities across the land, in tandem with a number of annual adjustments in minimum wages for inflation, just went into effect in the new year:All told, 29 states will exceed the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour at the beginning of January, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.By now, about 60 percent of the workforce is covered by minimum wages above the federal level.I've been getting a number of queries about all this, so here's some Q&A:Q: What with all these sub-national increases, do we even need a federal minimum wage anymore?A: Yep. There's still that 40 percent that's covered by the federal level. Though Arkansas just raised their minimum, the federal minimum is still largely the southern minimum. Given the differences in costs of living across the land, state variation makes sense. But even so, to let those in low-wage labor markets just covered by the federal minimum fall so far behind the rest of the country is to foster greater geographical inequalities.Q: What about the unintended consequences? Won't there be job losses?A: I've written many posts about this which you're welcome to dig up, but there's now such a large body of research based on all this regional variation that any debate quickly devolves into cherry picking the study that has the answer you want (i.e., opponents like to see significant job loss effects and vice versa). Therefore, I think it's efficient to be informed by the two meta-analyses I know well, both of which come to the same conclusion:Belman and Wolfson: ""Bearing in mind that the estimates for the United States reflect a historic experi­ence of moderate increases in the minimum wage, it appears that if negative effects on employment are present, they are too small to be statistically detectable.""Stanley and Doucouliagos:""...with 64 studies containing approximately 1,500 estimates, we have reason to believe that if there is some adverse employment effect from minimum-wage raises, it must be of a small and policy irrelevant magnitude.""It is of course plausible that some workers experience hours' reductions or job losses from minimum wage increases. But even the NFIB (small biz lobby) guy quoted in the NYT piece linked above says, ""The likeliest scenario won't be layoffs,"" claiming instead that employers will look for ways ""to avoid creating new jobs.""What is implausible is to suggest that the benefits to low-wage workers are outweighed by the costs. Not even close. Even the oft-cited CBO study, which some believe highballed the job loss impacts, found 24.5 million would get a wage bump (16.5 million directly and 8 million through spillovers) and 500,000 jobs lost, implying a benefit/cost ratio of 49/1.Q: We've already got a problem with labor saving technology displacing workers. Do we really want to incentivize more of that by mandating wage increases?A: This is the ""let's be a third world economy!"" wage strategy: keep wages low enough to dis-incentivize capital investment. Bad idea.First, there's no evidence of any acceleration in the pace at which machines or AI are replacing humans. To the contrary, both productivity growth and capital investment have been laggards of late. But more to the point, to discourage such investments/innovations by ensuring wages stay low is to work against improving productivity, a strategy that's antithetical to economic progress.And again, given the dozens of increases taking place as we speak, if raising the minimum wage displaced large numbers of workers, we'd know it and those meta-analyses would yield much different results.Q: But because it's not keyed off of income the minimum is poorly targeted. Wouldn't it be better to raise the EITC?A: It takes both. The minimum wage and the EITC are make-work-pay complements, not substitutes.First, the minimum wage reaches many poor and near-poor people. The CBO estimates that a federal increase to $10.10 would raise 900,000 out of poverty; Dube finds that increases in the wage floor have historically lifted twice that many out of poverty. And basing targeting judgments wholly on our unrealistically low poverty line is too restrictive: most of the benefits from the typical increase flows to low- and moderate-income households.But let's be very clear about this point: the minimum wage is more than a targeted or means-tested program. It's a labor standard, a floor below which Congress will not allow wages to fall. As with overtime, child labor, or safety standards, the motivation is to block a practice that we as a nation consider inconsistent with our values, in this case, the payment of wages below an agreed upon level.At a practical level while about half the states have state versions of the EITC that piggy back off of the federal one, one just doesn't see states putting higher EITCs on their ballots the way we do with minimum wage increases. I'm not sure why that is, but it may be something about inherent limits to how much governments are willing to redistribute through the tax code.At any rate, given the success of minimum wage ballot initiatives, the momentum of the movement, and the continued evidence regarding their benign impact (if that's how all of these new changes pan out), I suspect we'll continue to see more sub-national action on this issue.This post originally appeared at Jared Bernstein's On The Economy blog."

Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia have borne the brunt of the 20,000 infections and nearly 8,000 dead.The Royal Free, Britain's main center for Ebola cases, successfully treated British aid worker William Pooley with the experimental drug ZMapp after he was flown back to Britain in August.The hospital has not specified which drug Cafferkey is being treated with, but said no supplies of ZMapp were available.On Wednesday, the hospital had said Cafferkey was sitting up in bed, talking and reading. But a doctor treating her warned at the time that the course of the disease could be unpredictable.Ebola is transmitted through bodily fluids, and the hospital said it was treating Cafferkey inside a specially designed tent around her bed with controlled ventilation to reduce the risk of further infections.

She is going home to her live/work studio in Emeryville, California, an unusual coop that provides affordable artist-owned housing. Started in 1973, it has ""grown from a dozen studios in one converted warehouse building to nearly 60 studios in three buildings."" The artists renovated obsolete industrial warehouses into live/work spaces, and now offer tours to those living or just visiting Emeryville--thereby enriching the city of Emeryville culturally; and established a Youth Art Program which initially offered tutorials and field trips to promising high school students. The Cooperative's Emeryville Youth Program has now been ""integrated into the Emeryville Unified arts curriculum bringing professional artists into the classroom.""Today, as a non-profit, limited-equity housing cooperative, The 45th Street Cooperative, as it is called, claims to be ""a national model for affordable artist-owned housing."" But is it really?What artist group can afford to buy in today's real estate market? The soaring rents that most markets require coincide with the demand for artists and art and cultural districts to give a city vibrancy and economic growth. Randy Cohen, who researches and promotes sustainable arts policies at Americans for the Arts, acknowledges the dilemma and is fearful that cities will fail to come to grips with the urgent need for affordable artist housing. And thus, fail to make the transition to the new creative and innovation economy.Unfortunately, given the cost of housing in some areas of the country--usually attributable to the artists and/or the art and cultural districts, which have grown up around them--it is probably too late. A crisis is looming.Take San Francisco, just a few miles away. This is a city/county, in real trouble. Thanks in part to spillover of high tech startups in nearby Silicon Valley, San Franciscans now pay the highest median rent per bedroom in the country... about 4.5 percent higher than New York. According to KQED, "" Housing is a major issue for artists in San Francisco. The city does well compared with others around the nation when it comes to funding artists' work. But the city's efforts to create affordable live/work spaces for artists haven't panned out. Many local artists are now worrying that the high cost of housing will force them to leave the city and abandon their creative community.""Tom DeCaigny, cultural affairs director for the San Francisco Arts Commission, applauds the formation of The Community Arts Stabilization Trust (CAST) which will be purchasing and leasing space for the exclusive use of nonprofit arts organizations. CAST says, ""Without our support, some of San Francisco's most vital arts organizations might be forced to leave because of the rising cost of real estate."" He has expressed concern, however, that the cost of a studio or one bedroom is over $3000 per month in the heart of the city and is working with the Housing Authority and the Mayor's Office to find solutions. He knows that government can't solve these problems itself and is looking to private philanthropy and the nonprofit sector to foster new innovations in shared nonprofit space. Some non-profits like Project Artaud, a pioneering arts complex in San Francisco's Mission District, rehabilitated and converted a factory, and an entire city block to create housing and studio space, artists' resources and community homes to over 70 painters, sculptors, designers, photographers, filmmakers, writers, musicians and performers. Project Artaud is supported by its membership, by grants from the Cultural Facilities Fund Bay Area Program and the San Francisco Art Commission's Creative Space Program, and by individual contributions. There are others of course, spread across the city, trying to raise funds to buy properties and advocating for artists but making only a small dent in a much bigger problem. For San Francisco, and most cities, a more comprehensive, proactive strategy and plan is called for.Minneapolis based Artspace has been tackling this problem since 1979 and today ""own(s) and operate(s) 35 projects across the country. Twenty-six are live/work or mixed-use projects comprised of more than 1,100 residential units. Our portfolio of projects is rounded out with non-residential projects that provide space for artists and cultural organizations.""It was always an advocate for artist housing and in the early beginning, provided a referral service for artists looking for housing. After a short time however, said Melodie Bahan, V.P. of Communications for Artspace, they began to see the same faces, the same artists, looking for a place to live. They then ""made the leap from advocate to developer"", and began to build and take a more proactive role. Their first ""live/work projects were in Saint Paul: the Northern Warehouse Artists' Cooperative (1990), Frogtown Family Lofts (1992), and Tilsner Artists' Cooperative (1993)."" They now have developed properties in 35 states , and growing. ""Twenty-six are live/work or mixed-use projects comprised of more than 1,100 residential units. (Their) portfolio of projects is rounded out with non-residential projects that provide space for artists and cultural organizations."" With support form the Ford Foundation, the Kresge Foundation and not surprisingly ArtPlace which receives funding in part from some of the same foundations, Artspace is now a national leader in the field of developing affordable space that meets the needs of artists through the adaptive reuse of historic buildings and new construction with offices in Los Angeles, New Orleans, and Washington D.C.Communities that know the value of vibrant communities must insure that the artists, who helped foster that vibrancy, not be forced to move as the art and culture districts--often at the center of the community--are forced to move because of the increase in the price of real estate or rental costs. It's that simple but often not thought of until its too late."

When she hits the stage of venerable Manhattan nightspot 54 Below on Jan. 2, the British singer-songwriter, 60, will tackle songs by Bruce Springsteen, Noel Coward, Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, among others. Still, she says anyone seeking inspiration as far as resolutions or explicit messages are concerned would be better served elsewhere. “I don’t ever want to feel that I’ve become a message bearer, other than…I would like there to be joy in the world through the medium of what I do as a musician and an artist,” Jungr told The Huffington Post in an interview. “By excavating what we excavate, we allow the possibility that we can see the whole landscape. “Jungr, who is of both Czech and German descent, has been labeled a chansonnière in Europe, but her musical interpretations often defy classification stateside. While she was hailed as the ""high priestess of cabaret"" by Time Out New York, Jungr makes it clear that her aspirations extend into other genres, too. “I think I’m a cabaret artist and a jazz singer,” she said. “Because I improvise, re-harmonize [and] I deal with music in a certain way, my feet are in jazz. But my sensibility is in cabaret.” In November 2014, Jungr brought another show, “Hard Rain,” to New York’s 59E59 Theater. Jungr says she sees that show, hailed by The New York Times for its “astounding emotional range,” and her album of the same name as the politically-edged counterparts to “Mad About The Boy,” which was conceived prior to “Hard Rain” and features a fearlessly romantic, though unsentimental, tone. As both shows evidence, Jungr is perhaps best known for her interpretations of Dylan's songs. Regarding her tendency to emphasize material written by male singer-songwriters, she noted, “I get to understand things that I don’t necessarily understand. It’s the word made fresh. It’s a revelation to me.“Above all, Jungr, who says she’s a fan of Eliza Carthy, Gillian Welch and Meghan Trainor among other contemporary female performers, favors material with an edge, even if she doesn’t like to “intellectualize” her set lists too much beforehand. “I like songs that strip away the stuff, so that when you’re singing them, you access something that goes beyond words and people can also access within themselves -- who knows what it is? It’s best we don’t ever try and nail that down,” she said. “But I like a bit of bite to the work. I want a little bit of kicking, a little bit of irreverence. I want a little bit of knickers off and here’s my backside.” Barb Jungr's ""Mad About The Boy And No Regrets"" plays New York's 54 Below on Jan. 2-4. Head here for more information.  "

Around that same time, Owner Lurie sung the praises of Roseman and Kelly equally, while conveniently leaving out Gamble's name. Less than a week later, Gamble was fired.The entire thing is being labeled a swinging-­of-the-­power-­pendulum towards Roseman and away from Kelly. It's thrilling if you're into football front office politics, but head-­scratching if you care about actually winning football games. No football franchise wins Super Bowls with a front office that thinks its opponents are in house.The question Iggles fans should be asking shouldn't be who won the power struggle? It should be why does a power struggle exist at all?It boggles the layman's mind that such successful people can't find a way to coexist. Making this study in stupidity even more frustrating is that football fans just watched this same act play out with disparaging results in San Francisco.The 49ers essentially wasted the last year of football, slogging awkwardly towards an inevitable splitting of egos that left everyone worse off. Despite going 44-19-1 with General Manager Trent Baalke and Head Coach Jim Harbaugh, the pair could't co­-exist, and they blew the whole thing up. This very public divorce has been a huge loss for all parties involved, with no bigger loser than the fans (feel free to count the Niners players as the second biggest losers, as they had to waste a year of their short professional careers following broken leadership).The 2014 49ers should have stood as a cautionary tale for all sports franchises; if you have a machine that's working, don't let anything start pulling the pieces away. Especially ego.The Eagles brass is apparently incapable of learning this elementary lesson. The fact that the lesson is so readily on display in such recent history is what makes the Eagles front office dysfunction all the more baffling.In the end, it's on Lurie. It's his shop, and it is up to him to MAKE THIS WORK. The combo of Roseman and Kelly is 20-­12 since its pairing, not quite as good as Harbuagh-Baalke, but pretty close. The Eagles are on the path towards success... big success. The kind of success that ends in parades.The only thing that can stop them is themselves. Ego was the opponent that took down the 49ers. The fact that the Eagles so quickly appear to be repeating that embarrassing history is ignorance at its finest."

It asked why there were apparently so few police on duty for the tens of thousands thronging Shanghai's famous waterfront, known as the Bund.""It was a lack of vigilance from the government, a sloppiness,"" the news agency wrote.Xinhua noted that the crush happened not far from a much trumpeted new free trade zone described as the ""pride of the country"".""The disaster, which happened in China's financial hub of Shanghai, served as a wake-up call that the world's second-largest economy is still a developing country which has fragile social management,"" it said in an English-language commentary.Shanghai people echoed those complaints. ""There was not enough policing and planning. It is really sad to see a stampede happen in a big city like Shanghai,"" said resident Tang Lifeng, 38.The site of the stampede was cordoned off on Friday, with grieving relatives holding a candlelight memorial. Most victims were students in their 20s.City officials said one Taiwanese was among the dead. Of the 47 injured, 13 were in critical condition, they said.The waterfront has become a New Year countdown site in recent years after authorities brought in performances such as 3D light shows and fireworks. Celebrations in 2013 drew more than 300,000 revelers.Police have given few answers, saying an investigation is going on. On Thursday, they did not allow foreign media into a briefing, underscoring concern about negative coverage.They have dismissed reports that a rush to pick up coupons thrown from a bar overlooking the Bund was the cause, with focus shifting to overcrowding on a raised viewing area.The stampede has prompted unflattering comparisons with India, where stampedes are relatively common, another rapidly developing country and rival that many Chinese feel superior to.""I originally thought that stampedes like this could only happen to Indians on pilgrimages,"" Cheng Daolin, a manager at a Chinese engineering company, wrote on Weibo, China's answer to Twitter.""In the space of one night, China has become like India, and Shanghai has become like Mumbai,"" wrote another Weibo user.(Editing by Robert Birsel)"

She did all that. She worked in a cafeteria while earning college degrees in nutrition. She was married to a doctor in Dallas. She brought up three children. She helped thousands of expectant mothers learn about nutrition and the benefits of breastfeeding through jobs with the City of Dallas and Methodist Hospital.But this week, Thelma Tun Thein is leaving her life in America behind to return to her native Burma, also known as Myanmar. She's going back to help people in that long-oppressed country achieve their dreams.""My number one motivation is to do something to help my people. If I don't, it will haunt me,"" she said over the holidays. She revisited Burma last year to give workshops on maternal health and nutrition and was shocked by what she saw. Malnutrition is chronic. More a third of the children under five have stunted growth. She had her photo taken with a young girl who looked around the age of 12 and was several inches shorter than Thelma's 5 foot, 2 inches. The girl was actually 18.Thelma Tun Thein teaching maternal and infant careBurma's mortality rates for infants and children under 5 are the highest in Southeast Asia, according to UNICEF. Most deaths are caused from low birth weight due to malnutrition, treatable diseases, and prematurity. Saving children has not been a priority for the generals who have ruled the country for more than 50 years. Only three percent of the budget is dedicated to health, compared to more than 20 percent for defense.Generals still control the reins of power, although steps have been taken toward a ""Burma Spring."" The economy has been opened to the world of investment, with Coca-Cola, MasterCard, Hilton, Ford and even Kentucky Fried Chicken setting up shop in what was once a pariah state. The government has invited the 3 to 5 million Burmese expatriates who fled in past decades -- especially the educated professionals -- to return to help rebuild the country. Academics with degrees from Harvard, Cornell, and Berkeley have come back to work on economic policy and what seem like never-ending peace talks. Accountant Jasmine Thazin Aung came back to head the Burma office of PricewaterhouseCoopers. Entrepreneur Thar Htet returned to run a high-tech start-up. Film director Midi Z returned to make a movie called -- what else -- Return to Burma.But many expats are hanging back because the military has not relaxed its grip on Parliament. Unfair barriers have been put in place to keep Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi from running for President this year. Journalists are still being jailed. Corruption is rampant. Attacks on ethnic groups continue. Despite any risks, Thelma Tun Thein is determined to return. She knows she has the skills to save young lives. And she developed a commitment to helping others early. Her father left Burma to serve as a U.N. diplomat in Thailand in the 1960s. She grew up in a house in Bangkok where Burmese refuges often stayed for long periods while waiting for visas. ""We didn't suffer the same poverty or persecution as those inside Burma,"" Thelma acknowledges. ""They suffered every day. We suffered for them.""Sent to study in Texas in the 1970s, she was one of two Asians in her high school class. Other students would ask her things like ""Do Asians have cars?"" or ""Is it true Asians don't sweat?"" She would reply, ""In Texas, they do.""In Dallas, she became known as the den mother of the thousands of Burmese refuges in the area. Since she speaks Burmese, English, Thai, and a little Spanish, French and Korean, she provided translations for those in the hospital. She tutored literacy classes. She explained to newcomers how to pay their phone bills and their rent. When the Bush Presidential Center wanted to include local Burmese in discussions, Thelma brought a roomful. But mostly, Thelma counseled pregnant women of all races and ethnicities in Dallas about healthy choices. Quite a few named children after her. Even those who weren't Burmese called her ""Saya ma,"" which means teacher. Her family name Tun Thein means ""brightness of a hundred thousand lights"" -- that perfectly describes her smile, which can be seen across a room. As she finished packing for her new job at a Rangoon hospital, Thelma said she wanted to be like the Psalm: a tree planted by rivers of water, with leaves that would not wither, but bear fruit. ""I just want to be an asset,"" she said. Though unsung, her record here in the U.S. is testimony she will indeed.

Some celebrate by remembering episodes from the life of the Prophet Muhammad or by reciting devotional poetry and hymns. Parents are given the opportunity to teach their children about the Prophet's teachings, bravery, and forgiving character. Some families also make sure to donate to charity on this day.There is some debate over whether this date should be observed by Muslims -- with some arguing that the practice glorifies the Prophet above his humanity and others saying that Muhammad and his immediate contemporaries never celebrated this birthday.Omid Safi, Director of Duke University's Islamic Studies Center, explained it this way: For the Muslims who honor Muhammad’s Mawlid, it’s the deep love for Muhammad that brings them closer to God. For those who identify as Salafi, and wish to abide only by practices that they believe originate in the Qur’an and the example of Muhammad, it is a way of honoring the desire to practice Islam as Muhammad would have wanted us to do, without what is deemed to be later accretions and potentially dubious practices.

But the numbers refer to illegal killings and trade in rhino horn is prohibited globally.Rhino horn is coveted in Vietnam and China as an ingredient in traditional medicine. Conservationists say it fetches up to $65,000 a kilo on the street, making it more valuable than gold.The toll often rises in December, possibly because poaching syndicates want to stock up ahead of the Chinese New Year in February.Many of the rhino poachers in South Africa come from neighboring Mozambique, one of the world's poorest countries where villagers are tempted by the promise of quick money.Poaching centers on South Africa's flagship Kruger National Park, which borders Mozambique and is a major tourist draw, making the issue a state priority, with the Department of Environmental Affairs saying in November that over 340 arrests had been made so far in 2014 in connection with the scourge.Rhino horn, which only weighs a few kilos, is relatively easy to smuggle and its price has spawned a web of routes, with 16 members of a syndicate suspected of involvement in the trade arrested late last year in the Czech Republic. TIPPING POINTFinal estimates for elephant poaching across Africa in 2014 will not come out for some time, but conservationists say the number of the animals being slain for ivory -- valued for decorative purposes in China -- is likely exceeding the number being born.This suggests a ""tipping point"" of population decline is in prospect for Africa's 500,000 elephants.""2015 will be key, possibly the most significant yet in the battle to save the world's iconic animals,"" said Richard Thomas, spokesman for TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring network.""If the resources now being directed at this fail to put a big dent in the poaching figures, we need to find out what went wrong and why and amend our approach,"" he told Reuters.At least 20,000 elephants were poached annually from 2011 to 2013, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), a U.N.-linked agency.Killing elephants and smuggling ivory from their tusks is a trickier business than rhino poaching and selling horn. Elephants are bigger, warier, and more dangerous, and their tusks can reach lengths of a meter or longer.A CITES report two years ago noted that for smuggled ivory, ""Trade patterns have shifted to Indian Ocean seaports,"" and the sheer quantities of cargo moving through Asian ports ""makes detection of concealed ivory a severe enforcement challenge.""There have also been allegations of official complicity. In November, Tanzania denied allegations by a campaign group that Chinese officials smuggled out large amounts of illegal ivory in diplomatic bags during a state visit by President Xi Jinping.Foreign Minister Bernard Membe acknowledged that Tanzania -- where conservationists say 10,000 elephants were killed in 2013 -- was among the world's major sources of smuggled ivory, but denied that the Tanzanian and Chinese governments were involved in the internationally banned trade.In Africa's newest state, South Sudan, the current onset of the dry season may trigger more poaching in a country where the elephant population has fallen from 80,000 to 2,500 over the past four decades.The U.S.-based Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) says that eight of the almost 30 elephants it had radio-collared in the country for monitoring purposes were poached last year amid fighting between government forces and rebels.Aside from poaching for illicit ivory sales, elephants and other animals are also being killed by both sides for their meat, WCS said.

This year, for the first time ever, the parade hosted a float that celebrated the important and little-known history of Sikhs in America -- and it couldn't have come at a better time.In the midst of hate crimes and verbal attacks, the float told another side of the roughly 125-year history of Sikhs in America. A collaboration of United Sikh Mission, SikhLens, Khalsa Care Foundation, SALDEF and a team of dedicated Sikhs around the country, the float aimed to raise awareness about Sikhism in America, both past and present.“The theme of this year’s Rose Parade is inspiring American stories,"" Rashpal Dhindsa, founder of United Sikh Mission told the Huffington Post. ""That is why the Sikh American story was such a great fit for the parade organizers this year.” The float was modeled after the Stockton Gurdwara, the first Sikh house of worship established in the United States 102 years ago, SALDEF said in a press release. Also included in the design was a cornucopia and a locomotive to represent Sikh laborers and farmers like Didar Singh Bains, known as the ‘Peach King of California’ for growing the largest number of peaches in the country.Twelve community members, including members of California-based police forces, the national Army, a film student and civil rights advocates, were also featured on the float to display the diversity and values of the Sikh community.""It's not what we believe in,"" Rashpal Dhindsa, who came up with the idea of the Rose Parade float, told Los Angeles Times. ""It's about who we are.""The float arrives at a time when misperceptions and antagonism run high against Sikhs in the United States. In 2013, SALDEF teamed up with researchers from Stanford University to conduct the first public perception assessment of Sikh Americans -- entitled Turban Myths -- which revealed discouraged results. Seventy percent of Americans could not identify a fellow Sikh American and one out of every five Americans experienced anger or apprehension when they saw a Sikh stranger with a turban and beard. It is because of these misconceptions that activist and PhD candidate Simran Jeet Singh said the float's ability to raise awareness was ""a life and death proposition."" Writing in TIME about his decision to fly to Los Angeles to stand on the float, Singh continued:The story of Sikhs in America is compelling because it is the quintessential American story. Sikhs came to this country in the late 1800s to make a better life for themselves and their families. [...]“By bringing our shared American history to the forefront at the Rose Parade, we are addressing bias and generating major Sikh American awareness,"" Jasjit Singh, Executive Director of SALDEF, explained. ""This New Year’s Day, we are celebrating our Sikh American ancestors and our ongoing commitment to ensure that America is a land in which all Americans can pursue their unalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”Scroll down to read a brief timeline of Sikh American history, provided by SALDEF:1899-1917: Sikhs begin to migrate to California working as laborers and farmers; migration was severely curtailed by Immigration Act of 1917 (a.k.a. Asiatic Barred Zone Act). Legal migration from Asia ended with the National Origins Act of 1924.September 4, 1907: A lynch mob of several hundred attack and rob the homes of Sikh millworkers in Bellingham, Washington.October 24, 1912: The first Sikh American Gurdwara is founded in Stockton, California.1913: The Ghadar party—an independence movement from British colonialism—was founded in Astoria, Oregon; California Alien Land Law of 1913 bars South Asians and other groups from owning property.1920: Sikhs march in New York City’s St. Patrick’s Day Parade wearing green turbans and carrying signs that read: “300,000,000 of India with Ireland to the last” because “our cause is a common cause,” demanding unconditional independence for India and Ireland.1923: In United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, the U.S. Supreme Court rules that Thind— a U.S. Army veteran who sought naturalization— was “not white” and could not become a U.S. citizen. Asians were barred from citizenship until the Luce-Celler Act of 1946 is signed into law allowing Indians to naturalize and become citizens.January 3, 1957: Dalip Singh Saund from San Joaquin, California (C.A.’s 29th Congressional District) becomes the first Sikh American and APIA elected (in 1956) to the U.S. Congress.1965: The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 lifts restrictions and exclusions, allowing Asians to immigrate more freely to the U.S.1981: Sikhs are barred from serving with their articles of faith in the U.S. Military—despite the extensive participation of Sikhs in both World Wars— ending a long-standing religious accommodation. As of today, three Sikh American soldiers have been given exemptions to serve with their articles of faith.September 15, 2001: Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh American gas station owner, was shot five times and killed, becoming the first American to lose their life as a result of a hate crime after September 11th.October 2008: Jaspreet Kaur Saini becomes the first Sikh American female lawyer in the Armed Services (Navy JAG).May 2012: Washington, D.C. becomes the first major city in the U.S. to allow Sikh American police officers to serve with their articles of faith.August 5, 2012: A white supremacist gunman, Wade Michael Page, attacked a gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six Sikh American members, and injuring four others, in the deadliest attack on a place of worship since the Jim Crow Era."

Seaman(Reuters Health) - U.S. teens report easy access to firearms, even when they have mental health problems that put them at an increased risk of suicide, according to a new study.Overall, 41 percent of teens who reported being in a home with a firearm had easy access to it. Among teens with a history of mental illness or suicidal acts, researchers found that percentage was the same. The American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics advise healthcare providers to talk about firearm safe storage with parents - especially those with at-risk youths at home.""Our goal of this study was to find out if those recommendations were being implemented effectively in the community,"" said Dr. Joseph Simonetti, the study's lead author from the University of Washington School of Medicine's Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.Simonetti and his colleagues write in JAMA Psychiatry that suicide is the second leading cause of death for U.S. teens. Having a firearm in the home is one risk factor for suicide, they add.Previous studies have found a lower suicide risk among residents of homes that practice safe storage of firearms.For the new study, the authors used data collected between 2001 and 2004 from 10,123 U.S. teens between ages 13 and 18 years.A third of the teens reported living in a home with a firearm. Of those, about 41 percent said they had easy access to that firearm and the ability to shoot it.Older, male and non-Hispanic teens were more likely to report being able to access firearms. Those living in rural or wealthy households were also more likely to report access.Among the teens with histories of mental illness or suicidal actions, such as thoughts or attempts, the researchers found they were just as likely as those without such histories to report firearm access.""There is a disconnect between these generally agreed upon storage methods and what's happening in the community,"" Simonetti said.He cautioned that the data included in this study is old. ""One of the limitations of this study is we're using data that was collected from 2001 to 2004,"" Simonetti said, adding that he and his colleagues can't say how practices may have changed since then.""We need better studies on how to promote safe firearms storage especially in households with children and children with mental illness,"" he said.Simonetti said some effective safe storage methods include using gun locks and gun cabinets and hiding the keys from children.SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1xftWKo JAMA Psychiatry, December 30, 2014."

Security Council resolutions, may also be involved in the restaurant business in Cambodia, the coal industry in China or in selling manganese to the Malaysians,"" said Joshua Stanton, a lawyer and blogger at FreeKorea.us who has helped advise the House Foreign Affairs committee on sanctions legislation.It is almost impossible to estimate exactly how much of Pyongyang's revenues come from the illegal sale of weapons and drugs overseas. A 115-page report published last year by the Washington-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea estimated that illicit activities account for up to 30 percent of the country's trade. It's difficult to sever North Korea's trade networks. Under a United Nations resolution enacted to pressure the country to abandon its nuclear weapons program, countries are given broad authority to search ships for North Korean cargo.""Not all countries have the capacity to exercise that ability,"" said Kelsey Davenport, director for non-proliferation policy at the nonprofit Arms Control Association. ""Countries don't always quickly report back if there are concerns, and we don't hear about issues until months later.""However, sanctions have been most effective against North Korea when imposed on financial institutions that manage the country's treasure.In 2005, the Treasury Department began investigating Banco Delta Asia, a small family-owned bank in the Chinese gambling enclave of Macau. Under Section 311 of the Patriot Act, the department was granted a mandate with a broad set of tools to pursue any money laundering connected to terrorist groups. Wielding its newfound financial weapon, the Treasury warned that the bank would be barred from any dealings in the U.S. financial system, causing a run on the bank. Cut off from about $24 million, North Korea became a financial pariah as banks and other institutions began to back away, fearing similar actions by the U.S.""Despite the fact that the U.S. has no trade with North Korea, there were no bank accounts in the U.S. frozen, and this was not the subject of some U.N. measure, the North Koreans found themselves isolated in a way they never felt in recent memory,"" Juan Zarate, author of a book on Section 311 called Treasury's War, said in a 2013 Q&A with The Wall Street Journal. ""It was the first time the North Koreans called the White House to initiate talks. They began and ended every conversation saying they wanted their money back.""The sanctions were eventually lifted under the George W. Bush administration after Pyongyang began testing nuclear weapons in 2006. But the sanctions announced on Friday could be aimed at cultivating a similar fear among financial institutions and within the current North Korean regime. ""They have the effect of instilling some psychological doubt in Kim Jong Un,"" said Sung-Yoon Lee, an assistant professor of Korean studies at Tufts University's Fletcher School. ""Is that going to change Kim Jong Un's behavior overnight? No. But the longer the duration and greater enforcement of sanctions, the strong the U.S. will be when negotiating later on.""To effectively punish North Korea for its diplomatic belligerence and alleged role in breaching Sony's servers, the U.S. must make it difficult for regime leaders to access their money, Davenport said.""The Kim regime's primary concern is regime survival, not the well-being of the North Korean people,"" she said in an interview on Friday. ""Pressures on the economy alone will not drive the Kim regime to make decisions in the same manner that other countries would."""

A spokeswoman for Perelman's MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc had no comment.The case is Meyers v. Revlon Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. No. 14-10213.
