0,HEALTHY LIVING,Ebola Can Stay In Survivors' Semen Way Longer Than Expected,Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ebola-in-semen_us_57c6e9bae4b0a22de0934dbc,"“With this study, we now know that virus may persist for a year or longer.”",2016-08-31,A study of Ebola survivors in Liberia has revealed that the virus can stay in some men's semen for over a year. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c7022a1800002b19bce5b3.jpeg?cache=am1WuKSlzB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A study of Ebola survivors in Liberia has revealed that some men can remain carriers of the deadly virus for more than a year and a half after their recovery ― not months, as previously believed.The surprising news was published in Lancet Global Health this week following a study of semen samples taken from 466 Ebola survivors enrolled in Liberia’s Men’s Health Screening Program.Of those samples, 38 of them tested positive for the virus at least 12 months after the provider recovered from the disease. Most of these men were older than 40 years old, according to the report.One patient’s sample returned positive for the virus 565 days after he recovered.“Before this outbreak, scientists believed that Ebola virus could be found in semen for three months after recovery,” stated Dr. Moses Soka of the Liberian Ministry of Health, who helped conduct the research. “With this study, we now know that virus may persist for a year or longer.”Though those who tested positive had “only a small amount” of the virus in their semen, researchers warned in their report that “even low levels of [the] virus can result in transmission.”Officials discovered sexual contact could possibly spread the virus back in March 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which works in collaboration with the MHSP and other health groups, stated in a release Tuesday.A woman in Monrovia, Liberia, died after becoming infected by the virus, despite Liberia being declared Ebola-free at the time. It was later determined that her only contact with the virus was through an Ebola survivor with whom she had unprotected sex. That man’s semen was tested and found positive for the virus, 199 days after he first became ill. The CDC noted that there’s no way to tell whether the virus in a positive sample is live and capable of spreading disease. Still, health officials recommend that men continue using protection during sex.After they provide two negative samples over two months, men “graduate” from Liberia’s MHSP’s program. In addition to discovering more about the virus, the MHSP has made significant milestones when it comes to educating Liberia’s public about safe sex, CDC officials say.Since the program’s inception, nearly 75 percent of participating Ebola survivors who initially said they didn’t use condoms during sex now say that they do.CDC Director Tom Frieden applauded the program’s all-around work.“This program provides important insights into how long Ebola remains in semen, a key component to preventing flare-ups of the disease and protecting survivors and their loved ones,” he stated in a release. “It also shows how investments in public health capacity can save lives.”There are still many questions that remain unanswered as studies are in their early phases, the Lancet Global Health report notes.One specific question researchers have is whether experimental antiviral drugs — ones that have been proven to fight Ebola — can accelerate the virus’ removal from the semen and other bodily fluids."

2,POLITICS,New Jersey Governor Chris Christie Vetoes Minimum Wage Hike To $15 An Hour,"By Hilary Russ, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nj-minimum-wage-hike-veto_us_57c6791ee4b078581f102051,The legislation would have made New Jersey the third state to adopt a $15 per hour minimum wage.,2016-08-31,"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (R) vetoed the minimum wage hike, saying the bill failed to consider the ability of businesses to absorb the increased labor costs.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c6795d160000890bbff94a.jpeg?cache=2kHrZbZFFN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Tuesday vetoed a bill to raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 per hour over the next five years.The legislation would have made New Jersey the third state to adopt a $15 per hour minimum wage, Christie said in a statement.State voters agreed to a previous wage hike in 2013, to $8.25 from $7.25. New Jersey’s rate is tied to the consumer price index and is now at $8.38, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL).“Despite having a constitutional mandate in place, the legislature now wants to increase the minimum wage by almost 80 percent just three years later,” Christie said in a statement about his veto.Christie, a close ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, said the wage bill passed by Democrats, who control both houses of state legislature, failed to consider the ability of businesses to absorb the increased labor costs.Neighboring New York State, as well as California, became the first states to lift the minimum wage toward $15 earlier this year.While California’s higher rate will be in effect statewide by 2022, New York created a two-speed system, with different timetables for New York City and nearby counties, versus the “upstate” regions where incomes are lower and labor markets less robust.Some cities are also stepping up to higher wage levels. Washington, D.C.’s minimum wage will reach $15 per hour by July 1, 2020, after it enacted a law this year. The city’s current level is $10.50.Washington and 29 states have set minimum wages above the federal rate of $7.25 an hour, according to the NCSL.Michele Siekerka, president of the New Jersey Business & Industry Association, praised Christie’s veto, saying the increase was “too much too fast.”“Had this bill been signed, it would not only have hurt the New Jersey economy, but it would have hurt the exact workers the proponents of this policy are trying to help,” she said in a statement.Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, lead sponsor of the bill, said in a statement the wage increase is a key component to Democrats’ strategy to combat poverty.“A substantial minimum wage increase will help lift countless families out of poverty, decrease government dependency and boost commerce by pumping more dollars back into the economy,” he said."
3,POLITICS,Baltimore's Water Rates Just Went Up. Poor Residents Will Pay The Price.,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baltimore-water-rates_us_57c72a64e4b0e60d31dcda76,Activists and the city alike blame Congress' refusal to spend money on water infrastructure.,2016-08-31,Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake approved a plan Wednesday that will increase city residents' water bills by more than 30 percent over the next three years.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c72f3b1800002100bce69a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The price of water in one of America’s poorest large cities is about to skyrocket.In a controversial move Wednesday, the Baltimore City Council approved a plan to hike the city’s water rate about 33 percent over the next three years, by an average of 9.9 percent each year, in addition to introducing two new fixed fees. The additional funds, according to the Baltimore City Department of Public Works, are necessary in order to fix the city’s crumbling infrastructure and update its billing system in a way it says will be more efficient and accurate. The plan goes into effect in October. These are expensive fixes the city claims it simply can’t pay for without raising rates. Slowing federal support for infrastructure projects, a factor Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake referenced in a previous statement on the rate increase, isn’t helping matters. Federal spending on water and wastewater utility projects has stagnated since the 1980s while the cost to repair the nation’s aging water infrastructure has ballooned. The American Water Works Association, a water safety advocacy group, has estimated that price tag at $1 trillion between now and 2035.Residents and advocacy groups opposed to the rate hike largely agree that Washington deserves the blame for the matter, but also argue Baltimore’s new rate structure will disproportionately impact low-income and senior residents who are already struggling to pay their bill.One resident, Alexis Schofield, who spoke at Wednesday’s meeting said she “simply cannot afford” to pay an extra $50 per month for her water bill, according to the Baltimore Business Journal. The paper noted that some 20 residents testified against the rate hike.Many Baltimore residents appear to be in a similar position.In a report published Tuesday, the national advocacy group Food and Water Watch wrote that some of the city’s residents could actually see rate increases that exceed the widely reported 33 percent figure. According to the group’s analysis, seniors with low water use will see their bill double by 2018 under the current plan, for example.“Municipalities obviously need the money to do what they need to do to provide safe drinking water, but that drinking water doesn’t have to just be safe, it also has to be affordable,” Mitch Jones, a senior policy advocate at the organization, told The Huffington Post. “We have to make sure when we’re looking at rates that we have a structure in place that doesn’t put the burden on lower-income households.”To address the issue of making infrastructure improvements without squeezing those households, the group suggests implementing an income-based water affordability program like one already in the works in Philadelphia. In response to the criticism, Baltimore DPW spokesman Jeffrey Raymond pointed out that some of the city’s water users will actually see their water bill decrease as a result of the change, which will eliminate an existing minimum water charge.The city also moved Wednesday to approve slightly increased assistance for eligible low-income water users — from $179 in annual support to $197 — and to increase the flexibility of its payment plans, Raymond noted.Still, advocates like Jones say that’s not enough support to keep up with the level of need. Many Baltimore households — almost 24 percent of which are poor enough to receive food assistance — are already having a hard time keeping up with their water bills. And Baltimore isn’t the only city where residents are struggling, particularly as water rates have been on the rise nationally.According to the latest data from Circle of Blue, a water-focused news site, water prices in the nation’s 30 largest cities increased 5 percent last year and are up 48 percent since 2010. In the last year, water rate hikes have also been approved or implemented in cities including Phoenix, Los Angeles and Sacramento, California. Those high prices have correlated with high water shutoff rates in some of the nation’s poorest neighborhoods.In Detroit, the city shut off water service to 23,000 homes last year. That’s about 13 percent of the utility’s entire base of residential customers. And though Detroit has pledged to help struggling water users get on payment plans, the shutoffs have continued this year. The city has cut off water for about 150 homes per day since May._____Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

4,POLITICS,Americans Increasingly Believe Labor Unions Benefit The Economy,Janie Velencia,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/labor-unions-economy-poll_us_57c71fb0e4b0a22de093b26b,This is the most optimistic Americans have been about unions since 2006.,2016-08-31,"During the Great Recession, Americans believed labor unions mostly hurt the economy. Now a majority think unions help the economy.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Americans’ perceptions of labor unions and their impact on the economy have reached a five-year peak.According to a new Gallup poll, 52 percent of Americans now believe unions help the U.S. economy, while 41 percent believe they hurt the economy.This represents a 7-point rise since 2011 and it is the most positive Americans have been about the economic effects of unions since 2006, the year prior to the Great Recession. Between 2006 and 2009, Americans’ views on the economic benefits of labor unions dropped 14 points, reaching the lowest position in over a decade. This coincided with the failure of General Motors and Chrysler, two of the big three American auto companies, and the subsequent government bailout.Since then, the opinion of unions has been steadily improving and has nearly recovered to levels seen prior to the Great Recession.Perceptions have improved across party lines, though among Republicans they have improved the least.All in all, Americans are positive about other effects of labor unions. Seventy percent think unions help members of the union and 55 percent believe they help companies where workers are unionized. And overall approval of labor unions is at 56 percent, a 2-point drop from last year, when approval reached a six-year peak. According to the Economic Policy Institute, union membership among men in the private sector dropped from 34 percent in 1979 to just 10 percent in 2013. Among women, unionization has dropped from 16 to 6 percent in the same time period. A study released on Tuesday by the EPI points to declining union membership as one cause of wage stagnation among all Americans. But while union membership overall has been declining for decades, it has seen a growth in the digital media industry. Several big media companies, including The Huffington Post, have unionized in the last couple of years.Gallup surveyed 1,032 American adults via live calls to landlines and cell phones on August 3-7, 2016.

Former Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), a Trump advisor, claims to know the answer: God did it. Bachmann told “The Brody File” of CBN News that “the most high God lifts up who He will and takes down who He will.” She explained: I actually supported Ted Cruz. I thought he was fabulous but I also see that at the end of the day God raised up, I believe, Donald Trump who was going to be the nominee in this election. I don’t think God sits things out. He’s a sovereign God. Donald Trump became our nominee.Bachmann also said Trump was the only candidate who could win the general election. “Maybe I’m wrong, I don’t know,” she said. “But I do know that the Bible is true and that Daniel teaches the most high God, which is one of God’s names, is the one who lifts up who He will and takes down who He will.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
6,POLITICS,Supreme Court Denies North Carolina's Plea To Restore Swath Of Voting Restrictions,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-north-carolina-voter-id-law_us_57c059fbe4b02673444fbe34,The state won't be able to enforce them come Election Day.,2016-08-31,"A supporter holds a sign as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c05c5b1600003503bfea83.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a last-ditch request from North Carolina to reinstate a controversial set of voting restrictions that would have taken effect in the lead-up to the November election.In a one-sentence order that did not include any reasoning, the high court declined the state’s petition, which sought to put on hold a July ruling that found the voting law discriminated against African-Americans and compared it to a relic of the Jim Crow era.The state failed to convince at least five justices that three provisions of the contested law ― its voter ID requirement, cutbacks to early voting and elimination of pre-registration for certain under-18 voters ― were worth putting back on the books. The state had argued the measures were necessary to avoid “confusion” that might keep people away from the polls. But three justices ― Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito ― did note that they would’ve granted the state’s request, at least with respect to voter ID and early voting. Justice Clarence Thomas, for his part, would’ve granted North Carolina’s petition in full.In essence, this means that the Supreme Court voted 4-to-4 in the dispute, with Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan swinging against the state. A ninth conservative member in the mold of the late Justice Antonin Scalia might have given North Carolina a key victory.The president of the North Carolina NAACP, one of the several civil rights groups that challenged the voting law, praised the court’s order on Wednesday.“This critical rejection of the State’s position will allow the people of North Carolina to exercise the fundamental right to vote this November without expansive restrictions by racist politicians or racist policies,” said the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II in a statement. The American Civil Liberties Union also applauded Wednesday’s development.In legal filings, the civil rights groups had countered that the state’s own prior efforts to comply with the July ruling plus “on-the-ground activity” by election officials ― including preparations at the county level ― flew in the face of the state’s insistence that there was not enough time to get things in order for Election Day.“Now, almost a month after the Fourth Circuit’s ruling, State and local elections officials have taken nearly all of the steps to comply with that ruling,” the voting rights groups said in a brief opposing North Carolina’s request. The Obama administration, which in 2013 suffered a big loss when the Supreme Court did away with a key section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, filed its own brief urging the justices to deny the state’s plea, and to not read too much into arguments in favor of a law that was properly found to be discriminatory.The Supreme Court’s move is a significant setback for Gov. Pat McCrory (R), who had defended the law’s voter ID requirement as “common sense” and vowed to seek emergency relief from the high court soon after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit struck it down.But McCrory didn’t follow through on his promise: It took the state 17 days to ask the Supreme Court to inspect the ruling ― a delay that may have played a role in the court’s action on Wednesday.In a statement, McCrory lamented there weren’t enough votes at the high court to side with the state, but commended the justices who did vote in its favor ― while also taking a jab at state Attorney General Roy Cooper (D), who has refused to defend the voter ID law in court and is also leading in the polls in the race for the North Carolina governorship.“North Carolina has been denied basic voting rights already granted to more than 30 other states to protect the integrity of one person, one vote through a common-sense voter ID law,” McCrory said.Allison Riggs, an attorney with the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, which is monitoring these rule changes, was otherwise heartened by the signal the Supreme Court sent.“Hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians will now be able to vote without barriers,” Riggs said in a statement. “The voting booth is the one place where everyone is equal and where we all have the same say.”This article has been updated with comment from McCrory and civil rights groups."

(Reuters) - The first regularly scheduled commercial flight between the United States and Cuba in more than half a century is set to depart on Wednesday, starting a new chapter in the Obama administration’s bid to open trade and travel with the former Cold War foe.The first of several U.S. carriers to begin serving Cuba in the coming months, JetBlue Airways Corp will fly from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Santa Clara, a city in the center of Cuba known for its monument to revolutionary Che Guevara.Among the passengers on the 150-seat Airbus A320 will be U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, JetBlue Chief Executive Officer Robin Hayes, news reporters and photographers and other officials. Regular travelers, including some of Cuban descent, will occupy nearly half the seats on a route that may be a commercial challenge, at least initially.Cuba and the United States began normalizing relations in December 2014 after 18 months of secret talks. The countries had been hostile for more than five decades, since Fidel Castro ousted U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista in a revolution that steered the island on a communist course and made it a close ally of the Soviet Union.Since Obama has been unable to persuade the U.S. Congress to lift a longstanding trade embargo, U.S. citizens are still prohibited from visiting Cuba as tourists. The U.S. government has approved exceptions to the ban, ranging from cultural, religious and educational travel to business and visiting family.Despite those limitations, U.S. airlines have rushed to start flights - adding a lot of capacity and setting themselves up to lose money on the trips in the short run, said industry consultant Robert Mann.“Most carriers look at international markets that have been restricted and are just opening up as an investment,” Mann said. “You need to get your foot in the door.”Services on regional carrier Silver Airways and American Airlines Group Inc from the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area to Cuba’s outlying provinces are the next to start, in September.

While her increasingly popular party thrives on anti-immigration sentiment, she has been more careful in her speeches than Trump has been, keen to make her party more mainstream.“As far as France’s best interest is concerned it’s, ‘Everything but Hillary Clinton’,” Le Pen told CNN in an interview when asked which U.S. candidate she would back.“It’s everything but Hillary Clinton because I believe Hillary Clinton means war, Hillary Clinton means devastation, destabilizing the world, economic choices that would be devastating for my people, geostrategic choices that would lead to global conflicts.”Opinion polls see Le Pen making it to an early May run-off in France’s presidential election but losing that second round to a mainstream candidate as a majority of voters do not want her as president, despite her growing popularity.She shares with Trump a strategy that banks on presenting herself as “anti-system.”“What we have in common is that we’re not insiders, we are not taking part in the ‘system’, we depend on no one and do not take our orders from any financial institutions,” she told CNN in the interview taped and released on Wednesday.Trump has been rebuked by opponents for his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. He has faced criticism even from within his own party for comments seen as insulting women, Muslims and Mexican immigrants."

The virus is best known for causing the severe birth defect microcephaly, characterized by undersized heads and underdeveloped brains. But other studies have shown that Zika can cause other brain abnormalities, vision problems and joint deformities.In the latest study, a team led by Dr. Marli Tenório and Dr. Ernesto Marques of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Pernambuco, Brazil, examined records from 70 infants with microcephaly whose mothers had laboratory-confirmed Zika infections during pregnancy.They found that nearly 6 percent had hearing loss without any other plausible cause.Several other viral infections during pregnancy can cause hearing loss, including rubella and cytomegalovirus, or CMV, infections. The current study adds Zika infection to that list.Scientists say Zika should now be considered a risk factor for hearing loss, and children who were exposed during pregnancy but have normal hearing at birth should be screened regularly for delayed or progressive hearing loss.The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last fall in Brazil, which has since confirmed more than 1,800 cases of microcephaly.

Most of these men were older than 40 years old, according to the report.One patient’s sample returned positive for the virus 565 days after he recovered.“Before this outbreak, scientists believed that Ebola virus could be found in semen for three months after recovery,” stated Dr. Moses Soka of the Liberian Ministry of Health, who helped conduct the research. “With this study, we now know that virus may persist for a year or longer.”Though those who tested positive had “only a small amount” of the virus in their semen, researchers warned in their report that “even low levels of [the] virus can result in transmission.”Officials discovered sexual contact could possibly spread the virus back in March 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which works in collaboration with the MHSP and other health groups, stated in a release Tuesday.A woman in Monrovia, Liberia, died after becoming infected by the virus, despite Liberia being declared Ebola-free at the time. It was later determined that her only contact with the virus was through an Ebola survivor with whom she had unprotected sex. That man’s semen was tested and found positive for the virus, 199 days after he first became ill. The CDC noted that there’s no way to tell whether the virus in a positive sample is live and capable of spreading disease. Still, health officials recommend that men continue using protection during sex.After they provide two negative samples over two months, men “graduate” from Liberia’s MHSP’s program. In addition to discovering more about the virus, the MHSP has made significant milestones when it comes to educating Liberia’s public about safe sex, CDC officials say.Since the program’s inception, nearly 75 percent of participating Ebola survivors who initially said they didn’t use condoms during sex now say that they do.CDC Director Tom Frieden applauded the program’s all-around work.“This program provides important insights into how long Ebola remains in semen, a key component to preventing flare-ups of the disease and protecting survivors and their loved ones,” he stated in a release. “It also shows how investments in public health capacity can save lives.”There are still many questions that remain unanswered as studies are in their early phases, the Lancet Global Health report notes.One specific question researchers have is whether experimental antiviral drugs — ones that have been proven to fight Ebola — can accelerate the virus’ removal from the semen and other bodily fluids."

The legislative body called on Peña Nieto to demand that Trump publicly apologize for the insults he’s lobbed at Mexico, a list that notably includes the 2015 speech where Trump described the country’s migrants as criminals and “rapists.”The resolution also asks Trump to back off from his promise to build a giant wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that he expects Mexico to pay for.  Though Mexico City elected officials can’t stop Trump from entering the country, the declaration adds to the storm of criticism Peña Nieto has received for extending the invitation. Deputy Mauricio Toledo of the left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) offered the proposal Wednesday morning, in response to the surprise news the night before that Peña Nieto had invited Trump to visit. The conservative National Action Party (PAN) joined the PRD in supporting the resolution, as did two smaller parties. “We can’t let a person like Donald Trump perpetually insult the Mexican people,” Toledo told the city legislature. Toledo called on the Peña Nieto administration to seek assurances that Trump won’t develop “a fascist, and above all racist relationship” with Mexico and the rest of Latin America, according to a press statement. The PRD spearheaded a similar resolution back in March, asking the Peña Nieto administration to prohibit Trump from entering the country. That resolution also sailed through with support from the PAN.Peña Nieto ― who has seen his popularity ratings plummet amid a string of personal corruption allegations and his government’s mishandling of the country’s human rights problems ― has largely avoided confronting Trump, despite the GOP nominee’s repeated swipes against Mexico. On Wednesday, Peña Nieto defended his decision to invite Trump, saying on Twitter that he “believes in dialog to promote the interests of Mexico and, principally, to protect Mexicans where they are.” Trump is widely reviled in Mexico. A poll conducted in June by Mexico’s El Financiero showed that only 2 percent of Mexicans viewed Trump favorably. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Scores of free books have been appearing on buses, trams and trains in Melbourne, Australia, for passengers to read and share with each other. It’s all part of Books On The Rail, a program started by copywriter Ali Berg and teacher Michelle Kalus to get strangers to pass around anything from children’s titles to classics. “It’s a lot of fun and we’re just hoping to enrich people’s days,” Kalus told local radio station 774 ABC Melbourne.According to the initiative’s website, people are free to read the books they find and return them to public transportation for others to discover.Stickers on the books help indicate the titles that are part of the movement and also contain instructions on how to handle them.When finished with the book, commuters are encouraged to leave a review for others on the site, or share their experience.“We want people to follow the book’s own journey and adventure, and it’s really special seeing the way people are connecting with the books and each other,” Kalus told the Sydney Morning Herald. Though Books On The Rail started off with Kalus and Berg stealthily leaving their own books around the city, they’ve since involved more people to help with the mission. Now, anyone can become a “book ninja” by signing up through the website. The program has become so popular that publishers and authors are now donating books too. There are currently 300 titles available on Melbourne’s public transportation system.Kalus and Berg’s say their idea was influenced by NYC’s Books On The Subway movement, as well as London’s Books On The Underground.

In the episode, Conway sat in on a discussion about sexual assault in the military. A few days prior to the episode, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta had lifted the ban on women in the military fighting in combat roles.During the discussion, Conway said: “If we were physiologically — not mentally, emotionally, professionally — equal to men, if we were physiologically as strong as men, rape would not exist. You would be able to defend yourself and fight him off.”It should be very, very clear that that is absolutely not how rape and sexual assault work. Firstly, Conway’s statement completely ignores the fact that men are also sexually assaulted. In fact, according to RAINN, one out of every 10 victims of rape is actually male. Her comments also perpetuate the dangerous idea that women should do more to prevent assault or stop it from happening.Conway’s comments aren’t too surprising ― the man whose campaign she’s managing has said similarly infuriating things about women and about sexual assault in the military.

But he and his daughter aren't exactly anti-immigrant in their businesses.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c6e4291800002100bce50e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump has based his campaign on strident anti-immigration antagonism, promising to bring millions of jobs back to America, build a “great wall” to protect the southern border and save Americans from dangerous criminals here to take their jobs.His daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, has offered a gentler, more polished version of his message, in an attempt to make the candidate sound less xenophobic.But like her father’s clothing line, Ivanka-branded products are made overseas using cheap labor. And like her father’s businesses, which use the same guest worker programs he says keep wages down, federal immigration records show that Ivanka Trump’s jewelry enterprise has applied for guest worker visas to hire foreigners.Between 2008 and 2013, Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry applied for five H-1B visas ― which allow companies in the U.S. to temporarily employ foreign workers in certain jobs ― to hire public relations, marketing and operations staff at salaries from $41,370 to $45,000. In a March Republican Party presidential primary debate, Donald Trump said that he used H-1B visas in his businesses, but that the practice was bad for American workers and “we should end it.”Ivanka Trump’s jewelry business also applied for a green card for a public relations analyst in April 2015. Federal records list the salary as $54,642 and the employee’s place of birth as Mexico. Enigma, a data intelligence company, flagged the visa applications for HuffPost.Donald Trump’s Mar-A-Lago Club and Jupiter, Florida, golf course applied for 78 temporary visas to hire cooks, waiters and housekeepers under another visa program, H2-B, that allows businesses to hire low-skilled workers, BuzzFeed reported in July. Trump said he needed to hire foreign workers because “it’s very, very hard to get people in Palm Beach during the Palm Beach season.” (A state-chartered career services center told BuzzFeed it has hundreds of people qualified for the jobs.)The H1-B visa program is usually portrayed as helping bring in highly skilled workers in the science and technology fields to work at companies like Google and Facebook. But the law actually allows for the visas to be used for any job that requires a bachelor’s degree, immigration lawyer Peter Roberts told The Huffington Post.Companies are required to pay the workers they hire with H-1B visas the prevailing wage for a specific position or the salary they pay a current employee doing the same job, depending on which is higher. The prevailing wage is calculated using a national database.While Ivanka Trump’s use of the H-1B program appears to meet this requirement, it is at odds with her father’s complaints about the decline of good-paying American jobs and his harsh rhetoric against immigrants. Trump’s immigration policy says that “immigration reform” is often code for “cheap labor,” and notes that H-1B visas undercut American wages. If elected, Trump would want to raise the prevailing wage companies are allowed to pay H-1B visa workers, and require companies to try to hire Americans before applying for visas for foreign workers.In 2015, the number of applications for H-1B visas hit a record 233,000. Only 85,000 are granted through a lottery process. Published federal records list businesses’ visa applications, but not whether the application was given final approval or if the employee was hired. Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry did not respond to requests for comment.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Melissa Nelson emerged as the Republican primary winner, earning more than 64 percent of the vote compared to Corey’s 26 percent. A third challenger, Wes White, collected less than 10 percent. Corey’s loss was cheered by defense lawyers, academics and even former prosecutors ― many of whom had criticized her aggressive prosecution, particularly of juveniles.  “Corey’s loss is an encouraging sign that the public will no longer tolerate overzealous and unprincipled criminal prosecutions, including women and children,” Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami, said in a statement Tuesday. Even musician John Legend, who cofounded the criminal justice reform campaign #FreeAmerica weighed in on the Fourth Judicial Circuit State’s Attorney’s race. In a statement, Legend said: Prosecutors possess much of the power to end mass incarceration and to make our criminal justice system smarter and more just. They have the power to decide whether to charge or not, how to negotiate ​a plea deal, and whether or not to pursue the harshest punishment possible. ...Today the voters in Jacksonville and throughout Florida’s 4th Judicial Circuit have decided that Angela Corey failed in that responsibility by aggressively seeking the death penalty and egregiously charging juveniles, particularly those of color, as adults. Her tactics have been rejected by her community, and we applaud the voters for rejecting them. This is a sign of positive things to come in our fight for a #FREEAMERICA.Corey’s eight-year tenure was full of controversial cases and a prosecution style critics described as overzealous.Her jurisdiction included Clay, Duval and Nassau Counties and under her watch, Duval emerged as one of 16 outlier counties producing a disproportionate number of death sentences. Corey personally boasted one of the highest rates of death sentences in the U.S. and has sentenced more people to death than any other prosecutor in Florida. Since 2008, she’s cinched 24 death penalty convictions, 19 in Duval County cases. A former public defender noted Corey prosecuted cases other states attorneys “wouldn’t touch.” Tuesday’s primary wasn’t the first time Nelson, a 44-year-old corporate lawyer and former prosecutor, had faced off against Corey.Nelson was part of the team that in 2013 defended 12-year-old Cristian Fernandez pro bono after Corey prosecuted him as an adult and charged him with the first-degree murder of his 2-year-old half-brother. Fernandez was accused of shoving the younger boy into a bookshelf, which caused head injuries that he died from days later. Corey drew criticism for her decision to prosecute a juvenile so harshly ― Fernandez was the youngest person ever to be charged as an adult with first-degree murder in Jacksonville history. He eventually took a plea deal and will be released in 2018, when he’s 19 years old. At the time of the verdict, University of Miami law professor Tamara Lave, who followed the case, told the Florida Times-Union Fernandez should never have been charged with first-degree murder at his young age in the first place. “The way the prosecution and police handled this was unpardonable,” she said.Corey faced similar rebuke for her decision to seek a 20-year sentence against Marissa Alexander, a mother who fired a warning shot at her abusive husband who had threatened to kill her.Alexander rejected Corey’s plea deal and was ultimately tried and sentenced to 20 years after a jury convicted her in 12 minutes. After her conviction was overturned, Corey re-filed the same charges with a 60-year sentence. Corey was accused of being motivated by politics and racial bias in the case. Alexander was ultimately set free under the terms of a new plea deal that capped her sentence. But perhaps none of Corey’s cases drew as much attention as her prosecution of George Zimmerman, the Florida neighborhood watch volunteer accused of shooting 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teen. Corey was appointed the special prosecutor in the Zimmerman case, but failed to get a conviction despite strong evidence Zimmerman was responsible for Martin’s death. She was accused of overcharging Zimmerman with second-degree murder rather than manslaughter, thus setting her office up to lose the case by posting a standard they surely couldn’t meet. Corey’s ouster follows a growing trend of harsh “tough on crime” prosecutors losing their seats to more reform-minded candidates.Earlier this year, Cook County State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez ― who presided over a number of high-profile cases that involved Chicago police shooting civilians like Rekia Boyd and Laquan McDonald ― was roundly dismissed. In Cleveland’s Cuyahoga County, Prosecutor Tim McGinty, who failed to bring charges against the police officer who killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice, summarily lost his seat.Hard-nosed district attorneys in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas faced similar fates after tenures ― sometimes decades long ― of harsh prosecutions. The Nation’s cover story at the time of Corey’s Tuesday defeat featured her on the cover with the accompanying article that asked “Is Angela Corey The Cruelest Prosecutor In America?” “Corey’s defeat tonight continues a small—but important—trend of powerful, incumbent prosecutors losing primary elections for being too aggressive,” Fordham University law professor John Pfaff said in a statement Tuesday. “Tonight is further evidence,” he continued, “that being the toughest prosecutor on the block no longer ensures victory, even in a Republican primary.”Clarification: This article has been updated for consistency to reflect that Corey was a Republican candidate. Due to an editing error, she was at one point identified as a Democrat."

Melissa Nelson emerged as the Republican primary winner, earning more than 64 percent of the vote compared to Corey’s 26 percent. A third challenger, Wes White, collected less than 10 percent. Corey’s loss was cheered by defense lawyers, academics and even former prosecutors ― many of whom had criticized her aggressive prosecution, particularly of juveniles.  “Corey’s loss is an encouraging sign that the public will no longer tolerate overzealous and unprincipled criminal prosecutions, including women and children,” Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami, said in a statement Tuesday. Even musician John Legend, who cofounded the criminal justice reform campaign #FreeAmerica weighed in on the Fourth Judicial Circuit State’s Attorney’s race. In a statement, Legend said: Prosecutors possess much of the power to end mass incarceration and to make our criminal justice system smarter and more just. They have the power to decide whether to charge or not, how to negotiate ​a plea deal, and whether or not to pursue the harshest punishment possible. ...Today the voters in Jacksonville and throughout Florida’s 4th Judicial Circuit have decided that Angela Corey failed in that responsibility by aggressively seeking the death penalty and egregiously charging juveniles, particularly those of color, as adults. Her tactics have been rejected by her community, and we applaud the voters for rejecting them. This is a sign of positive things to come in our fight for a #FREEAMERICA.Corey’s eight-year tenure was full of controversial cases and a prosecution style critics described as overzealous.Her jurisdiction included Clay, Duval and Nassau Counties and under her watch, Duval emerged as one of 16 outlier counties producing a disproportionate number of death sentences. Corey personally boasted one of the highest rates of death sentences in the U.S. and has sentenced more people to death than any other prosecutor in Florida. Since 2008, she’s cinched 24 death penalty convictions, 19 in Duval County cases. A former public defender noted Corey prosecuted cases other states attorneys “wouldn’t touch.” Tuesday’s primary wasn’t the first time Nelson, a 44-year-old corporate lawyer and former prosecutor, had faced off against Corey.Nelson was part of the team that in 2013 defended 12-year-old Cristian Fernandez pro bono after Corey prosecuted him as an adult and charged him with the first-degree murder of his 2-year-old half-brother. Fernandez was accused of shoving the younger boy into a bookshelf, which caused head injuries that he died from days later. Corey drew criticism for her decision to prosecute a juvenile so harshly ― Fernandez was the youngest person ever to be charged as an adult with first-degree murder in Jacksonville history. He eventually took a plea deal and will be released in 2018, when he’s 19 years old.

On Tuesday, Coldplay shared a video on Twitter of a cover of “Pure Imagination,” a song from Wilder’s best-known film, 1971’s “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.”In the clip, you can hear frontman Chris Martin sing the song’s wondrous chorus, as confetti starts to rain down upon an audience, presumably at one of the band’s recent concerts during their international A Head Full of Dreams tour. “Come with me and we’ll be in a world of pure imagination,” Martin coos at the tail end of what sounds like the band’s hit song “The Scientist.”Watch Wilder sing “Pure Imagination” below: "

David, who is 52 and has Down syndrome, loved her job. So it was only fitting that when she retired, she got a huge going-away bash.Over 100 people attended the party at the McDonald’s in Needham, Massachusetts, on Aug. 29. Customers, co-workers, friends and relatives were all there to send David off in style, the Boston Globe reported.David was showered with gifts: two cakes, cards, photo collages, a silver necklace with a McDonald’s french fry carton pendant, her favorite Disney stuffed animals and a proclamation from the state House of Representatives.Any customer who came into the balloon-adorned restaurant during the three-hour party also got a free, small order of fries in David’s honor.“It was nice, I’m really happy,” David said of her time at McDonald’s, per Boston-based outlet WBZ-TV. “I like all my friends here.” One of David’s friends, Christopher Sheehan, who lived nextdoor to her when they were kids, attended the party. He had nothing but positive things to say about his lifelong buddy.“She is one of the most beautiful and upbeat people you could ever hope to know,” he wrote in a Facebook post.David lives in a home in Needham, which is supported by Charles River Center, an agency that creates programs for people with developmental disabilities. The organization helped David get her job at McDonald’s in 1984.“People with disabilities can be integrated in the community and learn new skills and learn new interests so that they can give back to the community and contribute,” Anne-Marie Bajwa, the center’s chief operating officer told WBZ-TV.David’s job at McDonald’s was “her life,” said her mother, Anneliese, per the Boston Globe. She worked five shifts a week, arriving an hour early and sometimes even dancing in front of the fry station in anticipation. On her Saturdays off, David would even come into the restaurant to eat lunch with her mom and give her friends high-fives and hugs.And David still plans on popping in on the weekends for a bite to eat.“Bye, sweetie,” Rony Sandoval, David’s manager, was overheard by the Globe saying to her at the end of her retirement party. “See you Saturday.”"

If they speak up against social injustice they are ‘ungrateful’ and too privileged or not black enough to feel the full weight of their race.

My name is Sharon Kim and I’m just one 25 year old determined to change the way people fight cancer. Why am I spending all my days working to create awareness when the rest of society is pressuring me with bills and expectations? Because I know how much of a pain in the ass cancer can be. I know what it feels like to be lost and confused about all the medical jargons and regimes. And I don’t want anyone to have to go through what my family and I went through.When my mom was first diagnosed with uterine sarcoma cancer back in 2014, I had no idea what the word cancer even really meant. I’ve heard it thrown around in conversations, but it’s just one of those things you don’t think you’ll ever have to come face to face with (millennial thinking I guess). I figured cancer was just a glitch in the road for my mom and she’d make it through to inspire others with her story, which is why I filmed the entire journey (You can watch the tear-jerking video at the end of this post). Well little did I know how naive my mentality was when I was thrown head first into the world of cancer, unarmed and unprepared. Right after her diagnosis, she went straight to surgery and then straight into an intensive round of chemotherapy. Everything was happening so fast that it felt like we had no other choice but to go with it. What made the whole experience even more nerve-wrecking was that we felt so distant from her oncologist. We were constantly waiting on him to give us answers or to tell us what direction we needed to go in, but it always felt like we’d walk out of her appointments empty-handed. Long story short, she successfully got through chemotherapy and we all thought this whole ordeal was over and done with... but boy were we wrong. The cancer came back three months later and it was so aggressive this time around, my mom was sent straight to hospice to pass peacefully. We got to spend another two blissful months with her, before she passed away a few days before my 23rd birthday.As you can see, the loss of my mom took a huge toll on me. So much so that I wasn’t satisfied with just telling people I lost my mom to cancer. I wanted there to be meaning. I wanted justification for her passing. The only way this wouldn’t feel like a loss is if I turned tragedy into inspiration and used my experience to help others facing the same ordeal. I wanted to give other fighters a chance to have a different end to their story. While I was going through all of this, I felt so alone. I had no idea where to turn to for resources or inspiration and I felt like I had no one to talk to about it all. Caregiving also took up 99% of my time, so I really had no energy or time to go looking for these resources. I wish I had an all in one tool that’d provide me with a roadmap for this journey. I wish I had a planner that’d show me what types of things I should be taking notes on, what I should be keeping track of and how to best utilize all this information. CanPlan does not only that, but it also provides daily reminders for positive thinking. It tunes you into the power of the mind and helps you to take action in the here and now and not dwell on the past or worry about the future. It is everything that I could’ve ever asked for while starting my journey with cancer, and I’m so excited to see the potential impact it’s going to make on the cancer community.This blog is really going to be about my journey with CanPlan and the emotional rollercoaster that comes along with dream chasing. I will take you through the ups and downs of running a start-up. I will provide you with all the tools necessary to help you overcome your fears and finally start living a life of meaning/purpose. And I will make you believe that You ‘CanPlan’ to do anything you put your heart into.A little bit more about me? Well, let’s just say that I’m a millennial looking to actually take action in making a positive social impact. I was born and raised on the beautiful island of Oahu and graduated with a BA in Psychology, Business Management & Communications from Santa Clara University. I’m your typical Asian nerd who cares more about my GPA than my relationship status. And yes, I do take pictures of my food. I was class clown in high school so you know I’ll throw in some jokes here and there. I’m very accepting of pity laughs. I’ve worked for various start-up companies in the Silicon Valley and I’ve always had an entrepreneurial mindset, but I’ve always struggled to find passion in what I was doing. Getting up each morning felt like a chore and I found myself constantly waiting for the next Friday or for the next paycheck. Unfortunately, I had to come to the lowest point in my life in order to figure out what it is I truly longed to do in this world. My mom had to die, so that I could finally start living… and that is the painful truth I use as fuel to motivate me to do what I do today. I want my story to teach people that they don’t have to wait until tragedy hits to start living a life of meaning and purpose. Don’t live just to live. Find what you love and let it kill you. Stay hungry and stay curious for it. Even if you have to try and fail a million times before you finally get it right…keep going because that’s far better than living with the guilt of all the “should haves” and “could haves”. Live the best life you possibly can and take action when it comes to your passions. It’s something you will never regret, I promise you.When to Jump, an independent media partner of The Huffington Post, is a curated community featuring the ideas and stories of people who have made the decision to leave something comfortable and chase a passion.

He later told NFL.com it was his way of protesting the treatment of black Americans. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick said. “To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”During the 1968 Olympics, Carlos, who won bronze in the 200-meter dash, along with U.S. teammate Tommie Smith, who won gold, made a bold statement on a world stage to protest the treatment of black Americans. The two took the podium in bare feet, to symbolize the poverty of black Americans. They wore black gloves, which they raised in the air when the “Star Spangled Banner” played. (Smith has since said their protest was misinterpreted as one for the Black Power movement, when it was intended as one for all human rights.)Speaking on San Francisco’s 95.7 FM Monday, Carlos expanded on his view of Kaepernick’s protest.“My view of him sitting down is the same as Rosa Parks sitting on the bus. Rosa Parks was making a statement. Colin is making a statement as well,” Carlos said.Carlos applauded the way Kaepernick is using the NFL’s large audience to highlight issues of racism, police brutality and inequality.“We come out to make these statements to encourage other people to raise their voices enough that people will sit down and have some common discussion about social issues that have been pushed under the rug for eons,” he said.Carlos also hinted that if history is any indication, the vitriol directed at Kaepernick now may eventually soften. He noted that the backlash to his protest ― which included a ban from the Olympic Village and anonymous death threats back home ― has now morphed into most people seeing his statement as iconic and noble.“Kaepernick and the football players from St. Louis ― those are the fruits of our labor in the ‘60s,” Carlos said. “You think about Bill Russell or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Muhammad Ali ... they were encouraging young people to step up.”"

(Smith has since said their protest was misinterpreted as one for the Black Power movement, when it was intended as one for all human rights.)Speaking on San Francisco’s 95.7 FM Monday, Carlos expanded on his view of Kaepernick’s protest.“My view of him sitting down is the same as Rosa Parks sitting on the bus. Rosa Parks was making a statement. Colin is making a statement as well,” Carlos said.Carlos applauded the way Kaepernick is using the NFL’s large audience to highlight issues of racism, police brutality and inequality.“We come out to make these statements to encourage other people to raise their voices enough that people will sit down and have some common discussion about social issues that have been pushed under the rug for eons,” he said.Carlos also hinted that if history is any indication, the vitriol directed at Kaepernick now may eventually soften. He noted that the backlash to his protest ― which included a ban from the Olympic Village and anonymous death threats back home ― has now morphed into most people seeing his statement as iconic and noble.“Kaepernick and the football players from St. Louis ― those are the fruits of our labor in the ‘60s,” Carlos said. “You think about Bill Russell or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Muhammad Ali ... they were encouraging young people to step up.”"

Pat Toomey by more than 10 percentage points.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c5cfe41800002100bce179.jpeg?ops=crop_18_126_4658_2923%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Democratic challenger Katie McGinty maintains a slight lead over Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), according to a new Monmouth University Poll released Tuesday. That’s good news for Democrats, who are hoping to flip that seat in their push to retake the Senate.The new poll is the seventh survey in the HuffPost Pollster average to show McGinty leading. The latest results bring her average up to 42.7 percent, with 42.4 percent for Toomey.While the race is still tight, support for McGinty has increased by more than 2 percentage points since July, effectively erasing any lead that Toomey previously had.McGinty leads Toomey by 45 percent to 41 percent among likely voters in the Monmouth poll, with 6 percent supporting Libertarian candidate Edward Clifford and 8 percent still undecided. The survey, conducted from Aug. 26 to 29, has a margin of error of 4.9 points.The same survey finds Hillary Clinton ahead of Donald Trump 48 percent to 40 percent among likely Pennsylvania voters.The HuffPost Pollster average now shows Clinton with a commanding lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, a traditional swing state that has ultimately voted Democratic in the last six presidential elections.One recent poll did find Toomey ahead by 7 points: In an Emerson College Poll of likely voters released Monday, the incumbent was up 46 percent to 39 percent. However, the automated poll surveyed only landline users. That method misses the many Americans who now rely on mobile phones, which is why such polls are no longer included in HuffPost Pollster’s data models.McGinty’s lead is impressive considering that many Pennsylvanians have yet to form a definitive opinion about the former state official. (Most recently she served as Gov. Tom Wolf’s chief of staff.) The Monmouth survey found that 27 percent of likely voters have a favorable view of McGinty and 17 percent have an unfavorable view. But 56 percent said they have no opinion at all.On the other hand, 32 percent reported having a favorable opinion of Toomey, 30 percent had an unfavorable opinion and 38 percent were undecided. Still, 43 percent said they approve of the job Toomey is doing as senator.Toomey’s struggles could be tied, in part, to Trump’s unpopularity in the state. Like many other Republican candidates, Toomey has struggled to articulate a clear distinction between his campaign and that of his party’s nominee. The senator has yet to endorse Trump and earlier said Trump was “not his first choice.”Meanwhile, McGinty has benefited from the support of national Democratic super PACs and interest groups."

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), discussing poverty and unemployment in a radio interview on Monday, proposed a strange solution for low-income single mothers trying to balance employment and child care.“Let single moms actually work in day care to support each other,” he told WIZM, a Wisconsin radio station. “We have prohibitions against that, providing day care for a facility that has your children in it. I think we need to reduce some of these policies. Let’s work smart, let’s rethink all of these programs, all the laws. Just about everything has got to be rethought.” Johnson was promoting a Milwaukee-based job training program, The Joseph Project, which he helped create. When lauding the program earlier this month, he referenced the recent protests over the fatal police shooting of a young black man in Milwaukee as evidence that the “War on Poverty didn’t work.”The riots have been “literally decades in the making,” Johnson told the Associated Press. “It’s the fact that well-intentioned programs didn’t work. The war on poverty didn’t work. We didn’t alleviate poverty. We’ve exacerbated it.”The war on poverty policies, instituted by President Lyndon Johnson, are frequently blamed by GOP lawmakers who argue that government welfare programs breed dependence and think that solutions to poverty should come from the private sector.The problem with the Wisconsin senator’s suggestion is that child care workers are poorly paid and receive scant benefits.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage for child care workers last year was only $9.77 per hour, which amounts to a yearly salary of $20,320.The Economic Policy Institute studied child care workers nationwide and found that only 15 percent of them receive health insurance from their employer and only 9.6 percent have a pension plan. Nearly 15 percent of them live below the poverty line."

Trump has made headlines in the last few months for having extremely low support among black voters ― as low as 0 percent in some swing states, according to a few polls.But despite Trump’s incendiary rhetoric and charges of racism and bigotry, he’s actually not doing worse among black voters than other recent GOP presidential nominees. Mitt Romney struggled in 2012, garnering only 6 percent of the black vote. A mid-August 2012 poll showed his support among the demographic at 0 percent. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) only got 4 percent of the black vote in 2008. To be fair, Romney and McCain were running against the first black nominee for a major political party. The last elected Republican president, George W. Bush, did a little better. In 2000, Bush pulled 9 percent of the black vote against then-Vice President Al Gore. During his re-election bid in 2004 against then-Sen. John Kerry, Bush won 11 percent of the black vote.Trump has also struggled with Hispanic voters. In recent polling, his support ranges from 20 percent to 28 percent among the voting bloc. Romney and McCain’s level of support among Hispanics in 2012 and 2008, respectively, were comparable to where Trump’s is now. Twenty-seven percent of the Hispanic vote went to Romney in 2012, and 31 percent went to McCain in 2008.However, Trump yet again underperforms the last elected Republican ― Bush won 35 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2000 and 44 percent in 2004. Conventional wisdom holds Trump can only win this year if he holds down the states Romney won in 2012 and wins over some crucial swing states that Romney lost. But since Trump isn’t doing better than Romney among black and Hispanic voters, these states could be difficult to win.Georgia, South Carolina and Missouri ― states that have swung Republican in most recent elections despite having relatively large African-American populations ― show a tight race, with Hillary Clinton trailing by only 2 to 4 percentage points, according to HuffPost Pollster charts. And North Carolina, which has the seventh-highest African-American population nationally but has voted Republican in eight of the 10 most recent elections, currently shows Clinton leading by an average of 3 percentage points.Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio ― the three states characterized as most likely to swing the election one way or the other, according to FiveThirtyEight’s “tipping-point” model ― might also prove difficult for Trump to win. Florida boasts the sixth-highest Hispanic and 11th-highest black population in the country. Pennsylvania and Ohio both have larger-than-average African-American populations. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
37,POLITICS,When A ZIP Code Can Determine A Death Sentence,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/death-penalty-outlier-counties_us_57c484f1e4b09cd22d91ea32,"“There’s no more basic form of arbitrariness in the death penalty than geography.""",2016-08-30,"Who gets sentenced to death can be heavily influenced by arbitrary factors like race, gender and geography. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c4857c180000dd10bcdd9b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Critics of capital punishment have long cited the arbitrary nature of the death penalty as a reason it should be abolished in the U.S. Who gets sentenced to death can depend on a variety of arbitrary factors, including ZIP code. “Too Broken To Fix,” a report released earlier this month by Harvard Law School’s Fair Punishment Project, highlights 16 so-called “outlier” counties in the U.S. where defendants are disproportionately sentenced to death.“Of the 3,143 county or county equivalents in the United States, only 16 ― or one half of one percent ― imposed five or more death sentences between 2010 and 2015,” the report states. The study notes that the 16 counties are exceptional not just for their high rates of death penalty convictions, but also because those rates persist even as the rest of the country is trending in the other direction. Last year, fewer people were sentenced to death in the U.S. than in any year since the 1970s.As use of the death penalty has fallen in the U.S., many of the 31 states that still have it on the books ― like Kansas and New Hampshire ― haven’t carried out an execution in 50 years or more.What the 16 outlier counties have in common, the study found, is overzealous prosecution, inadequate defense resources and a pattern of racial bias and exclusion.In reference to the Harvard report, Austin Sarat, who teaches law and political science at Amherst College, said that because capital punishment is growing more and more concentrated in specific areas, it requires greater precision in the way we talk about it.“We can say, ‘In a way, the U.S. doesn’t have the death penalty ― Texas has the death penalty,’” Sarat told The Huffington Post. “But even that’s not right. Harris County has the death penalty.”“There’s no more basic form of arbitrariness in the death penalty than geography,” he continued. “I used to advise my students that if they’re going to murder someone, they should do it in Michigan, not Ohio. If you murdered someone half a mile into Ohio, you could get the death penalty. It’s the same crime, but half a mile north [in Michigan], you’re not eligible for the death penalty.” Six of the 16 outlier counties are in Florida and Alabama — the only two states in the country that don’t require a unanimous jury decision to give a death sentence. The remaining 10 counties are concentrated in Arizona, California, Louisiana, Nevada and Texas.Looking at statistics from the various counties, it becomes clear that people of color and people with mental health issues are at especially high risk for death sentences. Some of these people are almost certainly innocent ― in fact, in the eight counties listed in the graphic below, there have been a combined 11 exonerations since 1976.Even more striking is the small number of individuals behind the death sentences. According to the Fair Punishment Project’s analysis, three prosecutors in particular ― Donnie Myers in South Carolina, the late Bob Macy in Oklahoma and the late Joe Freeman Britt in North Carolina ― have been responsible for a combined 131 death sentences, the equivalent of 1 in every 25 people currently on death row.Defendants in these outlier counties face not only overzealous prosecution but also inadequate defense. “In too many cases today, defendants are stuck with attorneys who lack the time, resources, or ability to zealously represent their clients as guaranteed by the Constitution,” the report notes. In some of the outlier counties, lawyers spend an average of less than a day on defense mitigation for clients who are ultimately sentenced to death.“I think there has been growing recognition that the death penalty machinery in the U.S. is broken,” Sarat said. “The situation with capital punishment today is dramatically different than it was 15, 20 years ago.” Sarat argued that the death penalty is no longer really an aspect of the U.S. justice system. Rather, he said, it’s a feature of “these isolated and rather idiosyncratic counties.”You can read the full report here."

But as HuffPost’s own Mollie Reilly pointed out, “It’s an odd line of criticism coming from Trump, whose ‘Make America Great Again’ campaign slogan indicates that he thinks the U.S. is a deeply flawed and troubled place ― the same belief at the heart of Kaepernick’s protest.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
