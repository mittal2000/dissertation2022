Reuters spoke to several of the passengers and their relatives in Florida and Texas, although some were still too traumatized to talk publicly about the experience.Cubans seeking to flee the communist-run island are heading in increasing numbers by sea to Central America and then making a long journey overland to reach the United States.Under Washington's ""wet foot, dry foot policy,"" Cuban migrants who make it onto U.S. soil are allowed to remain, while those intercepted at sea are turned back.The group set off from eastern Cuba in early August, but ran into trouble about 40 miles from the Cayman Islands when the boat's motor - a Hyundai diesel car engine, attached to a homemade propeller - failed on the second day at sea, said Izquierdo, 32.The 20-foot, home-made craft, made from aluminum roofing sheets riveted together and sealed with cloth and resin, drifted up the Cuban coast as the passengers tried to flag down passing ships.""No-one stopped even though they could see we were desperate,"" said Mailin Perez, 30, another survivor recovering in Austin, Texas.The passengers heaved the engine overboard to reduce weight and fashioned a makeshift sail from sheets sewn together with cord.Six of the men decided to swim for the Cuban coast clinging to inner tubes, but have not been heard from since.Brief rain showers every three or four days provided the only water, rationed out in doses by medical syringes. One woman who was six months pregnant received extra rations.One by one, 11 passengers died. Their bodies, lips swollen, were slid overboard, and floated off into the distance, a sight that one survivor said haunts her in nightmares.The first to die was Izquierdo's friend, 50-year-old Havana car mechanic, Rafael Baratuti O'Farrill.""That was the saddest day,"" said Izquierdo.After running out of water, some passengers began drinking sea water, as well as their own urine. O'Farrill was one of several who also used syringes to draw their own blood to drink.""That was a mistake, the ones who drank their blood became faint. Gradually they lost their minds and faded away,"" said Izquierdo. MORE MIGRANTSO'Farrill and Izquierdo had quit their jobs in Havana six months earlier after hearing that boats were leaving for Central America from the port town of Manzanillo, in eastern Cuba.The U.S. Coast Guard had virtually shut down the shorter routes across the treacherous Florida Straits, which separates Cuba and Florida by only 90 miles at its narrowest point.After Honduras' leftist president Manuel Zelaya, an ally of Cuba, was toppled in 2009 and replaced by a conservative, the longer western route became popular, a trip of about 675 miles, via the Cayman Islands.Honduran authorities give Cuban migrants temporary visas allowing them to head north for the United States.Most boats withstand the journey, taking a week to 10 days to cross the sea, said Izquierdo, who paid $500 to join the ill-fated voyage.""Boats are leaving Manzanillo every week and most of them make it,"" said Izquierdo.U.S. authorities said last month more than 16,200 Cubans arrived without visas at the border with Mexico in the past 11 months, the highest number in a decade.Cuban officials have not commented on the illegal boat departures, but blame the U.S. policy for encouraging migrants to risk their lives.Izquierdo and Perez said they abandoned Cuba for economic reasons to find a better future for their children. Izquierdo left behind his wife and two small boys in Havana. Perez was reunited with her husband in Texas, but also has a young son and daughter in Cuba.Economic reforms underway to modernize the Cuban economy by allowing greater private sector activity have so far failed to improve living standards, they said.Instead, conditions were getting worse.""The pressure cooker is boiling, it's ready to burst,"" said Izquierdo.Both sought to leave legally, but were told it could take five years before their cases would be determined by U.S. consular officials.Thinking of their spouses and children is what kept them alive, said Izquierdo and Perez.""I knew I had to be strong for them,"" said Perez. ""I felt very weak at the end. I was scared to close my eyes in case I never woke up."" (Reporting By David Adams; Editing by Kieran Murray and Andre Grenon)"

Target reports quarterly financial results on Wednesday, May 21, 2014. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3142d2100002501c7b02f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Retailers across the nation are accepting waves of new employee applications in preparation for the imminent 2014 holiday hiring season. Seven of the nation’s largest retailers will together add nearly 400,000 jobs this winter. Once again, Macy’s (NYSE: M) leads the nation with an expected 86,000 seasonal job openings.According to global outplacement consultancy firm, Challenger, Gray & Christmas, higher consumer spending and improved employment across the nation is enticing retailers to ramp up holiday hirings this year. To determine the companies adding the most workers this holiday season, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed seasonal hiring announcements from America’s largest retailers.Click here to see who is hiring the most people this holiday seasonA number of factors may help to bolster hiring during the holidays. According to a recent study from Deloitte, holiday spending is expected to grow by between 4.0% and 4.5% this year due to better job growth. Indeed, the United States is on track to add roughly 2.5 million jobs this year; the unemployment rate had fallen to 6.1% as of August; and the number of job openings continues to climb. And, despite the competitive landscape in traditional retail, many brick-and-mortar stores plan to hire huge numbers of people this year.In an interview with 24/7 Wall St. John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, highlighted the importance of an improving job market for retailers. “Compared to last year there are just a lot more people who have money in their wallets to spend,” Challenger said. “That means more traffic in the stores, and that means retailers need more people.”Among the seven retailers hiring the most workers are a number of America’s largest store chains, including Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) — owners of Walmart and Sam’s Club — and Target (NYSE: TGT). Last year, these two companies were the largest and fourth-largest retailers in the U.S., respectively, according to Kantar Retail. A number of top holiday season hirers, however, have much more of a seasonal focus and are especially dependent on the holiday season. These include video game retailer GameStop (NYSE: GME) and toy store giant Toys R’ Us.A number of chains will be looking to the holidays as a critical litmus test for how their business is performing. Target will look for a far better holiday result than it had last year, when a data breach reported just before Christmas drove shoppers away. J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP), too, will look to continue to prove to Wall Street that its turnaround is sustainable. Challenger added that struggling companies “are hoping that with this season they can put the past behind and show the marketplace that they have adapted, [and have] listened to their consumers.”Many companies will try to prove they can compete in a retail landscape that is increasingly shifting online. For instance, Deloitte expects that “digital interactions will influence 50%…of retail stores sales this holiday season,” and that online and mail order sales will rise by between 13.5% and 14.0% from the previous holiday season.Figures from the U.S. Census Bureau also show a consistent growth in e-commerce sales, which totalled $75 billion in the second quarter of this year, after accounting for seasonal variation. This accounted for a record 6.4% of total U.S. retail sales that quarter.Online sales are widely considered to be a major factor pushing hiring surges outside the retail sector, such as at FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and UPS (NYSE: UPS), which are respectively adding 50,000 and 95,000 employees this year. Both companies struggled to handle shipping volumes last year after underestimating staffing needs for the holiday season.Despite higher expectations for this year’s holiday season, numerous headwinds remain for many retailers. Consumer sentiment, though rebounding, remains below pre-recession levels. Additionally, American households largely continue to struggle financially. The median household income in the U.S. was $52,250 last year, only slightly higher than the year before according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Only 14 of the 50 states had a statistically meaningful increase in median income last year.To identify the retailers hiring the most for the holidays, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed Kantar Retail’s list of the 100 largest retail companies based on 2013 U.S. retail sales. To make our list, a company needed to be one of the nation’s 100 largest retailers and to have announced plans to hire at least 25,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season. Store counts and employee totals are from each company’s latest annual report.These are the retailers hiring the most employees for the holidays."
3,WORLDPOST,Business Backlash Looms In Occupied Hong Kong,Matt Sheehan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hong-kong-small-business_n_5934484.html,,2014-10-05,"HONG KONG - OCTOBER 03: Anti-Occupy supporters clash with Occupy camp members in Causeway Bay on October 3, 2014 in Hong Kong. Thousands of pro democracy supporters continue to occupy the streets surrounding Hong Kong's Financial district. The protesters are calling for open elections and the resignation of Hong Kong's Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who last night agreed to hold talks with the protest leaders in a bid to diffuse the growing unrest. (Photo by Anthony Kwan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9a8c222400007b00042c6c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"HONG KONG –- On a tense Sunday afternoon, the occupation of Hong Kong’s streets by democracy protesters crossed the one-week mark, as mounting losses to local businesses fed an increasingly violent backlash. Small business owners report that the perpetually blocked roads and physical confrontations have taken a toll, with the flow of customers slowing to a trickle.“Business now under Occupy Central is even worse than when SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome] hit Hong Kong [in 2003], because back then traffic wasn’t blocked,” said Sun Oi-ling, who runs a small restaurant located two miles from the occupation's epicenter in the Admiralty neighborhood. Sun said that her business has dropped by roughly two-thirds over the past week. “The protesters have their own position, but our position is that we have to face high rent and labor costs.” Since Sept. 28, student demonstrators have occupied major streets in the Asian financial hub to demand that the mainland Chinese government not screen candidates for the city’s 2017 elections. Public sympathy for the students surged last Sunday after local police used tear gas and pepper spray in an attempt to disperse protesters.  Student-led demonstrations have shut down some of Hong Kong's busiest commercial and financial centers. (Photo: Matt Sheehan/The WorldPost)That support continued to run high during a major public holiday this week, but as some Hong Kongers found protests interrupting their return to work on Friday, patience began to run thin. Confrontations between pro- and anti-occupy forces morphed into public brawls, with activists blaming much of the violence on triad gang members who they claim have been paid to stir up trouble. Hong Kongers who run small businesses with no guaranteed income now complain that their livelihoods are at stake. Restaurant owners, taxi drivers and fruit sellers report significant losses, ranging anywhere from 20 to 65 percent of regular sales. Some of those shop owners have gone onto the front lines to engage the pro-occupy camp in heated debates.In the weeks preceding the occupation, government officials had warned of the damage to Hong Kong’s economy and its reputation as a stable place to do business. On Friday, ANZ Bank estimated that the protests had already cost retailers around $2.2 billion in Hong Kong dollars (USD $280 million). ANZ Bank estimated that occupy protests have already cost the city over HKD $2 billion. (Photo: Bloomberg via Getty Images)That impact has many locals feeling torn between sympathy for the occupiers and concern over a very real hit to their own pocketbooks.Hong Kong taxi driver Wu Man-wai said that his daily income has dropped by around one-third during the occupy demonstrations, as the blocked roads and brawls push many riders to take the subway or stay home. But he still maintains a certain appreciation for demonstrators who have braved rain, heat and violent attacks in pursuit of political reform. “When people oppose the movement because it disrupts their businesses, they should stand back and think about what the students are fighting for,” said Wu. “I’m not saying the students are always right, but when they are shouldering the responsibilities for society, shouldn’t we as adults support them?” Some working Hong Kongers see the students as taking up a struggle that they can't because of their jobs. (Photo: Bloomberg via Getty Images)Some protesters, many of whom work in the city themselves, argue that the short-term economic losses will be compensated for in the long term with better governance under a more democratic system.“There will definitely be some impact on stores, but we haven't taken to the streets for money,” said Ngan Wing, 30, who has been coming out to the protests when not working at Hong Kong International Airport. “These people are here to demand the government improve its policies toward Hong Kong, and that will change the lives of Hong Kongers for the better.”But others in both the pro- and anti-occupy camps doubt that the protesters will achieve their stated goal of public nomination of electoral candidates for chief executive. That pessimism makes the short-term pain more difficult to bear for business owners, many of whom point out that students can simply return to class when the demonstrations end.Occupy protests have always been controversial in the city, with opinion often starkly divided along age and class lines: Protesters have overwhelmingly been young, many of them students from prestigious Hong Kong universities, while Hong Kong’s older and poorer populations tend to oppose such actions at much higher rates. As night fell over Hong Kong on Sunday, demonstrators faced difficult decisions about how best to turn up the pressure on the government without alienating more local residents. Authorities have set a deadline to clear the streets before Monday morning. Any move by protesters to limit their impact on surrounding businesses would help them consolidate local support ahead of potential negotiations with the government.Cleared streets that restored the flow of customers to Sun Oi-ling's restaurant would placate her opposition to the protests. “I don’t mind Occupy Central taking place as long as it doesn’t affect business,"" she said."

""Our main task is to push them (government forces) away from the city so that they can no longer shell residential districts. ""Polyovy said there was also fighting around the towns of Debaltseve and Shchastye both further east towards the border with Russia.Basulin said three civilians had also been killed in Donetsk area in the past 24 hours and he blamed Ukrainian forces for shelling the city's outskirts from positions adjacent to the airport.The Ukrainian military denies firing on civilian targets and says it only replies to fire when it is attacked by separatists.Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko called the ceasefire on Sept. 5 after government troops suffered heavy losses which Kiev attributed to Russian troops reinforcing the separatists who want to break away from pro-Western Kiev's rule.Moscow denies its troops have been directly involved in the fighting despite what Kiev and Western government say is incontrovertible proof.Poroshenko is hoping the ceasefire, cornerstone of a peace plan to end the conflict in which more than 3,500 people have been killed according to U.N. figures, will generally hold together for parliamentary elections on Oct. 26.But the truce has come under great pressure this past week.Last Monday, seven Ukrainian troops were killed in a single missile strike from a separatist tank and at least 10 people were killed on Wednesday when mortar bombs hit a school playground and a public transit van nearby.On Thursday night a Swiss Red Cross worker was killed when a shell exploded near the international organization's office in Donetsk.

""Every one of them will be monitored every day to see if they develop a fever, and if they do, they'll be promptly isolated. That's how you stop it in its tracks,"" Frieden said. ""And that's why we're confident that we won't see a large number of cases from this."" Frieden acknowledged that U.S. hospitals had been unprepared for Ebola and have made a few mistakes. The Texas hospital had originally misdiagnosed the patient and turned him away. Then it experienced delays with disposal of the patient's highly contagious medical waste -- a mistake Frieden called a ""teachable moment."" ""It's the first time we've had to deal with that situation, and just by chance, there had been a glitch in the government system to approve a waste removal company to do that,"" Frieden said. ""That's been resolved. Wish it had been resolved sooner, but it's resolved."" The biggest challenge in containing the Ebola epidemic, Frieden said, is stopping the spread of the virus in Africa. President Barack Obama significantly increased U.S. support for that effort last month. ""It's going to take time,"" Frieden said. ""The virus is spreading so fast that it's hard to keep up. That's why it's terrific that the president has deployed the Department of Defense there in support of the disease control efforts.

The sources did not specify whether the three wounded people were also militants.Ethnic Uzbeks and other foreign militants fight alongside the Pakistani Taliban but their exact number in Waziristan is not known.Drones, which are operated remotely, are key to the U.S. policy of targeting militants holed up in inaccessible corners on the Pakistani-Afghan border. The then leader of the Pakistani Taliban was killed in one such attack in late 2013. (Reporting by Saud Mehsud Writing by Maria Golovnina; Editing by Abigail Fielding-Smith)"

He has a cough and conjunctivitis, commonly known as pinkeye, hospital officials said.Sacra will remain in isolation until doctors have confirmation from tests by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that he is not infected with the virus, the hospital said. Doctors expect to know with certainty by late Monday.""We are isolating Dr. Sacra to be cautious pending final confirmation of his illness,"" said Dr. Robert Finberg, who is heading Sacra's medical team.

It has killed more than 3,400 people.""The man in Dallas, who is fighting for his life, is the only patient to develop Ebola in the United States,"" CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""In Nebraska, another hospital was preparing for the arrival of an Ebola patient who contracted the disease in Liberia, a spokesman said on Sunday.Nebraska Medical Center spokesman Taylor Wilson would only identify the patient as a male U.S. citizen expected to arrive on Monday. But the father of Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance NBC cameraman working for NBC who contracted Ebola in Liberia, told Reuters on Friday that his son was going to Nebraska for treatment.Duncan's case has highlighted problems that American public health officials are trying furiously to address: The Dallas hospital that admitted him initially did not recognize the deadly disease and sent him home, only for him to return two days later in an ambulance.""The issue of the missed diagnosis initially is concerning,"" Frieden said, adding that public health officials had redoubled their efforts to raise awareness of the disease.""We're seeing more people calling us, considering the possibility of Ebola - that's what we want to see,"" he said on CNN. ""We don't want people not to be diagnosed.""Frieden said he was confident the disease would not spread widely within the United States. U.S. officials are also scaling up their response in West Africa, where Ebola presents an enormous challenge, he added.""But it's going to take time,"" Frieden said. ""The virus is spreading so fast that it's hard to keep up.""In Dallas, a spokesman for Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, Wendell Watson, said Duncan remained critical on Sunday. He would not elaborate.The Nebraska hospital last month also treated and released, Dr. Rick Sacra, an American missionary who also contracted Ebola in Liberia.Sacra was admitted to a Massachusetts hospital on Saturday for a likely respiratory infection that is not believed to be a recurrence of the disease, hospital officials there said.When asked on Sunday if the U.S. should suspend flights to and from affected countries or impose a visa ban on travelers from those countries, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said ""absolutely not.""""When you start closing off countries like that, there is a real danger of making things worse,"" Fauci said on Fox News Sunday. ""You can cause unrest in the country. It's conceivable that governments could fall if you just isolate them completely.""The CDC has identified 10 people who had direct contact with Duncan as being at greatest risk of infection. Another 40 were being monitored as potential contacts, out of a group of 114 people initially evaluated for exposure risks, though none from either group has shown symptoms, Frieden said.Ebola, which can cause fever, vomiting and diarrhea, spreads through contact with bodily fluids such as blood or saliva.(Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Aruna Viswanatha in Washington, Jonathan Kaminsky in New Orleans; With additional writing by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Sophie Walker) "

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday that he approves of President Barack Obama's decision to put boots on the ground in Africa to control the Ebola outbreak and wishes the president would do the same in Iraq and Syria to control Islamic militants there.""It seems to be that the president is all in when it comes to Ebola,"" Graham said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""I want to compliment him for sending troops to help get ahead of this in Africa. But we've got a series of half measures with ISIL. They're gonna draw this conflict out, and it will not lead to ISIL's destruction."" Obama insisted last month that he would not drag the United States into another ground war in Iraq, despite escalating aggression in the area by the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS. The president's strategy is to help Iraqi and Syrian forces in the area defeat the extremist fighters on their own. Graham said he is confident that strategy won't work. ""I think most Americans understand if we don't destroy ISIL, if they survive our best shot, that we're all less safe. And at the end of the day, you cannot destroy ISIL in Syria without a ground component."" U.S. military forces themselves are apparently less enthusiastic than the senator about putting boots on the ground. According to a recent Military Times survey of U.S. troops, more than 70 percent oppose expanding America's mission in Iraq and Syria with combat forces. White House press secretary Josh Earnest has said Obama won't even ""review or consider options"" that include sending U.S. combat troops to the Middle East. But Graham issued a plea to the president on Sunday to change his mind. “Mr. President, level with the American people: You need boots on the ground,” Graham said. “And these are human beings with hopes and dreams, not just boots. American soldiers need to go back to Syria and Iraq as part of a coalition, and we’re going to need more than 4,000 to destroy ISIL in Iraq and Syria.” "

A mortar that crashed into a house on Turkish territory just a few kilometres from a border area inside Syria where Kurdish fighters are battling Islamic State (IS) jihadists wounded five people on October 5, medical sources said. Mortars have on occasion hit Turkish territory over the last days amid the fighting for the Syrian town of Kobane, leaving several people wounded. Turkish forces are deployed on the border but not taking part in the fighting. AFP PHOTO / ARIS MESSINIS (Photo credit should read ARIS MESSINIS/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13e44240000350076eabc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Turkish military is just watching as outgunned and outnumbered Kurdish fighters warn that a massacre is imminent in a town visible across the Syrian border. The fighters have been defending a key Kurdish stronghold in Syria against hardline militants aligned with the self-proclaimed Islamic State for nearly three weeks, but may not be able to hold out much longer.Kurdish fighters in Kobani have battled for 20 days as the militants took scores of local villages and some 160,000 people have fled across the nearby border into Turkey. The lightly armed Kurdish forces defending the town, also known as the People's Protection Units or YPG, have largely succeeded in fending off the militants, who are armed with heavy artillery and tanks, some of that U.S.-made and seized from other Syrian rebels and Iraqi forces. But Islamist forces have ramped up their efforts in recent days, shelling the town on Friday and Saturday.Some of the heaviest battles so far took place Sunday, as Islamic State forces battled Kurdish fighters for control of a strategic overlook. An Islamic State missile reportedly hit a house in Turkey close to the Syrian border and wounded five people, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, U.S.-led coalition airstrikes have done little to stop the siege of Kobani. According to U.S. Central Command, the coalition led nine airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria on Friday and Saturday, reportedly killing at least 35 militants. However, Kurdish fighters maintain that those attacks are largely ineffective in aiding the Kobani defenders.""Airstrikes alone are really not enough to defeat ISIS in Kobani,” Idris Nassan, who acts as Kobani's foreign minister, told The Guardian. “They are besieging the city on three sides, and fighter jets simply cannot hit each and every [Islamic State] fighter on the ground.”Last week, Turkey's Parliament voted to authorize military action in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State if it is deemed necessary. The 298-98 vote also gave the Turkish government a mandate to allow foreign troops to launch operations from within Turkey. ""We wouldn't want Kobani to fall,"" Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said. ""We welcomed our brothers who came from Kobani. We'll do whatever we can to prevent this from happening."" While the vote has received much attention as a possible step in the right direction, this is the third consecutive year the Turkish Parliament has voted in favor of military authorization to retaliate across the border in Syria without taking subsequent military action.Many Kurds are skeptical that Turkey will cross the border and help fend off the militants' advances in Kobani. Turkish leaders have yet to articulate any plans for lifting the siege. And on Friday, the BBC reported that Turkish tanks stood idle as Kobani faced further militant attacks. ""The Turkish state has declared its hostility to the Kurds with its reluctance,"" Burhan Atmaca, a Turkish Kurd, told Agence France-Presse as he watched the fighting from across the Turkish border. ""We no longer have confidence in Turkey. We will fend for ourselves.""Indeed, despite last week's vote, Turkey has made it clear that there will likely be no military action anytime soon. Meanwhile, rumors run rampant about Turkey's supporting the Islamic State and turning a blind eye both to extremist recruiting cells within its own borders and to the use of smuggling routes to and from Syria. Within the Turkish government, there is growing concern that the U.S.-led coalition focuses too much on defeating the Islamic State and not at all on toppling longtime Syrian President Bashar Assad. There is also worry over possible attacks on and within Turkey if the country did take up arms against the Islamic State. In particular, Turkey is concerned about YPG's ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has been in conflict with the Turkish state for 30 years. Designated a terrorist group by Turkey and the United States for its attacks on Turkish soldiers, the PKK has called for basic civil rights, greater freedoms for Kurds and the establishment of an ethnic homeland independent from Turkey (a demand since tabled). Recently, imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has warned that a fragile peace process with Turkey would abruptly end if Kobani fell to the Islamic State, threatening the country with internal conflict even as neighboring Syria implodes from its own war. “I am calling on those in Turkey who don’t want to see the process collapse to shoulder responsibility,” Ocalan said in a statement from prison on Thursday. “The reality of Kobani and the peace process are not separable.”Over 40,000 people in Turkey have died in the conflict between the Kurds and the Turkish state since 1984, the majority of them Kurds."

Mine is heavily influenced by growing up in 1950s Philadelphia with an older brother (not a boomer) who sang with street-corner doo-wop groups and danced on American Bandstand.  Individual soundtracks pull from a combination of ingredients, including when you were born, where you lived and which radio stations you listened to. But there were some songs that became part of a collective, generational playlist. Back then, radio was our Internet, and the songs the DJs spun connected us to our world and to one another.Here, in chronological order, are the 15 songs that this boomer ranks among the best that spoke to and defined our generation. Yes, my list tilts more East Coast, urban, R&B and late '50s and '60s. And I realize that, like every time one person tries to represent the millions of individuals who make up the baby boom, there will be discussion. In fact, I'm looking forward to comparing notes. Tell Next Avenue which songs you would put on a list of music that made us who we are, in the comments section below.1. Jailhouse Rock - Elvis Presley (1957)Why I loved it: “Elvis the Pelvis” had been around a few years already and was huge with my older brother and his crowd. This song was when I jumped on that bandwagon. It seemed really cool to have a hit song from a film with the same name — one of Elvis’ better flicks — and the song's two-chord riff is among rock's most unforgettable moments.Memorable lyric snippet: Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, ""Nix nix, I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks.""You might not know: Jailhouse Rock was the first record to enter the British singles chart at No. 1.2. That’ll Be The Day – Buddy Holly and the Crickets (1957)Why I loved it: This tune wasn’t just catchy, it was jaw dropping. Up until then, nothing sounded quite like this (Holly used double-tracking) or had utilized the lineup of two guitars, bass and drums. This all became even more poignant when Holly was killed in a plane crash in early 1959 (“the day the music died”).Memorable lyric snippet: You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie 'Cause that'll be the day when I dieYou might not know: The title, and inspiration, were from the classic John Wayne western, The Searchers, and That’ll be the Day was the first song recorded by the Quarrymen, who later became known as the Beatles.3. At the Hop – Danny and the Juniors (1957-58)Why I loved it: The song and the group were just so south Philly — American Bandstand impresario Dick Clark changed the group’s name and single-handedly made this a hit record. It’s celebrated for combining two of the most popular formulas in 1950s rock 'n' roll: the 12-bar blues and '50s progression.  Memorable lyric snippet: You can rock it you can roll it Do the stomp and even stroll it At the hopYou might not know: The rock 'n' roll revival act Sha Na Na delivered a raucous version of this at Woodstock in 1969.4. Johnny B. Goode – Chuck Berry (1958)Why I loved it: It feels like rock 'n' roll truly arrived with this great song. Couldn’t get enough of it. And, oh, that guitar riff. It didn’t matter to the local white DJs that Chuck Berry was black because they kept on playing this song on the radio, pretty much eliminating what was up until then called “race music.”Memorable lyric snippet: Who never ever learned to read or write so well But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell Go Johnny go!You might not know: The opening guitar riff on Johnny B. Goode is a note-for-note copy of the opening single-note solo on bandleader Louis Jordan’s Aint That Just Like a Woman and the song originally had ""colored boy"" in the lyrics, but Chuck Berry changed it to ""country boy"" to help ensure radio play.5. What’d I Say – Ray Charles (1959)Why I loved it: This was the song my parents turned off the radio for and wouldn’t let us buy. It reeks of improvisation, call and response, and sex. It forced you to get up and move, made Ray Charles a star and launched the musical sub-genre later known as soul.Memorable lyric snippet: See that girl with a diamond ring she knows how to shake that thingYou might not know: Ray Charles and his orchestra ad-libbed the song in front of a white audience at the end of a set in late 1958. 6. The Twist – Chubby Checker (1960)Why I loved it: If we were going to celebrate our own music, we needed our own dance and this song made all that happen. The dance craze swept the nation, eventually captivating high society and marking a turning point for “adult” acceptance of rock 'n' roll music.Memorable lyric snippet: Yeah, daddy just sleepin' And mama ain't around We're gonna twisty twisty twisty Till we tear the house downYou might not know: The Twist is the only hit single to reach No. 1 in two chart runs (1960 and 1962).7. I Want to Hold Your Hand – The Beatles (1963)Why I loved it: What teenager didn’t dig the Beatles in early 1964? Their sound was clean and crisp and fun, a combination of Elvis, the Everly Brothers and Buddy Holly. In fact, their manager Brian Epstein said this song was designed with “an American sound in mind.” And did we Americans ever love the Beatles.Memorable lyric snippet: Yeah you, got that something I think you'll understand When I feel that something I wanna hold your handYou might not know: According to John Lennon, I Want to Hold Your Hand sprang into being when, having to come up with an opening line, Paul hit a chord on the piano to which John said “That’s it. Do it again!”8. Dancing in the Street – Martha and the Vandellas (1964)Why I loved it: In June 1964, just about everything in America — politics, race, music, foreign policy — was going to change and this song became its anthem. Equal measures dance record, celebration, and call to action, Dancing in the Street is 100 percent pure joy. The trumpet introduction — the “fanfare” before the song’s announcement — is one of the seminal moments in rock 'n' roll history.Memorable lyric snippet: Calling out around the world “Are you ready for a brand new beat?”You might not know: The song’s writers — Ivy Jo Hunter, Marvin Gaye and Mickey Stevenson — “tricked” Martha Reeves into doing an extra take of this song so she’d record it a little edgier because they knew she’d be irritated.9. (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction – Rolling Stones (1965)Why I loved it: This song (and the one that follows) embodied my turning 18 and being newly out of high school in the summer of 1965. We listened to Satisfaction all summer long — it captured the spirit of those times — pretending we were Keith Richards running his guitar through a Gibson Fuzz Box to create the song’s distinctive distortion effect. What a sound.Memorable lyric snippet: And that man comes on to tell me How white my shirts can be But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke The same cigarettes as meYou might not know: The opening guitar riff is very similar to Dancing in the Street, so much so that Keith Richards was worried it was too much alike.10. Like a Rolling Stone — Bob Dylan (1965)Why I loved it: For me, this is the greatest song of all time. The confrontational lyrics, the questioning, the cynicism, the sound, the length — they all combined to make this so unique and exceptional. We’d never heard anything quite like it before. Every time that snare drum popped, we turned up the car radio and sang this tune at the top of our lungs. How do you spell freedom?Memorable lyric snippet:  How does it feel To be on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stoneYou might not know: Dylan's original draft of the song’s lyrics was written on four sheets of headed notepaper from the Roger Smith Hotel in Washington, D.C. The handwritten pages sold for more than $2 million at Sotheby’s New York in June 2014, setting a record for a popular music manuscript.11. Good Vibrations – The Beach Boys (1966)Why I loved it: We East Coast kids spurned some of the early Beach Boys hits as generic ripoffs, but this song was something else again. It came out when I was in college and blew us away with its array of instruments, strange sounds and key shifts. “It’s as if Brian Wilson’s used the recording studio as another instrument,” one of my fraternity brothers remarked, and was he ever right.Memorable lyric snippet:  I'm pickin' up good vibrations She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)You might not know: Brian Wilson spent nearly eight months in four recording studios — at a cost of more than $50,000 — to get this one right. At the time, Good Vibrations represented the greatest sum of money ever spent on a single.12. Respect – Aretha Franklin (1967)Why I loved it: I liked listening to girl groups like The Shirelles and The Ronettes when I was growing up and was also a big fan of The Supremes and the Motown girl groups, but I don’t ever remember hearing a woman sound like this — so strong and demanding and, well, feminist. It didn’t hurt that Aretha had that incredible voice and brought the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, a group of four studio musicians, to New York for the recording.Memorable lyric snippet:  R-E-S-P-E-C-T Find out what it means to me R-E-S-P-E-C-T Take care, TCBYou might not know: It was Aretha's idea to cover the Otis Redding song (""That a girl took away from me, a friend of mine, this girl she just took this song,"" he said at the Monterey Pop Festival). She came up with the arrangement, added the ""Sock it to me"" lines, and played piano on the track. Her sisters Emma and Carolyn sang backup.  13. Light My Fire – The Doors (1967)Why I loved it: Nearing the end of my sophomore year of college, I began to notice that popular music was starting to sound a lot different. Light My Fire was the song that convinced me things had indeed changed. For months we’d listen to the seven-minute album version of the song until the radio started playing a shorter one. Our fires were lit, all right, thanks to The Doors, and would burn brightly for many tumultuous months to come.Memorable lyric snippet: You know that it would be untrue You know that I would be a liar If I was to say to you Girl, we couldn't get much higher Come on baby, light my fire You might not know: Scheduled to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Doors had agreed to drop the line ""girl, we couldn't get much higher."" But lead singer Jim Morrison sang it anyway, and they were never invited back.14. A Day in the Life – The Beatles (1967)Why I loved it: For one day — June 1, 1967 — I felt connected to my entire generation worldwide with the release of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. And I wasn’t alone — writing in Rolling Stone, Langdon Winner observed: “The closest western civilization has come to unity since the Congress of Vienna in 1815 was the week the Sgt. Pepper album was released. In every city in Europe and America the radio stations played [it] ... and everyone listened ... For a brief while the irreparable fragmented consciousness of the West was unified, at least in the minds of the young.” And as memorable as every song on the album — and almost every Beatles No. 1 hit — is, there is something so haunting and captivating about A Day in the Life that stays in your soul.Memorable lyric snippet: I read the news today oh boyYou might not know: In 1968 Paul McCartney admitted, A Day in the Life was what he called a “turn-on song.” “This was the only one on the album written as a deliberate provocation,” he said, “but what we want to do is to turn you on to the truth rather than to pot.”15. What’s Going On – Marvin Gaye (1971)Why I loved it: I was a U.S. Army soldier in Vietnam when this song came out, and it asked the same question and sought the same answers that I did. Marvin’s voice never sounded better, yet there was urgency, a questioning, and anger to this song and album that forced me to pay attention to what was wrong with my country. I listened to it endlessly upon my return to the states, not realizing until years later that the song and the album were inspired by Marvin’s conversations with his brother Frankie, a Vietnam vet, about Frankie’s experiences in Vietnam and his returning home to a divided America.  Memorable lyric snippet: Brother, brother, brother There's far too many of you dyingYou might not know: Marvin Gaye and Berry Gordy, Jr., owner of Motown, argued for months about the viability of this song. Eventually, they agreed to disagree, with Gordy, who hated What’s Going On, telling Marvin: “One of us is going to learn a lesson with this.” After the song became a huge hit, Gordy confessed: “I learned something.”  Read more on Next Avenue: Transforming life as we age Training youth back into your body 6 new apps and sites to help you manage your money"
