They attend the same school, play on the same soccer team, go out on dates with girls together and earned their Eagle Scout awards together. They even plan to attend Brigham Young University next fall and live as roommates.Yet the reason for their profound bond is equal parts sadness and serendipity.The two best friends lost their parents to AIDS in Mozambique when they were very young and depended on one another for support in an orphanage.In 2008, when they were both 10 years old, they were coincidentally adopted by two different families in Gilbert, Arizona.The families just happen to live less than two miles away from each other.“Where Kelvin is, Afonso is not far behind and vice versa,” LaCinda Lewis, Kelvin’s mom told The Huffington Post. “Their very tight friendship makes perfect sense and is the reason that they are more like siblings than just friends.” The boys, whose families were friends in Mozambique, knew each other from such a young age that Afonso told The Arizona Republic: “In my earliest memories I’ve always known Kelvin."" So when Afonso lost both his parents to AIDS at age three, and Kelvin lost his mother to the same disease at four, the two leaned on each other for support while living in the same orphanage.“When I first met Kelvin, Afonso was by his side, arm-in-arm, always,” said Lewis. “They had so little but they had each other and that sustained them.”Lewis and her husband, John, decided to adopt Kelvin in 2002, before they even met him. They learned of him through Care For Life, a Mozambique NGO that their future daughter-in-law, Annie Packard, and her mother, Cindy Packard, run. Kelvin was found searching for food on the streets before he was dropped off in an orphanage by his aunt. As soon as the Lewis family met Kelvin, their eighth child, they instantly fell in love.According to , Greg and Sharon Slater, who adopted Afonso, met him during an AIDS-prevention program trip to Africa in 2002. As soon as they met their future son and his two siblings, the couple told People they knew ""in every fiber"" the three needed to be part of their family.Yet the Slater and Lewis families had a difficult time adopting the boys.Over the next six years, both families traveled to Mozambique numerous times, pleading with judges and country officials to adopt the boys.“We had no idea that Mozambique did not have an adoption agreement with the US or any country for that matter,” Lewis told HuffPost. “What we were trying to do was foreign to them.”According to Bureau of Consular Affairs,  Mozambique doesn’t fall under the Hague Adoption Convention, an agreement made in 1993 to protect international adoptions, so the adoption guidelines are set by the government.The process was difficult for the boys as well, as Kelvin described to The Arizona Republic:“Every time [LaCinda] came I thought I’d be able to leave with her, so it was pretty emotional quite often. But she always told me she would come back.”Yet, it was during one of these many trips that LaCinda learned of Sharon, and that the two boys would be living in the same town, just a two-minute car ride away. When both the boys arrived in Arizona in 2008, the families decided to throw them a surprise reunion:The duo have kept their arms wrapped around each other ever since.""The only way this makes sense to me is that there was a higher plan for our friendship to last,"" Afonso told People. ""I needed Kelvin back in Mozambique, because we relied on each other for comfort. And I can't explain it, but it just made sense that he would end up in Arizona too."""

An attack last month, allegedly using U.S.-supplied weapons, killed over 100 people.",2016-04-07,Yemenis protest Saudi-led airstrikes during a rally on the first anniversary of the conflict.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5706cfe5150000ad000b4504.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- U.S.-supplied weapons were used by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in one of its deadliest attacks in Yemen, Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit organization that surveyed the scene of the March 15 bombing, wrote in a report on Thursday. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies have waged a bombing campaign in Yemen for over one year, with the stated goal of weakening the Houthi separatist group. But the coalition has faced criticism for indiscriminate bombings that have hit civilian targets, including hospitals, schools, weddings and markets. One hundred and seven people, including 25 children, were killed in the dual airstrikes on a market in northwestern Yemen last month, said Human Rights Watch. The United Nations identified and named 97 of the victims as civilians, but another 10 bodies were charred beyond recognition by the blasts. A witness told Human Rights Watch he recognized the bodies of about 10 Houthi fighters who were killed in the blasts and said that Houthi fighters often ate and slept at a nearby restaurant. The group could not corroborate his claims. Brig. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, a spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition, told AFP last month that the target of the strike was a “militia gathering,” After investigating the site of the blast on March 28, the human rights group found the remains of a “GBU-31 satellite-guided bomb, which consists of a US-supplied MK-84 2,000-pound bomb mated with a JDAM satellite guidance kit, also US-supplied.” The New York Times reported that U.S. warplanes typically use smaller bombs, closer to 500 pounds, in order to reduce the risk of killing civilians.The JDAM kit, or Joint Direct Attack Munition, is a U.S. technology that converts unguided bombs into “smart” munitions. The U.S. justifies its backing of Saudi Arabia and its partners in its air war over Yemen by claiming that American assistance helps the coalition strike with more precision, minimizing civilian casualties. When asked if the high civilian death toll in the March 15 attacks challenged this narrative, the Pentagon remained on-message.  “The U.S. is confident that the information that we relay and non-combat support we provide to Saudi Arabia and other Coalition members is sound and provides them the best options for military success consistent with international norms and specifically mitigating the potential for civilian casualties,” Col. Patrick Ryder, a U.S. Central Command spokesman, said. The Pentagon has said in the past that it provides “targeting assistance” to the Saudi-led coalition, but Ryder emphasized on Thursday that the U.S. does not have a final say in selecting and vetting targets. A senior administration official pointed to Saudi’s announcement that it would form a commission to investigate incidents of civilian casualties as a “vital step” and called on “all parties in Yemen” to “comply with the laws of war."" (The Houthi separatists have also been accused of launching indiscriminate attacks that cause civilian casualties.)Groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, another human rights nonprofit, are dismissive of the Saudi pledge to self-investigate and have instead called for an independent investigation into possible war crimes. Saudi Arabia began bombing Yemen last March at the request of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who had been forced out of the capital by the Houthis. The Houthis receive weapons and support from Iran, but the Iranians do not exert direct control over the group. Over 6,000 people have died in the yearlong conflict in Yemen, with half estimated to be civilians. A U.N.-brokered ceasefire is set to go into effect April 10, followed by a new round of peace talks. The U.S. decision to back the Saudi-led operation in Yemen is thought to be threefold:Saudi Arabia is a key U.S. ally.But at least one lawmaker has challenged that rationale and called for the U.S. to suspend military sales to Saudi Arabia and its support of the Saudi-led war in Yemen until Congress receives assurances the coalition's actions aren't fueling instability in Yemen, which could in turn strengthen groups like al Qaeda and the Islamic State.“With little public debate, the U.S. has a key role in a misguided war that has killed 3,000 innocent civilians. While all sides clearly share responsibility for the violence, the UN reported that most civilian deaths are the result of the Saudi-led coalition’s aerial bombing,” said Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, after the attack. “The U.S. has no business getting involved in a war that has only served to empower our terrorist enemies, exacerbate a humanitarian crisis, and incite fear and anger among the Yemeni people toward the United States,” Murphy added."

4,SPORTS,Just Because Greg Hardy Was Nice Doesn’t Mean He’s A Changed Man,Justin Block,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/just-because-greg-hardy-was-nice-doesnt-mean-hes-good_us_57053a14e4b0b90ac270eada,His recent sit-down with ESPN was not indicative of anything.,2016-04-06,Greg Hardy hasn't learned anything useful from his violent past. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570542e71e000087007065de.jpeg?cache=76i3CThYoR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Throughout a one-on-one interview with ESPN's Adam Schefter that aired on Tuesday, NFL defensive end Greg Hardy, who was found guilty of domestic abuse (creating a record that was later expunged), responded to Schefter's questions with composure and in a hushed tone.In his first interview about his past allegations of domestic violence, Hardy was alarmingly polite to Schefter throughout the 13-minute sit-down, addressing him as ""sir"" and smiling out of the side out his mouth when talking about football and his teammates. There was no mea culpa from Hardy, so it was a cordial meeting — Schefter never pressed Hardy in his questioning — but the substance of it wasn't.After the interview aired, Schefter went on Dan Patrick's radio show to play pacemaker to Hardy's arrhythmic NFL dream, as the defensive end remains a free agent following a tumultuous year with the Dallas Cowboys.""I went in with the idea that this guy is a monster. I came out of there with a very different feeling,"" Schefter said. ""I found him to be a changed kind of guy.""But just because Hardy was able to get through an interview being calm and composed without lashing out or joking about Tom Brady's wife while dodging questions about his domestic violence allegations, he's not suddenly a different person. We can't consider him truly changed until he apologizes for his actions and, above all, seeks counseling for his violent behavior. Until then, everything he says is at the detriment of domestic violence victims everywhere — Hardy is a living reminder of how abusers can walk free without recourse. Being a ""monster"" and someone who can act as a decent person in the right situations are not mutually exclusive. A monster can allegedly toss his ex-girlfriend into a bathtub and then onto a futon of automatic weapons and still appear as a cordial person in front of the camera. Hardy claims that his ""personality is not confrontational. It’s not in-your-face,” but interactions with coaches and teammates seem to suggest otherwise:Hardy is unquestionably still a bad guy, but he's not actively committing acts of evil during every moment of his life — that's not how uncaught criminals manage to live among us. When a person commits a violent crime and is arrested, it's not uncommon for the media to run quotes from family members or friends saying things like, Oh, this is so out of character, I never would've expected this out of them — a cliched and bad bit of common criminal reporting that Schefter totally perpetuated. And, honestly, in an interview airing on the top sports cable network in the world, how did else Schefter expect Hardy to act? Did he think Hardy would transform into an ""invincible mythological sea creature with white eyes"" (actual language Hardy used to compare media speculation about his character to his possible existence as a fantasy creature) and bite his head off? Hell no. ESPN reporter Adam Schefter seemed all too happy to produce what amounted to a puff piece for a domestic abuser. Since the night police were summoned to his apartment in response to a domestic violence call in May 2014, Hardy has never once taken responsibility. Once Hardy and a friend reportedly fabricated a story to cover for ex-girlfriend Nicole Holder's beaten body, from that day forward, the party line has been one of innocence. He changed his Twitter bio in November saying he was ""innocent."" Because the state of North Carolina dropped his domestic violence case after Hardy paid off Holder to ""disappear,"" in his mind, nothing bad ever happened. Schefter schilling for Hardy during the interview and thereafter isn't even the worst part of it. It's that Hardy, a man who allegedly put these bruises on Nicole Holder's body, continues to proclaim that he never touched her that night:Instead of acknowledging his attacks, he's playing the victim. He told Schefter that he put himself ""in a situation where I can be attacked,"" adding, “I still suffer repercussions for it. I fight it on the day-to-day, dealing with the people, my family and being a leper of sorts."" No shit. For all intents and purposes, you physically harmed a woman, even if the justice system hasn't conclusively recognized it. He has no interest in seeking rehabilitation — his sole focus is on football and his image, when self-help should be his priority, especially if he realistically wants to rejoin the NFL. When he speaks about wanting to be ""better,"" it's only been in the context of football, not his character. “It hurts me and my family when people take me like that, as a criminal and a monster, when I wanna be better,"" he said to Schefter. ""I want to set records, I want to chase the dream, I want to be part of a team. When I go places, I want people to know that I want to be a part of a championship team.”In effect, Schefter conducted a job interview with an remorseless, undeserving individual (perhaps in exchange for future scoops). ESPN willingly provided Hardy with a platform to get his ""message out,"" but not to victims of domestic violence in the apologetic plea of a rehabilitated man, similar to how Ray Rice handled an interview during 2015 training camp in an attempt to find a job, but instead to teams looking for pass rush help. At one point, Schefter even ran through Hardy's list of statistics before putting his Hardy salesman hat on, saying, “Those are a lot of accomplishments, and this league is looking for pass rushers.”Tossing away football, the most profound accomplishment of Hardy's life would actually be signing up for a rehabilitation program for domestic abusers. It's where he belongs, because if he wants to return to the NFL one day, he'll need to see Holder as the real victim and propel himself to earnestly change. Need help? In the U.S., call 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) for the National Domestic Violence Hotline."
5,POLITICS,Obama Just Struck A Blow Against Corporate Tax Dodging,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-tax-inversion_us_57044e42e4b05376618815a7,And the timing of the new tax inversion rules couldn't have been better.,2016-04-06,Pfizer CEO Ian Read. The new Treasury rules could put the kibosh on his plans to merge with an Irish competitor to save money on taxes.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570455a91e000087007064bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Treasury Department's new rules making it harder for U.S. companies to perform “corporate inversions” that allow them to escape taxes were hailed Tuesday by Democratic politicians, including President Barack Obama, and liberal groups.The rules announced Monday could save money for American taxpayers over the long term, since they shoulder a larger share of taxes when corporations find ways to avoid paying. Already, the announcement has cast doubt on the largest corporate tax-inversion scheme yet: the planned purchase by New York-based Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, of Irish competitor Allergan, the maker of Botox. The fusion of the two companies would allow Pfizer to move its headquarters outside the U.S. and benefit from Ireland’s lower corporate tax rate.Treasury announced the rules a day after the release of the “Panama Papers,” a trove of leaked documents from a Panamanian law firm that provided new insight into complex and lucrative tax-dodging techniques of the global super-rich.Obama pointed to the revelations on Tuesday as evidence of the importance of Treasury’s new rules.“We've had another reminder in this big dump of data coming out of Panama that tax avoidance is a big, global problem. It’s not unique to other countries,” Obama told reporters at the White House.He characterized tax inversion as one tax-avoidance technique that harms the broader public.“When companies exploit loopholes like this, it makes it harder to invest in the things that are going to make the American economy strong for generations to come,” he said. The practice of inversion also elicits public ire because of its transparent gimmickry. Inversion entails the purchase of, or combination with, a smaller foreign company. The deal allows the U.S. company to reincorporate in a lower-tax country.The new rules include a change that would tighten a September 2014 notice barring companies from enjoying foreign tax benefits if 60 percent of the merged company’s shareholders were also shareholders of the original U.S. parent company. Now, the foreign ownership shares will not count toward the requisite percentage of foreign ownership if they were acquired from assets of an American company in the previous three years.Treasury’s increased regulation of foreign ownership at inverted companies jeopardizes Pfizer's $160 billion agreement to buy Allergan. The deal was designed to comply with Treasury's old rules on inversions, with Pfizer acquiring a 56-percent stake in Allergan.Americans for Tax Fairness, a liberal tax reform advocacy group, estimates that under the rules Treasury announced on Monday, Pfizer’s American shareholders would now exceed Treasury’s American ownership threshold, making it subject to U.S. corporate taxes -- and eliminating the motivation for the “corporate inversion.” Treasury will likely not count a significant percentage of shares in Allergan as those of the foreign-owned target company, because Allergan is a “serial inverter” that has already merged with several American companies in recent years.“We are conducting a review of the U.S. Department of Treasury’s actions announced today,” Pfizer and Allergan said in a joint statement on Monday. “Prior to completing the review, we won’t speculate on any potential impact.”But investors clearly interpreted the new rules as a sign that the deal was off. Allergan shares declined almost 15 percent at the close of New York Stock Exchange trading on Tuesday.Treasury’s new rules also seek to limit a feature of corporate inversion known as “earnings stripping,” in which the newly formed, foreign-based company lends money to its U.S.-based subsidiaries. When the U.S. company repays the debt, the interest on it is tax deductible, reducing the profits taxed at the higher U.S. tax rate. Meanwhile, the lower-taxed foreign company’s profits rise as it takes in the interest payments.Treasury would count several types of debt typically associated with this practice as equity, presumably limiting benefits of this practice. The progressive Economic Policy Institute argued that the earnings-stripping provision could have been more comprehensive, and speculated that companies will craft a new way around it.Obama acknowledged on Tuesday that the measures were incomplete. But he said that was because of limits of what the executive branch can do without congressional action.“I want to be clear. While the Treasury Department’s actions will make it more difficult ... to exploit this particular corporate inversions loophole, only Congress can close it for good,” Obama said.The rise in the number of corporate inversions in recent years has sparked public outrage that in some cases has forced companies to back away from their plans to acquire foreign competitors. In a testament to the issue’s political salience, even Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has vowed to end the practice. His plan includes lowering corporate taxes.Among the Democratic presidential candidates, both Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and the campaign of Hillary Clinton released statements on Tuesday praising the Obama administration’s measures.The roots of corporate inversion are more complex than a stump speech can typically accommodate, however. U.S. companies stash earnings overseas, they claim, because the top U.S. corporate tax rate of 39 percent is among the highest in the world. In practice, the vast majority of American corporations pay far less than that rate, thanks to loopholes and other aggressive avoidance methods.But because the U.S. is one of the rare countries that taxes foreign profits at domestic rates if they are brought back to the U.S., companies also have an extra incentive to hoard cash overseas. Currently, U.S. companies are believed to be holding over $2 trillion in foreign tax havens.That deprives the American public of much-needed revenue, and can also prevent companies from putting the profit to good use.What distinguishes corporate inversions from other methods of overseas tax avoidance is that it gives the parent company freer use of the money being sheltered from the U.S. government.In order to fix the problem over the long term, the Obama administration has proposed reforming the U.S. corporate tax laws to look more like a “territorial” tax system, in which companies pay taxes to the country in which they earned profits. The president also recommends lowering corporate tax rates, while closing tax loopholes, so the changes would be “revenue neutral.”"

The results make it less likely Donald Trump can sew up the GOP nomination, but don't change much on the Democratic side. And millennials are driving President Obama’s rising approval ratings. This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, April 6, 2016. CRUZ TAKES BIGGER-THAN-EXPECTED VICTORY IN WISCONSIN - Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) came out on top in Wisconsin's GOP primary on Tuesday, as polls indicated he would. But the margins of victory were much larger than polls had anticipated. Cruz won 48 percent of the vote to Trump's 35 percent. Ohio Gov. John Kasich trailed with only 14 percent. Most polls had estimated Cruz winning by a far smaller margin. Polls from Marquette Law School and Fox News had put Cruz up by 10 points on Trump, but most others showed a much smaller margin. The HuffPost Pollster average showed Cruz leading by 3 points over Trump, a long way from his actual 13-point victory. Kasich had 21 percent support in the average, which overshot his actual vote by 7 points.Were people voting strategically? - Clare Malone: ""A small little slice of the demographic in exit polls that might indicate just how strategic voters are getting as the race moves along: Cruz won voters with a postgraduate degree in Wisconsin, a group that Kasich has traditionally done very well with. Cruz got 54 percent of these voters in Wisconsin, while Kasich got only 18 percent. By contrast, in Michigan, another upper Midwestern state, Kasich won voters with postgraduate degrees, getting 37 percent of the vote, while Cruz only got 19 percent support."" [538] Most delegates went to Cruz - The results translate into 33 delegates for Cruz, 3 for Trump and none for Kasich, with a few still not allocated by Wednesday morning. Wisconsin’s primary results gave Cruz a chunk of delegates that Trump badly needed in order to get to the 1,237 majority needed to win the nomination outright. According to FiveThirtyEight, Trump was already 6 percent behind the number of delegates he needs to be on track to win the nomination. The deficit in Wisconsin, where he needed to win 18 delegates to stay on target, pushes him even farther behind. If Trump fails to get to 1,237 delegates, the nomination remains up for grabs.

That's all there is to it (and you can unsubscribe anytime).SANDERS ALSO OVERSHOOTS EXPECTATIONS - On the Democratic side, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders racked up a 13-point win over Hillary Clinton. The HuffPost Pollster average had put Sanders only 3 points ahead, with 49 percent to Clinton’s 46 percent, and no poll had Sanders ahead by more than 8 points. Sanders has been awarded 45 delegates to Clinton’s 31 delegates so far.The momentum probably won’t be enough to get Sanders to the nomination - Philip Bump: ""Sanders's path to victory is now about as cumbersome as Ted Cruz's. Like Cruz, Sanders has almost no way to get the delegate total he needs before the convention; like Cruz, Sanders is hoping that convention delegates will be moved by his late charge to hand him the nomination if both he and Clinton come up short. Part of that argument depends on Sanders continuing to charge, which means continuing to win states even as the calendar turns against him. After Wyoming this weekend, Sanders is projected to win two of the next eight Democratic contests, though Pennsylvania may be close….Momentum feels important….But here, in the hard math of the Democratic delegate process, in a series of contests where Clinton's still gotten millions more votes than Sanders -- that momentum is mostly a mirage."" [WashPost] MILLENNIALS ARE FUELING OBAMA’S APPROVAL RATING IMPROVEMENTS - Samantha Smith: ""During much of Barack Obama’s presidency, Millennials have been some of his strongest supporters, rating his job performance much more positively than those in older generations. And today — with Obama’s overall approval rating at 51%, the highest in nearly three years – the generation gap in approval is among the widest since he took office in 2009. About six-in-ten (62%) Millennials (adults born after 1980) approve of the job Obama is doing. By comparison, half of Generation Xers (born 1965-1980), 43% of Boomers (born 1946-1964) and just 37% of Silents (born 1928-1945) offer positive ratings of the president’s job performance….Over the past year, Obama’s ratings among Millennials have risen, while the ratings of older generations (particularly Boomers and Silents) are little changed.""

The Fairfax, Virginia-based school decided to revise the moniker in order to claim $20 million from an anonymous donor who called for the change as part of the deal. Billionaire conservative activist Charles Koch donated another $10 million to the high-caliber law school known for its conservative legal curriculum.But the school’s Board of Visitors, who approved the initial change, either forgot to eyeball the acronym, or overestimated the maturity of the public.The jokes and jabs were plentiful, as a Twitter search for #ASSoL or #ASSLaw can show.The official name is still ""The Antonin Scalia School of Law,"" but the website and marketing material is now “The Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University,"" the Wall Street Journal was first to note.The school addressed the switch in a letter to students and alumni. ""The name initially announced -- The Antonin Scalia School of Law -- has caused some acronym controversy on social media. The Antonin Scalia Law School is a logical substitute,"" the letter said.The question now is whether Scalia, once regarded the funniest justice, would have appreciated the flap, even though he was the butt of the joke."
9,POLITICS,New York Primary Shaping Up To Be One Of The Most Important Contests Of The Election,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-primary_us_57050fa2e4b0537661882ebd,"If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.",2016-04-06,Hillary Clinton joined New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) during a victory rally for the passage of a $15 minimum wage and paid family leave in New York City on April 4.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5705126b1500002a000b42aa.jpeg?cache=cPKITurCBQ&ops=crop_13_344_3329_1782%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The upcoming New York election may be one of the most consequential primaries to date, with both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump fighting to avoid embarrassing losses on their home territory. It's the first time in modern history that the state has had two competitive primaries.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has now won seven of the last eight contests, although he still trails Clinton in delegates. For Democrats, New York's April 19 primary will be the biggest prize to date with its 291 delegates. Sanders grew up in Brooklyn, although he's spent his entire political career in Vermont. But it's Clinton who is now most closely associated with the state; she was elected to two terms as its U.S. senator and has used that experience as part of her case for why she is best positioned to be president. Losing the state, even if it doesn't hurt her significantly in the delegate count, would be a mighty symbolic blow. Clinton set her sights on New York even before the Wisconsin primaries were over, underscoring the importance of a win there and the reality that Sanders has been catching up in the polls. On Monday, she joined Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in New York City for a rally celebrating a new law raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour in much of the state. And on Tuesday, instead of finishing up campaigning in Wisconsin, she was back in New York appearing on ""The View"" on ABC, holding a women's event in Brooklyn and attending a high-dollar fundraiser in the Bronx. She and former President Bill Clinton will also be campaigning in upstate New York, an area that tends to be more conservative but where she did better than expected during her Senate campaigns.Sanders, meanwhile, has set up a new office in Brooklyn. While he will be campaigning in other states over the next couple weeks, he'll be returning to New York ""most nights"" to focus on the race there, The Washington Post reports. Sanders also sat down with the New York Daily News editorial board for a wide-ranging interview. The resulting coverage likely wasn't what he and his team wanted, with some criticism about his answers on both domestic and foreign policy. It also resulted in a tough Daily News front page.Still, Sanders has managed to significantly close the gap with Clinton in recent polling, and his April 13 rally in Washington Square Park is expected to have massive turnout. Sanders spokesman Karthik Ganapathy told Politico recently that the campaign felt good about New York because Sanders has ""the wind at his back"" after the string of wins. ""New York is an opportunity for us to head into a state Secretary Clinton represented for years in the Senate, and continue connecting with voters by spreading Bernie's message about the need for a political revolution that finally fixes a rigged economy and a corrupt system of campaign finance,"" he said.Trump is on firmer ground in New York. He's lived there his whole life and his golden, gaudy brand is inextricably tied to Manhattan. He's also resonating in upstate New York, where his messages on trade and the economy have rung true with workers who have seen jobs disappear from the Rust Belt. His first congressional endorsement came from Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who represents the suburbs and rural areas outside of Buffalo. Trump has also passionately defended New York against his main opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has lambasted the real estate mogul's ""New York values."" ""We don't really like Cruz, and Donald is one of us,"" John Catsimatidis, a billionaire talk radio host who owns the largest grocery store chain in Manhattan and ran for New York City mayor in 2013, told The Washington Post. ""He's a happy-go-lucky guy. He's not seen as extreme. He's seen as the guy who gets big things done and saves money when he does them."""

Soon enough, however, scientists working with the laser may be able to do much, much more.Construction is underway at the Stanford University-based laboratory to build an even brighter laser that will work in parallel with the existing LCLS.Each laser will occupy about one-third of the lab's 2-mile-long linear accelerator tunnel. They will shoot off rapid-fire beams to capture detailed glimpses of structures and reactions in quadrillionths of a second, The Washington Post reported. The $1 billion project, called LCLS-II, is described in a stunning new video (above) that was posted to YouTube on Monday.""LCLS-II will take X-ray science to the next level, opening the door to a whole new range of studies of the ultrafast and ultrasmall,"" Dr. Mike Dunne, director of LCLS at Stanford University, said in a statement. ""This will tremendously advance our ability to develop transformative technologies of the future, including novel electronics, life-saving drugs and innovative energy solutions.""How would LCLS-II work? Just like the existing LCLS, it will generate beams of extremely bright X-ray laser light by using the energy of electrons accelerated to nearly the speed of light.Unlike LCLS, however, LCLS-II will include a ​superconducting accelerator to propel electrons through a series of cavities, resulting in an almost continuous X-ray laser beam with pulses that are 10,000 times brighter, on average, than those of LCLS. It will be capable of creating up to 1 million X-ray flashes per second.LCLS, meanwhile, uses a copper accelerator that operates at room temperature and allows for the generation of 120 X-ray pulses per second. It will be understandable if it makes the LCLS look like a jealous older sibling.The superconducting accelerator is scheduled to begin operations in the early 2020s. In the meantime, LCLS will continue to operate, except for a six-month recess scheduled in 2017 for construction, and a yearlong shutdown extending from 2018 into 2019."
11,TECH,Why We Can't Network Our Way To More Women In Tech,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-in-tech-networking-cosmo_us_570523c5e4b0a506064dba12,The industry's good intentions can't fix a broken pipeline.,2016-04-06,"A sample from Cosmopolitan's ""Crack the BRO CODE"" feature in the April 2016 issue.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5706b3b82e00002d00950b64.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- You'd think Rebecca Minkoff, an elite fashion designer known for the ""Morning After Bag,"" would have an easy time hiring women. You might even guess they'd be lining up.But when it comes to the backend engineers and developers who have helped establish Minkoff as a tech visionary in the style space, female candidates are hard to come by.""Even my company has trouble,"" Minkoff said at an event about women in technology sponsored by Cosmopolitan magazine, Popular Mechanics and Intel Tuesday night. The event, Breaking the Code: Why Tech Needs Women, was made up of three hours of discussion and networking opportunities. Most of the attendees were young women. We talked to a number who said they work in or adjacent to the tech field -- there were people in sales and public relations -- and that underscores a problem: Women who are already in the biz may not have needed these panels, which were focused largely on answering questions about why they belong in tech. If anything, they need these messages much earlier.In a panel called STEM Dream Jobs, Popular Mechanics editor-in-chief Ryan D'Agostino talked to women panelists -- Jennifer Brace of Ford and Dona Sarkar of Microsoft -- about the problems they face. Brace, who has an engineering background, was asked to talk about whether men approach her differently because she's a woman in a tech role. The answer was expected: Of course they do. It's only after Brace drops ""knowledge bombs,"" she said, that men acknowledge she knows what she's talking about. On the other hand, it's assumed that any man might be an engineer or know about tech.Everyone loved the ""knowledge bomb"" anecdote. D'Agostino repeated the phrase numerous times throughout the event. But women shouldn't have to drop knowledge bombs, or prove they belong in the tech industry. They have to because they are vastly outnumbered by male peers. When it comes to tech roles -- engineering, product development and so on -- Apple is 79 percent male. Facebook is 84 percent male, Microsoft 83 percent and Google 82. Women aren't just underrepresented in tech: They're barely represented at all in even the world's biggest, most important companies. Great anecdotes about kicking ass and well-intentioned bits of advice can help empower individuals to chase opportunities, but they cannot solve systemic problems that lead companies to fail half of the world's population.""The way to change an archetype is to be in it,"" Microsoft's Sarkar said in the same panel. That's a good idea slathered in enigma. Indeed, having more women fill tech roles does seem like the best way to change misperceptions about women, but how do we get those women there to begin with?Cosmopolitan, Popular Mechanics and Intel did a great thing by attempting to empower young professionals in the tech space. For sure, women face an onslaught of problems even after they get these jobs -- harassment and pay inequality, for example -- which is why there's a value in holding events like these. They should absolutely continue. But the primary issue is bigger than any networking event could handle.For one thing, companies need to enact more innovative ways to identify and hire diverse candidates. Intel, a sponsor of Tuesday's event, is doing much to lead the charge.But much of this problem has to do with the moments in a child's life that define whether or not she will have opportunities to pursue computer science. That's why it's so important to create a better pipeline for women who seek education in the field, as YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki recently wrote on The Huffington Post. The beginnings of that pipeline can start with early, public education.Cosmopolitan, it should be noted, made a good attempt to educate readers in its April issue. In a package called ""Crack the BRO CODE To Win Big @Work"" -- which warranted a small cover line just below a much larger one about how to hump your boyfriend so good that his brain explodes -- the magazine spotlighted women who are destroying stereotypes in the tech industry. There were pages of good tips about how to land a job and a glossary of useful tech terms that, yes, was a bit pandering. (Sample: ""Basically, the front end is Gigi Hadid's glam squad, and the back end is the assistant who booked the studio."")If the magazine gets some girls thinking about pursuing tech professionally, that's one mission accomplished. But there's a ton of slack that the rest of the world needs to pick up, too."

That's when the explosion occurred, injuring the two teenagers, according to KTLA.com.Moon died as a result of the blast. The other teen suffered only minor injuries.The rocket was about 12 inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter, according to Ventura County sheriff’s Capt. Garo Kuredjian.""It wasn’t meant to go up into the sky,"" Kuredjian told News10.com. “It was meant to go horizontally to propel a skateboard.”He said it wasn't clear whether anyone was trying to ride the skateboard at the time.

Tammy Coburn, who was attending the meeting, told KABC TV that no one knew what happened at first.""Nobody could really discern what [the explosion] really was because it was a huge explosion, but it was just all at once,"" she said. ""Just a 'boom!' That was it.""Coburn said a Girl Scout leader who was also a former military member recognized the sound and went to investigate what happened.""He quietly stepped out of the meeting, closed the door and went out,"" Coburn said. ""He's the one that came upon the boys and then got the emergency help from a Girl Scout nurse.""Despite the efforts of the nurse and EMS crew members, Moon died shortly after 10 p.m. at Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center, the Ventura County Star reported. The cause was blunt force trauma according to an autopsy conducted by the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office. The incident was ruled an accident.The other teen was released from the hospital Tuesday afternoon.The accident has cast a pall over Thousand Oaks High School, where Moon was an honors student. The other students were encouraged to wear the school colors on Wednesday as a tribute to him. The elementary school where the incident occurred was closed on Tuesday.“He was just a cool kid. He was a nice person ... He could make you laugh.

In a sentencing memo, Hastert's lawyers asked the court to go easy on the former House speaker, who allegedly paid a former high school student millions to stay quiet about their inappropriate sexual relationship.Hastert's sentencing, they wrote, will ""be the most difficult day"" in his life, and he will appear before the court ""deteriorated both physically and emotionally, undoubtedly in part due to public shaming and humiliation of an unprecedented degree.""His lawyers wrote that while Hastert is ""deeply sorry"" for his ""misconduct that occurred decades ago and the resulting harm he caused for others,"" his life had been ""guided by his commitment to service."" They touted his dedication to his family, his faith and his community, and asked the court to ""consider the lives Mr. Hastert has impacted for the better, the contributions he has made, and his many good traits.""As speaker of the House, Hastert moved a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage during his time in office, years after he allegedly sexually abused underage boys.Hastert's lawyers do not go into detail about the ""misconduct"" he allegedly committed, but the court may hear specific allegations at the hearing. His alleged sexual abuse reportedly occurred before he entered politics, when he was a high school wrestling coach in the 1980s. He agreed to make payments to his alleged victim as part of an effort to keep information about his misconduct from going public.But Hastert, his lawyers wrote, has been in a ""state of despair caused by extreme isolation and the withdrawal of support from many friends and former colleagues."" His work and reputation ""have become forever tainted"" and he has been ""stung by the public repudiations of him that followed his indictment, including the removal of his portrait from the United States Capitol, the removal of his name from the public landmarks for which he passionately fought, and the characterization of his legacy as a 'black eye' on his county.""Hastert is ""tormented"" that his last name will disgrace his family members,"" his lawyers said, and he is concerned about the effect that the media coverage of his case has had on his wife.""Mr. Hastert recognizes that his misconduct is the cause of this public disapproval and close scrutiny, and does not seek to shift responsibility,"" Hastert's lawyers wrote.

Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) for Senate on Wednesday.""I'm proud to support Tammy Duckworth for the seat I once held in the United States Senate,"" Obama said. ""Few people fight as passionately for our veterans as Tammy. Soon after I was first elected president, I asked her to join my administration and serve her fellow veterans at the VA. She served with purpose and distinction -- service that continued when she ran for Congress and won. And I was proud to sign one of Tammy's signature pieces of legislation -- the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act -- into law.""""When her nation calls, Tammy Duckworth answers, and I’m proud to support her in this next mission: running for the U.S. Senate,"" Biden said. ""She supports programs that make college more affordable, including free community college for deserving students, and that's the kind of voice we need in the U.S. Senate.""The president rarely makes endorsements in congressional or Senate races, and it's unusual that both he and Biden decided to publicly back Duckworth. Both are popular in Illinois -- it is Obama's home state, after all -- so their support will go a long way. Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran and two-term congresswoman, is trying to unseat Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) in one of the most competitive races in the country. Polling from last summer showed Duckworth with a slight lead. She also raised more money in the last quarter of 2015 -- $1.6 million to Kirk’s $1 million.There's been some suspicious activity during their race. A ""protest"" last week at a Duckworth event included people who said they were being paid and didn't know if the congresswoman was a Democrat or a Republican. In November, Kirk supporters were caught using a fake minimum wage petition to put his name on the ballot. The Kirk campaign denied any involvement."

Jasper, a greyhound, has been at animal shelter Dogs Trust Snetterton in North End, UK for about six months. Staff fear he's been overlooked by around 2,000 potential owners because he's always napping when they come visit.The organization's now spreading the word on the pooch in hopes someone can give Mr. Sleepyhead a forever home. “We take in hundreds of dogs of all shapes and sizes but I have never met a dog who sleeps quite as much as Jasper,"" Supporter Relations Officer, Lara Murphy, said in a press release. ""Jasper is exceptionally handsome so it’s a bit of a shame he is often snoozing when he could be showing himself off to potential owners.""The 3-year-old greyhound used to be a racing champion but was handed over to Dogs Trust after his career ended, the release noted. While many other dogs have been adopted in the time Jasper's been with at the shelter, the pooch just hasn't had such luck -- a shame since the staff at the center claim he's very charming and sweet when he's awake. As the release points out, the adorable pooch, who's described as ""happy and healthy,"" isn't particularly high maintenance. The shelter hopes that he can find a home with a garden or some space for him to roam around. Because of his easy-going nature, he's able to live with children or other dogs. And of course -- he needs a cozy spot to curl up and take a siesta. Potential owners don't need to be taking the pooch out to run marathons either. “As Jasper demonstrates daily, [Greyhounds] are actually quite lazy creatures and though they need a few short bursts of exercise a day, are actually more than happy to curl up and snooze for most of the day.""According to the release, Dogs Trust, the larger organization to which Dogs Trust Snetterton belongs, has re-homed 200 ex-racing Greyhounds last year. Hopefully Jasper can soon join them as a success story. After all, isn't he just like all of us, who love a little shut-eye? For more information on Jasper, visit his adoption page here. "
18,SPORTS,State Attorney General Calls Fantasy Sports 'Illegal Gambling',Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tennessee-daily-fantasy-sports-illegal_us_570525f9e4b05376618847be,"Tennessee is the latest legislature to address the issue, as it looks to tackle gambling laws.",2016-04-06,"Some states have passed bills to regulate fantasy sports, while legislation is proceeding in several others.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Fantasy sports contests constitute ""illegal gambling"" under Tennessee law, state Attorney General Herbert Slatery determined in an opinion handed down Tuesday.Slatery's opinion does not carry legal weight but it could be cited in efforts to modify the state's gambling and fantasy sports laws, according to The Tennesseean.In recent months, attorneys generals in states across the nation have weighed in on the legality of daily fantasy sports. The fast-growing industry has attracted legal and regulatory scrutiny since an ""insider trading"" scandal rocked its two largest companies in October. Attorneys general in states like Illinois and New York have ruled daily fantasy contests illegal under their gambling laws, and Nevada determined that daily fantasy companies needed a gambling license to operate in the state.But Slatery went further than many state attorneys general in that he also ruled that traditional season-long fantasy sports contests are games of chance that, if wagered on, violate state gambling statutes.""Fantasy sports fall within the broad definition of 'gambling' under Tennessee law,"" Slatery said, if they involve ""an entry fee in order to win a prize.""“While participants may use skill to select players for their teams, winning a fantasy sports contest is contingent to some degree on chance,"" he added in the decision. ""Namely, the participants do not control how selected athletes perform in actuality on a given day. Athletes’ performances are affected by many fortuitous factors -- weather, facilities, referees, injuries, etc.""Season-long fantasy sports have largely avoided the legal attention the daily fantasy industry has received in recent months because they are legal under a carve-out in federal gaming law. Daily fantasy operators like DraftKings and FanDuel, the industry's two behemoths, have argued that their contests are also the types of ""games of skill"" that are protected under the federal exemption.State legislatures in states across the U.S. have also sought to address the murky legal environment around fantasy sports. Virginia and Indiana have both passed bills that legalize and regulate daily fantasy sports, and legislation is proceeding in several other states, including New Jersey.Without similar legislation ""specifically exempting fantasy sports contests from the definition of 'gambling'"" in Tennessee, Slatery wrote, ""these contests constitute illegal gambling under Tennessee law.""Tennessee's state senate approved legislation to regulate daily fantasy sports in February, but it has not passed the state House of Representatives.""We have been and are in an active dialogue with elected officials to advance thoughtful and appropriate legislation that includes consumer protections to govern our skill-based contests and are encouraged by our progress to date in Tennessee,"" DraftKings told HuffPost in a statement. ""We call on all of our fans and Tennessee supporters to let their voices be heard in the coming days to show support for this legislation and protect their right to play the games they love.” The story has been updated with a statement from DraftKings."

Mike Pence’s phone lines to protest his decision to sign a bill into law that will severely restrict abortion rights in the state.But instead of voicing their disagreement in conventional ways, they’re providing detailed accounts of their menstrual cycles.The creators of the “Periods for Pence” Facebook page explained their reasoning in a March 28 post, making the tongue-in-cheek observation that ""any period could potentially be a miscarriage without knowledge,"" and that ""just to cover our bases, perhaps we should make sure to contact Governor Pence's office to report our periods.""It seems like the calls to the governor are going well so far, based on what women are reporting on Facebook.Some have also been leaving messages on Pence’s Facebook page.HB 1337, which is now law, bans women from seeking abortions because of the fetus’ gender or race, or due to fetal abnormalities. That means that abortions will be prohibited even if a fetus is diagnosed with “Down syndrome or any other disability.""The phrase “any other disability” could include potential fetal defects related to Zika virus. The stipulation may also force women to continue with complicated, high-risk pregnancies or carry fetuses to term that have virtually no chance of surviving long after birth.The new law also requires women to listen to a fetal heartbeat and view an ultrasound 18 hours before getting an abortion. This will likely impose a significant travel burden on many women, since only four out of Indiana’s 92 counties have abortion clinics.Additionally, doctors at abortion clinics will have to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. “Admitting privileges” have nothing to do with whether or not a hospital will accept a particular patient. Instead, they enable a clinic doctor to admit their patient for a stay in a hospital without another doctor at the hospital weighing in. As Slate notes, the fact that some hospitals are unwilling to grant admitting privileges to abortion providers may force some clinics will close.If you’d like to tell Pence about your period, call (317) 232-4567, or 317–569-0709. Some Facebook users have reported busy signals, but you can still fill out a form on the governor’s website or leave a message on his Facebook page."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) made the case that some New Yorkers share his conservative positions and actually agree with his crack about “New York values.""“The people of New York know exactly what those values are,” Cruz said Wednesday afternoon at Sabrosura 2, a Chinese-Dominican restaurant where journalists clearly outnumbered the Texas senator's supporters. ""They're the values of liberal Democratic politicians.""At a January debate in South Carolina, Cruz cited the ""New York values"" of Donald Trump, his Queens-born, Manhattan-based rival. Such a person, Cruz said, is a social liberal who supports abortion rights and gay marriage.In a Republican primary campaign, that isn't meant as a compliment. And though knocking New York as some kind of decadent coastal metropolis may play well in deep red states, Cruz's line of attack is unlikely to find a very receptive audience among the New York voters he's now courting.Trump currently has a commanding leading in his home state, but Cruz -- fresh off Tuesday's big win in Wisconsin -- is hoping to gain enough support to diminish the front-runner's chances of securing 1,237 delegates and the GOP nomination.On Wednesday, Cruz qualified his earlier statement by distinguishing between New Yorkers and New York's Democratic politicians, like Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Rep. Charlie Rangel, former Rep. Anthony Weiner and former Gov. Eliot Spitzer.  “If you want to know what liberal democratic values are, follow Donald Trump’s checkbook,” Cruz said, noting that the Republican front-runner has given contributions to a number of Democratic politicians in the state. Cruz, an evangelical Christian, met with Hispanic and African-American pastors and several supporters behind a blue curtain on Wednesday as the press pack roamed the dining room, looking for members of the community to weigh in on the senator's visit. Rev. Rubén Díaz Sr., a socially conservative Democrat and New York State senator, hosted the event for Cruz while his son, Bronx Borough President Rubén Díaz Jr., a socially liberal Democrat, introduced Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton at an event that morning in the Bronx. After the meeting with Díaz Sr. and other pastors, Cruz singled out de Blasio for criticism several times. He suggested that the mayor reflexively takes the side of “criminals and the looters and the rioters rather than the police officers.” And the senator said he cheered when members of the NYPD turned their backs on de Blasio last year. A couple of protesters disrupted Cruz’s event, saying they didn't feel his values meshed with the community he was visiting.“Ted Cruz has no business being in the Bronx,” said a protester wearing a Yankees cap. ""To receive this right-wing bigot is an insult to the whole community.""But Donald Sadler, who was also sporting a Yankees hat, told HuffPost that he’s a Cruz supporter and was glad to see the candidate visit the borough. Sadler, an African-American Bronx native who now lives about an hour north of the city, said he’s believed for years that “that Republicans need to come and mesh with the communities of New York.” Sadler said he knows what Cruz means by “New York values” -- and agrees with him. “I understand clearly,” he said. “I’m pro-life. I’m pro-Second Amendment. I’m born and raised in New York City. I’m pro-family, traditional family, traditional marriage. These are our values. This is my value. This is not the general value of how voters in New York vote, and that’s what he said."""

They filed the complaint with the Department of Homeland Security and its agencies Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.In the document, the groups allege that U.S. government agents, most of them in Border Patrol, violated the agencies’ own policies by failing to return some or all possessions of individuals repatriated in 2015 or 2016 to Ciudad Juárez, which is across the border from El Paso, Texas, and near Las Cruces, New Mexico. In some cases, people said agents intimidated them by saying they could be detained for more time if they tried to pick up their belongings.Those belongings included wedding rings, glasses, identification needed to travel and work in Mexico, phones with their families’ contact info and things like jackets, the groups allege. Without them, people are essentially undocumented in their own country. “One needs the [voter card] for everything,” a 45-year-old woman says in the complaint. “It was my only identification.”Many of the individuals in the complaint said they were never given a claim receipt or inventory to help them pick up belongings. Some individuals said they were told they could pick up possessions only after they were deported, only to find once released that more than 30 days had elapsed and those items were destroyed.Some people were unable to pick up months or years of wages they had saved to come to the U.S., according to the complaint.All in all, human rights groups wrote in the complaint that the incidents detailed show “systemic abuse against those seeking asylum in the United States and those repatriated from the Southwest border.”Some of the incidents happened after CBP released standards for detention in October of last year, and after the government signed repatriation arrangements in February with Mexican authorities that include a commitment to “take all feasible steps” to ensure property, possessions and money are returned to their owners, the groups say.The Department of Homeland Security will review the complaint, spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said in a statement.“DHS has strict standards in place to ensure that detainees’ personal property ‐- including funds, baggage and other effects -- is safeguarded and controlled while they are in detention and returned to them when they are released from CBP/ICE custody or removed from the United States. Any allegation of missing property will be thoroughly investigated.”People can keep their money and identification while in Customs and Border Protection custody, but other possessions are stored, according to DHS. The U.S. government provides information on how individuals can retrieve those belongings, and if a person is being held more than 30 days, their home country's consulate or their attorney is allowed to pick items up. DHS says people should contact the agency if they are not given back their belongings.The complaint argues that even the current policy is too restrictive. If someone is attempting to leave Mexico because of fear of the government, for instance, they can hardly ask the country’s consulate for help.The government should act immediately to make changes where needed to ensure people can retrieve their belongings, investigate the incidents described in the complaint and ensure its policies are being followed on the ground, the groups write.“The U.S. government shouldn't be putting people in harm's way,” Vicki Gaubeca, director of the ACLU of New Mexico Regional Center for Border Rights, said in an interview. “What it amounts to is they're robbing people of their money and their belongings.”"

Total traffic stops dropped by more than half in the nine months following the shooting, according to the state Department of Public Safety.""I think they're laying low,"" James Johnson, president of the South Carolina chapter of the National Action Network and a North Charleston resident, said of police.

A bystander captured the shooting on cell phone video. Scott, 50, was a father of four.Slager's arrest on a murder charge may have helped spare North Charleston the rioting that took place in other U.S. cities after police killings of black men. He is awaiting trial, his lawyers saying he acted in self-defense.African Americans say their demands for more transparency in police practices, such as the creation of a citizen review board, have gone unheeded. Some complain of being subjected to overly aggressive policing and racial profiling.""People are still being picked out and picked on,"" Walter Scott's brother, Anthony Scott, said on Monday after family and friends prayed and placed white roses on the slain man's grave.""I don't want to see another mother, another family, have to go through what we've gone through,"" added Judy Scott, the men's mother. ""There needs to be a change.""Civil rights organizations are urging the U.S. Justice Department to investigate the police department. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc (LDF) has collected testimonials they hope will bolster the request for a federal probe, said Monique Dixon, LDF's deputy director of policy and senior counsel.""We want to make sure it doesn't happen again,"" said Edward Bryant III, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's North Charleston chapter. No one should ""act as judge, jury and prosecutor on the streets in a police car.""Mayor Keith Summey, who declined an interview request, said in a statement that steps had been taken to rebuild trust in the city where 47 percent of the 106,000 residents are black and about 78 percent of the city's police force is white, as are Summey and Police Chief Eddie Driggers.The entire police force is now equipped with body cameras and the department launched two new community outreach programs, including ""front porch visits"" aimed at forging relationships between people and law enforcement.Driggers ""has built a more responsive, yet gentler department than what we had at the beginning of 2015,"" Summey said. Driggers did not respond to an interview request.RACIAL PROFILINGThe Charleston Area Justice Ministry, an interfaith group that works for social change, will ask the police department to allow an external audit of its records for evidence of racial bias after the group said it collected anecdotes of unwarranted searches and questioning.The group plans to present its findings to the city this month, member Bill Thomas said.State records show black drivers continue to be stopped by North Charleston police at a higher rate than white drivers.In both the nine months before Scott's death and the nine months after, black drivers were stopped at almost twice the rate of white drivers. Total traffic stops dropped by more than half in the nine months following the shooting, according to the state Department of Public Safety.""I think they're laying low,"" James Johnson, president of the South Carolina chapter of the National Action Network and a North Charleston resident, said of police.

""We think of the social things that influence behavior: parents, schools,"" Boutwell said. ""But our study drives home the fact that there are aspects of the environment that aren’t social, like lead levels."" Research linking early childhood lead exposure and crime goes back decades -- and has even been offered as a factor contributing to the historic drop in crime after a spike in the 1970s and '80s. But the new study focused on data at the census tract level, giving a more detailed analysis than prior research, which studied broader population segments like states or counties that allowed for more variation in factors like income and race. The average American's exposure to lead dropped drastically in the mid-1970s, when lead was phased out as a gasoline additive and lead paint for homes was banned, prompted in part by research that linked lead exposure to low IQs in children. Within a few years, gasoline lead levels had fallen 80 percent (leaded gasoline was banned completely by 1996). Nowadays, researchers find the main sources of lead exposure are from the soil (where lead particulate in the air permanently settled) and from aging, pre-1970s housing stock, where lead paint dust and paint chips are present, Boutwell said. Another source is water carried through lead pipes.Lead is a deadly toxin. Exposure at an early age can cause low IQ, growth problems, mood disorders, poor impulse control, irritability and learning disabilities. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1992 set the blood lead levels for ""action and concern"" at 10 micrograms per deciliter, nearly half of all children in St. Louis who were screened exceeded the standard. Within two decades, the rate fell to around 12 percent -- even as the CDC standard became more stringent.Some children, however, continued to face the threat of lead exposure from aging homes in their neighborhood. ""Children are the barometer of environmental lead. it always shows up in them first,"" said University of Cincinnati professor Kim Dietrich, who is leading the longest-running U.S. study on the effects of lead exposure and development, known as the Cincinnati Lead Study.Boutwell and his colleagues looked at the blood lead screening levels of young children in St. Louis over an 11-year period, from 1996 to 2007, and compared that to crime levels in each census tract from 2010 to 2012.The researchers didn't track individuals' lead exposure as a predictor of criminal behavior, but rather as a way to establish lead levels in each area. Boutwell said researchers also controlled for ""disadvantage factors"" like single-parent families, unemployment and food stamp use.

Dietrich and a team of researchers, including fellow University of Cincinnati professor John Wright, who focuses on biosocial criminology, continue to follow roughly 250 people who, in the 1970s lived in mostly poor areas Cincinnati that had heavy lead concentration. Researchers assessed the blood lead level from the prenatal period through the individuals' early adulthood. ""We did developmental assessments on sensory motor development, IQ, attention, behavioral problems, academic skills up to about 6 to 7 years old,"" Dietrich said. ""We began to get interested in this crime link when they were about 16 to 17 years in age."" Dietrich's team wanted to see if lead exposure was pushing the cohort toward adult criminal activity. The findings indicated that the lead exposure did indeed predict criminal behavior later in life. ""There was a strong relationship between their blood lead levels as juveniles and their prenatal levels. Not only was there a relationship between lead exposure and adolescence, but into adulthood --19 to 24 years old,"" Dietrich said. The study showed that lead had a surprising effect on brain development: Early childhood exposure predictably decreased brain volume, but in specific regions that control executive functions, like decision making, mood and anticipation of consequences, Dietrich said.Wright said the blood lead level as a criminal behavior predictor is ""quite remarkable for a variable that essentially occurred very early in the life cycle.” ""The data speaks very, very clearly that the removal of lead from products has a significant impact on these crime trends in our society,"" Dietrich said."

But Switlick, who is legally blind, was unable to obtain a piece of photo identification that would comply with the state’s strict new voter ID law to cast a regular ballot in Tuesday's primary. Wisconsin is one of 17 states with new restrictions on voting in place for this year’s presidential election. Republicans like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who signed the state’s voter ID law in 2011, say such requirements prevent voter fraud, even though in-person impersonation fraud almost never occurs and over 300,000 potential voters in Wisconsin were estimated to lack a qualifying form of ID when the law was challenged in court.“There is only one motivation for imposing burdens on voting that are ostensibly designed to discourage voter-imperson fraud, if there is no actual danger of such fraud, and that is to discourage voting by persons likely to vote against the party responsible for imposing the burdens,” wrote Justice Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in an opinion urging the court to reconsider a decision upholding the state's photo ID law. (The Supreme Court stayed that decision, so the law was not in effect for the 2014 midterm elections, but the court declined to hear a challenge to the law last year.)Despite Walker’s claim that the state’s photo ID law “works just fine,” some voters were actually prevented from voting on Tuesday, with the burdens disproportionately felt by low-income voters, people of color, seniors, people with disabilities and students. When Switlick went to the DMV to obtain an ID card to vote, he brought his birth certificate with him, along with a utility bill, property tax statement and Medicare card. He has voted in Wisconsin since he was 21. He’s now 67. “I went there and went up to the counter and the gentleman behind the counter said ‘This stuff is no good, you’ve got to have a picture ID card, how do I know who you say you are?’”Switlick’s documents proved his name and date of birth, his Wisconsin residency and his citizenship. But they didn’t prove his identity -- he needed a piece of identification with his photo and signature, like a passport. But he had none of the acceptable documents. “How do I get an ID card if I don’t have an ID card?” Switlick asked. “They should make it easier to vote, not see how hard they can make it. I just thought it would be easy enough that I could walk in there … I was frustrated even when I went there because they don’t know how to deal with people who are visually impaired, they’re usually dealing with people who can drive.” Switlick ultimately decided to vote for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton with a provisional ballot; he’s hoping to get an ID to make his ballot count before the Friday afternoon deadline.Kari Venteris of Madison also had to vote with a provisional ballot Tuesday. The 41-year-old has a disability that makes it difficult for her to get around; she moved from Illinois to Wisconsin in December and hadn’t yet had a chance to get a Wisconsin driver’s license. When a friend told her that she actually couldn’t vote with her Illinois license, she contacted Wisconsin’s chapter of Election Protection. Her birth certificate is in Illinois, so she wasn’t able to get an acceptable form of photo ID before the primary. Election Protection advised her to go to her polling place anyway, so she did: there, she registered to vote using her Illinois license. A poll worker gave her a slip to get a regular ballot, but she knew submitting a regular ballot, rather than a provisional ballot, would be illegal under Wisconsin law.“What country am I in, where I’m thinking, ‘Do I vote or face imprisonment or a fine, or do I walk away and not vote?’” she said. “It’s so unreal, in the U.S., to be worried about the ramifications of voting, when the polling officials say it’s fine but I know it’s not.” Venteris is taking a bus back to Illinois Wednesday afternoon to get her birth certificate, a three-hour round trip. She estimated that the cost of getting the provisional ballot she cast to count before Friday’s deadline will add up to roughly $100.Ben Krause-Decorah, a 22-year-old member of the Ho-Chunk Nation who lives in Waukesha, interacted with some confused or uneducated poll workers when he went to vote Tuesday. He presented his tribal identification card, which Wisconsin considers an acceptable form of photo ID to vote, but the poll workers he interacted with asked him if his ID was ""real"" and requested that he use his driver's license instead, saying it would be ""easier for everyone"" if he didn't try to use his tribal ID.For more on how other voters were affected by the photo ID law, read Alice Ollstein at ThinkProgress and Ari Berman at The Nation, who were both in Wisconsin for the primary. While Republicans say that the relatively high turnout seen in Wisconsin Tuesday shows that the photo ID requirement wasn’t too onerous for voters, civil rights advocates say there’s no way to know how many potential voters stayed home because they didn’t think they had the right type of identification, perhaps because the state’s legislature failed to appropriate the funds it said it would to broadcast educational advertisements about the law. The unspoken understanding shaping debates about photo identification is that such laws are passed to disenfranchise those voters who are more likely to vote for Democrats. Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) articulated that position explicitly on Tuesday, arguing that the Republican presidential nominee would have a better chance of defeating whomever the Democratic nominee is in Wisconsin because the photo ID law will result in fewer Democrats voting. “[Grothman] seems to have gone off script,"" said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, which runs the Election Protection program. ""But he confirmed what we’ve always known, which is that voter ID is a tool used to promote voter suppression.” "

He was hospitalized at one point, after his leg was crushed by a coal car.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570568ac2e00002d009509c1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's not often that the head of a mining company sees jail time over safety violations.Former Massey Energy Company CEO Don Blankenship's one-year sentence for violating mine safety standards, which was handed down Wednesday, is wholly unprecedented -- but it's yet another punch in the gut for a labor force whose safety has, historically, been an afterthought for executives and federal regulatory authorities alike.For more than a century, the United States has crept forward -- slowly -- in its regulation of the mining industry. In 1916, the first federal child labor law made it more difficult for mines to operate with children under the age of 16. (Previously, children as young as 8 were forced to work.) It wasn't until 1941 that federal inspectors were able to enter and inspect mines for safety, and another few decades of disasters led to the Coal Act of 1969, which required annual inspections for all operations.Despite that legislation and other safety regulations, companies can often deal with a disaster by simply adding a line to their budget. A 2014 investigation by NPR and Mine Safety and Health News found that thousands of companies with poor federal safety grades failed to pay their fines -- sometimes for up to 10 years -- and continued to operate even after a deadly incident and while owing up to millions of dollars to the government.The coal mine explosion at a Kentucky Darby mine in 2006 killed two men instantly, and another three died of carbon monoxide poisoning while trying to escape. The company that ran the operation was slapped with hefty fines, but wasn't exactly forced to pay up.NPR reports:State and federal records list Ralph Napier Sr. as Kentucky Darby's co-owner and legally responsible corporate official. The mining company he and some partners once operated still owes $500,000 in penalties for the Kentucky Darby disaster. Napier also controls eight other mines that have $2.4 million in delinquent fines. ...In most cases, including Napier's, the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration allowed operations to continue, even when there were more injuries down the line.It's perhaps not very surprising that safety takes a back seat to profit today, since it's always been that way.There were warning signs, violations and pleas from workers to fix a coal dust problem well before a mine explosion in Centralia, Illinois, claimed 111 lives on March 25, 1947. A mine in West Frankfort, Illinois, was plagued with federal violations that went uncorrected until a blast in 1951 ripped through the area and led to 119 deaths. Over the past century, hundreds have perished in what are remembered as sad accidents rather than negligent, unmitigated disasters.In Blankenship's case, the justice system found criminality in labor practices that blatantly ignored safety protocols if they threatened profit. Depending on whom you talk to, Blankenship's sentencing is either a precedent that shows no executive is invincible or is an unthinkable miscarriage of justice. But many people agree one year was not enough.""No prison sentence and no amount of money can bring back the 29 men who lost their lives at Upper Big Branch, but my sincere hope is that this sentence can offer some measure of closure for the families of those miners,"" U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez said in a press release.“That said, this is a clear case of the punishment not fitting the crime,"" he said. ""This sentence is the maximum allowable under the law, but regrettably, the criminal provisions of the Mine Act are far too weak to truly hold accountable those who put miners’ lives at risk.""The United Mine Workers of America put the deaths in frightening context.“There were 52 people killed at Massey mines while [Blankenship] was CEO of that company. The penalty he has received means he will get one week per death. That’s a travesty,"" UMWA International President Cecil Roberts said. ""Don Blankenship deserves to go to jail, for that is surely where he belongs. And although this sentence will not begin to make him atone for his crimes, there is a higher court he will answer to someday, and I have complete faith that the justice he receives there will be more than adequate."""

They have previously said Vasquez had mental health problems and suffered from learning disabilities.The victim, David Cardenas, was found under metal sheets in the Texas border town of Donna in 1998. Arms were missing from the corpse, which had no skin on the back and a hole in the back of the head, court papers filed by Texas said.The incident raised worries at the time about occult rituals, which were stoked when prosecutors produced a taped confession in which Vasquez, then 21, admitted to the killing and drinking his victim's blood after saying voices from the devil told him to do so.Cardenas, trying to fit in with a group of teenagers and Vasquez, was hanging out with the group near a mobile home, when he was attacked in 1998.Police later received tips of a murder and found the decaying and mutilated body of the 12-year-old, the court papers showed.Prosecutors said Vasquez hit the victim in the head with a pipe and cut his throat. They also said he stole some jewelry from the victim.""The body was also mutilated after death by some means that caused bones to shatter,"" the court papers said.It took the jury about an hour to find Vasquez guilty.A co-defendant, then 15, was sentenced to 35 years in prison on a murder conviction."
36,POLITICS,Barack Obama Just Cracked Down On Wall Street,Dave Jamieson and Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-retirement-rule_us_57052f97e4b05376618854c0,"The White House says the contentious new ""fiduciary rule"" could save Americans billions of dollars on their IRAs.",2016-04-06,"President Barack Obama with Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who unveiled the so-called fiduciary rule on April 6, which will tighten the regulations around retirement accounts.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57052ff21e0000b3007065a4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After six years of debate and lobbying, the Labor Department rolled out a major new regulation on Wednesday that will require virtually all financial advisers to legally act in their clients' best interests.Known as the fiduciary rule, the new standards are aimed at cutting down on the unnecessary fees that Americans pay to brokers who advise them on their retirement investments. The White House says the rule will address a fundamental conflict of interest within individual retirement accounts, or IRAs -- that many brokers, who aren’t legally bound to act in their clients’ best interests, have a financial incentive to shepherd clients toward investments that come with high commissions, regardless of whether it’s right for the customer.Administration officials say the change will put the law regarding retirement funds on par with that of pensions. Pension trustees and administrators are considered ""fiduciaries,"" who therefore have a legal obligation to act in the client's best interests. But when it comes to retirement advice, until now only financial advisers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission have been considered fiduciaries, so brokers were held to a lesser standard. Pensions have been gradually disappearing from the U.S. workforce, leaving more and more current and future retirees reliant on retirement funds such as 401(k)s and IRAs. Any fees that customers have to pay is money that doesn't grow in their retirement fund. The White House estimates that conflicts of interest among retirement advisers reduces people's annual returns on their retirement investments by one percentage point, or $17 billion -- a figure much larger than it sounds, considering the power of compound interest over the course of decades.For example, a one percentage point lower return could reduce retirement savings by more than 25 percent over 35 years, according to the Labor Department. The financial industry argues that the Obama administration has exaggerated the potential cost for savers.Advocates for the rule hope it will end up pushing consumers toward cheaper retirement funds, saving them more money in the long run. The transition from expensive, actively-managed funds to index-tracking and exchange-traded funds is already under way, eating into Wall Street’s fees. They also say it will make retirement advice more transparent, since brokers will have to disclose potential conflicts of interest to customers.""It is indeed a good day for all of those who want to really move forward on retirement security for everyone in this country,"" Labor Secretary Tom Perez said Wednesday at an event at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning Washington think tank. ""[The rule] puts in place a fundamental principle of consumer protection into the American retirement marketplace, which is that a consumer's best interest must now come before the adviser's financial interest.""The financial services industry pushed back hard against the regulation, arguing that, in addition to cutting into broker pay, it would limit the menu of investment options for customers -- particularly low-income Americans. It’s unclear though how much effort Wall Street devotes to serving the retirement needs of low-income households, as bigger accounts typically lead to fatter fee opportunities. The new rule could result in financial institutions charging households a flat fee to manage their retirement accounts, instead of advisers getting paid commissions on investments.The lobbying led the White House to shelve the proposal in 2011, only to later revive it. The rule is one of Obama's most contentious and anticipated new regulations, and it's a prime target for Republicans in Congress to try to kill before it gets implemented, perhaps by seeking to block funding for it through the appropriations process.The Obama administration estimates that the rule will aid more than 40 million households that collectively have more than $7 trillion in IRAs, and in particular the hundreds of billions of dollars that consumers annually roll over from 401(k)s and other retirement plans to IRAs. Households were “especially vulnerable to bad advice” on their rollovers because those transactions weren’t protected until this new rule.The campaign by critics wasn't a total loss. Some of the original proposal's details were watered down or jettisoned on its way toward implementation, as is often the case with such regulations. The Labor Department ended up scrapping some of the disclosure requirements for advisers and brokers. It also included a ""grandfathering"" provision so that existing arrangements with customers don't have to be redrawn to meet the new standards. And in the end, the rules won't be fully effective until 2018, rather than 2017 as many expected.The longer timeline could allow the next administration to further delay, or even revoke, the rule. Already, some senior Republicans in Congress have moved to repeal it. ""Congress must act to stop this costly, complicated and potentially conflicting rule that’s unfair to millions of American families who only want the freedom to plan for financial independence and the right to shape their own destiny,"" said Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee."

The goal was to move her to the relative safety of a sanctuary, away from the dangers of plantations and poachers. But this week, her story of survival and hope took a grim turn.Najaq died.Indonesia's environment ministry told the AFP on Tuesday that the 4- or 5-year-old rhino succumbed to a leg infection. The wound appeared to have been caused by a snare from an earlier poaching attempt, WWF said.“The sad death of this rhino reminds us of the tremendous challenges associated with protecting the Sumatran rhino population in the Indonesian part of Borneo,” Arnold Sitompul, conservation director of WWF-Indonesia, told National Geographic. “[It] underscores why we need to continue our efforts with the strong support of the government and other experts to save the remaining population of Sumatran rhinos in the area.”Habitat destruction and poaching have decimated populations of the Sumatran rhino, a species once widespread in Asia. Today, fewer than 100 Sumatran rhinos are believed to still exist in the wild. All of them are in Indonesia, in either Kalimantan or the island of Sumatra.For years, it was assumed that the Sumatran rhino had gone extinct in Kalimantan. But in 2013, camera trap evidence suggested that at least a few of the species had returned. It wasn’t until Najaq’s capture in March, however, that conservationists could confirm their existence in the area.“The death of this Sumatran rhino proves they exist on Borneo so we will continue protecting them,” Tachrir Fathoni, a senior official at Indonesia’s environment ministry, told AFP. The Sumatran rhino is the smallest living rhinoceros. Covered with long hair, the critically endangered species -- also known as “hairy rhinos” -- are “more closely related to the extinct woolly rhinos than any of the other rhino species alive today,” according to WWF."

The merger would have allowed New York-based Pfizer to cut its tax bill by redomiciling to Ireland, where tax rates are lower.A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that the deal would be terminated.Pfizer said on Wednesday it would pay Allergan $150 million as reimbursement of expenses related to the deal.Allergan said it would report first-quarter results by May 10, when it would also update on its plans to simplify its operations after the close of its $40.5 billion deal to sell its generic drug business to Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. The deal is expected to close by June.While the new Treasury rules did not name Pfizer and Allergan, one of the provisions targeted a specific feature of their merger - Allergan's previous history as a major acquirer of other companies.The collapse of what would have been the biggest-ever inversion deal allows Obama to claim a major victory in his last year in office.Obama on Tuesday called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to take action to stop U.S. companies from tax-avoiding deals.Pfizer was concerned that any tweaks to salvage its deal with Allergan might have provoked new rules by the Treasury, the source had told Reuters.This is not the first time that a tightening of U.S. inversion rules has caused a merger to unravel.U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc abandoned its $55 billion takeover of Ireland-domiciled peer Shire Plc in 2014 after the Obama administration cracked down on inversions.

Above, an airstrike in Aleppo in 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57052e5b150000ad000b42ec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Among the international figures named in the “Panama Papers,” the trove of more than 11 million leaked financial and legal documents made public over the weekend, is the richest man in Syria, Rami Makhlouf. Makhlouf, 46, is a cousin and close friend of Syrian President Bashar Assad. He's also one of the most hated men in the country. His flagrant corruption helped spark Syria’s 2011 uprising, when protesters attacked his businesses and chanted ""Rami Makhlouf is robbing us.""He sure was. Makhlouf exploited his close connections to the Assad regime to amass a fortune of some $5 billion and control some 60 percent of the Syrian economy. In 2011, Reuters reported that Makhlouf had total or partial monopolies in Syria’s telecommunications, real estate, oil, airline, duty free, construction and import sectors. Any foreigner who wanted to do business in Syria had to go through Makhlouf, analysts say.The 11.5 million leaked documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and published on Sunday, together make up the largest-ever data leak about offshore companies. They shed more light on how Makhlouf stashed his cash overseas with the help of foreign business partners. Mossack Fonseca set up and ran several companies owned by Makhlouf that were registered in the British Virgin Islands, where it's relatively easy to hide cash from tax, regulatory and criminal authorities. Makhlouf's businesses appear to be classic “shell” companies -- financial entities that don't really do anything in their own right, instead mainly serving as places through which to move money.The U.S. has been chasing Makhlouf’s wealth since at least 2008, when it banned American companies from dealing with him or his businesses because of his role fueling corruption in Syria. Analysts believe that Makhlouf serves as Assad’s “bagman,"" managing the president’s own ill-gotten gains.The Panama Papers reveal that international banks and law firms kept working with Makhlouf and other regime allies in spite of U.S. sanctions and as war broke out in Syria.Mossack Fonseca rejected the advice of its own compliance department to cut off the Syrian tycoon in 2011, as protesters took to the streets to decry the regime. Despite years of U.S. sanctions, one partner in the firm dismissed the claims against Makhlouf as ""rumors."" He defended the decision based on the advice of U.K.-headquartered bank HSBC, whose role as Makhlouf’s banker was revealed in previous leaks and prompted a U.S. Senate investigation. After the Syrian regime responded to the protests with deadly force, and the European Union imposed sanctions on Makhlouf and other members of regime in mid-2011, HSBC and Mossack Fonseca finally cut ties with him. ""We did not know this individual until his name and association were reported in the media,"" Mossack Fonseca said of Makhlouf in a statement following the leaks. ""While we were the registered agent for a company that, as we later discovered, was resold to him, we did not deal with him directly. Due to the banking secrecy laws in Switzerland we did not have access to information regarding the final beneficiary of the company in question.""The law firm has denied that the Panama Papers establish any wrongdoing, noting that there is nothing illegal about setting up offshore companies. The Guardian notes that there are legitimate reasons why people might want anonymity, or to protect their money overseas.Still, the scale of the practice is staggering. One 2012 study reported that at least $21 trillion, and perhaps as much as $31 trillion, has been parked in offshore accounts to put it beyond the reach of various authorities, and Mossack Fonseca itself says it has set up more than 240,000 offshore companies. The Panama Papers reveal that Mossack's clients include more than 143 world leaders, officials and their relatives, as well sports stars, arms dealers and drug lords. Icelandic Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson stepped down on Tuesday after revelations about his offshore dealings sparked massive protests.Makhlouf’s country cannot, for now, hold him accountable. Syria has spent the past four years imploding after protests against corruption and repression were crushed, and today is embroiled in a complicated, brutal war with nearly half a million casualties to date.If Rami Makhlouf symbolizes corruption in Syria, his brother Hafez symbolizes repression.Hafez Makhlouf is the 45-year-old former Damascus branch chief of a Syrian intelligence agency called the General Security Directorate. When the U.S. imposed sanctions on him in May 2011, the Treasury said Hafez Makhlouf had a “leading role in responding to protests in Syria,” including the deadly crackdowns on protesters from the first days of the uprising. Hafez was also named in the Panama Papers as the director of yet another company registered in the British Virgin Islands by Mossack Fonseca.In Assad’s Syria, corruption and repression work hand in hand. The Makhlouf brothers are a striking example of the dirty dealings of the regime's inner circle.Rami Makhlouf used the intelligence apparatus run by his brother to intimidate his business rivals. One prominent economist, who criticized authorities for giving Rami a contract to set up the country’s largest cell phone operator, ended up spending seven years in jail.It’s not totally clear how the brothers have fared since the war.At the start of the uprising, Rami Makhlouf reportedly angered Assad by warning in an interview with The New York Times that the regime would fight to the death for its survival. Shortly after, Makhlouf declared that he would quit business and donate his profits to charity. But most Syrians didn’t believe him, and last June a Swiss court rejected Makhlouf's attempt to unfreeze his assets in the country, expressing skepticism that he'd actually dissociated himself from the regime as he claimed.Hafez Makhlouf, meanwhile, lost his intelligence post in 2014, and was later reported to have left Syria for Belarus or Russia. Unlike his brother, he was able to persuade a Swiss court in 2012 to unfreeze some $3 million he was holding in the country.The leaks also show that Mossack Fonseca helped Syrian companies that worked with the regime as the war escalated.The law firm helped three Syrian companies that were blacklisted by the U.S. to create front companies in the Seychelles, according to the French newspaper and ICIJ media partner Le Monde. The companies were sanctioned for selling fuel to the Assad regime that could potentially have been used in the warplanes terrorizing Syrian towns and cities. Mossack Fonseca kept working with one of the companies associated with the regime, Pangates International, nine months after sanctions were imposed in July 2014, according to the documents.Unsurprisingly, Syria’s state media has thus far ignored the Panama Papers leaks.

40,THE WORLDPOST,The Leaked 'Panama Papers' Expose The Dirty Dealings Behind Syria's War,Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/panama-papers-syria-assad-rami-makhlouf_us_57052790e4b0a506064dbd8b,The Assad cronies who got rich and crushed dissent had no problem moving their money offshore.,2016-04-06,"Syrians hold banners condemning Syrian president Bashar Assad and his allies, including billionaire cousin Rami Makhlouf, who owned offshore companies set up and run by Mossack Fonseca.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57052f16150000ad000b42ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Among the international figures named in the “Panama Papers,” the trove of more than 11 million leaked financial and legal documents made public over the weekend, is the richest man in Syria, Rami Makhlouf. Makhlouf, 46, is a cousin and close friend of Syrian President Bashar Assad. He's also one of the most hated men in the country. His flagrant corruption helped spark Syria’s 2011 uprising, when protesters attacked his businesses and chanted ""Rami Makhlouf is robbing us.""He sure was. Makhlouf exploited his close connections to the Assad regime to amass a fortune of some $5 billion and control some 60 percent of the Syrian economy. In 2011, Reuters reported that Makhlouf had total or partial monopolies in Syria’s telecommunications, real estate, oil, airline, duty free, construction and import sectors. Any foreigner who wanted to do business in Syria had to go through Makhlouf, analysts say.The 11.5 million leaked documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and published on Sunday, together make up the largest-ever data leak about offshore companies. They shed more light on how Makhlouf stashed his cash overseas with the help of foreign business partners. Mossack Fonseca set up and ran several companies owned by Makhlouf that were registered in the British Virgin Islands, where it's relatively easy to hide cash from tax, regulatory and criminal authorities. Makhlouf's businesses appear to be classic “shell” companies -- financial entities that don't really do anything in their own right, instead mainly serving as places through which to move money.The U.S. has been chasing Makhlouf’s wealth since at least 2008, when it banned American companies from dealing with him or his businesses because of his role fueling corruption in Syria. Analysts believe that Makhlouf serves as Assad’s “bagman,"" managing the president’s own ill-gotten gains.The Panama Papers reveal that international banks and law firms kept working with Makhlouf and other regime allies in spite of U.S. sanctions and as war broke out in Syria.Mossack Fonseca rejected the advice of its own compliance department to cut off the Syrian tycoon in 2011, as protesters took to the streets to decry the regime. Despite years of U.S. sanctions, one partner in the firm dismissed the claims against Makhlouf as ""rumors."" He defended the decision based on the advice of U.K.-headquartered bank HSBC, whose role as Makhlouf’s banker was revealed in previous leaks and prompted a U.S. Senate investigation. After the Syrian regime responded to the protests with deadly force, and the European Union imposed sanctions on Makhlouf and other members of regime in mid-2011, HSBC and Mossack Fonseca finally cut ties with him. ""We did not know this individual until his name and association were reported in the media,"" Mossack Fonseca said of Makhlouf in a statement following the leaks. ""While we were the registered agent for a company that, as we later discovered, was resold to him, we did not deal with him directly. Due to the banking secrecy laws in Switzerland we did not have access to information regarding the final beneficiary of the company in question.""The law firm has denied that the Panama Papers establish any wrongdoing, noting that there is nothing illegal about setting up offshore companies. The Guardian notes that there are legitimate reasons why people might want anonymity, or to protect their money overseas.Still, the scale of the practice is staggering. One 2012 study reported that at least $21 trillion, and perhaps as much as $31 trillion, has been parked in offshore accounts to put it beyond the reach of various authorities, and Mossack Fonseca itself says it has set up more than 240,000 offshore companies. The Panama Papers reveal that Mossack's clients include more than 143 world leaders, officials and their relatives, as well sports stars, arms dealers and drug lords. Icelandic Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson stepped down on Tuesday after revelations about his offshore dealings sparked massive protests.Makhlouf’s country cannot, for now, hold him accountable. Syria has spent the past four years imploding after protests against corruption and repression were crushed, and today is embroiled in a complicated, brutal war with nearly half a million casualties to date.If Rami Makhlouf symbolizes corruption in Syria, his brother Hafez symbolizes repression.Hafez Makhlouf is the 45-year-old former Damascus branch chief of a Syrian intelligence agency called the General Security Directorate. When the U.S. imposed sanctions on him in May 2011, the Treasury said Hafez Makhlouf had a “leading role in responding to protests in Syria,” including the deadly crackdowns on protesters from the first days of the uprising. Hafez was also named in the Panama Papers as the director of yet another company registered in the British Virgin Islands by Mossack Fonseca.In Assad’s Syria, corruption and repression work hand in hand. The Makhlouf brothers are a striking example of the dirty dealings of the regime's inner circle.Rami Makhlouf used the intelligence apparatus run by his brother to intimidate his business rivals. One prominent economist, who criticized authorities for giving Rami a contract to set up the country’s largest cell phone operator, ended up spending seven years in jail.It’s not totally clear how the brothers have fared since the war.At the start of the uprising, Rami Makhlouf reportedly angered Assad by warning in an interview with The New York Times that the regime would fight to the death for its survival. Shortly after, Makhlouf declared that he would quit business and donate his profits to charity. But most Syrians didn’t believe him, and last June a Swiss court rejected Makhlouf's attempt to unfreeze his assets in the country, expressing skepticism that he'd actually dissociated himself from the regime as he claimed.Hafez Makhlouf, meanwhile, lost his intelligence post in 2014, and was later reported to have left Syria for Belarus or Russia. Unlike his brother, he was able to persuade a Swiss court in 2012 to unfreeze some $3 million he was holding in the country.The leaks also show that Mossack Fonseca helped Syrian companies that worked with the regime as the war escalated.The law firm helped three Syrian companies that were blacklisted by the U.S. to create front companies in the Seychelles, according to the French newspaper and ICIJ media partner Le Monde. The companies were sanctioned for selling fuel to the Assad regime that could potentially have been used in the warplanes terrorizing Syrian towns and cities. Mossack Fonseca kept working with one of the companies associated with the regime, Pangates International, nine months after sanctions were imposed in July 2014, according to the documents.Unsurprisingly, Syria’s state media has thus far ignored the Panama Papers leaks.

The attack killed 42 people, including 14 MSF staff members, 24 patients, and four caretakers, and wounded dozens more.Since 2011, the hospital had been providing free, high-quality surgical care to victims of general trauma, such as traffic accidents, as well as patients with conflict-related injuries. It was the only facility of its kind in the northeastern region of Afghanistan.The attack has had devastating consequences for the victims, their families, MSF teams and Kunduz. Six months later, the hospital remains closed until further notice, leaving thousands of people without vital medical services.Dr. Evangeline Cua is a surgeon from the Philippines who was working in MSF’s Kunduz Trauma Center in Afghanistan when US airstrikes destroyed the hospital on October 3. Here, she shares her story of surviving that horrific night.It happened again last night. I woke up sobbing and disoriented. It had been three months since I went home from Afghanistan and, except for a fading scar on my right knee, that awful incident at the Kunduz Trauma Center was almost forgotten, suppressed to memory.Debriefings, consults with psychiatrists, meditation techniques, pages upon pages of journal entries to unload myself of the horror of that night — all of these were swept aside when memories came rushing back, triggered by a firework.We were like two headless chickens running in total darkness -- me and the surgeon who assisted me in an operation. The nurses who were with us a moment ago had run outside the building, braving the volley of gunshots coming from above. I was coughing, half-choked by dust swirling around the area. Behind my surgical mask, my mouth was gritty, as if somebody forced me to eat sand. I could hear my breath rasping in and out. Layers of smoke coming from a nearby room made it hard to see where we were. Blinking around, I caught sight of a glow, from a man’s hand holding a phone. He seemed mortally wounded but was still trying to send a message… perhaps to a loved one?I stood transfixed, not knowing where to turn or what to do. All around us, bombing continued in regular intervals, shaking the ground, sending debris sweeping and flying. One. Two. Three. I tried to count but there seems to be no abatement to the explosions. I stopped counting at eight and silently prayed that we could get out of there alive.I was 12 years old when I read a famous woman surgeon’s biography. I dreamed of becoming a surgeon since then. “I am going to wear a scrub suit,” I thought to myself. “With a scalpel in my hand, I’ll make a difference in other peoples’ lives.”The desire to work in a war zone came later but it was prominent in my bucket list. I feel like I won the lottery when I got accepted by Médecins Sans Frontières as a field surgeon. Doctors Without Borders! Despite the reminders and warnings from well-meaning friends and relatives about the dangers of working in a conflict zone, I eagerly prepared for my first mission.In a 100-bed trauma center in a war zone, I was expecting to be inundated with patients, operating day in and day out, to be so exhausted that all I could do was crawl into bed and fall into a deep slumber each night. I wanted to do complicated cases. Bomb blasts. Gunshots. Cases I had only read in textbooks. Anything.But I felt useless in my first few weeks in Kunduz. Except for the occasional liver injury sustained during motor vehicle accidents and some elective general surgeries, the majority of cases I encountered involved bones and fractures, something I have minimal knowledge about. And there were eight Afghan orthopedic surgeons who were so adept at what they were doing that I began questioning if I was of any use there at all.I was bored. I wanted to operate on patients. I wanted to do more. It was the reason I was there, after all. I only had two weeks before the end of my mission and, with a few exceptions, my life in Kunduz was one monotonous routine.That is, until the fighting began.“Car doors… windows unlocked…. jump….. car…. stray bullets. No…. contact… stopped… the way.”It was a few days before the bombing. Last minute instructions were being given to us. I couldn’t concentrate. The field coordinator’s voice drifted in and out of my consciousness. My stomach was growling and I hadn’t had any sleep since last night.“Okay?” Four heads simultaneously nodded. I was hardly paying attention. Trying to fix my head scarf with one hand, I was also busy writing a message to send back home.Surgical team going to the hospital. No wifi there. Will call once I’m back in the staff house. Tell mom and dad not to worry. We’re safe. :)Message sending failed.Message sending failed.Message sending failed.Darn! Securing my backpack, and trying to hide my frustration, I hurriedly climbed into the vehicle where a female nurse supervisor was already waiting. The male orthopedic surgeon and anesthetist were in the other van.Heart pounding and pulse racing, I tried to position myself as low as possible near the door, ready to spring up and jump out of the car if necessary. I had lots of questions in my mind — what are we going to do if a bomb was thrown our way, if they wouldn’t let us pass, or worse, if we were kidnapped? I chose to be silent, to maintain an appearance of calmness, to focus instead on the journey to the hospital. The sun was already rising in the east when the sound of explosions temporarily stopped and the surroundings became relatively quiet. When the go signal was given, the gates of the staff house were opened and two vehicles entered the deserted streets of Kunduz.The atmosphere that dawn was in stark contrast to the previous weekend. Eid had just ended, which is a happy and celebratory time in the Muslim world. Not a single shot was heard that weekend. Roses were in full bloom and the weather was perfect. Afghan men were shaking hands and hugging each other; kids in their finest clothing were playing in the streets, candies in their pockets; food was shared; people were freely walking in the streets, going to relatives’ houses to pay visits.It had been a delight to see children, and even adults, waving at us as our vehicle passed through the streets of Kunduz going to the hospital. The local staff and caretakers greeted us with smiles. Eid Mubarak! Happy Eid, doctor!But two days after that idyllic weekend, after fierce fighting between government troops and the opposition, the city of Kunduz, after 14 years, was once again back in the hands of the Taliban.I lost track of time. The clock on the wall reminded me that it was already late afternoon. A barrage of gunfire and explosions continued in the distance. I had just finished my sixth surgery and was slowly drying my hands with a piece of cloth. My scrub suit and shoes had splatters of blood on them. I probably got them from the pregnant woman who was hit by a stray bullet in the neck, I thought to myself.I was exhausted. I had been on my feet for almost nine hours already and my legs were aching. All I wanted to do was to eat a hot meal and sleep.I was immediately given a white doctor’s gown to put over my soiled scrubs. Following him outside the operating room, it was a moment or so before I realized the strangeness of the scene before me. There were at least a dozen people on the floor. More were lying on stretchers parked on both sides of the ER lobby. There were women with blood-spattered shalwar kameez, one of them pregnant, another staring blankly at the ceiling; men with tattered, bloody clothes; and a little kid moaning in pain, blood pooling where his legs should have been.I walked slowly back to the operating room with a forlorn look on my face. I was startled when an old wrinkled man with a full beard and kind eyes stopped me, and uncharacteristic for an Afghan man, tried to touch my arm. With a pleading voice, he asked me in halting English, “Doctor, please. My son is out there. Could you please take a look at him?” pointing to the black zone.The constant element of my nightmares was the roaring sound and panels of wood crashing down on us. And screams. Mine. Then me tripping and landing on the floor.“Left side. Going to the basement!” I shouted. We ran and jumped into the hole. To our horror, and big disappointment, we found ourselves inside the exhaust of the basement window. Surrounded with thick cement walls, about seven feet below the ground, it was covered only by a thin sheet of roof above. An abyss. A dark space. Dead end. The basement was on the other side of the wall.Patiently, like a teacher, he guided me through the prayer.My mind wandered to five days prior, when the conflict started. It had been a blur of surgeries, which sometimes meant staying at the operating theater for 16 hours straight. My arms were red and raw from constant scrubbing. I would wince in pain whenever I prepare for surgery. “You’re losing weight,” one of the local surgeons told me. I did. I lost appetite from seeing all the wounded day in and day out.Sleep was a luxury. I tried sleeping in the dressing room whenever I could — on the narrow bench, even on the cold floor sometimes. There was no stopping the flow of injured people seeking treatment at our hospital. There was just too much to do and I feel like we were not doing enough. But the anguish on the faces of parents with injured children was enough to keep me going.I was functioning like a robot on those days — emotions off, just concentrate on the task at hand and do as much as I could to save lives. There was no time to get emotional even if I wanted to cry. Crying was always bad for morale.The day before the bombing, October 2, it was quiet at the hospital. We were woken up — me, the other surgeons, the anesthesiologist — from deep slumber. “Morning meeting guys, it’s already 8 a.m.!”I woke up refreshed; eight hours of sleep, that was good! It felt like things were going back to normal. We could now walk across the open field to the hospital without fear of getting hit by a stray bullet. And there were very few patients’ names on the white board outside the OR. I did rounds in the outpatient department, something we had missed doing for almost a week.Life was good in Kunduz, again!We scheduled a young man at the ICU for surgery. Two more of my patients at the ICU also needed repeat surgery. We wanted to finish all the cases scheduled on the board that night.We had been doing the first surgery for almost three hours and we were exchanging jokes and stories to break the monotony of the activity. It was already 2 a.m. when I glanced at the clock. I scrubbed out, asking the local surgeon to finish the operation while I wrote the operative technique. “Let’s eat after you finish. I have some food in my locker,” I said.Then the bombing started.I was leaning on my colleague’s shoulder in the basement when he shook me hard, waking me in panic.All traces of sleepiness now gone, we began discussing what we would do if we were still alive in the morning. We had been hiding in that hole for what seemed like an hour. Nobody knew I was there, that I was still alive. I asked if I could go with him.I slumped on the floor, weeping, all trace of hope now gone. I was weeping for myself, the dreams I had yet to achieve, all the plans for the future. For my family back home, for giving them so much heartache — I could have spared them the agony if I had chosen to stay at home and had a private practice instead. For my friends — I was not going to see them again. For the patient I just lost at the OR table — he was still so young. For the old man who lost a son. For all the work we poured into this hospital. For the people of Kunduz.Then, surprisingly, there was calm and clarity. I was back to being a surgeon again. “Okay, nobody will help me now but myself. What should I do?” After removing my shoes, I stood and studied the small space I was in. No crevice on the wall to put my foot into and the wall was really too high for me."

With a pleading voice, he asked me in halting English, “Doctor, please. My son is out there. Could you please take a look at him?” pointing to the black zone.The constant element of my nightmares was the roaring sound and panels of wood crashing down on us. And screams. Mine. Then me tripping and landing on the floor.“Left side. Going to the basement!” I shouted. We ran and jumped into the hole. To our horror, and big disappointment, we found ourselves inside the exhaust of the basement window. Surrounded with thick cement walls, about seven feet below the ground, it was covered only by a thin sheet of roof above. An abyss. A dark space. Dead end. The basement was on the other side of the wall.Patiently, like a teacher, he guided me through the prayer.My mind wandered to five days prior, when the conflict started. It had been a blur of surgeries, which sometimes meant staying at the operating theater for 16 hours straight. My arms were red and raw from constant scrubbing. I would wince in pain whenever I prepare for surgery. “You’re losing weight,” one of the local surgeons told me. I did. I lost appetite from seeing all the wounded day in and day out.Sleep was a luxury. I tried sleeping in the dressing room whenever I could — on the narrow bench, even on the cold floor sometimes. There was no stopping the flow of injured people seeking treatment at our hospital. There was just too much to do and I feel like we were not doing enough. But the anguish on the faces of parents with injured children was enough to keep me going.I was functioning like a robot on those days — emotions off, just concentrate on the task at hand and do as much as I could to save lives. There was no time to get emotional even if I wanted to cry. Crying was always bad for morale.The day before the bombing, October 2, it was quiet at the hospital. We were woken up — me, the other surgeons, the anesthesiologist — from deep slumber. “Morning meeting guys, it’s already 8 a.m.!”I woke up refreshed; eight hours of sleep, that was good! It felt like things were going back to normal. We could now walk across the open field to the hospital without fear of getting hit by a stray bullet. And there were very few patients’ names on the white board outside the OR. I did rounds in the outpatient department, something we had missed doing for almost a week.Life was good in Kunduz, again!We scheduled a young man at the ICU for surgery. Two more of my patients at the ICU also needed repeat surgery. We wanted to finish all the cases scheduled on the board that night.We had been doing the first surgery for almost three hours and we were exchanging jokes and stories to break the monotony of the activity. It was already 2 a.m. when I glanced at the clock. I scrubbed out, asking the local surgeon to finish the operation while I wrote the operative technique. “Let’s eat after you finish. I have some food in my locker,” I said.Then the bombing started.I was leaning on my colleague’s shoulder in the basement when he shook me hard, waking me in panic.All traces of sleepiness now gone, we began discussing what we would do if we were still alive in the morning. We had been hiding in that hole for what seemed like an hour. Nobody knew I was there, that I was still alive. I asked if I could go with him.I slumped on the floor, weeping, all trace of hope now gone. I was weeping for myself, the dreams I had yet to achieve, all the plans for the future. For my family back home, for giving them so much heartache — I could have spared them the agony if I had chosen to stay at home and had a private practice instead. For my friends — I was not going to see them again. For the patient I just lost at the OR table — he was still so young. For the old man who lost a son. For all the work we poured into this hospital. For the people of Kunduz.Then, surprisingly, there was calm and clarity. I was back to being a surgeon again. “Okay, nobody will help me now but myself. What should I do?” After removing my shoes, I stood and studied the small space I was in. No crevice on the wall to put my foot into and the wall was really too high for me."

These are her memories from that fateful night.",2016-04-06,"Fire burns in the MSF hospital in Kunduz following the airstrike. Cua still remembers the ""acrid smell of smoke, the burning bodies and hair, the smell of fresh blood mixed with hospital cleaning agents.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570511d22e000064009508f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On October 3 2015, MSF’s trauma hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, was destroyed by precise and repeated U.S. airstrikes. The attack killed 42 people, including 14 MSF staff members, 24 patients, and four caretakers, and wounded dozens more.Since 2011, the hospital had been providing free, high-quality surgical care to victims of general trauma, such as traffic accidents, as well as patients with conflict-related injuries. It was the only facility of its kind in the northeastern region of Afghanistan.The attack has had devastating consequences for the victims, their families, MSF teams and Kunduz. Six months later, the hospital remains closed until further notice, leaving thousands of people without vital medical services.Dr. Evangeline Cua is a surgeon from the Philippines who was working in MSF’s Kunduz Trauma Center in Afghanistan when US airstrikes destroyed the hospital on October 3. Here, she shares her story of surviving that horrific night.It happened again last night. I woke up sobbing and disoriented. It had been three months since I went home from Afghanistan and, except for a fading scar on my right knee, that awful incident at the Kunduz Trauma Center was almost forgotten, suppressed to memory.Debriefings, consults with psychiatrists, meditation techniques, pages upon pages of journal entries to unload myself of the horror of that night — all of these were swept aside when memories came rushing back, triggered by a firework.We were like two headless chickens running in total darkness -- me and the surgeon who assisted me in an operation. The nurses who were with us a moment ago had run outside the building, braving the volley of gunshots coming from above. I was coughing, half-choked by dust swirling around the area. Behind my surgical mask, my mouth was gritty, as if somebody forced me to eat sand. I could hear my breath rasping in and out. Layers of smoke coming from a nearby room made it hard to see where we were. Blinking around, I caught sight of a glow, from a man’s hand holding a phone. He seemed mortally wounded but was still trying to send a message… perhaps to a loved one?I stood transfixed, not knowing where to turn or what to do. All around us, bombing continued in regular intervals, shaking the ground, sending debris sweeping and flying. One. Two. Three. I tried to count but there seems to be no abatement to the explosions. I stopped counting at eight and silently prayed that we could get out of there alive.I was 12 years old when I read a famous woman surgeon’s biography. I dreamed of becoming a surgeon since then. “I am going to wear a scrub suit,” I thought to myself. “With a scalpel in my hand, I’ll make a difference in other peoples’ lives.”The desire to work in a war zone came later but it was prominent in my bucket list. I feel like I won the lottery when I got accepted by Médecins Sans Frontières as a field surgeon. Doctors Without Borders! Despite the reminders and warnings from well-meaning friends and relatives about the dangers of working in a conflict zone, I eagerly prepared for my first mission.In a 100-bed trauma center in a war zone, I was expecting to be inundated with patients, operating day in and day out, to be so exhausted that all I could do was crawl into bed and fall into a deep slumber each night. I wanted to do complicated cases. Bomb blasts. Gunshots. Cases I had only read in textbooks. Anything.But I felt useless in my first few weeks in Kunduz. Except for the occasional liver injury sustained during motor vehicle accidents and some elective general surgeries, the majority of cases I encountered involved bones and fractures, something I have minimal knowledge about. And there were eight Afghan orthopedic surgeons who were so adept at what they were doing that I began questioning if I was of any use there at all.I was bored. I wanted to operate on patients. I wanted to do more. It was the reason I was there, after all. I only had two weeks before the end of my mission and, with a few exceptions, my life in Kunduz was one monotonous routine.That is, until the fighting began.“Car doors… windows unlocked…. jump….. car…. stray bullets. No…. contact… stopped… the way.”It was a few days before the bombing. Last minute instructions were being given to us. I couldn’t concentrate. The field coordinator’s voice drifted in and out of my consciousness. My stomach was growling and I hadn’t had any sleep since last night.“Okay?” Four heads simultaneously nodded. I was hardly paying attention. Trying to fix my head scarf with one hand, I was also busy writing a message to send back home.Surgical team going to the hospital. No wifi there. Will call once I’m back in the staff house. Tell mom and dad not to worry. We’re safe. :)Message sending failed.Message sending failed.Message sending failed.Darn! Securing my backpack, and trying to hide my frustration, I hurriedly climbed into the vehicle where a female nurse supervisor was already waiting. The male orthopedic surgeon and anesthetist were in the other van.Heart pounding and pulse racing, I tried to position myself as low as possible near the door, ready to spring up and jump out of the car if necessary. I had lots of questions in my mind — what are we going to do if a bomb was thrown our way, if they wouldn’t let us pass, or worse, if we were kidnapped? I chose to be silent, to maintain an appearance of calmness, to focus instead on the journey to the hospital. The sun was already rising in the east when the sound of explosions temporarily stopped and the surroundings became relatively quiet. When the go signal was given, the gates of the staff house were opened and two vehicles entered the deserted streets of Kunduz.The atmosphere that dawn was in stark contrast to the previous weekend. Eid had just ended, which is a happy and celebratory time in the Muslim world. Not a single shot was heard that weekend. Roses were in full bloom and the weather was perfect. Afghan men were shaking hands and hugging each other; kids in their finest clothing were playing in the streets, candies in their pockets; food was shared; people were freely walking in the streets, going to relatives’ houses to pay visits.It had been a delight to see children, and even adults, waving at us as our vehicle passed through the streets of Kunduz going to the hospital. The local staff and caretakers greeted us with smiles. Eid Mubarak! Happy Eid, doctor!But two days after that idyllic weekend, after fierce fighting between government troops and the opposition, the city of Kunduz, after 14 years, was once again back in the hands of the Taliban.I lost track of time. The clock on the wall reminded me that it was already late afternoon. A barrage of gunfire and explosions continued in the distance. I had just finished my sixth surgery and was slowly drying my hands with a piece of cloth. My scrub suit and shoes had splatters of blood on them. I probably got them from the pregnant woman who was hit by a stray bullet in the neck, I thought to myself.I was exhausted. I had been on my feet for almost nine hours already and my legs were aching. All I wanted to do was to eat a hot meal and sleep.I was immediately given a white doctor’s gown to put over my soiled scrubs. Following him outside the operating room, it was a moment or so before I realized the strangeness of the scene before me. There were at least a dozen people on the floor. More were lying on stretchers parked on both sides of the ER lobby. There were women with blood-spattered shalwar kameez, one of them pregnant, another staring blankly at the ceiling; men with tattered, bloody clothes; and a little kid moaning in pain, blood pooling where his legs should have been.I walked slowly back to the operating room with a forlorn look on my face. I was startled when an old wrinkled man with a full beard and kind eyes stopped me, and uncharacteristic for an Afghan man, tried to touch my arm. With a pleading voice, he asked me in halting English, “Doctor, please. My son is out there. Could you please take a look at him?” pointing to the black zone.The constant element of my nightmares was the roaring sound and panels of wood crashing down on us. And screams. Mine. Then me tripping and landing on the floor.“Left side. Going to the basement!” I shouted. We ran and jumped into the hole.

The country's enormous surge in executions places it among the world's most active executioners. The country tops even Saudi Arabia, which executed 158 people in 2015, more people than it had killed in two decades. The stark shift in Pakistan's number of executions is related to a deadly attack on a school in Peshawar by the Pakistani Taliban, which killed over 140 students and staff in December 2014. The government announced that it would end the moratorium on the death penalty in the wake of the attack, but only for terrorism-related offenses.
