Seeing Love Letters once again, twenty-five years later, I find it far better than remembered. Gurney's play, as revived at the Brooks Atkinson under the direction of Gregory Mosher, is smart, delightful, and moving. Gurney gives us two WASPs who spend time together at dancing schools, coming out parties, college weekends and the like; a pair that could have and perhaps should have been lovers. They reveal themselves, in the letters, in a direct and honest manner; best friends on the page, the face-to-face meetings they describe are impossibly awkward. Andrew Makepeace Ladd III is--need we say it?--a straight-laced, cautious little boy, always behaving properly; no surprise when he becomes a U.S. Senator of the Republican persuasion. Melissa Gardner is an artist from a wealthier but broken family, more of a free spirit, and ultimately a lost soul. Gurney places them on an epistolarian seesaw, each balancing the other's wild swings but sometimes falling off (at which point the letters become one-way pleas).This came off as relatively insubstantial back then, perhaps in part due to the gimmicky circumstance of the production. The producers of Gurney's off-Broadway hit The Cocktail Hour--at the Promenade Theatre, on upper Broadway at 76th Street--noted the success of Love Letters at Long Wharf in the fall of 1988. Given the simple production values and the use of a revolving cast of stars at Long Wharf (starting with Joanna Gleason and John Rubinstein), the producers came up with the idea of doing Love Letters on Sunday and Monday nights, when their other Gurney play was dark. Performances started in March and continued--with two performances per week--until The Cocktail Hour closed in the fall. Knowing a good thing when they had it, they then moved to the 500-seat Edison for another three months; marginally higher-caliber casts played full eight-performance weeks, starting with Colleen Dewhurst and Jason Robards. Does the play--which spans a half century, starting in 1937--now seem better due to our distance from the events that are described? Andy fights in World War II, Melissa turns bohemian and moves to Europe in the '50s; Melissa embraces the freedoms of the '60s, while Andy becomes more conservative. Are present-day audiences more willing to go along with simple, 90-minute entertainments? The difference could just come from the marvelous performances by Brian Dennehy and Mia Farrow, on display through October 10; but I have a hunch that this production will retain its magic once the initial cast is gone.

If he could find a telephone book, that is. Dennehy effortlessly charms and entertains us here, grafting a touch of stodgily stuffy smugness onto the otherwise likeable character. Farrow, somewhat surprisingly, is giving the best performance we've seen from her. ""Performance"" is the correct word; there is a limited amount of acting possible when you are sitting stationary, without props or costumes or blocking, and reading a script through your eyeglasses. But Farrow isn't merely reading; she performs the character. Dennehy (and Gurney) refer a couple of times to L. Frank Baum's 1917 novel The Lost Princess of Oz, one of the fourteen Oz books--and Farrow plays Melissa as a Lost Princess who over the decades becomes increasingly more lost. The actress--who is best known, perhaps, for her non-acting adventures--has a theatrical background, having appeared often in London in the 1970s (including a stint as a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company). Her only Broadway performance--in 1979 across the street, opposite Tony Perkins in Bernard Slade's Romantic Comedy--was less than impressive. Word is that she was very good as Honey in the 1999 staged reading of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? which celebrated Uta Hagen's 80th birthday. (With Jonathan Pryce and Matthew Broderick completing the quartet, they played one performance at the Majestic and one at the Ahmanson in Los Angeles.) In any event, Dennehy is the sturdy rock of this Love Letters while Farrow grabs us and pulls us into the emotional center. Dennehy will remain a second month, with Farrow giving way to Carol Burnett (through November 8). Then come Alan Alda and Candice Bergen, through December 5, followed by five-week stints by Stacy Keach and Diana Rigg and--starting January 10--Anjelica Huston and Martin Sheen. Business permitting, I suppose; and the producers--led by Nelle Nugent, one of the lead producers of the original productions of Amadeus, The Elephant Man and Nicholas Nickleby--surely have more stars lined up for the spring. Back in 1989, one visit to Love Letters was enough for me. Having seen Dennehy and Farrow and experienced the enhanced emotions of this new production, I will happily contemplate returning to see what other favorite actors will make of Gurney's privileged but forlorn non-lovers. .Love Letters, written by A.

Moorhead Federal Building in downtown Pittsburgh by some 5000 union members, led by the United Mine Workers of America Thursday, July 31, 2014. Thursday is the first of two days of public hearings being held by the Environmental Protection Agency in Pittsburgh to discuss stricter pollution rules for coal-burning power plants proposed by the EPA.

From Hurricane Sandy on the U.S. east coast to the horrific Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, from rising seas to widespread droughts, wildfires, floods and famine, climate change is taking a growing and grievous toll on our families, communities and financial security. The costs of climate change are high while the solutions are affordable and doable. Yet the fossil fuel interests that are driving climate change are still so entrenched that it will take a strong public outcry to push the political will towards action.The public is letting its voice be heard. On September 21, NRDC will join hundreds of thousands of people, from all walks of life and dozens of countries in the largest ever climate march to demand strong action now. Gathering in New York City and with solidarity marches around the world, people are joining together because they know that climate action needs every voice. The gathering for the march will show that climate change is more than an environmental issue: it’s a justice issue, it’s a public health issue, it’s a community issue, it’s a family issue, it’s a food security issue, it’s a national security issue, and it’s a jobs issue.The march will send a strong message to the United Nations Climate Summit taking place just days later. The Summit is an opportunity for leaders to commit to the kind of action that will change the destructive path of climate change, moving us from dirty to clean energy.We can’t keep delaying action on climate change. It has been nearly fifty years since a report in the Johnson Administration warned of carbon pollution. Just this year, scientists in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Climate Assessment warned that the world is rapidly warming and already causing havoc in our climate. They’ve sent a clear message: dire consequences for our health, food supply, economies and environment are in store if we continue to kick the can down the road.We are almost out of time to curb the worst impacts of climate change, but we are not out of solutions.We have a huge opportunity to grow our economies and speed the transition to a clean energy future. We can create millions of good jobs in the United States and worldwide even as we strengthen our communities and protect our health. In fact, the new international “New Climate Economy” report shows that the barrier to fighting climate change is not financial, but one of political will.Political will can be changed if enough of us come together and speak up. The United States, the second largest carbon polluting country, has begun to show much needed leadership with improved vehicle fuel efficiency standards that will save money and clean up the air, and the first-ever limits on dangerous carbon pollution from our largest source, power plants. Yet in the United States and around the world we need even stronger steps to curb our dependence on fossil fuels and move ahead rapidly with solutions such as energy efficiency, renewable energy and transportation electrification. Our leaders need to stop the extraction of ever dirtier forms of fuel such as tar sands and their infrastructure projects such as the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline. We need to stop ever more costly and risky extraction from places such as deepwater sites or the Arctic. We need to stop granting subsidies for fossil fuels – something that many of our governments have committed to do but have yet to put into practice.We need much bolder action and accountability in the United States and around the world. Join us at the Peoples Climate March and raise your voices. Our leaders need to hear loud and clear that the time for talking about climate change as something to solve in the future has passed. The time for taking decisive action to protect ourselves, our children and future generations is now."

Tens of thousands are slated to respond to his call, ostensibly to channel Franklin D. Roosevelt's ghost and make world leaders ""do it"" - push for strong climate policies, now.Except that it wouldn't be the climate movement if it weren't beset with self-doubt and second-guessing. Going to New York, you see, produces carbon dioxide emissions, the very cause of the problem. So how then can climate activists justify riding, driving or - heaven forbid - flying in the name of climate action?We do because traveling to Manhattan, and expanding our carbon footprint in the process, may be better for the planet in the long-run than if we stayed home.Real climate policy is what we needEvery cross-country roundtrip flight causes about a ton of carbon dioxide, per passenger. Driving emits carbon, if not quite as much. Trains do, too. Even if you bike or walk, you will need extra calories, which also come with additional carbon emissions.A plethora of online calculators can help you decide how to minimize your own footprint. You could get positively crazy making these calculations, and some possibly have.If you spend so much time online researching your carbon footprint that your power consumption shoots up, you may be on the wrong track. We should all be decreasing our carbon footprint. The emphasis is on ""all."" Real climate action, then, must go far beyond individual action by the committed core.The People's Climate March will take place on the eve of the United Nations' Climate Summit, convened by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on September 23, and for good reason. It's policy that needs to change.Coal cannot be banned, but it can be pricedThe headwinds are strong, to say the least. King Edward I banned the burning of coal in 1306, replete with the death penalty for repeat offenders. It didn't take long for the ban to be lifted, and the coal-fueled industrial revolution has brought untold riches to many.The coal question, in many ways, goes to the heart of the matter. Banning coal is out. It is neither possible nor necessarily desirable. What we need is to incorporate the full societal cost of burning that coal into everyone's private decisions.At the moment, each ton of coal and each barrel of oil used causes more in external damage to human health and the environment than it adds in value to the economy. That doesn't mean we should not burn any coal or any oil, but it does mean putting a price on carbon, ideally directly via carbon markets or taxes.It means regulation. It means standards. It means tax reform. It means taking significant policy steps to restructure misguided market forces so they lead us off of the current high-carbon, low-efficiency path.Composting counts, but it's not enoughGoing green is fine. I don't drive, don't eat meat, and do all sorts of other things that minimize my own carbon footprint. The climate movement is home to quite a few who go the full-on vegan, composting, skip-coffee-because-it's-bad-for-the-climate route.But going green is only good if it actually gets somewhere.If you compel your in-laws to compost more and drive less - go forth and proselytize. But if this makes them ignore efforts to achieve critical policy changes, your campaign for a voluntary green lifestyle should probably stop.Many actions needed for a climate revolution are akin to a bootstrapping problem. Building a wind turbine takes steel, which in turn takes energy. The green energy revolution then may well mean an increase in current, largely fossil-fueled energy use for the sake of decreased carbon emissions later. The Climate March falls into the same category. Going to New York implies emissions, as do most other things we hold near and dear in our daily lives.Participating in the march won't change that fact overnight. But calling for real, measured climate action just might. Helping to build the momentum toward policy change is precisely what's needed. If you can do it while also decreasing your own footprint, so much the better. If not, choose policy change.Bike if you can, fly if you must. By all means, go to New York on September 21."
4,POLITICS,Joe Biden: Shakespearean Wordsmith,"Robert David Jaffee, ContributorAuthor, journalist and mental health activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-shakespearean-w_b_5847196.html,"By invoking Shylock, the villain of The Merchant of Venice, Biden trafficked in one of the most insidious stereotypes about Jews, that the people of the book are unethical money lenders.",2014-09-19,"Vice President Joe Biden addresses the Roosevelt Institute Honors after receiving the groups Freedom Medal, the institutes highest honor, during a dinner in Washington, Thursday, July 10, 2014. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d672240000510057730c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Who knew that Joe Biden had ever studied Shakespeare? When the vice president spoke at the Legal Services Corp. in Washington on Tuesday, he criticized ""Shylocks who took advantage"" of servicemen and women by giving them bad loans and foreclosing on their properties. By invoking Shylock, the villain of The Merchant of Venice, Biden trafficked in one of the most insidious stereotypes about Jews, that the people of the book are unethical money lenders.An absent-minded bumbler, who happens to be a proverbial heart beat from the presidency, Biden is a decent and amiable fellow, who to his credit immediately apologized for his gaffe. He is an Irish-American mensch, who has supported Israel for years, who is loyal to his president and his country, and who has survived many tragedies and challenges, including surgery on his brain. That he is not a brain surgeon is well-known. It is not simply that Biden, hailed as a foreign policy expert, got it wrong on both Gulf Wars, voting against the first one and for the second, it is also that Biden has historically had somewhat of a problem with borrowing passages without attribution from others.In 1988, during his first run for the presidency, Biden dropped out of the race after charges that his campaign had pilfered from the speeches of Neil Kinnock, then a Labor Party leader in Britain. Around that time, allegations also surfaced that a young Joe Biden plagiarized from someone else when he was a law student at Syracuse University.Is it possible that Biden, in citing Shylock all these years later, was simply atoning for his past by acknowledging the Bard, the greatest writer who ever lived?Shylock is best remembered for his hideous proclamation, ""I want my pound of flesh."" Yet, to be fair to Biden, who has struggled to come up with original material, he may admire the rare eloquence accorded Shylock by Shakespeare. In one of the most luminous speeches in The Merchant of Venice, Shylock says, ""Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? ... If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?""No one is seeking revenge against Joe Biden, the White House's equivalent of Mr. Magoo. And no one should accuse the vice president, who may run for president again in 2016, of being anti-Semitic. Uncle Joe almost assuredly did not think before he uttered that phrase about Shylock and bad loans to our troops.Similarly, no one should accuse Shakespeare of being anti-Semitic. Not only did the Bard grant Shylock a rare eloquence. The Bard also depicted the other Jews in the play, Tubal, Shylock's friend, and Jessica, Shylock's daughter, as reasonably positive characters. While many laud Portia for her legal gifts in condemning Shylock, she exhibits a cruelty toward him that makes her far from the most sublime heroine in Shakespeare. One need only remember what Shakespeare famously said about members of her profession: ""The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.""Just as Portia does not approach the magnificence of Rosalind or Cleopatra, Shylock is far from Shakespeare's most sinister villain. It is Iago, not Shylock, who asserts, ""I am not what I am."" In so doing, Iago attempts to subvert a pillar of Western civilization, the life-affirming credo of Yahweh, who states, ""I am that I am.""Unlike Iago, who embodies pure evil and is an existential threat to all we hold dear, Shylock, for all his despicable behavior, is, in many respects, a victim not only of stereotyping but also a victim of his time. And the greatest indictment of Shylock may be not that he is obsessed with money, as many merchants of all denominations are, but rather that Shylock has no ear for music, a point I have made before.As Shakespeare wrote, The man that hath no music in himself, nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds, is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils; the motions of his spirit are dull as night and his affections dark as Erebus. Let no such man be trusted.I would love to know what music Joe Biden plays on his iPod. While he lacks the eloquence of Shylock, it is quite possible that our vice president has good taste in tunes. Whether he does or does not, he might consider listening to a little Cole Porter. ""Brush Up Your Shakespeare"" comes to mind."

Yet in the wake of star running back Adrian Peterson's grand jury indictment for reckless and negligent injury to a child, it's clear there are grown men and women out there who still think it's OK to strip leaves off a tree branch and whip a 4-year-old until he bleeds. To stuff leaves in his mouth. To cut him on the legs, thighs, buttocks, and scrotum. To whip him between 10-15 times, leaving defensive wounds on the poor kid's hands that were still readily apparent even a week later when photographs were taken.What Adrian Peterson did was wrong. That's fact, not opinion. And yet, for so many, they don't accept that. Why?I've been told it's a southern thing. A cultural thing. A black thing. A religious thing. I've been told it's the only way to make sure children are raised to be respectful. I've been told if more kids were disciplined like this, there would be fewer school shootings and spoiled children. But mostly, I've been told this kind of corporal punishment is acceptable because the parents who do it were raised this way themselves. And after all, they were whipped and they turned out just fine.Want to know how I know they're wrong? Because they still think it's OK to take up weapons against children and beat them bloody.If this is part of your southern culture, then your southern culture condones child abuse and needs to change. If this is because you're African-American, then the black community needs some serious internal reflection and a change of heart, because this is wrong. And if this is how you were raised, well... I'm sorry for that. But just because your parents made a terrible mistake out of ignorance, doesn't mean you have to continue the violent cycle.Because that's the thing -- your parents weren't perfect. They made mistakes, probably because they didn't know any better. Some of our parents smoked while pregnant because the dangers of smoking weren't well established yet, or didn't use car seats because the safety standards weren't in place. Our parents didn't have the wealth of information available to us today, so why repeat mistakes made out of ignorance when we know better now?NFL analyst Cris Carter -- a black NFL Hall of Famer no less -- said he was whipped as a child when disciplined. However, he chose to parent a different way. Watch this.Cris Carter learned from his mom's mistakes. But the saddest part of this whole fiasco is that Adrian Peterson believes he didn't do a damn thing wrong. Asked about the behavior, he said: ""To be honest with you, I feel very confident with my actions because I know my intent.""If Adrian Peterson thinks he turned out so wonderful because he was whipped with various objects as a child, just imagine what he could've accomplished if he hadn't been physically abused. And I'm sorry, but when it comes to putting our kids in danger with physical violence, ignorance is no excuse.Also, please don't let Peterson's defenders turn this into a public debate on spanking and government intrusion in our lives.This isn't about spanking, because Adrian Peterson didn't spank his son. I can count on one hand the times I've given my oldest a swat on the butt, mainly because he was attempting to run toward the road or trying to tear off the electrical outlet cover after putting his hand in the dog's water bowl. And even then, it wasn't the force that made him cry -- it was the stern ""NO!"" that accompanies the light spank.That's in stark contrast to Peterson, who reportedly took the time to fashion himself a switch and proceeded to beat his small child bloody with it by hitting him more than a dozen times. A grown man who smashes into offensive linemen and linebackers for a living, whipping a small boy he's supposed to love and care for. How anyone can defend that is beyond me.Allow me to bottom line this for you. If you think hitting your kid with a stick until he bleeds is an acceptable form of punishment, you're a bad parent. And, more than likely, you're engaging in a criminal act. Your culture, race, ethnicity, and upbringing don't matter in this instance. I don't care where you're from or what color you are, because when you decide to whip your 4-year-old with the branch of a tree, you are committing a crime. And I hope you face the same charges Peterson is facing.But mostly, I hope it doesn't get to that point. I'm hoping this will be a wake-up call to the parents who still condone this kind of nonsense.

6,WORLDPOST,Not Everyone Tweeting ISIS Threats Is Actually Representing The Group,Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/isis-social-media_n_5843166.html,,2014-09-19,"NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 17: New York City police officers stand guard in Times Square on September 17, 2014 in New York City. A blog affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) mentioned Times Square as a target for bombing. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13d7c2400003300382077.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, we bring you one overlooked aspect of the stories that made news in recent days. You noticed the media forgot all about another story's basic facts? Tweet @TheWorldPost or let us know on our Facebook page.According to recent news reports, the Islamic State has not only threatened to kill the pope, the British prime minister, Twitter employees, and every single American, but has also suggested bombing Times Square, Las Vegas, and infiltrating the United States through Mexico.Yet these were not official warnings issued by spokespeople for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. They were social media posts by Islamic State members, sympathizers and even some people purporting to be Islamic State militants tweeting from fake accounts. The much-cited recent call to assassinate Twitter employees, for example, was posted by an account claiming to represent a Gaza-based militant group affiliated with the Islamic State. In June, the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR) issued a warning about publicizing anonymous posts: “Fake social media profiles by 'wannabe' jihadis are not uncommon,” it said.The warning came in light of a report by British newspapers that a British militant in Syria had called for the beheading of U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron. The British research group found no evidence that the militant in question actually exists, and said his Twitter posts were nearly identical to another account from someone claiming to be an American fighter for the Islamic State.Regardless of whether the accounts are real, the Islamic State has actively encouraged a wide network of sympathizers to repost propaganda on social media. An ICSR study of foreign fighters in Syria in April found that many militants get their information from social media users who are unaffiliated with the Islamic State, rather than from official Islamic State accounts.Amplifying militants' social media posts that threaten Western targets could just add fuel to the propaganda machine. Counterterrorism officials recently warned that online propaganda encourages radicalized Americans to carry out lone-wolf attacks. And the former head of Britain's intelligence service, Richard Dearlove, warned in July that Islamic State supporters were getting more coverage ""than their wildest dreams"" and urged the media to ignore extremists' posts and stop giving them the ""oxygen of publicity."""
7,RELIGION,Orthodox Synagogue Plans To Hire Woman As Clergy Member -- But Won't Call Her A Rabbi,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jewish-orthodox-woman-clergy_n_5844182.html,,2014-09-19,Jewish Woman Reading a Torah (Photo by: Godong/Universal Images Group via Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7ef5e260000350083715f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In what would be an unprecedented move among Orthodox synagogues in Los Angeles, Congregation B’nai David-Judea plans to hire a woman clergy member by September 2015. The development in America’s second-largest Jewish community marks the success of a controversial move by some liberal Modern Orthodox leaders that began five years ago in New York. As a start, B’nai David recently hired Alissa Newborn, 25, for a one-year “kehilla intern” position. Newborn is in her final year at the New York-based seminary Yeshivat Maharat and will complete her coursework from Los Angeles while interning at B’nai David. Rabbi Yosef Kanefsky, B’nai David’s spiritual leader, wrote in an email that Newborn’s internship will involve seven or eight Shabbatot over the course of the coming year, at which she will address the full congregation and teach at various events with different demographic groups. In addition, Kanefsky said, she will shadow him in lifecycle events.Upon graduation from her program, Newborn will earn the title of “maharat,” an acronym for manhiga hilchatit ruchanit toranit — female leader of Jewish law, spirit and Torah.

8,BUSINESS,Apple Watch Tells Us That It Is Time to Get Serious About Jobs,"Greg Autry, ContributorAssistant Prof. of Clinical Entrepreneurship at USC, Economist...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/apple-watch-tells-us-that_b_5819218.html,"All things being equal, Apple and other nominally American companies would be more efficient if they kept production closer to design and weren't shuffling $billions between Irish shell corporations and Caribbean banks.",2014-09-18,2014-09-14-iPhone634FRSpGry_iPhone6plus34FLSpGry_HomescreenPRINT.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-14-iPhone634FRSpGry_iPhone6plus34FLSpGry_HomescreenPRINT-thumb.jpg," Last week, the world held its breath in anticipation of Apple's product announcement. When we finally managed to see the goods, we saw that CEO Tim Cook had knocked one out of the park. In fact, he hit for the cycle. The iPhone 6 answered every criticism of the current model. The 6 Plus filled a giant phablet hole in Apple's lineup. Watching master designer Jony Ive extol the virtues of the new Watch, I actually felt proud to be living in the golden age of consumer products. Of course, this stuff actually has to be built. Where and how that will happen wasn't mentioned; either because Apple didn't feel that it merited attention or because they didn't want us to think about it. Apple has demonstrated that Cupertino is home to the dream team of industrial design. California remains the center of the electronic products and software development universe as well a nexus of culture and fashion. The Golden State still attracts the best from around the globe. You'd think that would generate prosperity for all the state's citizens. Not so much.In the U.S. Apple creative efforts are limited to engineering, marketing, retail and tax avoidance. Apple makes great jobs at the top end and bottom end. Apple's futuristic new head quarters will be home to graduates of Northumbria School of Design, Stanford's Engineering school and Ivy League MBA programs. Meanwhile, Apple stores will remain packed with hip and pierced nerds in blue shirts who make more than their peers at Wal-Mart, but will never buy a California home. What should have been a million middle class U.S. manufacturing jobs were transferred to China's squalid system of indentured servitude.Is this Apple's fault? I'm outraged over Apple's poor corporate citizenship but as a shareholder I love the firm's 10Q. Apple has both the intelligence and social conscious to know better. It also has the fat margins that would allow it to do the right thing. However, the primary obligation of a corporate board of directors and of management is to deliver profits to shareholders. It is incumbent upon them neither to run a philanthropic job creation enterprise nor to fund the government beyond their legal obligation. Shareholders could vote out the board or sue the company if they pursued such a wild-eyed corporate mission.It is government's responsibility to maintain an attractive and competitive tax and regulatory environment that fuels the engine of private sector job creation. The U.S. in general and California in particular have utterly failed at this task. We've done everything possible to drive jobs away, often for no good reason. All things being equal, Apple and other nominally American companies would be more efficient if they kept production closer to design and weren't shuffling $billions between Irish shell corporations and Caribbean banks. By maintaining the world's highest corporate tax rate we've created an enormous incentive for firms to pursue tortuous mechanisms for offshoring their production and profits, or like Burger King, sneak out of the U.S. entirely.Of course, small businesses cannot afford to play this game. So, we've also established barriers to entry that favor incumbents and depress the processes of creative destruction and entrepreneurial job creation. Multinationals, fully invested in the status quo, feel compelled to support an entrenched political system that continues to make poor choices for our future. They fund think-tank economists on both the right and the left to theoretically justify our disastrous free trade + high regulation model, despite the overwhelming empirical evidence that it is killing jobs.What to do? A reset of corporate taxes to a reasonable rate is long over due. Moving this tax below the cost of avoidance will mean that we actually collect some revenues. This move will also create new jobs in tax brackets where workers are taxpayers rather than consumers of public services. Like nearly every other country in the world, we should reduce individual income tax rates and replace that revenue with a Value Added Tax (VAT) that subtly favors domestic producers. Though our think-tank economists are determined not to understand how this works, in the real world, the leaders of countries like Germany and South Korea totally get it. At a fundamental level this offers a realignment of incentives aimed at national wealth accumulation. Taxes are disincentives as well as revenue sources. Taxing labor (income) and capital gains (investment) discourages creation whereas taxing consumption encourages investment. We must also get competitive in the regulatory world. This does not mean racing China back to the 19th century in search of environmental and labor chaos. Even the most ardent libertarian wouldn't want to breath the stuff they call ""air"" in Beijing or see their kids locked inside one of those factories.Firstly, it means a change in mindset. Legislators and enforcement agents must be aware that in addition to protecting the public health and environment they have a real obligation to contribute to our shared economic success and understand that their own jobs and their children's futures depend on it. This is how our competitors in Germany and South Korea view things. When regulations are hideously complex (California's overtime laws) redundant (CalOSHA) or burdensome beyond their trivial benefits (desert tortoise protection) they must go. In the long run workers will be wealthier and safer in a state that can afford its government and we won't be forced to eat those desert tortoises. Secondly, it means simply not permitting firms to offshore pollution or labor violations. In the age of globalization corporations aren't competing against the economic advantages of wanton pollution and labor repression. Our workers are forced to compete with China and they can't, no matter how many part-time, no-benefit retail jobs they work. We must impose tariffs to offset these ill-gotten advantages. As people usually don't vote to abuse themselves or their environment, levying a tax on imports from dictatorships would ameliorate this situation.Yes, I can hear the apologists screaming, ""But consumers would have to pay more for the iPhone!"" Yep, and eliminating slavery increased the price of cotton, for a while. Doing things right isn't cheap in the short run. It's time we started thinking about our economic and geopolitical futures when we design the technology of the world's future.Greg Autry teaches technology entrepreneurship at The Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies in the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California.

Detroit has reached a tentative deal with unions that represent thousands of employees in the bankrupt city. Mediators announced Monday, April 28, 2014 that the city and the Coalition of Detroit Unions have agreed in principle on the âmajor aspectsâ of a five-year collective bargaining agreement.(AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb313732500003200389fae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The 1970s are remembered as dark days for New York City, as it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy amid rampant crime, urban decay and population loss. While it feels like ancient history for New York now, those problems are mirrored in present-day Detroit -- but that could be a positive sign for the city, according to some top voices in the financial sphere.""Detroit is like New York City back in the '70s,"" former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Thursday. ""When everybody had written us off, there were people who believed.""Bloomberg was at Wayne State University in Detroit for a graduation ceremony of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses program, for which he serves as an advisory council co-chair. He was joined by investor Warren Buffett, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, among others. Goldman Sachs launched the southeast Michigan and Detroit chapter of the 10,000 Small Businesses program with a $20 million commitment for small business loans, business education and grants. Like New York 40 years ago, Detroit ""is turning it around because of the people behind me,"" Bloomberg said of the 64 graduates and small-business owners, whose companies that make everything from socks to pickles and provide services from laying asphalt to kenneling dogs. Detroit's similarities to '70s New York make for a seemingly dire environment for the small-business graduates. The city is currently involved in a federal bankruptcy trial that officials hope will allow it to shed debts and make crucial investments in crumbling services. The poverty rate is more than double the state average; the unemployment rate is the highest among the country's 50 largest cities. Detroit is also losing residents: At 700,000, the population is less than half its 1950 peak.NEW YORK -- A high chain fence with barbed wire has not prevented a vacant lot on Amsterdam Ave. between 173rd and 175th streets in Washington Heights from becoming a dump, March 15, 1970.

(Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)But Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein reiterated Bloomberg's assertion, saying Detroit has the chance to come back. ""The prognosis going forward [in 1970s New York] was just terrible. It's hard to imagine now, if you didn't live through it, but the prospects seemed to be nil,"" Blankfein said. ""If you add time, people, great leadership, like you also have here in Detroit and you got New York City ... Detroit has been there before and Detroit will be there again.""White House Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett said Thursday that small businesses are key to cities' revitalization, in part because they provide job opportunities -- about two-thirds of jobs in the country are created by small businesses, she noted, though the Small Business Administration categorizes all companies with fewer than 500 employees as ""small.""Carla Walker-Miller is one of the graduates of the small business program, and her energy auditing firm is an example of those job creators. She said Thursday that since starting the program, she had been able to hire 12 new employees. Her Detroit company's revenue had grown from $3.2 million to $5 million in a year. ""This is a city that overcomes,"" Walker-Miller said. ""It's a city with heart, a city with soul, and a city that ultimately wins. Part of that win looks like growth, fueled by small businesses in Detroit.""Goldman Sachs has committed $500 million to more than a dozen sites nationally, and said that 64 percent of participants have reported an increase in revenues six months after graduation."
