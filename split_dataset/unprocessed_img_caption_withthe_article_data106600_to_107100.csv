Lululemon said in a press release that it will contribute $750,000 to the Tibetan spiritual leader's nonprofit organization over the next three years to expand education initiatives and for ""researching the connection between mind-body-heart."" The company cited ""a common vision for developing the next generation of compassionate leaders in the world"" and said that both ""are committed to engaging and empowering healthy communities.""But a mob flocked to Lululemon's official blog after the announcement, lighting up the comments section with objections to the partnership, suggesting that the Dalai Lama's name shouldn't be associated with a money-making enterprise. Others complained he's been ""hijacked"" and turned into a mere corporate marketing tool. Popular women's media website Jezebel suggested that the donation ""seems more like penance"" by the clothing line for previous PR blunders.Among the company's missteps: Last spring, quality control issues sparked a recall of too-sheer yoga pants. Then, last fall, co-founder Chip Wilson irked many customers when he said Lululemon's pants ""don't work"" for some women's bodies. Earlier this month, Lululemon managed to offend the entire city of Buffalo, New York, by making fun of its NFL team.In a statement posted Saturday on its website, the Dalai Lama Center's chairman Geoff Plant said, ""Our recently announced partnership with lululemon athletica is a wonderful example of how alignment of our visions can engage and empower healthy communities. This generous donation will support a variety of initiatives – all rooted in scientific research on heart-mind-body – allowing us to expand our work globally."" He added, ""The Dalai Lama’s Office was not involved in the donation and was unaware of the arrangement.""Note: This article has been revised throughout from its original version to remove anonymous quotations sourced from the Lululemon website."
1,POLITICS,Outside Money Surge Makes Kansas Senate Race Costliest In State History,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kansas-senate-money_n_6044524.html,,2014-10-25,"Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts speaks after being endorsed the the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Monday, Oct. 6, 2014, in Topeka, Kan. Roberts is facing independent challenger Greg Orman in November's elections as Republicans fight to recapture a Senate majority. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dae7260000350083bc37.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Few Senate races have seen a gush of spending like the competition in Kansas between Sen. Pat Roberts (R) and independent challenger Greg Orman. That may be because, until lately, it had been unthinkable that a Republican incumbent could lose in the solidly red state.But Roberts failed to break 50 percent in a primary  against a weak tea party opponent. And on Sept. 3, the Democratic candidate dropped out after polls showed Orman could beat Roberts in a two-way race.Spending by super PACs and dark money nonprofits has exploded by at least 560 percent since then, fueling what will end up being the most expensive Senate race in Kansas history.Overall, independent groups have pumped $10.5 million into the Senate contest, according to Federal Election Commission records, with more than $8.8 million coming in the first three weeks of October. The only Senate race seeing a similar surge in outside spending is the three-way competition in South Dakota.""The acceleration in spending is remarkable,"" said Mark Johnson, a Kansas City-based lawyer at the law firm Dentons and a lecturer on campaign finance and elections at the University of Kansas.The late flood of spending for Roberts has largely come from entrenched business interests in the state, led by the billionaires Charles and David Koch, and entrenched business interests in Washington, including the National Rifle Association and a billionaire-backed super PAC.The biggest spender in the race is Freedom Partners Action Fund, a super PAC founded by the Koch brothers, which has paid out nearly $2 million attacking Orman. Koch Industries, the private company owned by the brothers, is based in Wichita, Kansas, and has long backed Roberts. Its employees and political action committee are the leading funders of the senator's political career.Roberts has made a name for himself recently as a forceful opponent of campaign finance reform. In debates over electoral spending by nonprofits that keep donors secret, Roberts has emerged as one of disclosure's leading opponents. The Kochs intensely oppose restrictions on how much the wealthy can spend on elections, as well as disclosure laws that show who is influencing voters.The latest independent group entering the Kansas Senate race is a nonprofit formed in July. The Alliance for a Free Society Inc., a 501(c)(4) nonprofit registered in Delaware, reported more than $380,000 in expenses opposing Orman on Thursday. The organization, which also funds radio ads against Kansas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Paul Davis, has no website and a faint paper trail.""I'm not really sure what that one is,"" said Johnson, who closely tracks the political campaigns and outside groups in Kansas.The Alliance for a Free Society appears tied to the Koch political empire. According to documents filed with the FEC and local television stations, the group's chairman is Michael K. Morgan, a former Koch Industries lobbyist and board member of the American Legislative Exchange Council.Koch Industries communications director Missy Cohlmia told The Huffington Post in an email, ""Mike Morgan worked at Koch for a number of years; he left in 2006. Since then, he has worked as a consultant to Koch.""Roberts also has received the backing of corporate lobbying groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Realtors, American Hospital Association and National Federation of Independent Business. All of these groups are lobbying powerhouses in Washington. They have combined to spend $1.6 million so far in October to boost Roberts.The billionaire-backed Ending Spending Action Fund has put $1.1 million into the race to help Roberts. This super PAC, founded by billionaire TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts, is largely funded by Forbes 400 members, including Ricketts, hedge fund executives Paul Singer and Ken Griffin, World Wrestling Entertainment co-founder Linda McMahon, and coal titan Joe Craft.Orman, meanwhile, is finding support from campaign finance reformers.Mayday PAC, the super PAC to end all super PACs founded by Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, recently asked its supporters to raise $200,000 to help fund an advertising campaign for Orman. The super PAC, dedicated to supporting candidates who want to curtail the influence of money in politics, surpassed that goal and has reported spending nearly $900,000 in the race.Mark McKinnon, a longtime consultant for Republican politicians and a co-founder of Mayday PAC, told The Huffington Post that Mayday supports Orman because of his support of campaign finance reforms. ""As expected, all the traditional special influence interests are now swamping Kansas with late money to try and save Pat Roberts,"" McKinnon said in an email. ""The only way Orman will survive the onslaught is with the help of Mayday and the few others who have stepped up with rocks in our slingshots to take on this Goliath of the status quo.""Mayday PAC is funded by a small collection of big-dollar donors, mostly Silicon Valley titans like LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman, Facebook billionaire Sean Parker and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, and tens of thousands of smaller donations.Orman also is backed by millionaire investor Peter Ackerman, who has teamed up with tech industry entrepreneur Thomas Layton to fund the Committee to Elect an Independent Senate.Ackerman, who made his millions trading junk bonds with Michael Milken in the 1980s, is best known in political circles for funding the online presidential primary site, Americans Elect. The effort aimed to let the public select an independent ticket for the presidency, but was seen as a platform for a pro-business moderate. The effort ultimately failed to find a candidate.Felicia Knight, spokeswoman for the committee, said in an email that those involved in creating the pro-Orman group met the candidate through Americans Elect. Layton is a friend of Orman's and serves as the committee's treasurer. ""We support systemic political reforms aimed at leveling the playing field for independent candidates,"" she said.""Our Committee is working to make sure there is a level playing field for the independent candidate,"" Knight added.Another pro-Orman super PAC called Kansans Support Problem Solvers PAC received $500,000 from John Arnold, the Texas-based billionaire energy investor and supporter of centrist political candidates.Arnold, a self-described moderate Democrat, is a major funder of public school privatization, including charter schools and attacks on teachers unions. He has dedicated large sums to advocating cutting public pensions. (Arnold and his wife Laura stepped in to fund the Head Start program during the 2013 government shutdown.)This outside spending onslaught relieves the campaigns of spending their own money on television. But Johnson argued there are downsides for both campaigns.""I'm not sure the Orman campaign is happy with all the outside spending,"" Johnson said, noting that the divergent interests may distract from the candidates' message of party independence. Of the Roberts campaign, Johnson said, ""I think they believe that if there were no campaign, they'd win, and so the quieter things are, the better they'd be.""As for the people of Kansas inundated with election ads, Johnson said the novelty may outweigh the annoyance. After all, there hasn't been a competitive Senate race in the state in at least 40 years.""I don't think they're sick of seeing these ads on TV because they've never been exposed to it,"" Johnson said. ""We're not used to seeing this."""

Lanza also killed his mother and then himself in the Dec. 14, 2012 violence.The information is contained in the soon-to-be released report by the Connecticut Office of the Child Advocate, Jackson said. That report will make recommendations to prevent violence in schools and among youths.Lanza was evaluated by therapists at the Yale Child Study Center in the years before he entered Newtown High School. Not only was he apparently not properly assessed, but no information from his Yale evaluations was shared with the Newtown school system, which he attended until his mother took him out of the 10th grade and home schooled him.Jackson said the failure to properly assess the degree of Lanza's mental state as a child and teenager ""could have impacted his propensity for violence"" as an adult.Lanza was deemed a special education student, but his treatment apparently failed to address how he could be helped, Jackson said the report indicates.""Violent tragedies like this one might be prevented in the future by properly diagnosing individuals and getting them the treatment they need,"" Jackson said.A spokeswoman for Connecticut Child Advocate Sarah Eagan declined to comment on Friday.The gubernatorial commission, which was created to make recommendations to prevent violence, had expected to release its own report by now. However, it appears the report may not be available anytime soon since the commission voted on Friday to convene a public hearing in Newtown to gather testimony from local residents and families of victims.(Editing by Barbara Goldberg and Richard Chang)"

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bezos-best-ceo_n_6047456.html,,2014-10-25,"WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 17: Jeff Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin and Amazon.com, speaks at a press conference to announce the new BE-4 rocket engine during a press conference with Tory Bruno, CEO of United Launch Alliance, at the National Press Club September 17, 2014 in Washington, DC. United Launch Alliance and Blue Origin announced today that they have entered into an agreement to jointly fund development of the BE-4 rocket engine. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb315182600003500820644.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jeff Bezos had a bad week.Calls to rein in the ambitious Amazon chief executive grew loud on Thursday after the e-commerce giant reported its biggest quarterly loss in 14 years, driven by the anemic sales of its Fire Phone, the company’s first smartphone. The losses were seen as proof of Bezos’ reckless obsession with prioritizing growth over profitability. The 50-year-old tech mogul was lambasted as a megalomaniacal “Grinch” who stole Christmas from a company so bad at making money that it’s “not a real business.” Yet, according to the November issue of the Harvard Business Review, Bezos is the best-performing CEO in the world. Despite the latest bad news, the venerable magazine stands by that assessment.“People have bet against him over the years, and historically they’ve been wrong,” Daniel McGinn, the senior editor who profiled Bezos, told The Huffington Post on Saturday. “He definitely has a set of shareholders who have faith in him because of his ability to deliver despite a lot of doubt over the last 20 years.”The Harvard Business Review compiled its list of top CEOs by comparing shareholder returns for S&P Global 1200 companies from each executive’s first day in office until April 30 of this year. Bezos won by a wide margin. Even if Amazon’s stock price -- which plummeted nearly 9 percent to $287.06 on Friday -- fell to $250, he still would have beaten runner-up John Martin, the CEO of biotech giant Gilead Sciences.“He had quite a bit of leeway,” McGinn said. “He had such a big lead over everyone else.” Amazon's stock tumbled after a disappointing earnings report on Thursday.Profitable quarters are rare for Amazon, but the company generates strong revenues. Bezos’ strategy, which both befuddles and inspires investors, is to reinvest money to continually grow Amazon. A small online bookseller thereby became a video streaming service, a cloud-computing behemoth, a grocer and, most recently, a smartphone maker. But the Fire Phone, unveiled in June, has flopped. A study published in August by the ad network Chitika, which measured web traffic from Fire Phones, found a paltry number of the devices were in use. In a conference call with analysts on Thursday, Amazon’s chief financial officer, Thomas Szkutak, admitted that the dearth of people buying the phone had cost the company $170 million in losses “primarily related to the Fire Phone inventory evaluation and supply commitment costs.”“It’s not unusual for them to lose more money,” McGinn said. “It is unusual for them to miss a growth target.”That doesn’t seem to worry Bezos, however. “Even though we have significant revenues, we invest in so many new initiatives that in some ways we’re still a startup,” he told McGinn sometime before last week’s earnings report. “Volatility is part of being a startup.”Bezos may be alone in thinking of the company as a nascent venture. Since going public in 1997, Amazon has grown so large and powerful that some have called it a monopoly ripe for a regulatory crackdown.Still, even as Amazon stock takes a hit, the company is a lucrative investment by the Harvard Business Review’s methodology.“If you could go in a time machine and go back to 1997 and you had the chance to buy stock on that day, would you do it?” McGinn asked rhetorically. “In financial terms, you’d still be many thousand percentage points ahead today.”Amazon did not return a call requesting comment.

Out of all the investors in the 20th century, Buffett was the most successful.Given his success, it stands to reason that Buffett has an excellent understanding of how to spend his time each day. From a monetary perspective, you could say that he manages his time better than anyone else.And that's why the story below, which was shared directly from Buffett's employee to my good friend Scott Dinsmore, caught my attention.Let's talk about the simple three-step productivity strategy that Warren Buffett uses to help his employees determine their priorities and actions.The Story of Mike FlintMike Flint was Buffett's personal airplane pilot for 10 years. (Flint has also flown four US Presidents, so I think we can safely say he is good at his job.) According to Flint, he was talking about his career priorities with Buffett when his boss asked the pilot to go through a three-step exercise.Here's how it works...STEP 1: Buffett started by asking Flint to write down his top 25 career goals. So, Flint took some time and wrote them down. (Note: you could also complete this exercise with goals for a shorter timeline. For example, write down the top 25 things you want to accomplish this week.)STEP 2: Then, Buffett asked Flint to review his list and circle his top 5 goals. Again, Flint took some time, made his way through the list, and eventually decided on his 5 most important goals.Note: If you're following along at home, pause right now and do these first two steps before moving on to Step 3.STEP 3: At this point, Flint had two lists. The 5 items he had circled were List A and the 20 items he had not circled were List B.Flint confirmed that he would start working on his top 5 goals right away. And that's when Buffett asked him about the second list, ""And what about the ones you didn't circle?""Flint replied, ""Well, the top 5 are my primary focus, but the other 20 come in a close second. They are still important so I'll work on those intermittently as I see fit. They are not as urgent, but I still plan to give them a dedicated effort.""To which Buffett replied, ""No. You've got it wrong, Mike. Everything you didn't circle just became your Avoid-At-All-Cost list. No matter what, these things get no attention from you until you've succeeded with your top 5.""The Power of EliminationI believe in minimalism and simplicity. I like getting rid of waste. I think that eliminating the inessential is one of the best ways to make life easier, make good habits more automatic, and make you grateful for what you do have.That said, getting rid of wasteful items and decisions is relatively easy. It's eliminating things you care about that is difficult. It is hard to prevent using your time on things that are easy to rationalize, but that have little payoff. The tasks that have the greatest likelihood of derailing your progress are the ones you care about, but that aren't truly important.Every behavior has a cost. Even neutral behaviors aren't really neutral. They take up time, energy, and space that could be put toward better behaviors or more important tasks. We are often spinning in motion instead of taking action.This is why Buffett's strategy is particularly brilliant. Items 6 through 25 on your list are things you care about. They are important to you. It is very easy to justify spending your time on them. But when you compare them to your top 5 goals, these items are distractions. Spending time on secondary priorities is the reason you have 20 half-finished projects instead of 5 completed ones.Eliminate ruthlessly. Force yourself to focus. Complete a task or kill it.The most dangerous distractions are the ones you love, but that don't love you back.James Clear writes at JamesClear.com, where he uses behavioral science to help you master your habits, increase your creativity, and improve your health.

General Assembly in 1966, was signed by China in 1998 but never ratified, though it applies to Hong Kong. The pact guarantees fundamental freedoms including the right to self-determination and free and regular elections.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying acknowledged that the covenant applied to Hong Kong, but said the treaty had no weight in China, adding that China's decision on Hong Kong elections had ""unshakable legal status and effect.""""The covenant is not a measure for Hong Kong's political reform,"" she added, without elaborating.It was not immediately clear how, if the covenant applied to Hong Kong, it could have no bearing on its political reform.Thousands have taken to the streets of Hong Kong in protest against central government plans to allow only Beijing loyalists to stand in 2017 elections. Talks between student leaders and senior officials on Tuesday failed to break a deadlock.Since the protests began, China has consistently decried what it calls outside interference in Hong Kong, saying that as a part of China its politics are a purely internal matter.

It means the restaurant will be looking to offer more foods that are popular in a particular region. A current example of that: Mozzarella sticks are offered in some stores in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, and the McRib will no longer be rolled out nationwide, since some regions have more of an interest in pork than others, Businessweek notes. McDonald's has long been offering different menu items in their stores around the world. In Hong Kong, for example, the chain offers Red Bean Pie, since red beans are widely used there. In Portugal, a traditional Portuguese soup called Caldo Verde is on the menu. In addition to using ""locally relevant ingredients,"" the company also plans to gradually roll out a ""Create Your Own Taste"" program, which allows patrons to build their own custom burgers. The program is already active in western Sydney, Australia, and according news.com.au, Australians will be able to build their own burgers all over the country within the next three years. According to Bloomberg, McDonald's is also considering offering more organic food. The company's change in business strategy is a direct response to its recent decline in numbers. As Time put it, the change is ""McDonald's big plan to win you over."" In August, McDonald's saw its worst month since 2003. Global sales at stores open for over a year dropped 3.7 percent that month, while same-store sales in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region dropped 14.5 percent.

On September 11, 2001, three firefighters raised an American flag above the rubble at Ground Zero. One hundred feet away, photographer Thomas Franklin snapped a shot for the Bergen Record that, a day later, would be seen around the world, providing a ray of hope in a moment of darkness. But guess what? Today, that famous flag is missing. And it's not the only piece of history that's been taken.Where'd the flag go? You can help us find out.It began with firefighter Dan McWilliams. He's the one who first saw the flag hanging from the back of a yacht docked near Ground Zero. It was McWilliams's idea to raise the flag on the flagpole. A simple and brilliant notion. From there, McWilliams, along with firefighters George Johnson and Billy Eisengrein, hoisted the 3x5 flag on the afternoon of 9/11 as photographer Franklin took his famous picture.In the days that followed, the Associated Press picked up the photo, then it was on the cover of Newsweek, then on a U.S. postage stamp. Indeed, after 9/11, the flag become so famous, New York City Hall requested it for a massive ceremony at Yankee Stadium.On September 23, at the stadium, the flag was signed by Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Gov. George Pataki, and other top officials, then raised in front of 20,000 people to commemorate the victims of 9/11. From there, the flag was given to the Navy, so it could be raised on ships heading to war in Afghanistan. The flag then traveled the world, flying high at countless ceremonies before finally returning to New York City in early 2012. So when did the flag go missing? It was after a Greek-American couple, Spiro Kopelakis and Shirley Dreifus, announced that they were the owners of the original flag -- it was their yacht, the Star of America -- that was docked at a marina near Ground Zero. This patriotic couple didn't demand the flag for themselves. They wanted to ensure that it was displayed in a museum for everyone to see. But when they borrowed the flag for a charity event to honor firefighters, they realized the sad truth: The famous flag was the wrong size. It wasn't the 3x5 flag that was on the back of their boat on 9/11. And the three firefighters all agreed, it wasn't the 3x5 flag that they'd raised in the famous photograph. What's worse, this imposter flag bears the signatures of the city officials who signed it at Yankee Stadium. In other words, the flag that was raised at Yankee Stadium and then sent around the world? That was not the original flag!So what happened to the real 9/11 flag? To this day, no one knows. We're trying to change that as we launch the TV show Lost History, premiering Friday, October 31 at 10 p.m. EST on H2, and offer a reward of up to $10,000 if you help us find this famous flag.A few years ago, a new clue emerged: On the night of 9/11, a New York police officer was shooting surveillance footage at Ground Zero. In this footage, at 10:30 p.m., the famous flagpole from the photo is bare. The flag is already gone, meaning that it had already been taken down within five hours of the iconic photo.To this day, New York City has no leads, nor does the FDNY. Some experts suggest the real flag was misplaced at Ground Zero in the days after 9/11. Others suggest it was stolen. Others guess it may have been used to cover the body of a slain first responder and therefore could be stored in a morgue.All we know for sure is that the real flag came down from the flagpole the night of 9/11, and a different flag was raised 12 days later at Yankee Stadium.Why does it matter? It's our history. These are our stories. And now, we need your help. If you know something, go to History.com and file a tip.

The stock price of Long Island-based Lakeland Industries, which makes various types of protective garb, has more than doubled in the past month amid feverish news coverage of the deadly virus. The stock jumped from less than $7 a share in late September to as high as $29 on October 13, when Ebola panic in the U.S. was particularly high. Shares have drifted lower since then, but got another boost on Thursday afternoon after the news that Dr. Craig Spencer, a physician who recently returned to New York from treating patients in Guinea, had been hospitalized with Ebola symptoms. Later on Thursday he became the fourth person in the United States to be diagnosed with the virus. The spike in stock price came after the first case of Ebola was confirmed in New York.  “We’ve been getting a lot of calls in the last 24 hours,” Jordan Darrow, a spokesman for Lakeland, told The Huffington Post on Friday morning. “We’ve been getting a lot of calls for the last three months.” He declined to comment on sales of hazmat suits. Last month, Lakeland said it was increasing production to meet heightened demand for the suits, which cover the whole body. Ebola is spread only through direct contact with bodily fluids -- such as blood, vomit or feces -- of an infected person. “We hope our added capacity will help alleviate that problem,” Christopher J. Ryan, the president and chief executive of Lakeland, said in a statement last month. “With the U.S. State Department alone putting out a bid for 160,000 suits, we encourage all protective apparel companies to increase their manufacturing capacity for sealed seam garments so that our industry can do its part in addressing this threat to global health.”Lakeland’s stock fell about 4 percent in early trading Friday morning, to about $14."

New York confirmed the first case of Ebola in the largest city in the United States as the EU dramatically ramped up aid Friday to contain the killer epidemic ravaging west Africa.The EU announcement of one billion euros ($1.3 billion) for the worst-hit countries comes as fears of a spread of the virus grew, with the first confirmed case in Mali, where a two-year-old girl has tested positive.

Here is what we know about what Dr. Craig Spencer, the fourth person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. and the first case in New York City, did and where he went since his return from working with Doctors Without Borders in Guinea.Sunday, October 12 Spencer finishes his work in Guinea with Doctors Without Borders.Tuesday, October 14 He leaves Guinea and travels through Brussels, Belgium.Friday, October 17 Spencer arrives at JFK International Airport.Tuesday, October 21 Spencer begins to feel sluggish, but health officials emphasize that his symptoms have not yet begun, according to the Boston Globe.

He has contact with three people, including his fiancee, Morgan Dixon, and two friends, CNN reported.He later rides the A and L subway lines to The Gutter, a Brooklyn bowling alley, and takes an Uber taxi back to Manhattan around 8:30 p.m.Thursday, October 23 Spencer develops fever and nausea, both symptoms of Ebola. When his fever spikes to 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit (not 103 degrees, as was first reported), he and Dixon make a joint call to authorities around 11 a.m. to report his symptoms and travel history, ABC News reported. Spencer is taken to an isolation ward at Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, one of eight New York hospitals designated for the care of Ebola patients.The Gutter bowling alley voluntarily closes, writing on its Facebook page, ""We are working with the NYC Health Department to have the bar cleaned and sanitized under their supervision.""Spencer tests positive for Ebola later Thursday night, becoming the fourth person to be diagnosed in the U.S.Friday, October 24 Spencer remains hospitalized in isolation and in stable condition, Bassett said. The CDC has confirmed Spencer's positive test results. Health officials visit The Gutter and Blue Bottle Coffee and clear both for business. Spencer's fiancee as well as the two other friends he had close contact with have all been quarantined and are not showing any symptoms, and his apartment is locked and isolated, Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a press conference. The car service driver is deemed to have had no contact with Spencer. Health officials visit The Meatball Shop and expect it to reopen at 6 p.m.Tuesday, November 11 Spencer is deemed Ebola-free and released from Bellevue.

It's a bit overwrought and defensive. A lot of fans seem to want to believe the NFL is not a homophobic institution.",2014-10-24,"Dallas Cowboys practice squad player defensive end Michael Sam speaks to reporters after team practice at the team's headquarters Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2014, in Irving, Texas. (AP Photo/LM Otero)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafcff1250000360037f9dd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I've seen a little too much insistence this week, online and on social media, that Michael Sam's being cut from the Dallas Cowboys' practice squad had nothing to do with his being gay. It's a bit overwrought and defensive. A lot of fans seem to want to believe the NFL is not a homophobic institution, and that the Sam story somehow proved it: The NFL gave a shot to the first openly gay player ever drafted and treated him well, and his fate was based on his performance, and that's that.But Michael Sam's being gay has been so much a part of this story from the moment he came out, with anonymous NFL executives saying he wouldn't be accepted, and some commentators and even some players making anti-gay remarks, right up through his late-round drafting and beyond. Can anyone really say for sure whether or not his being gay had anything to do with his being cut? As both Outsports' Jim Buzinski and WCBS sports radio host Jared Max point out, there are no other openly gay players in the NFL right now, and if the NBA's Jason Collins indeed retires soon, as many commentators are predicting, there will be no openly gay player in any of the four major sports leagues. That's not exactly a sign of acceptance. Add to this the fact that the NFL has given minor or no penalties to players like the San Francisco 49ers' Chris Culliver after homophobic incidents. It also stood by the hiring of anti-gay former New York Giant David Tyree -- who worked to stop marriage equality, adheres to an extremist anti-gay ideology and has expressed the belief that gays can be made straight -- as the New York Giants' director of player development. So it can't be ruled out that Michael Sam was cut because he's gay, not with the NFL's record. People can point to Sam's performance at this or that juncture, but that's been countered by pointing to other players who've performed similarly and have done just fine. Buzinski notes, looking at the chronology of events, that it was all quite suspicious:Sam was the SEC co-defensive player of the year in 2013. Yet he was drafted in the seventh round, 249 out of 256 players selected. That's three rounds and 124 players later than what bookies set his draft order at. It's also by far the lowest any SEC defensive player of the year had been drafted in at least a decade. ...After former voach Tony Dungy called Sam a ""distraction"" and said he'd have stayed away from picking him, Sam seemed to become even more of a hot potato. The Rams chose not to keep him, which seemed like a football decision, since he wasn't what they needed. But the fact that he wasn't immediately chosen by another team was ""unprecedented,""  according to Michael Freeman of the Bleacher Report: It can't be stressed enough how Sam not being signed despite a productive preseason is almost unprecedented. In my two decades of covering the NFL, it isn't just rare; it's basically unheard of for a player to not make the league after playing well in the preseason.And Adam Schefter of ESPN tweeted: NFL insider Peter King, of MMQB.com and NBC, reported that the Cowboys finally took Sam for the practice squad after ""a league official contacted multiple teams asking if they'd evaluated Sam,"" and that the NFL ""avoided a nightmare situation"" when the Cowboys signed him. (The NFL denied King's claim.) Then, a month and a half later, he was cut, almost unnoticed, while the country was focused on Ebola, the attack on the Canadian Parliament and other pressing concerns.Again, any of the individual actions can be explained away as a football decision. But when you add it all up and throw in the NFL's past and current disregard for homophobia (in incidents and hiring), it's impossible to escape the very real probability that Sam's being gay was a factor that determined his fate. And Jim Buzinski is right when he says it will give any other player pause about coming out, which may be exactly what the NFL wanted."

How can you hear a confession about somebody abusing a child and the matter must be sealed up and you mustn’t talk about it?”The inquiry was commissioned by Uganda-born Sentamu after an investigation by The Times newspaper exposed an Anglican priest, Robert Waddington, as a serial sexual abuser of children in England and Australia for more than 50 years.Waddington, who died in 2007, was head of education for the Church of England, a dean of Manchester Cathedral in the English Midlands and governor of a music school where he was alleged to be responsible for mass abuse against children.In July, Anglicans in Australia backed a historic change that breaks the convention that the confidentiality of what a man or woman tells a priest during confession is inviolable.While more common among Roman Catholics, some traditionalist Anglicans also practice confession, referred to as the Sacrament of Reconciliation.Existing church law demands that the confession of a crime is to be kept confidential unless the person making the confession consents to the priest disclosing it. The Roman Catholic Church insists that the seal of confession is inviolable — even when it involves a person confessing to sexual crimes committed against children."
