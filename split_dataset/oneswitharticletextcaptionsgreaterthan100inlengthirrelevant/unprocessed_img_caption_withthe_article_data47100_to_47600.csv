After the game, he said he did it in support of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who made national headlines for refusing to stand during the anthem last week to protest racial injustice and police brutality.“I don’t mean no disrespect to anybody,’’ he told the Seattle Times. “I’m just standing behind what I believe in.’’ He said that, like Kaepernick, he will not stand “until I feel like justice is being served.”Lane is in his fifth year with the Seahawks after re-signing with the team during the offseason, ESPN reported. Kaepernick had not stood for the song during two previous games, although the protest went unnoticed, according to the San Jose Mercury News.On Thursday, he stood as a giant American flag was unfurled before a preseason game against the Chargers in San Diego. When the anthem played, Kaepernick dropped to a knee, USA Today reported.He was joined by teammate Eric Reid.Last week, the NFL announced that players are “encouraged but not required to stand during the playing of the national anthem.”UPDATE: This story has been updated with information from Lane about why he declined to stand during the national anthem."

The Associated Press reports that he left in a white SUV, and plans to travel to his native Ohio to live with his parents.There, he’ll have to register as a sex offender for life and undergo three years of supervised probation.Turner served only three months of a lenient six-month sentence, which was reduced due to “automatically applied credits” for good behavior before he was even locked up. Convicts in county jail often serve half their sentences for good behavior in California.He was initially charged with sexual assault and penetration of an unconscious person ― not rape ― because although he digitally penetrated the victim, he did not have intercourse with her. State law does not classify the act as rape.The assault commanded the attention of the nation in June after Buzzfeed published his victim’s statement that she read in court. It read, in part:On that morning, all that I was told was that I had been found behind a dumpster, potentially penetrated by a stranger, and that I should get retested for HIV because results don’t always show up immediately. But for now, I should go home and get back to my normal life. Imagine stepping back into the world with only that information.Her emotional statement wouldn’t be enough to result in longer jail time, and the nation reacted to what was widely viewed as a failure of justice.More than a million people signed a petition calling for Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky to be removed from the bench over Turner’s sentence. Persky eventually quit criminal court in August and now oversees civil cases. Meanwhile, California legislators passed a mandatory minimum sentence law for sexually assault of an unconscious woman. Had it been enacted before, Turner would have faced a minimum of three years in jail.AP reports that Turner’s neighbors will receive postcards from the sheriff in Xenia, Ohio, declaring that a convicted sex offender will be moving nearby.Turner will be required to check in with the local sheriff’s office in person every three months, confirm that he’s still living with his parents and undergo random screening from deputies without warning. He’s also banned from parks, schools and other places where children may gather."

During the press conference, he said he would donate $1 million to needy communities. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c981981800009129bced8e.jpeg?cache=tofbF5rHz1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Colin Kaepernick will donate $1 million to communities in need, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback announced Thursday. Kaepernick stayed seated while the national anthem played before a preseason game last Friday, which he said was a protest against structural racism and police brutality. He made a similar gesture before Thursday’s preseason game against the San Diego Chargers, kneeling during the song rather than sitting. The promised donation will take the protest a “step further,” Kaepernick said at a press conference after the game.“It was something I was thinking about to try to make sure I am not just talking about something, but I am actively being involved and actively trying to make a change in these communities,” he said.He did not specify which groups he would be supporting, but made clear the donations would keep with his goal of helping people of color living in distressed communities. “I’ve been very blessed to be in this position and make the kind of money I do,” Kaepernick said. “And I have to help these people.”The NFL player and his girlfriend recently donated $60,000 worth of backpacks to students in the New York City neighborhoods of Harlem and the South Bronx, The Root reported. It’s not clear if this was part of the $1 million donation.Notwithstanding the public backlash, Kaepernick’s protest seems to be gaining traction among players. Eric Reid, another 49ers player, joined him in the kneeling protest this week. Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane also did not stand when “The Star-Spangled Banner” was played before a preseason game Thursday night. Kaepernick explained at the press conference that he decided to kneel, rather than sit, during the national anthem after he and Reid had a conversation with Nate Boyer, an NFL free agent who served as a U.S. Army Green Beret. (Boyer published an open letter to Kaepernick in The Army Times on Wednesday, reflecting on both his discomfort with Kaepernick’s gesture and his sympathy for the quarterback’s intentions.)The players concluded that kneeling would be a “way to try to show more respect for the men and women who fight for this country.” Boyer joined the 49ers on the sidelines during the anthem at Kaepernick’s invitation.“I realize that men and women of the military go out and sacrifice their lives and put themselves in harm’s way for my freedom of speech,” Kaepernick said. While Kaepernick has faced heated criticism from many on social media, including Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, he has also received an outpouring of support from U.S. veterans. Veterans backing Kaepernick have used #VeteransForKaepernick to get their message out. "
3,POLITICS,"Death-Row Inmates Have A Right To Know The Identities Of Lethal Injection Suppliers, Court Rules",Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/missouri-lethal-injection_us_57c99a3fe4b078581f12c1aa,"Missouri can’t keep secret the names of those who provide it with pentobarbital, a deadly anesthetic.",2016-09-02,Midazolam was at the center of an explosive 2015 Supreme Court case that upheld the constitutionality of Oklahoma's lethal injection protocols.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal appeals court said on Friday that Missouri must disclose the identities of the drug suppliers who provide the chemical used in the state’s single-drug execution protocol.In 2015, two death-row inmates from Mississippi challenged the constitutionality of the three-drug cocktail in their impending executions, but to make their case they sought information from Missouri, which uses pentobarbital ― an anesthetic that is used as the sole drug in a number of states.In their lawsuit, the inmates, Richard Jordan and Ricky Chase, are relying on language from Glossip v. Gross, a 2015 Supreme Court case that required prisoners defying their methods of execution to name a “known and available alternative method of execution” before pressing forward with their claims. So their attorneys filed a subpoena requesting more information about how Missouri obtains and uses pentobarbital. The state resisted, leading to a court battle resulting in Friday’s ruling.Acknowledging that “the public disclosure of a pentobarbital supplier’s identity may have detrimental consequences for a state,” the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit ruled that Missouri couldn’t show that disclosing the information would impose an “undue burden” as required by law.Officials had argued that its pentobarbital suppliers “require the assurance of confidentiality” before doing business with the state, but the appeals court found these claims “speculative,” noting instead that suppliers may also consider “financial, political, and other factors” in deciding whether to continue providing pentobarbital to Missouri.The 8th Circuit also rejected arguments that revealing the identities of the suppliers of the lethal chemical threatened Missouri’s sovereignty, or that the information is otherwise protected by the state secrets privilege, which the court said applies to military or national security concerns.Like other death penalty states, Missouri has laws shielding the public from knowing how its lethal injection drugs are obtained. Because of this secrecy, the inmates turned to courts to shed some light on how Missouri ― as well as Texas and Georgia ― does things to hopefully help their own case in Mississippi.Friday’s decision complements a BuzzFeed News report published earlier this week that called into question states’ claims that secrecy is needed to protect lethal injection suppliers from threats of violence.“Missouri’s lethal drug suppliers are selling to a public agency; they cannot expect their sales to be kept a secret from the public, let alone prisoners who need that information to prove that Mississippi’s execution procedures will cause a severely painful death,” said Jim Craig, a lawyer for the MacArthur Justice Center, responding to an earlier ruling on the case in July.In an interview with The Huffington Post, Craig, a longtime death penalty attorney, put his clients’ case in starker terms.“This is really about a concern that Mississippi is going to torture these men to death,” he said."

The Grande Hotel Beira was a luxury hotel in Beira, Mozambique that was open from 1952 to 1963. It continued to be used during the 1960s as a conference center and swimming pool. During the Mozambican Civil War (1977-1992) it became a refugee camp. Today the former hotel is occupied by approximately 1,000 squatters who live in substandard conditions.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c9807e180000b429bced77.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BEIRA, Mozambique, Sept 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Bemusa was only eight when her parents died of tuberculosis and she was left in the care of an “aunt”, who made ends meet by working as a prostitute in Mozambique’s second city, Beira.By the time Bemusa reached puberty, her aunt wanted the girl to join her as a sex worker on the streets of Beira, a city known for its faded colonial grandeur, busy port and sleazy nightlife.“My foster mother would push a blue candlestick laced with pepper into my vagina when I was 13,” said Bemusa, who agreed to be interviewed on condition that her real name was not used.“Each time she scolded me, ‘you must bleed and lose it’.”When the sexual initiation failed, Bemusa’s aunt sent two boys to sleep with her to ensure she lost her virginity. Men paid less to have sex with “inexperienced” girls, her aunt said.At the time, food was scarce and rice, a staple, had become too expensive to buy.“My aunt said, ‘lose that virginity, it’s a meal ticket’,” said Bemusa, who is now 18. Bemusa now earns on average $7 a day “on a good day” selling sex to truckers, foreign traders and Chinese tourists passing through Beira, a major trading point on the Mozambique Channel for goods coming in and out of Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia.“UNGRATEFUL”Women’s rights campaigners say scores of mostly orphaned girls in Mozambique have suffered similar sexual initiations at the hands of their guardians, who offer them to rich, older men in exchange for food, clothes, cash or even a goat.Many orphans lost their parents to HIV/AIDS which has claimed some 800,000 lives in the southern African country over the past decade.“To refuse is seen as a taboo,” said Bemusa, who drinks tea brewed with Mudzepete leaves, a hallucinogenic drink that blunts the painful memories of her experience.“Resisting brings violent beatings and intense shame especially when you are an orphan. You appear ungrateful.”The teenager, who has long abandoned her dream of becoming a nurse and getting married, blames her aunt for tricking her.“She said rich men in Mozambique pay more cows for wives who are ‘easy’, with no tight genitals. I was young, hungry, naïve.”Disasters in recent years, such as drought and floods, have driven poor Mozambican families deeper into destitution, and more women into prostitution, local activists say.The U.N. children’s agency UNICEF has also recognised the threat, warning in July that drought exacerbated by El Nino could lead to a spike in new HIV infections in southern Africa as more women and girls turn to sex to survive.WORKED GIRLSMany of Beira’s sex workers meet their clients inside tin shacks that line a dusty road where lorry drivers from Zimbabwe, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo are known to rest.An underage girl who has lost her virginity through these kinds of sexual initiations is known as a “worked girl” in the sex trade in Beira.“I’m a worked girl. I’m more attractive,” said Bemusa, wrapping a piece of cloth, known as a kanga, around her hips to indicate to would-be clients that she is available.“Chinese tourists usually pay $10 for a ‘worked girl’ and leave a gift,” she added.Jane, a 44-year-old prostitute, who has been working in Beira town for nine years, defended the practice of using candlesticks to initiate her daughter into sex: “Why not? ... Far better than older men paining her later in sex.”When asked whether this practice was a violation of her daughter, she replied: “My daughter is my property.”Efraimo Hoso, an infectious diseases doctor who runs a health clinic in Beira, said he has seen an increase in genital warts and vaginal tears in 15-year-old girls who sell sex.“I feel mad thinking of it,” Hoso told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.The Mozambican authorities with aid agencies such as UNICEF regularly run courses for police officers, immigration officials and teachers to raise awareness about sex trafficking.Pimping is illegal in Mozambique, and there have been high-profile prosecutions of offenders.However, rather than cracking down on the offence, some police officers have been accused by sex workers of extorting sexual favours from underage girls in exchange for turning a blind eye to their activities.“At night they happily visit my girls,” said a brothel owner in Beira.Beira police officials declined to comment.Bemusa is too deep into sex work to care.“I think of trying my luck in South Africa. I hear men pay better over there,” she said.(Editing by Katie Nguyen and Jo Griffin.

12,BLACK VOICES,Chicago Had Its Deadliest Month In Nearly 20 Years — And The Community Says It's Being Ignored,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chicago-homicides-august-2016_us_57c861bbe4b078581f11a767,Residents in the city's hard-hit areas say City Hall and the police aren't listening.,2016-09-02,"People watch as Father Pfleger of St. Sabina Church hangs the American flag upside down on the flag pole outside of his church during a protest for the recent uptick in homicides across the city on Aug. 31 in Chicago. Chicago has seen over 80 people killed and over 400 people shot and wounded during the month of August, making it the most violent month in 20 years.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c8a854180000b429bcebbd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Chicago’s gun violence is once again making national headlines, this time as the city ended the month of August with 92 homicides, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner ― the highest rate in almost two decades. With more than 400 wounded, the month was the city’s deadliest since October of 1997.Earlier this week, Fr. Michael Pfleger of South Side’s St. Sabina Church received three calls from three different community members who wanted to hold funerals at the church.“In 41 years here, I’ve never had three calls for people being killed in one day,” Pfleger said. “I think the greatest concern is that it’s just seemingly getting worse.” Wednesday evening during a protest, Pfleger called for Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner to declare a state of emergency for the city. “If the city is broke, Chicago needs to be declared a state of emergency so we can get federal resources to come in,” Pfleger said. “I’m told we’re down 1,000 police officers; schools are underfunded and whole communities look like a tornado went through it.” Rauner dismissed the idea of declaring a state of emergency and similarly rejected the perennial call to activate the National Guard. “No thoughtful leader thinks that’s a good idea or would really provide a solution. In fact, it may exacerbate other problems,” Rauner told reporters Wednesday. Pfleger has been a vocal critic of state and city leaders, including Rauner, Chicago aldermen and even the governor’s one-time ally, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.“What is the strategy to try and turn this disaster around? Where is the plan?” Pfleger said. “Asking for help is not an embarrassment. In my mind, that’s true leadership.” With 483 total homicides so far this year, Chicago has had more killings than New York and Los Angeles combined, according to DNAinfo Chicago, which tracks every shooting in the city (reported numbers vary by news organization depending on the source, as the Cook County Medical Examiner, Chicago Police and others have different criteria for counting “homicides”). Chicago had followed a broader nationwide trend in which homicides peaked in the early ‘90s and then steadily fell, save for the city’s slight jump in 2008. The city made headlines in 2012 when it posted more than 500 homicides for the year, a number not seen in almost a decade. Then the homicide rate dipped again, only to rise sharply this year. As early as March, the city was already on course to top 500 homicides for the year.After August’s totals, Chicago will likely hit that grim milestone with a few months to spare. But one area of the city that was once rife with shootings hasn’t had one for more than a year.Mothers Against Senseless Killings, or MASK, engages daily in what it calls positive loitering at the corner of 75th and Stewart in the city’s Englewood neighborhood, patrolling the block and setting out food so that neighbors come out of their homes and reclaim the space. MASK President Tamar Manasseh said as shooting totals have risen in their neighborhood, they have not on MASK’s block. “The city needs to start encouraging their residents to come out into the streets and on their blocks,” she said. “The city, the community and the police need to be on the same page and they’re not.” Manasseh is like many community members who say the key to fighting the city’s homicide rate isn’t a mystery: investment in neighborhoods, jobs training, mental health and schools, and implementing tougher gun laws to stem the tide of illegal weapons from Wisconsin and Indiana are the most common suggestions. What’s lacking, Manasseh and others argue, is the attention and will from leaders to act. “You think the mayor hasn’t heard about us? You think the [CPD] superintendent hasn’t heard about what we do? Neither one has reached out and said, ‘How can we expand this? How can we get this going in other neighborhoods?’” Manasseh said. “I have to believe they’re not as interested in solving this ... as you may think.”Chicago Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. By contrast, Manasseh points to how police shootings in Texas prompted a Chicago alderman to quickly propose a so-called “Blue Lives Matter” ordinance that would treat attacks on first responders like hate crimes. Manasseh and other MASK members have no shortage of ideas ― “maybe police forgive a parking ticket if you come out to a BBQ on your block or community event” ― but are frustrated city leadership seem uninterested in hearing them. “Just meet me and tell me my idea is dumb, but at least meet with me,” she said.Police and crime analysts have cited the November release of the Laquan McDonald video as a distinct point when crime numbers started to climb.The bombshell video, which Emanuel’s office fought to keep out of the public eye, shows a police officer shooting the black teenager 16 times as he walked away, and contradicts several police accounts of the incident. Emanuel fired then-Superintendent Garry McCarthy and the department faced intense criticism. It also began requiring police to fill out a new form before performing stops ― the result of a civil rights lawsuit over the department’s stop and frisk practices ― all of which led to a drop in morale and an apparent curbing of police activity; arrests plummeted while shootings around the city soared. Police have argued they don’t want to be the subject of the next protest-sparking viral video, while community members say police are using the McDonald video and anti-police-brutality protests as a scapegoat. “’I can’t figure out how to not shoot you, so I’m not going to show up for work’?” Manasseh said incredulously. “I think [police] pretty much gave up. They aren’t trying to make it worse but they’re not trying to fix it either.””I live on pins and needles. That is not an environment that people should live in,” said Pam Bosley, whose 18-year-old son, Terrell, was killed in 2006 while unloading instruments outside his church. “When you walk out the door in Chicago, you walk out as a target.” Bosley, who is part of the group Purpose Over Pain, which performs outreach to communities and families who have lost loved ones to gun violence, expressed frustration her youngest son refused to stay at school, at Southern Illinois University, for the Labor Day weekend. “My son is not backing down. He says he lives here and he doesn’t understand why he can’t come home,” Bosley said. “I’m going to get him tomorrow from SIU and pray nothing happens.” Bosley said she and others like her have suggested plenty of solutions to the gun violence problem “because we’re living it.” But the city, she said, would rather invest in a new Ferris wheel downtown than invest in struggling communities. The mayor’s office touts its summer jobs program, but Bosley said that alone isn’t enough investment for the neighborhoods facing intractable violence. As for police, Bosley ― like Manasseh ― yearns for a more positive relationship, but is frustrated by what she says is a status quo attitude. “Police blame the code of silence, they say people don’t tell,” she said of CPD’s claims that community members don’t cooperate with investigations. “People do tell. For my son’s case, a lady wanted to clear her conscience and came forward. The detective didn’t follow up.” Bosley likened Chicago’s violence issue to a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces continue growing: The community, the police and the leaders all have the pieces, but they need to be fit together. “Donald Trump said he could fix Chicago’s violence problem in one week,” Bosley said with a laugh. “If it were that easy, don’t you think it would have been done by now? Donald, you don’t have to wait for November: You can do it now.” "

14,BUSINESS,The Battle For The Future Of Transportation Seems Imminent,Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-google-waze-ride-hailing-lyft_us_57c8558fe4b0a22de09485cc,Are things about to get ugly in the ride-hailing business?,2016-09-02,"The Waze logo is displayed on a tablet, Jan. 2, 2014. The Alphabet-owned mobile app edged into Uber's territory this week.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c8abb9160000231cc001e4.jpeg?ops=crop_303_794_5584_1998%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Pay no attention to the cordial press releases. Google ― sorry, Alphabet ― sure looks like it’s thinking about taking on Uber.Earlier this week, Google announced that its popular Waze app, which offers crowd-sourced navigation and has 65 million active users, plans to explore a carpooling feature in the Bay Area sometime this fall.At around the same time, David Drummond ― chief legal officer at Alphabet, the parent company of Google ― announced his resignation from Uber’s board of directors. Drummond’s departure ends a three-year stint with the company that began in 2013, when Google invested $360 million in Uber.Both companies released statements attesting to their continued collaborative spirit. “I wish David and Alphabet the best, and look forward to continued cooperation and partnership,” Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said. Drummond said that Google Ventures “remains an enthusiastic investor and Google will continue to partner with Uber.”Still, it’s hard not to read this week’s events as signs that Google is planning to get into the ride-hailing game in a big way.Not mentioned in the official company statements: Uber had intentionally shut both Drummond and Google Ventures CEO David Krane out of board meetings for “a significant amount of time” prior, reports The Information.Also not mentioned: Earlier this month, Uber announced that it had acquired Otto, a self-driving truck company that counts among its co-founders ― who else? ― Anthony Levandowski, one of the minds behind Google’s self-driving research, and Lior Ron, an alumnus of Google Maps.With the announcement of the new Waze carpooling feature, charmingly called “WazeRider,” it seems things are coming to a head.“Considering that Waze reportedly has more than 50 million users, Google is arguably more knowledgeable — and has more insight — towards driving habits than any other company on the planet,” Kelley Blue Book analyst Michael Harley told NBC, adding that this is likely just “the tip of this emerging iceberg [in the] rapidly evolving ride-sharing wave.”From a financial perspective, if Google is indeed planning to storm the ride-hailing world, it’s doing so at an opportune time. Uber announced last week that it’s already lost over $1 billion this year in its unsuccessful battle for Chinese market share, and it needs to clean up its balance sheet ahead of a potential IPO. And rumors persist that Lyft is shopping itself around for a corporate buyer (Lyft denies these.)Google’s pockets are sufficiently deep to make a grand entrance into this space if it wants. Perhaps even more importantly, it has the detailed mapping data necessary to actually put self-driving cars on the road ― an ultimate goal for Uber, Lyft and many other companies.“Nominally, you can do autonomous driving without high-definition maps,” Sam Abuelsamid, senior research analyst at Navigant Research, told Popular Mechanics earlier this summer. “But if you get into challenging situations like rainy or snowy conditions, or can’t see the curbs or lane markings, it’s almost like putting a blind person behind the wheel.”"

In a later tweet, she clarified she was traveling with her breast pump.The actress, who welcomed her daughter in March, tweeted that the pilot was “helpful & apologetic,” but requested that the airline “kindly dismiss” the employee she said forcefully grabbed her carry-on. In response, the airline asked de Ravin to follow its Twitter account so it could look into the incident. American Airlines told The Huffington Post that it is still investigating the issue. A representative wrote in an email:We are still looking into the situation internally and following up with the customer. Passengers are allowed to have two carry-on items, and breast pump is considered a medical assistive device that can be brought on board in addition to carry-on items. The pump was eventually allowed on board. We apologize to the customer for the inconvenience.de Ravin also tweeted to thank the airline for an otherwise “smooth and safe flight.”Other moms, famous and non-famous, have used social media to share their grievances about traveling as a breastfeeding mother. In April 2015, Alyssa Milano tweeted that Heathrow Airport confiscated 10 ounces of breast milk she had pumped. And in December 2015, a Texas mom wrote a viral Facebook post saying Delta would not allow her to bring her frozen breast milk on board with dry ice after contacting the airline for specific instructions on how to travel with it.Hopefully de Ravin’s tweets will help ensure other breastfeeding moms won’t have to go through what she did."

Her family turned to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital for her treatment, and today she is back in training for the sport she loves.This September, as we recognize Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, we can celebrate the strides made against childhood cancer that are helping children like Jordyn: Thanks to the work of St. Jude, the overall childhood cancer survival rate is now more than 80 percent, up from just 20 percent when the hospital opened in 1962.But, we have tremendous work still to be done. Too many childhood cancers, including brain tumors and bone cancers, still have terrible survival rates. So, we must re-dedicate ourselves to tackling this disease until no child dies from cancer. With your support, and that of people across this country, St. Jude will continue to lead the way the world understands, treats and defeats childhood cancer.Just like the early supporters who rallied around St. Jude founder Danny Thomas’ call to help build St. Jude, we can come together to help St. Jude and the patients and families battling childhood cancer in leading the charge today in the fight against this disease. And we can help keep Danny’s promise that no family will ever receive a bill from St. Jude – not for treatment, travel, housing or food – because we believe all a family should worry about is helping their child live.This month, I urge you to join us at the St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer. More than 60 communities are hosting this event on Sept. 17, 24 and 25 to raise funds and bring critically important awareness to the work of St. Jude and the impact of childhood cancer on far too many families. No matter your fitness level, this is an easy, fun, family-friendly and meaningful way to come together and celebrate the lives of children from communities everywhere.“We knew St. Jude was the best place for childhood cancer,” said Chastity, Jordyn’s mom. “We knew that when families go to St. Jude, they have no worries. They’re going to be taken care of.”With your help, St. Jude can continue to provide ground-breaking treatment and world-class care to children like Jordyn. Our doctors and scientists can press on in the search for cures for childhood cancer – and for other diseases that threaten a child’s life. We freely share our discoveries so that doctors and scientists can use that knowledge to save children in communities everywhere. And we can work with the survivors of childhood cancer, through the St. Jude LIFE study, helping them learn how to manage their health care risks as adults while also learning how to minimize the side effects of treatments from yesterday in our patients today.This month, we can unite behind the St. Jude mission: Finding cures. Saving children.Let’s do this. Let’s end childhood cancer. Together.This blog post is part of an annual series produced by The Huffington Post and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital® in recognition of Childhood Cancer Awareness Month in September.

Murthy, MD, MBA, our current United States Surgeon General in the Obama Administration. The Surgeon General’s position and role is often used to reach citizens about their health and the measures they can take to protect or improve it (among many other responsibilities). But this letter, dated August 2016, was addressed “Dear Colleague.”True to his salutation, in the most collegial of ways, Dr. Murthy wrote “I am asking for your help to solve an urgent health care crisis facing America...” He was referring to the opioid addiction epidemic that has spread like a terrible virus across our country, affecting people of all colors, socio-economic stations, ages and geographies (from rural communities to small towns to big cities). Deaths from opioid overdoses, which are surely underreported in older people as well as because of the limited capacities of medical examiners in about every city, have quadrupled since 1999. The great increase in the prescription of opioid pain pills (like OxyContin, Vicodin and Percocet) has not only been a tragic route to dependence on this analgesics to relieve physical and mental pain it has also helped to create a resurgence of heroin use when the pills become too expensive or difficult to access. Yet there is no evidence that the collective pain experienced by Americans, at least physical pain, is any greater than it was in 1999.When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidelines for opioid prescribing, it was the first time a federal agency so forcefully declared the problem and took action towards its remediation. I covered this release in US News & World Report in an article called “Better Than a War on Drugs.” I wrote that guidelines, like these, are welcome but seldom prove sufficient to change doctors’ practices. Nor are they likely to alter the demand from users already addicted.Dr. Murthy’s enclosed pocket card was titled “Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain,” and was noted to have been adapted from the CDC publication. The card, like the original guidelines, advised doctors (really anyone who can prescribe these medications) about what they could/should do before prescribing, when prescribing, and after initiating treatment with an opioid medication. The Surgeon General’s card made plain that these guidelines were for people over 18 years of age (because too little is known about youth) with chronic pain, and not meant for patients with active cancer, or palliative or end of life care. The counsel the card provided was clear and will be useful if it will find its way into everyday practice, which the Surgeon General was beseeching.To add to Dr. Murthy’s call for change was a link to “Turn The Tide,” a website where doctors could make a “pledge” to do what is right. I made the pledge – though my clinical work today does not call for the prescription of this category of medications – though many of my colleagues are in a position to adopt its recommendations.Changing social attitudes and individual reactions towards people with addictions, including alcohol, tobacco and drugs, is one of the great barriers to changing the course of the opioid epidemic. People with substance use disorders and their families face and feel shame. Many doctors and other clinicians feel out of their comfort zone, untrained and unconnected to addiction services, and thus eschew asking patients about addiction, screening for it in practice, and being part of a medical team caring for someone with an addiction. In the article I wrote after Prince’s death, “Painful Shadow of Prince’s Death,” I illustrated how his route to addiction started with the prescription of opioids following hip surgery and then progressed to dependence, coupled with his need to hide this problem ― thus giving him little chance of being saved.The Surgeon General’s letter called on doctors to be “leaders” in saving lives lost to opioids. He did not say but I am confident he also meant we doctors need to help mitigate the impact of this epidemic on families who are devastated, and communities ravaged by crime and the social costs of untreated addictions.Drug use, abuse, and dependence are, I believe, one of a handful of major societal issues we face in the 21 Century, along with immigration, terrorism, climate change and poverty (including disparities and injustice). The opioid addiction epidemic can be brought under control ― if responded to with the types of strong public health approaches that achieved great success with TB, polio, HIV/AIDS and many other diseases. Doctors must help but they cannot do it alone. They need to be part of a larger effort involving youth, adults, families, communities, media and government. Complex problems require complex solutions, “teams of teams,” and adequate resources. When that happens we can change the world for the better.………….The opinions expressed herein are solely my own as a psychiatrist and public health advocate.

Ultimately, Bondi did not join New York’s case.As a nonprofit, Trump’s charity cannot make political gifts. The Post reported earlier this year that the Trump Foundation listed the gift as going to a Kansas group with a similar name in IRS filings. That, Fahrenthold points out, meant that “the prohibited gift was, in effect, replaced with an innocent-sounding but nonexistent donation.”Trump also donated $35,000 to support former Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott’s campaign for governor in 2013. As attorney general, Abbott decided in 2010 not to pursue a false advertising case against Trump U.Jeffrey McConney, senior vice president at the Trump Organization, told the Post this week that the inaccurate record of a donation to the Kansas group “was just an honest mistake... It wasn’t done intentionally to hide a political donation, it was just an error.”Trump said he donated to support Bondi’s re-election because she “is a fabulous representative of the people — Florida is lucky to have her.” Bondi has endorsed Trump for president and spoke at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer.Internal company documents show that Trump University employees were instructed to emotionally manipulate people into buying classes. According to court testimony, Trump U. employees pressured customers to max out their credit cards. Trump’s lawyers and campaign have denied the allegations.McConney did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Bush and Sidney Blumenthal, a former Clinton White House aide and an unofficial adviser to Clinton. Clinton is now the Democratic nominee for president.Lazar leaked online memos Blumenthal sent Clinton that were addressed to her private email account, which was used during her time as secretary of state to conduct both personal and work business in lieu of a government account.Clinton’s email arrangement, which became the subject of an FBI investigation, has drawn intense scrutiny from Republicans attempting to sow doubt about her honesty ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.An entity calling itself “Guccifer 2.0” and claiming to be a Romanian hacker emerged in June and began taking credit for data breaches at the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.U.S. intelligence officials and cyber security experts believe Guccifer 2.0 is a front for Russian intelligence services intended to spread confusion about the hacks against the Democratic Party.(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by James Dalgleish)"
