0,POLITICS,Harvard GOP Club Calls Trump 'A Threat To The Survival Of The Republic',Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harvard-republicans-donald-trump_us_57a3987fe4b056bad214e643,"Members urge other student groups not to endorse ""this dangerous man.""",2016-08-04,The Harvard Republicans have officially denounced Donald Trump. Shown here is a scene from a Trump-themed protest on Harvard's campus in March. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a3a9b82a0000fa01fb4cbb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Republican student group at Harvard University released a statement on Thursday denouncing GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.“Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic,” the Harvard Republican Club statement says. “His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy.”“He isn’t eschewing political correctness,” the statement continues. “He is eschewing basic human decency.”The students’ statement goes on to call out Trump’s flimsy rhetoric.“Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning,” it reads. “When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.”The Harvard club is the oldest college GOP group. Its members hope that other Republicans in the Northeast will rescind endorsements of Trump, so that the party’s candidates are not severely impacted down the ballot at local and state-level elections. “We call on our party’s elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man,” the group says in its statement. Declan Garvey, a rising senior and president of the Harvard group, said members have expressed disappointment in Trump for months.“However, Trump’s remarks on Khizr Khan and his wife pushed us to start the official endorsement process now rather than wait until everyone was back on campus in the fall,” he told The Huffington Post. “On Tuesday night we emailed a secure and anonymous survey to our club’s email list, and approximately 80 percent of respondents preferred for us to not endorse the nominee, so we put together the ensuing statement.”The Harvard Republican Club is the latest student group to officially denounce Trump. Last month, some 4,000 students and alumni from Trump’s alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, signed an open letter condemning the candidate. The letter’s authors said many of Trump’s statements were in direct conflict with the values of their school.In April, the Boston Globe interviewed several leaders of campus GOP groups who expressed serious concerns about Trump and said they would consider voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Some college Republican groups do support Trump, but it’s not exactly the lovefest that the national College Republican has said it is. Oh, and the Harvard club isn’t having it with the birtherism from Trump’s allies. You can read the full statement from the Harvard group here. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

4,THE WORLDPOST,Murder On The Rise In Rio's Slums Ahead Of Olympics,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/murder-on-the-rise-in-rios-slums-ahead-of-olympics_us_57a3864be4b04414d1f3eefb,Shantytown 'pacification' efforts have stalled.,2016-08-04,"A general view of the Rocinha favela, one of the slums that was included in the ""police pacification unit"" program that began in 2008, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, July 24, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a387b41300002a007c3001.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Atop the chipped blue metal table sat two 9 mm pistols and small plastic packets of cocaine and marijuana. Two young men slouched in white plastic chairs, while a third held a rifle in a corner 10 meters away.It was midday this week, not far from a main road in Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro’s most developed and supposedly “pacified” slum that straddles a mountain and sits right between the main Barra and Copacabana Olympic zones.A uniformed police officer stood just 150 meters away, up a sinuous, narrow asphalted lane.How long had the gang members returned to openly carrying weapons in Rocinha, where 3,000 police and armored personnel carriers in late 2011 invaded to drive out traffickers?“If you are not buying, move along,” was the terse response from one man at the table, who appeared to be in his late teens.The scene was emblematic of problems plaguing the stagnated “police pacification unit” program, or UPP, which started in 2008. Its ambitious goal: to push heavily armed gangs from slums and construct permanent police outposts.There were early successes but they have faded with murder rates again on the rise. A lack of serious follow-up investments because of exhausted public finances and insufficient political will now threatens the entire program.While most residents are pleased the gangs have less of a presence than before the program began, they also expected to see improved schools, health clinics and sewage systems.Rio’s city government says it has spent $1.8 billion reais ($560 million) on social programs since 2011. But with so much need for the roughly 20 percent of Rio’s population that lives in slums, frustration over what residents see as a lack of progress has exacerbated tensions with heavily armed police.“People around here are more afraid of the police than we ever were of the drug gang,” said Alex de Mello, a fishmonger who has lived 24 years in Rocinha. “At least with the gangs, if you minded your business you probably would be left alone.”To date, 38 police pacification units have been created, putting over 9,500 police into the shantytowns, or “favelas”, where 1.5 million people live, according to Rio’s state government.The effort was meant bring security ahead of the Olympics and the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament, with the promised legacy of delivering basic social services to the favelas.Authorities openly stated the effort could not end the drug trade, but sought to at least disarm it. For several years, drugs continued to be sold out of “pacified” areas but without the obvious presence of weapons. That has changed.For the first five years, the program was a smash success on the security front. By 2012, murders in Rio and the surrounding Baixada Fluminense area had plummeted 40 percent from the 2008 level of 3,856 killed.“Then we had the Rocinha effect,” said Robert Muggah, research director at the Rio-based Igarape Institute, a security and development think tank. “Pushback against the program began in 2013 and reached a crescendo with the killing of Amarildo.”A 42-year-old construction worker who lived in Rocinha, Amarildo Souza was abducted, tortured and “disappeared” by pacification police in July 2013.They falsely claimed he had ties to gangs. His body has never been found.Twelve officers were found guilty in his case, with the former commander of Rocinha’s UPP unit sentenced in February to over 13 years in prison.Souza’s death followed years of complaints of heavy-handed policing, and was the final straw for residents fed up that the promised social services never appeared.Several subsequent episodes of police killing innocents, including children, and officers caught colluding with drug gangs have made things even worse. Add an ongoing recession, and public and institutional support for new UPPs waned.The last unit created was inaugurated in May 2014 - since then, nothing. MORE MURDERSFive years after the pacification programs began, homicides suddenly spiked again. Killings in 2013 returned to the pre-UPP level, with 3,879 murders in Rio and Baixada Fluminense as emboldened gangs carried out brazen attacks on police.The killings dipped again for the following two years, but climbed 7.5 percent to 1,518 murders in the first six months of this year compared to the same period in 2015.As worrying, the number of people killed by police has jumped 12 percent in that same time frame. They spiked 62 percent in May and June with 127 people killed by officers - mostly young, black and poor men.Rio’s outspoken Mayor Eduardo Paes has bashed state officials on the security front, saying they have done a terrible job.The state’s security chief Jose Beltrame loudly laments the fiscal crisis, openly questioning how he can adequately protect the population when his 2016 budget was slashed by 30 percent.Rio state, which oversees security forces, is the second most indebted in Brazil. The interim governor declared a “state of calamity” in June to secure enough federal funds to pay police and keep hospitals open this year.Renata Neder, a Rio-based human rights advisor with Amnesty International, blamed the Olympics for the increase in police violence because of more frequent slum raids.“You increase the number of operations then you increase the number of people being killed,” she said. “The security for the Games is resulting in rights violations.”Rio’s state security secretariat said in an emailed statement that “the UPPs are not going to end” and that a state decree from 2015 enshrining the pacification policy was a guarantee the effort could not stop when new governments are elected.Shantytown residents are not so sure.A survey released last month by the Getulio Vargas Foundation think tank found that over 43 percent of slum residents think the pacification program “will end” after the Olympics, while slightly over 41 percent think it will continue.The survey questioned 2,000 people in 20 different slums.Although gang members sell drugs and carry weapons, they still have much less of a presence than before the pacification programs were implemented.Jeruza Lima, a 28-year-old born and raised in Rocinha who runs a tiny snack food store, said she thinks the UPP improved life in the community and she hopes the policing effort continues for long after the Olympics end on Aug. 21.“You no longer see the gangs walking around heavily armed, setting the rules of how we live our life,” she said.“For me, Rocinha is a better place now with the police here. They can’t go away – can they?”(Reporting by Brad Brooks; Additional reporting by Maria Pia Palermo; Editing by Kieran Murray)"

Police said there was no evidence that the attack was related to terrorism.Armed police were called at 10:33 p.m. local time after a Norwegian man of Somali origin attacked people with a knife in London’s Russell Square, an elegant park near the site of a 2005 suicide bombing.The victim, identified by Scotland Yard late Thursday as 64-year-old Darlene Horton, a U.S. citizen from Florida, was treated at the scene but pronounced dead a short time later.Horton’s husband, Richard Wagner, is a professor at Florida State University and spent the summer teaching FSU’s London Study Program. The two had planned to return home Thursday.Another woman and four men were treated in hospital, though three of them were later discharged. Nationals from Australia, Britain, and Israel were also hurt.”All of the work we have done so far increasingly points to this tragic incident as having been triggered by mental health issues,” said London Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley.“We believe this was a spontaneous attack and that the victims were selected at random. So far we have found no evidence of radicalization that would suggest that the man in our custody is in any way motivated by terrorism,” added Rowley, who is Britain’s most senior anti-terrorism officer. Initially he said that terrorism was a line of inquiry.Police, who arrived within six minutes of being called, used a Taser electric shock gun while detaining the 19-year-old suspect. They later formally arrested him on suspicion of murder.Officers cordoned off the southern part of the square, which sits at the heart of London’s university area and is close to landmarks such as the British Museum, for several hours as forensics officers examined the attack scene.Later, workmen hosed blood off the pavement.London’s Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital, called for vigilance and urged Londoners to report anything suspicious to the police‎, who increased their presence in the capital.“The safety of all Londoners is my number one priority and my heart goes out to the victims of the incident in Russell Square and their loved ones,” he said.“I urge all Londoners to remain calm and vigilant. Please report anything suspicious to the police‎. We all have a vital role to play as eyes and ears for our police and security services and in helping to ensure London is protected.”Hours before the Russell Square attack, London’s police chief said that he would deploy an additional 600 armed officers across the capital to protect against attacks.London counter-terrorism police chiefs have previously warned that the Islamic State was seeking to radicalize vulnerable people with mental health issues to carry out attacks. In some operations, police commanders have taken advice from specialist psychologists.Militants hit London with coordinated suicide bombings on July 7, 2005, killing 52 people. One of the bombs detonated on a bus close to Russell Square.Since then, dozens of plots have been foiled and there have been smaller-scale attacks, such as the beheading of an off-duty soldier by militant Islamists in a London street in May 2013.A man who attacked passengers at a London underground train station in December was jailed for life earlier this month. The judge said the attacker was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the offense but may have been motivated by events in Syria.This article has been updated to include new details, including the nationalities of those attacked, the identity of the stabbing victim and new comments from London police."

High Commissioner for Human Rights, called on the government of President Salva Kiir to prosecute perpetrators and urged world powers in the U.N. Security Council to take “urgent action” to halt violence.“While some civilians were killed in crossfire between the fighting forces, others were reportedly summarily executed by Government (SPLA) soldiers, who appear to have specifically targeted people of Nuer origin,” Zeid said in a statement.Kiir fired six ministers allied to his long-time rival Riek Machar late on Tuesday, widening a political rift in the world’s newest state and drawing threats of more fighting.Zeid, reporting on his office’s investigation, cited two separate incidents on 11 July in which SPLA soldiers reportedly arrested eight Nuer civilians during house-to-house searches in Juba’s Munuki area and took them to two nearby hotels, “where they shot four of them”.On the same day, SPLA soldiers broke into another hotel where they shot and killed a Nuer journalist.At least 73 civilian deaths have been documented so far by the U.N., but it is believed the civilian death toll may turn out to be “much higher”, Zeid said.“The fighting also resulted in widespread sexual violence, including rape and gang rape by soldiers in uniform and men in plain clothes,” he said, adding that Nuer, Dinka and women from the three Equatorial states were all targeted, along with foreign nationals.At least 217 cases of sexual violence in Juba had been documented during the period of July 8-25, he said.“In a few areas, women from various ethnic groups were raped by heavily armed youth believed to be affiliated to the SPLA in Opposition (SPLA/IO),” Zeid said.“However, according to the information we have gathered so far, those most affected were displaced Nuer women and girls and those responsible seem to have been mostly SPLA.”"

9,MEDIA,It's Extremely Troublesome That Trump Thinks The Media Is 'All Bad',Alana Horowitz Satlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-media-bad_us_57a30d31e4b04414d1f39a6c,"We should be very, very afraid.",2016-08-04,"Donald Trump’s vindictive attitude toward journalists that challenge or criticize him suggests he’d limit their ability to cover his presidency, should he be elected.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a317652a00000002fb49f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s disdain for media organizations, including the one you’re reading right now, is well-documented. He’s referred to CNN as “the Clinton Network,” accused The New York Times’ writers of not being able to “write good,” and called the New York Daily News “a dying tabloid.”But the Republican presidential nominee took his hatred a step further Wednesday night and insulted all news outlets at once.“The press is more dishonest now than I’ve ever seen it,” he told supporters in Jacksonville, Florida. “They’re all bad,” he added, according to The Washington Post. “Honestly, they’re all bad.”His language is troubling because it reflects more than just his love for insulting people and things. Trump’s anti-media attitude extends beyond words into actions. The businessman regularly blocks journalists and outlets from attending his events. His staff and security have kicked reporters out of rallies and press conferences for attempting to interview supporters or asking questions he didn’t like.Most concerning, though, are Trump’s vows to dial back free press by strengthening libel laws and suing media outlets. A 2008 UNESCO study of worldwide media sovereignty concluded that “freedom of expression is essential to the exercise of all other rights.” “Without it, peoples cannot be aware of their rights and, less still, secure respect for them,” the report said. “A free press is the channel of communication between the public and its rulers, revealing the needs of the population and its attitudes towards public policies.”A free press which is able to provide checks and balances to government actions is essential to a modern, functioning democracy. As the Miami Herald argues, without transparency, America simply cannot be a government ruled “by the people, for the people.”“This free flow of information to the public is essential to preserving our American democracy,” the Herald said. “In addition to educating and reporting, the press serves as the public’s independent watchdog, charged with keeping governments, businesses and other organizations in check. What other institution has the power to talk to key leaders, inspire social change and uncover corruption, while analyzing and providing context for major global events? Thanks to diligent reporting, citizens are empowered to take a stance on critical issues, enact change and demand the best from their leaders.”Countries like China, Russia and Egypt ― where state-controlled media reigns and independent journalists are thrown in jail ― are rampant with other types of human rights violations.Trump’s vindictive attitude toward the media suggests he’d limit its ability to cover his presidency, should he be elected. It’s in line with his unwillingness to accept criticism, relentlessly insulting anyone who challenges him and refusing to admit when he’s wrong.A Trump presidency could be disastrous for press freedoms. And that’s something we should be very, very afraid of.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Above, visitors walk through Wynwood.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a39cf213000029007c3070.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Doctors are telling pregnant women in Miami to wear long sleeves and pants in 100-degree heat, to avoid going outside, and to use condoms for the duration of their pregnancies as Zika cases multiply in South Florida. “I used to go for these long walks at night with my first [pregnancy], and now I’m stuck inside,” said Dr. Karla Maguire, an OBGYN in Miami who is pregnant with her second child. “I think in an ideal world, if I were independently wealthy, I’d get out of Florida right now. But just following recommendations and trying to avoid mosquitos is all we can do.” Because the Zika virus presents the biggest problem for pregnant women and their fetuses, women’s health clinics have a vital role to play in the outbreak. And clinics are scrambling to deal with the flood of women worried about Zika in light of reports this week that the number of locally transmitted cases in the Miami area had risen to 15, obstetricians told The Huffington Post. “We are getting an influx of phone calls from pregnant patients and people thinking about getting pregnant,” said Dr. Lona Sasser, an OBGYN in Coral Gables. “We’ve been talking to the patients about it for months and months, but the phone calls certainly have increased over the last week.”Zika can be spread through sex, by mosquitos or from a pregnant woman to her fetus. (A lot is still unknown about the virus.) Many people who get Zika will have mild symptoms or none at all. But the virus can cause severe birth defects. Zika has spread throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, and the World Health Organization declared it a public health emergency in February. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised pregnant women this week to avoid Wynwood, a neighborhood in downtown Miami where the virus appears to be rapidly spreading ― the first time in history the CDC has issued a travel warning for an American neighborhood due to an infectious disease. But the agency lacks the resources it needs to quickly and adequately address Zika.Women’s health clinics are on “the leading edge of addressing this epidemic, educating women and protecting women and their babies,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. They may teach women about prevention, refer women to get tested, distribute contraceptives ― even help pregnant women avoid mosquitos.“We are handing out insect repellent in our office and informing our patients to use it every day before you leave the house,” said Sasser. “We tell them long sleeves, long pants. We’re so hot down here, it can be unrealistic. There’s a couple websites that provide SPF 50 sunwear that makes it more doable … Some people have waited so long, and this is their opportunity to have a baby, so they’re going to do everything they can.”Planned Parenthood, which has two locations less than a 15-minute drive from Wynwood, started providing targeted information to women about Zika “months ago” because the state is a major travel destination, said Dr. Christopher Estes, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of South, East and North Florida. Estes hasn’t seen a major uptick in patients asking about Zika, he said, and noted that especially in the South Florida region, many people have close connections to Latin America, where the Zika outbreak is already a known problem. Some clinics “will be much more prepared than others, but they’re all going to have to be playing catch-up to some degree,” said Benjamin. He noted that clinics are now burdened with Zika, along with the other things they have to do to assist pregnant women. Dr. Rosana Rodriguez, an OBGYN at Women’s Healthcare of Kendall in Miami, said there is confusion about whether they can start doing testing in their clinic, and who is responsible for notifying the CDC if there is a positive result. The clinic is screening women with questions like whether they or their partners live in Wynwood, then referring at-risk women to a hospital for testing. The CDC only recommends testing for certain people: those who have lived or traveled to an area with Zika or have a sexual partner who has, and pregnant women who live in or have traveled to such an area or had sex with someone who has, even if the pregnant women don’t show symptoms. Other people who may wish to get tested in Florida — like women who are planning to get pregnant, but don’t have symptoms — cannot currently do so at county health departments. One reason that county health departments can’t offer “curiosity testing” for individuals who don’t meet the CDC’s testing criteria is that there may not be sufficient funding to process Zika tests. CDC director Tom Frieden said the agency needs more money from Congress to mount a more comprehensive and permanent response to Zika. The GOP-led House approved a Zika funding bill in June that would limit contraception access and exclude Planned Parenthood from the effort to fight the virus, but the Senate demanded a bigger and more inclusive response. And nearly five months after President Barack Obama requested $1.9 billion for the effort, Congress left for the summer on July 14 without passing the much-needed funding. In the meantime, women’s health clinics are using the resources they have to slow the spread of the virus and deal with the highest-risk patients first. “I ask how old they are, what their circumstances are, what neighborhood they live in,” Sasser said. “Zika is going to be here eventually where we are ― it’s going to be in all of South Florida. The only thing you can do is use the best precautions.”CORRECTION: An earlier version wrongly reported the amount that Obama has requested for a Zika response. It’s $1.9 billion, not $1.9 million."

On Monday, the Assembly passed a resolution that declared August 2016 as Muslim Appreciation and Awareness Month, as part of an effort to acknowledge the “myriad invaluable contributions of Muslim Americans in California and across the country.” The resolution (HR-59) was introduced by Assembly Member Bill Quirk and passed with bipartisan support, according to NBC. The writers of the resolution pointed out that California is home to over 240 mosques, more than any other state in the country. The resolution also decried the discrimination that Muslim Americans have had to endure in the years following the September 11 attacks. “Muslim Americans have made contributions to education, science, entertainment and medicine both nationally and globally,” Quirk told NBC News. “Unfortunately, the Muslim community has been, and continues to be, the target of harassment, discrimination and assaults.”The Huffington Post’s Islamophobia project, which has been tracking anti-Muslim incidents in The United States, has recorded 233 Islamophobic incidents in 2016 alone. Three of these took place in California this past July, including one instance where a mom wearing a hijab was reportedly attacked and egged while walking out of a Walmart in San Leandro.“During these difficult times of increased anti-Muslim rhetoric and hate incidents, Assembly member Quirk’s resolution and recognition of Muslim Americans is uplifting for our community and immensely appreciated,” said Basim Elkarra, Sacramento Valley Executive Director of the advocacy organization Council on American-Islamic Relations. “It is truly a historic moment for all Californians.”"

She just returned from a 34-date European tour to release her latest solo record produced by John Carter Cash, the only child of Johnny and June Carter Cash.By age 9, Robin, a precocious guitarist, was studying under the classically-trained shredder Randy Rhoads, a heavy metal legend.

I had a moment with him where he put his hands around me, his arms around me ― not around my shoulder but around, you know, my stomach area or whatever you want to call it. I thought that was a little strange.”With his arm around her, Trump said, “Oh my god, Janet, you have a tight body,” she recalled. (The band’s lead singer, Leslie Knauer, has the same recollection. Donald Trump’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.)“He didn’t molest me or try to make out or anything,” Robin told HuffPost. “You know, I’m not a trash-talker. That’s why I’m not trash-talking him. But he did say that and I thought it was inappropriate. It was while he had his arm around me.”Trump’s participation in the video stemmed from his connection to Jay Pritzker, the Hyatt Hotels’ founder with whom Trump had purchased his first Manhattan property, the famed Grand Hyatt.

Now he wanted $250,000, and he would decide who received the money.“You know, $10,000 really isn’t a Trump kind of donation,” he told the band, according to Knauer.Trump’s demands made headlines at the time, and he blamed the band. “He thought it was only fair that the charities receive more,” a Trump spokesperson told the New York Post. “Now it seems this group is just grabbing for publicity and using Mr. Trump’s name to do it.”Trump’s practice of appealing to charity to justify reneging on an agreement was put to use again this year when he skipped a key presidential debate to host a fundraiser for veterans’ causes. He claimed that he’d given $1 million of his own money to the cause, but he had not. Only after media scrutiny did Trump provide a donation, four months later.Another investigation found that Trump has for 15 years “promised to donate earnings from a wide variety of his moneymaking enterprises,” including TV’s “The Apprentice,” Trump Vodka and Trump University. Public records show he donated less than one-third of the pledged amount.Precious Metal’s label couldn’t afford to pay Trump, so they had to scrap his footage and reshoot the video using a Trump-ish looking body-double.“We were just a struggling band, wondering why he would do that to us,” Knauer later told Billboard Magazine. “He full-on just lied. I hate to think the guy had any power over me at all, but he hurt our career at that moment.”Precious Metal didn’t make another album. “It was really a shame, a disappointment that he pulled out,” Robin said. “There certainly weren’t many hard-rock all-girl bands in that time, and we were just trying to make more of a name for ourselves and promote our new record.”A trailblazer in her own right, Robin acknowledged that she’s excited at the prospect of seeing a woman in the Oval Office.“Now that’s politics, and that’s not rock and roll. Rock’s still male-dominated.” On the other hand, she said, 70 percent of her guitar students these days are young girls, and the boys she teaches are increasingly gender-blind when it comes to music.“I have a boy who started with me at 8 or 9 and he’s a shredder now; he doesn’t give a shit that I’m a girl, he could care less,” she said. “I’m very happy teaching younger boys.

Each one has a name, a downtown area filled with shops and restaurants, and it’s own je ne sais quoi that gives it a distinctive personality. Most of them also boast their own large parks, which are favorite haunts for Seattleites looking to escape the heat in the summer. Not sure where to start? Here are a few top recommendations from a local.Sunbathe at Alki BeachEven though it’s only a short 15-minute drive (or water taxi ride) from downtown, Alki Beach in West Seattle feels like you’ve suddenly been transported to California. A long strip of white sand entices sunbathers and volleyball players, swimmers and families, to slow down and lounge the afternoon away in the sun. Your choice of lunch awaits at the cluster of restaurants, ice cream shops, and cafes that line the street across from the beach.Go for a stroll (or a roll) at Seward ParkThough many parks in Seattle have walking trails, they are not all accessible. Seward Park in South Seattle, however, has a wide, paved path around its perimeter that can accommodate strollers, wheelchairs, toddlers who are still wobbly on their feet, bicyclists, dogs… you get the idea. Since this park is a peninsula, the path offers gorgeous views shifting from the north, east, and south as you complete the 2.4 mile trail.Roast marshmallows at Golden GardensFor a sandy swimming beach that’s less urban than Alki, head north past the Ballard neighborhood to Golden Gardens. Extremely popular on weekends, there are several fire pits available for beachside campfires in the evening. Roasting a marshmallow while watching the sun set behind the Olympics across Puget Sound is an experience every Seattleite should have at least once.Dive in at Madrona Park BeachThis Lake Washington park is tiny but mighty. On those hot summer days where you just can’t bear to be inside your greenhouse of an apartment (Seattle still hasn’t caught on to this whole “air conditioning” thing), jump in the lake at Madrona Beach to cool off. Friday afternoons can get a bit crowded, but you can’t beat the convenience. If you are the kind of swimmer who wears arm floaties and fears the deep unknown—don’t worry, there are lifeguards on duty here.Go trail running at Discovery ParkA Seattle classic, this enormous park in the Magnolia neighborhood is a favorite among joggers (I believe it’s jogging, or yogging. It might be a soft J, I’m not sure). Though usually spotted running solo or in small groups, on weekends you may find large herds doing a lap or two together on the 2.8 mile loop trail that winds through the forested park. Also make sure to stop by the lighthouse and enjoy the rocky beach.Picnic at Gasworks ParkIf there were an award for weirdest park, Gasworks would definitely win that award. Perched on the north end of Lake Union, it used to be an oil and gas refinery, and now hosts a spiral-shaped grassy hill and brightly painted leftover machinery to climb on. It’s a favorite picnic spot, as well as home to the 4 of July fireworks and Seafair festivities. Just don’t swim in the water here (remember what I said about the refinery?).Do yoga at the Olympic Sculpture ParkFor a mini break from the concrete jungle of downtown Seattle, walk north of Pike Place Market to the Sculpture Park, which is actually owned by the Seattle Art Museum. This long stretch of protected shoreline has many grassy areas and benches for getting your Seattleite introvert fix and reading a book (or napping) and odd sculptures that are up for personal interpretation. In the summer there are also free community fitness classes like yoga hosted here. They are fun as long as you don’t mind being photographed by giggling tourists. Play at the Seattle CenterEveryone thinks of the Space Needle, our iconic 605 foot tall structure erected in 1962 for the World’s Fair. But there is so much more! There are dozens of free festivals, concerts, and family-friendly events, free zumba and yoga classes, plus the permanent museums, theaters, and more. And don’t forget the fountain, which is a great way to cool off during a hot afternoon. Watch out, it sporadically sprays in different directions to soak you when you least expect it!Catch a film at Magnuson ParkThis huge park in North Seattle sits on the edge of Lake Washington, and is host to dozens of activities like boating, athletic fields, and nature walks. During Thursday evenings in July and August, though, it becomes an outdoor movie theater. Locals cozy up in their camping chairs and blankets and enjoy classic films.  Hola, Bonjour, Sabaidee!

Most of them also boast their own large parks, which are favorite haunts for Seattleites looking to escape the heat in the summer. Not sure where to start? Here are a few top recommendations from a local.Sunbathe at Alki BeachEven though it’s only a short 15-minute drive (or water taxi ride) from downtown, Alki Beach in West Seattle feels like you’ve suddenly been transported to California. A long strip of white sand entices sunbathers and volleyball players, swimmers and families, to slow down and lounge the afternoon away in the sun. Your choice of lunch awaits at the cluster of restaurants, ice cream shops, and cafes that line the street across from the beach.Go for a stroll (or a roll) at Seward ParkThough many parks in Seattle have walking trails, they are not all accessible. Seward Park in South Seattle, however, has a wide, paved path around its perimeter that can accommodate strollers, wheelchairs, toddlers who are still wobbly on their feet, bicyclists, dogs… you get the idea. Since this park is a peninsula, the path offers gorgeous views shifting from the north, east, and south as you complete the 2.4 mile trail.Roast marshmallows at Golden GardensFor a sandy swimming beach that’s less urban than Alki, head north past the Ballard neighborhood to Golden Gardens. Extremely popular on weekends, there are several fire pits available for beachside campfires in the evening. Roasting a marshmallow while watching the sun set behind the Olympics across Puget Sound is an experience every Seattleite should have at least once.Dive in at Madrona Park BeachThis Lake Washington park is tiny but mighty. On those hot summer days where you just can’t bear to be inside your greenhouse of an apartment (Seattle still hasn’t caught on to this whole “air conditioning” thing), jump in the lake at Madrona Beach to cool off. Friday afternoons can get a bit crowded, but you can’t beat the convenience. If you are the kind of swimmer who wears arm floaties and fears the deep unknown—don’t worry, there are lifeguards on duty here.Go trail running at Discovery ParkA Seattle classic, this enormous park in the Magnolia neighborhood is a favorite among joggers (I believe it’s jogging, or yogging. It might be a soft J, I’m not sure). Though usually spotted running solo or in small groups, on weekends you may find large herds doing a lap or two together on the 2.8 mile loop trail that winds through the forested park. Also make sure to stop by the lighthouse and enjoy the rocky beach.Picnic at Gasworks ParkIf there were an award for weirdest park, Gasworks would definitely win that award. Perched on the north end of Lake Union, it used to be an oil and gas refinery, and now hosts a spiral-shaped grassy hill and brightly painted leftover machinery to climb on. It’s a favorite picnic spot, as well as home to the 4 of July fireworks and Seafair festivities. Just don’t swim in the water here (remember what I said about the refinery?).Do yoga at the Olympic Sculpture ParkFor a mini break from the concrete jungle of downtown Seattle, walk north of Pike Place Market to the Sculpture Park, which is actually owned by the Seattle Art Museum. This long stretch of protected shoreline has many grassy areas and benches for getting your Seattleite introvert fix and reading a book (or napping) and odd sculptures that are up for personal interpretation.

Its modern turbines are shown here stretching toward the horizon.

(Links to preceding articles in the series are at the bottom of the article.) Amsterdam, The Netherlands — For the past nine years, a Dutch cooperative wind power project in North Holland has been stalled. Ironically, the project seems to fit perfectly with the renewable energy goals both of the nation and the city of Amsterdam, where the turbines would be sited.The difficulties of this citizen-based renewable energy effort indicate how, even in a city renowned for its progressive climate and energy policies, political opposition can stifle the growth of renewable energy. In turn, this renewable energy snafu illustrates the challenges that even prosperous, progressive European cities may face in attempting to achieve a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable power.Amsterdam’s Ambitious Climate GoalsWhen it comes to clean energy, Amsterdam and the Netherlands are not exactly on the same page. Amsterdam has an ambitious climate policy designed to reduce its carbon emissions 40 percent below its 1990 levels by 2025. By 2040, the city plans a 75 percent reduction in emissions compared with 1990.The Netherlands also would like to be regarded as a pacesetter in clean energy. In 2012, it adopted the Energy Agreement for Sustainable Growth. The Agreement proposed an energy strategy for the Netherlands that would lead to the development of a wholly sustainable energy supply by 2050. It was drafted by the country’s multi-stakeholder Social and Economic Council (SEC) which advises the Dutch government and Parliament on important social and economic issues. Progress under the Agreement, however, has been less than stellar. Political opposition to renewable energy by the center-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie [VVD]), at both national and provincial levels, has led to siting regulations that have hobbled would-be wind power developers in the province of North Holland and elsewhere in the Netherlands.The Agreement calls for the Netherlands to initially reduce the country’s final energy consumption by 1.5 percent per year and increase the proportion of energy obtained from renewable sources from 2.5 percent in 2005 to 14 percent by 2020 and 16 percent within another three years. The average EU target is 20 percent by 2020.“The Netherlands performs poorly when it comes to meeting the targets as agreed upon in the EU Directive Renewable Energy for 2020,” according to the Netherlands Statistical Bureau (CBS). The country now gets only 5.8 percent of its energy from renewables—less than half the way to its 2020 renewables goal, but after almostthree-quarters of the allotted time. Among European nations, “only France is further away from its national target,” CBS noted, and only Malta and Luxembourg get smaller percentage shares of their energy from renewables. Meanwhile, “one-third of European countries have already reached their agreed [EU] targets,” and countries like Denmark and Austria are only a percentage point away. Sweden, a star performer in renewable energy, already obtains 53 percent of its energy from renewables. Finland and Latvia are tied for second place in the EU at 39 percent. (Iceland gets more than 80 percent of its energy and 100 percent of its power from renewables, but is not in the EU.)Because the Netherlands is the EU’s largest natural gas producer, “nearly every house in the Netherlands is connected to the natural gas grid and gas is fairly cheap,” according to CBS. The country has little hydropower or biomass and national renewable energy subsidies are lower than in front-running countries like Denmark and Germany.Wind Projects Encounter Stiff Head WindsUnder the 2012 Energy Agreement for Sustainable Energy, the main mechanism for increasing the country’s share of renewable energy is the SDE+ or Sustainable Energy Incentive.The SDE+ guarantees renewable energy producers a minimum price for each unit of energy sold for an extended period of time. That makes for stable prices and a predictable long-term revenue stream, which in turn makes it easier to attract investment capital. But that hasn’t been enough to create a renewable energy gold rush, as in some other countries. To fulfill the Energy Agreement’s wind energy goals, the Netherlands was to scale up its offshore wind capacity from about 1,000 MW in 2011 to 4,450 MW by 2023. In addition, 6,000 MW of onshore wind was to be built by 2020. That is a relatively small amount of capacity for an industrialized nation: the 3,031 MW in place in 2015 avoided only 1.2 percent of the country’s fossil fuel use. The expansion of wind power in the Netherlands has not gone as rapidly or as smoothly as it might have. A premise of the 2012 national Energy Agreement was that local residents would be able to participate actively in the planning and operation of wind projects under the rules of their respective provinces. But in some provinces, many barriers stand in the way of wind power expansion.“If the experiences of citizen wind coops in North Holland are any indication, the Netherlands still needs to clear some major obstacles at the national and provincial levels that currently hinder the citizens of Amsterdam and elsewhere from achieving their clean energy goals.” Onze Energie and Windvogel Windvogel (Wind Bird in English) is a democratically run citizens’ wind energy coop of 3,300 members established in 1991, inspired by the environmental concerns expressed in the Club of Rome report.People can join Windvogel for as little as 50 euros and then become co-owners of the co-ops renewable energy projects. Members democratically help set co-op policy, including investment decisions and how to price wind energy projects. They also receive education, training, and information about renewable energy. Local chapters of Windvogel actively work for renewable energy in Amsterdam and six other Dutch cities as well as in several Dutch provinces. The emergence of renewable energy co-ops like Windvogel in the Netherlands is a natural offshoot of the country’s long tradition of citizen co-ops in agriculture and horticulture. Windvogel’s experience trying to create a new wind project in Amsterdam with other local wind co-ops, however, exemplifies the difficulties that citizens of the Netherlands have encountered in trying to help the nation meet its clean energy goals.Obstacles to ProgressSince its founding a quarter century ago, Windvogel has built or shared in the construction of just four wind turbines from 600 kW to 2 MW in size, plus two small turbines. All told, the co-op’s turbines produce approximately 7,600 megawatt-hours per year—enough power for about 2,500 households. Windvogel would like to build more wind turbines while increasing public support for renewable energy. The slow pace of the co-op’s progress, however, has nowhere been more apparent than in Amsterdam where the largest project Windvogel has been involved in still exists only on paper.That project was initiated in 2007 by a local, largely voluntary co-op called, “Onze Energie” (Our Energy) in cooperation with the City of Amsterdam. The group soon found how time-consuming the planning and political process for the development of wind energy in the Netherlands can be.Nine years of collaborative effort have since been expended in an attempt to gain financing and government approval for a wind project of just five new large wind turbines and an existing turbine in Amsterdam’s NDSM Wharf area. Onze Energie’s main partner in this venture is NDSM Energy. NDSM EnergyNDSM Energy is a four-year-old cooperative of companies doing business at Amsterdam’s NDSM Wharf on the site of the old NDSM shipyard in Amsterdam North. Its 60 members include multinationals as well as local businesses and artists.In addition to the wind project, NDSM has put solar PV panels on company roofs and is planning a large-scale solar park. “We hope to raise awareness and inspire as many people as possible to produce and use their energy in the most sustainable way,” said Keijen van Eijk, NDSM ’s Project Manager.Soon after its founding, NDSM Energy partnered with Onze Energie, providing new support for the project. Since 2012, NDSM Energy has led the wind project’s spatial planning and political process.In 2016, the NDSM-Onze Energie alliance was further broadened by affiliation with Amsterdam Wind, a newly formed collaboration of Windvogel, Zuiderlicht (Southern Lights), and Amsterdam Energie. Windvogel’s formal involvement in the project began at this time, according to van Eijk.Political Opposition In May 2016, NDSM Energy representing itself and the citizen co-op alliance, submitted a license application for its 15 MW wind project near the NDSM Wharf. If the application is successful, the project could supply enough power for thousands of Amsterdam households and all 400 companies on the NDSM Wharf. However, in addition to meeting national environmental regulations, the project, like other wind farms in North Holland, has to meet stringent and, some would say unnecessary, additional provincial statutory requirements.The Netherlands’ VVD Party traditionally is the largest party in the provincial government of North Holland. Before the elections of 2011, the VVD campaigned for a moratorium on land-based wind energy. When it won and formed a national coalition government, restrictions on wind energy became national policy until 2015.Under the 2012 Energy Agreement for Sustainable Energy, North Holland had been allocated a 2020 minimal target of 685.5 MW of onshore wind by 2020. After the VVD won the North Holland provincial elections in 2015, the province’s restrictive policy towards onshore wind was reaffirmed.Arcane Rules and RestrictionsThus the province of North Holland requires that wind farms must consist of a minimum of six turbines and that, for each new wind turbine installed, project developers must buy and retire two old turbines. In addition, the new turbines have to be sited at least 600 meters from residential areas, almost twice as far as national laws require.According to NDSM Energy’s Director Martijn Pater, in open rural landscapes the national legislation serves to prevent excessive encroachment of wind turbines on residences. In the city, however, in between the highways, industrial areas, and other types of dense and noisy development, “the rule doesn’t make any sense,” he contends. “The province actually limits the number of wind turbines that Dutch people can put in North Holland,” he said, with evident frustration. As mentioned, under the country’s Energy Agreement, the federal government is committed to having 6,000 megawatts of wind power on land in the Netherlands by 2020, divided among Holland’s 12 provinces.The province of North Holland was apportioned slightly over 11 percent of the total capacity because it is close to the coast and has more wind-generating capacity. “This [allocation] was by no means a cap,” said Pater.A Kafka-esque SituationHowever, when the VVD won control of the provincial government in 2011, “they actually promised the voters that they will put up as few wind turbines as possible. . . . They don’t believe in sustainable energy because it is heavily subsidized,” according to Pater.“The situation I’m in right now is almost Kafka-esque,” Pater said, “but it comes down to this: North Holland has to at least put up 685.5 megawatts of wind turbines.” But to make sure that no more than that capacity is installed, the province introduced three wind project permitting rules.Ironically, these rules are stricter than Dutch law to slow the implementation of wind power in a country that’s nominally interested in expanding its wind and solar power capacity to reduce its carbon emissions.The rule that turbines must be 600 meters from the nearest house, “created a problem for us,” Pater said, “because here where we are now in the industrial area, we are only 450 meters from houses, so [the wind project we want to build here] wouldn’t be complying with the provincial law.”The second provincial rule is that a wind project cannot consist of fewer than six turbines and is related to the third rule which requires taking down two old turbines to put a new one up. “So you have to find farmers or people in North Holland who already have wind farms and buy at least 12 old ones,” Pater said.What happens, Pater continued, “is that they basically organize themselves in a cartel,” in order to negotiate for ownership rights to the project. This can make project financing and management challenging.According to Pater, the province has blocked NDSM from building a turbine for which it had strong local support, a city permit, and federal subsidies. (The subsidy guarantees a floor price of €0.09 per kilowatt-hour for each kW-hr produced.) The turbine would have been the first of the six-turbine NDSM-Windvogel project. Four of the project’s turbines would be sited along a highway near NDSM, and two would be along the waterfront. Each turbine would be 3 MW in capacity for a total of 18 MW. “If we’re able to install them,” Pater said, “we’ll have enough electricity for 400 companies—26 million kilowatt-hours—and [13 million kilowatt-hours] for 6,000 households in North Amsterdam.”The new turbines will cost about €4,200,000 each and, at the guaranteed price of €0.09 per kW-hr, would earn about €585,000 per year and would generate about €100,000 in profit. Pater sees NDSM as a “sustainability laboratory.” “I think 75 percent [of the profits] will be invested in new renewable energy projects and education,” he projected. The remainder, minus operating costs, would be given back to the co-op member-investors, he indicated. “The whole idea is to invest and create a sustainable wharf,” he said. Seeking a WaiverNDSM, joined by the City of Amsterdam, took the provincial government to court last November. “We want the province to change its siting rules. . . . Are we creating the rules for the rules, or are we creating rules for the people?” Pater asked.According to NDSM’s van Eijk, “Technically, the province took the City of Amsterdam to court, by appealing the city’s decision to grant us a permit for the turbine, stating that it was the province’s [right] to grant permits for building wind turbines on provincial territory.”The Netherlands’ Council of State, the country’s highest administrative court, ruled in the province’s favor on the narrow jurisdictional issue but failed to weigh in on the merits of the province’s rules, as NDSM had hoped.Although Amsterdam Wind and NDSM cannot meet all the provincial statutory requirements, the co-ops have decided to seek an exemption from these regulations and apply for a license anyway, with the support of the Amsterdam city council, which owns the proposed project site. Alderman Abdelhuleb Choho of Amsterdam, in a letter of support to the provincial government, asserted that provincial support for local energy cooperatives would be consistent with the province’s own Energy Policy Agenda 2016–2020. Initiatives such as the proposed project are essential for a successful energy transition, he added, politely reminding the province that it has the authority to grant an exemption from provincial siting policies to a municipality.Specifically, the involvement of citizens and local businesses is important in meeting the state’s wind power targets, according to van Eijk. Revenues from the wind farm would also contribute to the economic sustainability of Amsterdam and would help fund other sustainable ventures, he pointed out.“Although politics and restrictive government policies can be a frustrating phenomenon,” van Eijk observed, “I think the bottom-up movement of citizens and businesses is here to stay and plays a crucial role in the energy transition. . . .”The Environment Department for the North Sea Canal Area is currently reviewing the Amsterdam Wind and NDSM application along with others, and the province expects to issue its first licenses in 2017.Perhaps that will be the year in which the protracted citizen-based campaign to expand cooperative wind power in Amsterdam triumphs over the formidable regulatory obstacles in its path. #–––––––––––––––––––Other articles in the Netherlands sustainability series include:‒ Netherlands Faces Climate Challenges and Struggles for Consensus‒ Sustainable Amsterdam, Part 1—An Ambitious Green Agenda- Sustainable Amsterdam, Part 2 — Mobilizing for a Clean, Sustainable Future‒ Sustainable Amsterdam, Part 3—Ambitious Electric Mobility, District Heating, and Circular Economy Goals- Sustainable Amsterdam, Part 4 — The Port Embarks on a Clean Energy Transition–––––––––––––––––––John J.

Amsterdam has an ambitious climate policy designed to reduce its carbon emissions 40 percent below its 1990 levels by 2025. By 2040, the city plans a 75 percent reduction in emissions compared with 1990.The Netherlands also would like to be regarded as a pacesetter in clean energy. In 2012, it adopted the Energy Agreement for Sustainable Growth. The Agreement proposed an energy strategy for the Netherlands that would lead to the development of a wholly sustainable energy supply by 2050. It was drafted by the country’s multi-stakeholder Social and Economic Council (SEC) which advises the Dutch government and Parliament on important social and economic issues. Progress under the Agreement, however, has been less than stellar. Political opposition to renewable energy by the center-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie [VVD]), at both national and provincial levels, has led to siting regulations that have hobbled would-be wind power developers in the province of North Holland and elsewhere in the Netherlands.The Agreement calls for the Netherlands to initially reduce the country’s final energy consumption by 1.5 percent per year and increase the proportion of energy obtained from renewable sources from 2.5 percent in 2005 to 14 percent by 2020 and 16 percent within another three years. The average EU target is 20 percent by 2020.“The Netherlands performs poorly when it comes to meeting the targets as agreed upon in the EU Directive Renewable Energy for 2020,” according to the Netherlands Statistical Bureau (CBS). The country now gets only 5.8 percent of its energy from renewables—less than half the way to its 2020 renewables goal, but after almostthree-quarters of the allotted time. Among European nations, “only France is further away from its national target,” CBS noted, and only Malta and Luxembourg get smaller percentage shares of their energy from renewables. Meanwhile, “one-third of European countries have already reached their agreed [EU] targets,” and countries like Denmark and Austria are only a percentage point away. Sweden, a star performer in renewable energy, already obtains 53 percent of its energy from renewables. Finland and Latvia are tied for second place in the EU at 39 percent. (Iceland gets more than 80 percent of its energy and 100 percent of its power from renewables, but is not in the EU.)Because the Netherlands is the EU’s largest natural gas producer, “nearly every house in the Netherlands is connected to the natural gas grid and gas is fairly cheap,” according to CBS. The country has little hydropower or biomass and national renewable energy subsidies are lower than in front-running countries like Denmark and Germany.Wind Projects Encounter Stiff Head WindsUnder the 2012 Energy Agreement for Sustainable Energy, the main mechanism for increasing the country’s share of renewable energy is the SDE+ or Sustainable Energy Incentive.The SDE+ guarantees renewable energy producers a minimum price for each unit of energy sold for an extended period of time. That makes for stable prices and a predictable long-term revenue stream, which in turn makes it easier to attract investment capital. But that hasn’t been enough to create a renewable energy gold rush, as in some other countries. To fulfill the Energy Agreement’s wind energy goals, the Netherlands was to scale up its offshore wind capacity from about 1,000 MW in 2011 to 4,450 MW by 2023. In addition, 6,000 MW of onshore wind was to be built by 2020. That is a relatively small amount of capacity for an industrialized nation: the 3,031 MW in place in 2015 avoided only 1.2 percent of the country’s fossil fuel use. The expansion of wind power in the Netherlands has not gone as rapidly or as smoothly as it might have. A premise of the 2012 national Energy Agreement was that local residents would be able to participate actively in the planning and operation of wind projects under the rules of their respective provinces. But in some provinces, many barriers stand in the way of wind power expansion.“If the experiences of citizen wind coops in North Holland are any indication, the Netherlands still needs to clear some major obstacles at the national and provincial levels that currently hinder the citizens of Amsterdam and elsewhere from achieving their clean energy goals.” Onze Energie and Windvogel Windvogel (Wind Bird in English) is a democratically run citizens’ wind energy coop of 3,300 members established in 1991, inspired by the environmental concerns expressed in the Club of Rome report.People can join Windvogel for as little as 50 euros and then become co-owners of the co-ops renewable energy projects. Members democratically help set co-op policy, including investment decisions and how to price wind energy projects. They also receive education, training, and information about renewable energy. Local chapters of Windvogel actively work for renewable energy in Amsterdam and six other Dutch cities as well as in several Dutch provinces. The emergence of renewable energy co-ops like Windvogel in the Netherlands is a natural offshoot of the country’s long tradition of citizen co-ops in agriculture and horticulture. Windvogel’s experience trying to create a new wind project in Amsterdam with other local wind co-ops, however, exemplifies the difficulties that citizens of the Netherlands have encountered in trying to help the nation meet its clean energy goals.Obstacles to ProgressSince its founding a quarter century ago, Windvogel has built or shared in the construction of just four wind turbines from 600 kW to 2 MW in size, plus two small turbines. All told, the co-op’s turbines produce approximately 7,600 megawatt-hours per year—enough power for about 2,500 households. Windvogel would like to build more wind turbines while increasing public support for renewable energy. The slow pace of the co-op’s progress, however, has nowhere been more apparent than in Amsterdam where the largest project Windvogel has been involved in still exists only on paper.That project was initiated in 2007 by a local, largely voluntary co-op called, “Onze Energie” (Our Energy) in cooperation with the City of Amsterdam. The group soon found how time-consuming the planning and political process for the development of wind energy in the Netherlands can be.Nine years of collaborative effort have since been expended in an attempt to gain financing and government approval for a wind project of just five new large wind turbines and an existing turbine in Amsterdam’s NDSM Wharf area. Onze Energie’s main partner in this venture is NDSM Energy. NDSM EnergyNDSM Energy is a four-year-old cooperative of companies doing business at Amsterdam’s NDSM Wharf on the site of the old NDSM shipyard in Amsterdam North. Its 60 members include multinationals as well as local businesses and artists.In addition to the wind project, NDSM has put solar PV panels on company roofs and is planning a large-scale solar park. “We hope to raise awareness and inspire as many people as possible to produce and use their energy in the most sustainable way,” said Keijen van Eijk, NDSM ’s Project Manager.Soon after its founding, NDSM Energy partnered with Onze Energie, providing new support for the project. Since 2012, NDSM Energy has led the wind project’s spatial planning and political process.In 2016, the NDSM-Onze Energie alliance was further broadened by affiliation with Amsterdam Wind, a newly formed collaboration of Windvogel, Zuiderlicht (Southern Lights), and Amsterdam Energie. Windvogel’s formal involvement in the project began at this time, according to van Eijk.Political Opposition In May 2016, NDSM Energy representing itself and the citizen co-op alliance, submitted a license application for its 15 MW wind project near the NDSM Wharf. If the application is successful, the project could supply enough power for thousands of Amsterdam households and all 400 companies on the NDSM Wharf. However, in addition to meeting national environmental regulations, the project, like other wind farms in North Holland, has to meet stringent and, some would say unnecessary, additional provincial statutory requirements.The Netherlands’ VVD Party traditionally is the largest party in the provincial government of North Holland. Before the elections of 2011, the VVD campaigned for a moratorium on land-based wind energy. When it won and formed a national coalition government, restrictions on wind energy became national policy until 2015.Under the 2012 Energy Agreement for Sustainable Energy, North Holland had been allocated a 2020 minimal target of 685.5 MW of onshore wind by 2020. After the VVD won the North Holland provincial elections in 2015, the province’s restrictive policy towards onshore wind was reaffirmed.Arcane Rules and RestrictionsThus the province of North Holland requires that wind farms must consist of a minimum of six turbines and that, for each new wind turbine installed, project developers must buy and retire two old turbines. In addition, the new turbines have to be sited at least 600 meters from residential areas, almost twice as far as national laws require.According to NDSM Energy’s Director Martijn Pater, in open rural landscapes the national legislation serves to prevent excessive encroachment of wind turbines on residences. In the city, however, in between the highways, industrial areas, and other types of dense and noisy development, “the rule doesn’t make any sense,” he contends. “The province actually limits the number of wind turbines that Dutch people can put in North Holland,” he said, with evident frustration. As mentioned, under the country’s Energy Agreement, the federal government is committed to having 6,000 megawatts of wind power on land in the Netherlands by 2020, divided among Holland’s 12 provinces.The province of North Holland was apportioned slightly over 11 percent of the total capacity because it is close to the coast and has more wind-generating capacity. “This [allocation] was by no means a cap,” said Pater.A Kafka-esque SituationHowever, when the VVD won control of the provincial government in 2011, “they actually promised the voters that they will put up as few wind turbines as possible. . . . They don’t believe in sustainable energy because it is heavily subsidized,” according to Pater.“The situation I’m in right now is almost Kafka-esque,” Pater said, “but it comes down to this: North Holland has to at least put up 685.5 megawatts of wind turbines.” But to make sure that no more than that capacity is installed, the province introduced three wind project permitting rules.Ironically, these rules are stricter than Dutch law to slow the implementation of wind power in a country that’s nominally interested in expanding its wind and solar power capacity to reduce its carbon emissions.The rule that turbines must be 600 meters from the nearest house, “created a problem for us,” Pater said, “because here where we are now in the industrial area, we are only 450 meters from houses, so [the wind project we want to build here] wouldn’t be complying with the provincial law.”The second provincial rule is that a wind project cannot consist of fewer than six turbines and is related to the third rule which requires taking down two old turbines to put a new one up. “So you have to find farmers or people in North Holland who already have wind farms and buy at least 12 old ones,” Pater said.What happens, Pater continued, “is that they basically organize themselves in a cartel,” in order to negotiate for ownership rights to the project. This can make project financing and management challenging.According to Pater, the province has blocked NDSM from building a turbine for which it had strong local support, a city permit, and federal subsidies. (The subsidy guarantees a floor price of €0.09 per kilowatt-hour for each kW-hr produced.) The turbine would have been the first of the six-turbine NDSM-Windvogel project. Four of the project’s turbines would be sited along a highway near NDSM, and two would be along the waterfront. Each turbine would be 3 MW in capacity for a total of 18 MW. “If we’re able to install them,” Pater said, “we’ll have enough electricity for 400 companies—26 million kilowatt-hours—and [13 million kilowatt-hours] for 6,000 households in North Amsterdam.”The new turbines will cost about €4,200,000 each and, at the guaranteed price of €0.09 per kW-hr, would earn about €585,000 per year and would generate about €100,000 in profit. Pater sees NDSM as a “sustainability laboratory.” “I think 75 percent [of the profits] will be invested in new renewable energy projects and education,” he projected. The remainder, minus operating costs, would be given back to the co-op member-investors, he indicated. “The whole idea is to invest and create a sustainable wharf,” he said. Seeking a WaiverNDSM, joined by the City of Amsterdam, took the provincial government to court last November. “We want the province to change its siting rules. . . . Are we creating the rules for the rules, or are we creating rules for the people?” Pater asked.According to NDSM’s van Eijk, “Technically, the province took the City of Amsterdam to court, by appealing the city’s decision to grant us a permit for the turbine, stating that it was the province’s [right] to grant permits for building wind turbines on provincial territory.”The Netherlands’ Council of State, the country’s highest administrative court, ruled in the province’s favor on the narrow jurisdictional issue but failed to weigh in on the merits of the province’s rules, as NDSM had hoped.Although Amsterdam Wind and NDSM cannot meet all the provincial statutory requirements, the co-ops have decided to seek an exemption from these regulations and apply for a license anyway, with the support of the Amsterdam city council, which owns the proposed project site. Alderman Abdelhuleb Choho of Amsterdam, in a letter of support to the provincial government, asserted that provincial support for local energy cooperatives would be consistent with the province’s own Energy Policy Agenda 2016–2020. Initiatives such as the proposed project are essential for a successful energy transition, he added, politely reminding the province that it has the authority to grant an exemption from provincial siting policies to a municipality.Specifically, the involvement of citizens and local businesses is important in meeting the state’s wind power targets, according to van Eijk. Revenues from the wind farm would also contribute to the economic sustainability of Amsterdam and would help fund other sustainable ventures, he pointed out.“Although politics and restrictive government policies can be a frustrating phenomenon,” van Eijk observed, “I think the bottom-up movement of citizens and businesses is here to stay and plays a crucial role in the energy transition. . . .”The Environment Department for the North Sea Canal Area is currently reviewing the Amsterdam Wind and NDSM application along with others, and the province expects to issue its first licenses in 2017.Perhaps that will be the year in which the protracted citizen-based campaign to expand cooperative wind power in Amsterdam triumphs over the formidable regulatory obstacles in its path. #–––––––––––––––––––Other articles in the Netherlands sustainability series include:‒ Netherlands Faces Climate Challenges and Struggles for Consensus‒ Sustainable Amsterdam, Part 1—An Ambitious Green Agenda- Sustainable Amsterdam, Part 2 — Mobilizing for a Clean, Sustainable Future‒ Sustainable Amsterdam, Part 3—Ambitious Electric Mobility, District Heating, and Circular Economy Goals- Sustainable Amsterdam, Part 4 — The Port Embarks on a Clean Energy Transition–––––––––––––––––––John J.

The campaign says that it has raised about $64 million through digital and direct mail operations with support from the RNC. These tend to be donations of under $200, so nearly all of that money is likely headed to Trump campaign coffers. The campaign further stated that the businessman raised $16 million in larger donations for both his campaign, the RNC and a handful of state parties.“We are extremely proud of our 69 percent growth in small dollar donations which shows the broad based support of over one million donors across America. Our volunteers and contributors are clearly committed to electing Donald J. Trump as President in November,” said Trump campaign finance chairman Steven Mnuchin in a statement.The real estate mogul personally donated $2 million of his own money in July, according to the campaign. Trump will match small donations up to $2 million, his team said. The press release goes out of its way to mention that Trump’s contributions exceed the amount the campaign spent on companies, properties and vehicles owned by the candidate himself. “His contributions for the month far surpass the FEC required reimbursements to his related entities, i.e., airplane, Trump properties and the like,” it reads. This may be an attempt to assuage donors of concerns that Trump is using their money to line his own pockets.The Republican presidential nominee had $37 million on hand at the beginning of August in his campaign account and another $37 million available in two joint fundraising committees.Trump’s total fundraising still trails that of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She raised $90 million in conjunction with the Democratic National Committee and a number of state parties. Of that total, $63 million went to her campaign and $26 million went to the DNC and the state parties. In this respect, it is possible that the Trump campaign actually out-raised Clinton.This was the second full month that Trump spent raising money from donors. He raised $51 million in June, after entering the month with only $1.3 million cash on hand.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

The virus has spread rapidly through the Americas and Caribbean and its arrival in the continental United States has been widely anticipated.Florida health officials announced another non-travel related case of Zika on Tuesday, bringing the total to 15.The aerial spraying campaign was recommended by the CDC in conjunction with the Florida Health Department to reduce adult mosquito populations that might be capable of carrying the Zika virus.In a conference call on Tuesday, CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden expressed concern that vector control efforts so far have not been as effective as hoped. A CDC expert is currently conducting tests in Miami to see if mosquitoes in the area have developed insecticide resistance.Florida had been using two products in the pyrethroid class of insecticides. In its aerial campaign, the state will use a chemical called Naled that has been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, according to Joseph Conlon, a spokesman for the American Mosquito Control Association.Naled is from a different class of insecticides known as organophosphates. According to the CDC, the chemical has been widely used to control mosquito populations in the United States, including in Miami, Tampa and New Orleans.The CDC recommended the same chemical for aerial spraying in Puerto Rico, but the recommendation has been met with protests from residents concerned about its impact on health, bees, agriculture and the environment.Miami-Dade health officials said residents do not need to take special precautions during the aerial spraying activities, but it has recommended that people with known allergies remain indoors.

Charlie Baker (R) this week, job interviewers in the state can no longer ask applicants how much money they make.That’s just one piece of the law, hailed as groundbreaking by the academics, policy wonks and politicians who are fighting to close the persistent gulf between what men and women earn in the United States. Its passage, pushed through by both Republicans and Democrats, is a strong sign of the growing economic and political clout of working women, who are increasingly the sole or primary breadwinners for their families.The law is also an indication that the equal pay issue is moving front-and-center into the national conversation. “The hope is that the bipartisan law will help spark change at the federal level,” Amy Traub, a senior policy analyst at Demos said. “There’s more energy behind these issues.”Hillary Clinton, who’s been outspoken on equal pay, applauded the law Tuesday night. Donald Trump’s campaign did not respond to HuffPost’s questions about the new policy. Massachusetts was first on equal pay more than 70 years ago, passing the country’s first law prohibiting employers from paying women less than men for the same work in 1945. The federal government didn’t pass anything until 1963.Hopefully, this time around, it won’t take nearly 20 years for the feds to follow the lead. There are currently two bills kicking around Congress that seek to strengthen equal pay policy.“This law is much stronger and goes farther than [other equal pay laws],” Vivien Labaton, a co-founder of nonprofit group Make It Work, which focuses on economic security for women and families, told The Huffington Post. “It’s a big deal.”Massachusetts’ law is the first to prohibit the salary question ― a pretty standard interview ask.Proponents say forbidding the question will mean that women won’t have to drag around their low salary from job to job anymore. If you’ve been interviewed for a position, you probably know the stress that question can bring on. If you’re underpaid in your current role, you don’t want your next employer to lowball you. If you’re overpaid (should we all be so lucky) you don’t want to take yourself out of the running.How it usually would work is: The interviewer would say, what are you making now? You’d say $25,000 ― even though you know you’re being underpaid and feel like you maybe could double your pay at the new company. Oh well, your employer hears your number and winds up only offering you a 10 to 15 percent bump on your current income. The cycle of low pay goes on.The law still allows applicants to reveal their pay during the negotiating process.“It’s a question that plagues people,” said Deborah Kolb, a professor emerita at Simmons College who advises many top female executives on their careers and is the author of “Negotiating at Work.” It’s particularly agonizing for women who are changing careers ― going from, say, a position in government to the private sector, Kolb said. Don’t answer the question, if at all possible, she advises. You can try to say something like, I expect to be paid fairly or turn it around and ask the interviewer what the range is for the position. That’s harder though if the question is posed in an online application, which is common.The question prohibition is just one piece of Massachusetts’ new law. The state has also expanded the definition of equal work, emphasizing that women should be paid the same as men for “comparable” work, defined in the legislation as “work that is substantially similar in that it requires substantially similar skill, effort and responsibility and is performed under similar working conditions.”That could mean a female cafeteria worker at a company could not be underpaid relative to a male janitorial worker. Or the woman who runs the style section of a newspaper could not be underpaid relative to the man who runs the investing section. Employers still can vary pay based on seniority, merit, productivity, education, training, cost of living or travel, the law makes clear.The legislation also goes far in encouraging workers to tell each other how much money they make, regarded as a key component of pay fairness. It’s not always easy to know if you’re underpaid; it helps when you can ask the guy next to you what he makes.When the legislation goes into effect in 2018, companies will be prohibited from retaliating against workers who openly discuss their salaries.If the law’s preventive aspects fail workers, Massachusetts has also removed procedural hurdles to filing complaints. The state’s current equal pay legislation only allowed you 300 days to file a complaint if you felt you were paid unfairly. Now you’ll get three years. Other procedural hurdles have also been lifted.Though Massachusetts was a first mover in pay equity, it’s unclear if the old law as written was effective. Since the 1970s, only 50 cases in the state have even cited it, noted Amanda Baer, an employment lawyer in Westborough, Massachusetts. She said since its passage, employers in the state have reached out to talk about how they should tweak their hiring process to avoid the salary question.Pay unfairness is notoriously tough to prove. A massive group of female Walmart workers famously lost their fight for pay equity at the Supreme Court because it was ruled that their complaints were too different for the women to constitute a clear class with standing to sue.Lilly Ledbetter, who found out she was being paid far less for years at Goodyear Tire, lost her case at the Supreme Court because the court ruled that under the law she only had 180 days to file her claim after the first instance of unfair pay. Ledbetter found out she was being paid unfairly after years. The federal law was updated after she lost her case.Women are on average paid only 79 percent of what men make in the United States for a complex stew of reasons, from straight-up discrimination to differences in career choices and more. In Massachusetts the number is slightly higher, women earn 82 cents for every dollar a man makes. But African-American women earn only 61 cents on the dollar and Latinas 50 cents.Women in the state lose out on $11 billion a year because of the pay inequity in the state, according to research from the National Partnership for Women and Families. In tangible terms, that would mean 85 more weeks of food for a woman’s family, six more months of mortgage and utility payments or more than 10 more months of rent.Fair pay wouldn’t just boost the economy it would lift up the millions of families that rely on a woman as a primary or secondary provider.“Even though equal pay is described as a ‘women’s issue’ it is core to the economic stability of millions of families in this country,” Labaton said. Laws like Massachusetts’ don’t quite address all of the factors that contribute to pay inequality: women still wind up taking more time away from the workforce for child-rearing and elder-care. And unconscious bias still holds us back from getting promotions or more mission-critical roles. Still, the march to progress moves forward. "

Miami police officers are giving out bug spray to homeless residents in Wynwood, Miami, according to ABC News, an area where the first cases of locally transmitted cases of Zika in the U.S. were identified. At least 15 residents have been infected by mosquitoes locally, Reuters reported, and health officials have located the area just north of downtown Miami ― which includes Wynwood ― as the epicenter of Zika transmission in the state.U.S. health officials have warned for months that the summer mosquito season might bring outbreaks in Gulf states such as Florida. Authorities hope to curb the spread of the virus, which can cause birth defects in newborns and homeless people who live outdoors are particularly susceptible. The Miami Police Department distributed 50 cans of bug repellent on Tuesday, according to ABC, one to each homeless resident they came across in Wynwood, and left any extras at the Miami Rescue Shelter.There were 4,152 homeless residents in Miami-Dade County last year and 35,964 statewide, according to Florida’s Council on Homelessness.In some areas of Florida, at least 90 percent of homeless individuals were unsheltered last year, according to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. While in most cases, Zika only causes mild symptoms, such as fever or rash, for pregnant women the outcomes can be severe. The virus has been found to cause birth defects in newborns, including microcephaly, which can lead to intellectual disabilities in children.This isn’t the first initiative to protect Florida’s homeless from Zika.

(Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge refused on Tuesday to allow Sports Authority to pay up to $2.85 million in bonuses to four executives for overseeing the winding down of the national sporting goods chain.Englewood, Colorado-based Sports Authority filed for bankruptcy in March with hopes of keeping some of its 464 stores open, but battles among lenders and suppliers eventually scuttled those plans. Its final stores closed last month.“I think it’s just inappropriate to pay senior executives a bonus when all the employees are losing their jobs,” said Judge Mary Walrath during a hearing in Wilmington, Delaware.Sports Authority said the bonuses were essential to ensure executives squeeze the most value out of its assets by adhering to a budget and preventing waste.The company asked to keep the identities of the executives under seal to “minimize detrimental impacts on employee morale,” which prompted an outcry from some of the 14,000 former staffers.“I’m not surprised the employees are sending angry emails about it,” said Walrath. Bankrupt companies often get court approval to make special bonus payments to top executives for hitting performance targets designed to maximize value for creditors.The payments are routinely opposed by the U.S. Trustee, which is the government’s bankruptcy watchdog, and by unions, particularly when aspects of the bonus programs are filed under seal.Last year, judges rejected bonus plans from both Molycorp Inc, a producer of rare earth materials, and GT Advanced Technologies Inc, which developed mobile device screens for Apple Inc.Also on Tuesday, Walrath approved a settlement among Sports Authority, its lenders and creditors over the division of the remaining cash and legal claims.Under the deal, landlords would get most of their unpaid rent that accrued during the bankruptcy, and the lenders would give up claims they could have pursued against suppliers and other unsecured creditors.Unsecured creditors agreed to drop their request to convert the case to a Chapter 7 liquidation.The largest U.S. sporting goods retailer, Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc, acquired the SportsAuthority name and other intellectual property at a June auction.(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)"

But researchers have cautioned against relying too heavily on that figure to indicate trends in suicides because it does not take into account that the overall number of veterans is declining because of deaths from old age.For the first time, a study of veteran suicides drew from 55 million veterans’ records from 1979 to 2014 and from every U.S. state, the report said. Previous studies were more limited in scope and drew from three million records from 20 states or from records of those using veterans health services.The study found that between 2001 and 2014, veteran suicides increased by 32 percent, while civilian suicides increased by 23 percent in the same time period. After controlling for factors like age and gender, this meant veterans faced a 21 percent greater risk for suicide than those who had not served in the armed forces.The report did not provide numbers associated with the percentages it recorded and a department representative could not immediately be reached to provide more information.While the suicide rate was highest among younger veterans, aged 18 to 29, most veteran suicides - 65 percent - in 2014 were among those 50 or older..The study found sharp differences between the suicide rates of those veterans who used VA services compared to those who did not, though it did not draw conclusions about why. Of an estimated 21.6 million veterans in the United States, about 8.5 million receive VA health services, the report said.Suicide rates for male veterans who used VA services increased by 11 percent since 2001, compared to a 35 percent increase among those who did not. That contrast was even sharper for female veterans. The rate of suicide among female veterans since 2001 increased 4.6 percent for those who used VA services, and increased 98 percent for those female veterans who did not.As a whole, the risk of suicide among female veterans was 2.4 times higher than among civilian women in 2014, the study found. By contrast, male veterans faced an 18 percent higher risk for suicide than their civilian counterparts in 2014.(Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati; editing by Grant McCool)"

30,POLITICS,Ivanka Is Not Donald's Trump Card With Young Women,Samantha Neal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivanka-donald-trump-women-voters_us_57a20bc7e4b0e1aac9140781,Polling shows they aren't all that enthusiastic about her.,2016-08-03,Ivanka Trump is not winning over young female voters — a demographic Donald Trump struggles with — as well as the campaign would have hoped.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a20c972a0000fa01fb46d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ivanka Trump ― former model, vice president of development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization, creator of a self-titled clothing brand, and founder of the #WomenWhoWork initiative ― is considered by some campaign insiders her father’s single greatest asset in winning over young female voters.But Ivanka herself isn’t all that popular with her intended targets. Only 28 percent of women ages 18 to 34 say they have a favorable view of her, while 42 percent have an unfavorable view, according to a recent Cosmopolitan/Morning Consult poll.She’s better liked among millennial men and older women. According to the survey, 42 percent of men ages 18-34 have a favorable view of her, while 36 percent have an unfavorable view. Among women over the age of 65, 67 percent have a positive impression.On the whole, less than half of all registered voters have a favorable view of Ivanka.Perhaps part of the problem is a disconnect between Ivanka’s message and her father’s words.Of the four adult Trump children who spoke at the Republican National Convention, Ivanka was given the most prominent speaking slot, introducing her father before his acceptance speech. Her address portrayed her father as a purveyor of women’s issues, one who strongly supports equal opportunity in the workplace.“He is color-blind and gender-neutral,” Ivanka said. “Women are paid equally for the work that we do. ... As president, my father will change the labor laws that were put into place at a time when women were not a significant portion of the workforce.”That pronouncement came as something of a surprise in light of Donald Trump’s actual rhetoric on women’s issues. The GOP nominee has said little, if anything, on the campaign trail to back up his daughter’s remarks.To many observers, Ivanka’s speech sounded more Democratic than Republican. ABC political director Rick Klein tweeted, “Is there anything Ivanka Trump has said tonight that wouldn’t be cheered at a DNC?”Indeed, not once in the 58 pages of the 2016 Republican platform does the word “gender” appear. Nor do the terms “wage gap,” “equal pay” or “inequality.” There are no provisions on gender equality or policy prescriptions for equal pay. The 2016 Democratic platform, in stark contrast, uses the word “gender” 19 times. An entire chapter is dedicated to the “Fight for Economic Fairness and Against Inequality,” with a separate subsection on “Guaranteeing Women’s Rights.”Ivanka’s failure to connect with young female voters might also be a reflection of her father’s own trouble with women. Only 29 percent of women say they have a “favorable” impression of Donald Trump, while almost 7 in 10 have an “unfavorable” one, according to an Economist/YouGov poll.The Republican nominee has been criticized recently for his response to the sexual harassment scandal surrounding former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes. Trump called it “very sad” that women are coming out against Ailes. This prompted one USA Today reporter to ask: What if someone had treated Ivanka the way Ailes allegedly treated these other women?“I would like to think she would find another career or find another company if that was the case,” Trump responded.But most women lack the financial resources that Ivanka has and can’t simply quit their jobs. More importantly, a woman who has faced sexual harassment should not be expected to “find another career” ― because she did nothing wrong. It’s the harasser who should suffer the consequences.Brother Eric Trump jumped into the fray with an equally misguided response, shifting the blame for sexual harassment onto the victim. “Ivanka is a strong, powerful woman,” he said. “She wouldn’t allow herself to be subjected to it.”Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly captured the absurdity of the younger Trump’s reply:The Cosmopolitan/Morning Consult survey of nearly 3,000 registered voters nationwide was conducted July 22-24. Respondents were reached online and the data were weighed to approximate a target sample of registered voters based on age, race/ethnicity, gender, educational attainment, region, annual household income, home ownership status and marital status. Results have a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points."

33,POLITICS,"Yeah, GOP Can Replace Trump -- If He Quits",S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-dropout-rules_us_57a2643ae4b04414d1f372ad,"Under their rules, Republicans are stuck with their nominee unless they talk him into dropping out.",2016-08-03,"Facing mounting criticism from his own party to fix his campaign, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump traveled to Daytona Beach for a rally and did succeed in finishing his remarks without mentioning the family of an Army soldier who died in Iraq.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a264dc2a00000002fb4889.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Just a few pages into the Republican National Committee rulebook is some good news for officials horrified by Donald Trump’s latest meltdown: It’s not too late to replace him on the November ballot.Now the bad news: Trump would have to quit on his own. His official nomination last month in Cleveland leaves the party no way to remove him.So far, there is little indication that Trump might consider dropping out. “The campaign is in very good shape,” his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, told Fox News Wednesday, the day after multiple reports of his increasing frustration with Trump’s antics.“Nobody expects this to happen,” agreed one top RNC member on the condition of anonymity. “This is dog days of August silliness.”Nevertheless ― and just in case ― top party officials have researched the process for replacing Trump, should he decide he’s had enough. That Republicans are even bothering to bone up on the rules for such a contingency illustrates how badly the developer-turned-reality TV star’s campaign has gone recently.“Rule 9” of the party rulebook specifically addresses the filling of vacancies on the presidential ticket, and gives the power to the 168 RNC members ― three from each state and territory. The RNC could, if it chooses, hold another convention ― but that’s considered highly unlikely, given the time constraints.“It takes us two years to put on a convention,” the RNC member said. “It would be a nightmare.”The alternative is for the RNC to pick a replacement nominee on its own, with each state getting the same number of votes as it had delegates to the Cleveland convention last month. Texas’ three members, for example, would cast a total of 155 votes; Vermont’s three members would cast 16 votes.For weeks following the May 3 Indiana primary, where Trump’s victory led his remaining rivals to drop out, RNC leaders have promised other Republican candidates, donors and the public that the party was already uniting behind Trump. The party convention, they predicted, would further unify the party to start the general election campaign against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.That failed to happen. A number of Trump’s primary foes would not even attend the convention, including the host state governor, John Kasich. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who did attend, used his prime-time speaking slot not to endorse Trump, but to urge delegates to vote their conscience ― which happened to be the rallying cry for the anti-Trump contingent who had been trying to strip Trump of the nomination.The subsequent Democratic convention, apart from featuring a well-choreographed program that pummeled Trump as an unqualified menace, also hosted the Muslim parents of an Army captain who died in Iraq in 2004. The father, Khizr Khan, tore into Trump for his proposed ban on letting Muslims into the country and then offered to lend Trump his copy of the U.S. Constitution.Trump reacted with a series of insults against the Khans. He suggested Ghazala Khan hadn’t been permitted to speak because of their religion, and then complained that Khizr Khan had unfairly attacked him. Trump in the days that followed began claiming that the November election was already “rigged” against him, and broadened his attacks to include Republican officeholders, including New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Arizona Sen. John McCain and House Speaker Paul Ryan ― all the while continuing his complaints about the Khans. In a Fox News appearance Tuesday night, Trump said Khizr Khan had “viciously attacked” him from the DNC stage five times in a matter of several minutes.On Wednesday, Trump did get through a rally in Daytona Beach, Florida, without mentioning the Khan family, suggesting Manafort or other aides successfully conveyed to Trump the seriousness of the party’s discontent.How long Trump can go without getting back into trouble is an open question. “His complete lack of focus and discipline, and the ADD that has brought him to his place is not something that can be solved overnight,” said one White House aide privately, who added that his behavior has given Clinton’s team a huge advantage. “The Democratic political world has seen how he responds to attacks. It’s pretty clear that they can get in his head anytime they want.”He said, though, that he doubted that Trump would actually quit: “It’s not his way to either apologize or give up.”Still, for Republicans who wished Trump had never run in the first place, his leaving the race remains a nice fantasy. “I think there’s still a group that is wishing this is just a dream and they’ll wake up and Marco Rubio or Scott Walker will actually be the guy,” said Utah convention delegate Boyd Matheson, a Cruz supporter.Matheson acknowledged that a Trump resignation would create its own set of problems ― not the least of which would be who the RNC would choose to replace him, and whether that person would be a caretaker whose job would be to avoid causing the party further damage, or whether there would be a serious attempt at winning the presidency.“It might be a Paul Ryan moment,” Matheson said. “Maybe we’ll capture lightning.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
34,POLITICS,Health Secretary Details How Congress Is Screwing Over Americans Who Get Zika,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-secretary-zika-sylvia-burwell_us_57a24245e4b0104052a10092,"Failing to fund a response means less tracking, less understanding, slower creation of a vaccine and more people infected.",2016-08-03,"Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell urged lawmakers to approve emergency Zika funding ""to mount the full and timely response to the Zika virus that the American people deserve.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a247682a0000fa01fb480b.jpeg?cache=PyOL3W7Vm3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell delivered a letter to key lawmakers on Wednesday that explained exactly how their underfunded response to the Zika virus is screwing Americans over.President Barack Obama asked Congress for $1.9 billion in February to deal with the impending outbreak of Zika in the United States. Congress finally began working on the request in May, with the Senate passing a bipartisan compromise that was about $800 million short.The bill got tanked in a partisan squabble last month after Republicans decided to add in contraception restrictions, a pro-Confederate flag provision, extra cuts to Obamacare, and a measure to exempt pesticides from the Clean Water Act, even though those pesticides don’t target Zika-carrying mosquitoes.They then departed for a seven-week break while sending a sternly worded letter to Obama, saying he should take aggressive action to battle Zika using the $589 million the administration transferred from other programs, taken primarily from the ongoing Ebola response. GOP lawmakers have also complained recently that the money is not being spent quickly enough, with nearly two-thirds still available.Wednesday, Burwell detailed how that money is being spent, and how key programs actually will run dry this month if Congress does not act.“Now that the United States is in the height of mosquito season and with the progress in developing a Zika vaccine, the need for additional resources is critical,” she wrote to the top members of the appropriations committees in the House and Senate. “Without additional funding as requested in the President’s request for an emergency supplemental, our nation’s ability to effectively respond to Zika will be impaired.”The programs that will be the most immediately affected include efforts to develop vaccines and better diagnostic tools, Burwell said, echoing warnings issued Monday by the administration.She also said that efforts to track and control the spread of the disease and virus-carrying mosquitoes, as well as to understand Zika’s impact on mothers and babies, would all be hampered.Money that has not yet been spent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be gone by the end of September, the end of the fiscal year, Burwell said. That’s when many Republicans have said they’d be willing to earmark new Zika funding.Burwell did hint that she was looking at additional ways to manipulate funding streams.“In regards to the immediate needs that [the National Institutes of Health] and [Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority] face, I am evaluating all options in order to avoid delaying the development of a Zika vaccine,” she said. “At the same time, I want to urge you to work with your leadership to develop a bipartisan bill that will allow us to mount the full and timely response to the Zika virus that the American people deserve.”Republican leaders in both chambers have refused to reopen talks on the Zika bill. Spokespeople for both House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) both said in a response to Burwell that the Democrats were to blame for objecting to the partisan riders that Republicans attached to the Zika bill.Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee who would likely lead any new efforts to pass a clean Zika funding bill, also blamed Democrats, saying there was nothing wrong with the GOP-crafted bills. “Zika is a dangerous disease and the risk it poses continues to grow. We must do what we can to fight it and prevent its spread,” Rogers said in a statement. “That is why twice now the House has passed comprehensive and responsible funding legislation to provide resources for Zika response and prevention. We continue to call on the Senate to approve this funding, so that these dollars can be used immediately to stop this devastating epidemic.”At least 14 people have now contracted Zika in Miami, and federal health officials have taken the unprecedented step of warning pregnant women not to visit the area.

On Tuesday morning, Eric Trump echoed his father’s sentiments about Carlson’s lawsuit against Roger Ailes. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told USA Today that he was skeptical about Carlson’s sexual harassment allegations, and that a woman (like his daughter, Ivanka) “would find another career or find another company,” rather than subject herself to harassment. Eric clarified his father’s statement, telling “CBS This Morning”:“I think what he’s saying is, Ivanka is a strong, powerful woman, she wouldn’t allow herself to be objected [sic] to it, and by the way, you should take it up with Human Resources, and I think she would, as a strong person; at the same time, I don’t think she would allow herself to be subjected to that. I think that’s a point he was making, and I think he did so well.”The comments have (rightfully) come under fire for putting the onus on a woman to report sexual harassment or leave a job because of it, rather than acknowledge that men need to simply stop harassing women in the workplace. On Tuesday morning, Carlson responded on Twitter:Being “strong” will not minimize the likelihood a woman will be victimized in the workplace, and choosing to stay with in a job or profession even if you’re being harassed by no means makes a woman weak. Even more, taking on a lawsuit against one of the media industry’s most powerful men sounds like a herculean task ― so it doesn’t seem like strength is something that Carlson is lacking. "
36,QUEER VOICES,Gay Congressman Warns Of Donald Trump's Danger To LGBT Rights,Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sean-patrick-maloney-donald-trump-lgbt_us_57a16235e4b08a8e8b600cb1,"""Trump will repeal the president's executive orders.""",2016-08-03,“He’s told us who he’s going to appoint and they will eviscerate all of the rights we’ve won at the Supreme Court.”,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a21fbf2a00002d004f8210.jpeg?cache=h7bgABOYXL&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Look no further than the folks he wants to put on the Supreme Court,” Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney warned about Donald Trump and LGBT rights in an interview with me on SiriusXM Progress at the Democratic National Convention last week in Philadelphia. “He’s told us who he’s going to appoint, and they will eviscerate all of the rights we’ve won at the Supreme Court.”Maloney, an openly gay Democratic member of Congress from upstate New York, has been battling with GOP House members in recent months over attempts to repeal President Obama’s executive order banning workplace discrimination against LGBT people among federal contractors.“[Trump] will repeal the president’s executive orders,” he said, noting that a new president can do so without Congress passing any legislation. “Those federal contractors employ 28 million Americans. So this is significant workplace protection for a large part of the American workforce – those are gone [under Trump]. All of the other things the president has done over the last 8 years, not just on our rights but really everything else, from health care to the climate change action, to the immigration issue we all care about as well – all of that stuff is out the window.”Maloney sounded the alarm for LGBT people who might not see the stark contrast between Trump, who has portrayed himself as a friend to LGBT people though his positions are anti-LGBT, and Hillary Clinton.“We are talking about a very dramatic fork in the road here,” he said. “And for those of us who have maybe gotten a little complacent with all the progress we’ve made: Look, we don’t have any workplace protections in 29 American states. You could be fired for being LGBT any day of the week. There is no legal recourse. So it is very important that we get legislation on the federal level. But here’s the good news: There is a majority even in the Republican-controlled House for LGBT equality. What they’re doing now is they’re rigging the process so we can’t get votes.”“If you have Hillary Clinton in the White House,” Maloney continued, “and you get more Democrats in the House and we take the Senate, they’re not going to be able to rig that process. We actually have the votes and what we showed is that you can’t bring this anti-gay stuff on the floor anymore and get away with it. And so, they’ve had to retreat into this rigging the process, where they won’t let us have amendments. They won’t let us have votes because they know we’re going to win on them. With a fair vote we can pass the Equality Act. We can protect people in their workplaces. We can make sure you don’t get discriminated against in housing, accommodations and restaurants and the rest. Just as we’ve had in the civil rights context.”None of that, however, will happen, Maloney underscored, if Donald Trump gets into the White House.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S. "
