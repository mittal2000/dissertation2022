Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) says that if Donald Trump is elected president, he might pursue a clean energy policy, but only if he believes it's a smart business move.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e44ebf1b00002d00ef18f0.jpeg?cache=V7ZnL8JmBP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump could embrace a clean energy policy as president, but only if he can be convinced that it’s a good business decision, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told The Huffington Post on Thursday.“He’s the type of guy that, if you show him that’s the only pathway forward, he may have more sensitivity to the environmental side,” Graham said.Graham has acknowledged the reality of climate change, which makes him something of an outlier among Republican lawmakers. Trump has called climate change a hoax perpetrated by China to hurt U.S. manufacturing. Graham has been critical of Trump since they both were competing in the GOP presidential primary. In June, the South Carolina senator called on fellow Republicans to unendorse Trump after the billionaire estate mogul claimed that a judge presiding over a lawsuit against him was unfit to serve on the bench because of his Mexican heritage.“If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,” Graham told The New York Times then.Trump’s skepticism on climate change has severely hurt the GOP presidential nominee with young voters, Graham said, since the vast majority of them firmly accept that human activity is causing significant shifts in Earth’s climate. “Trump the dealmaker may emerge here if he gets to be president,” Graham said. “But when you’re campaigning for president, this is one reason he’s hurting with millennials. Millennials overwhelmingly believe that climate change is real, and when they hear a candidate say it’s a Chinese hoax, I think that is a barrier to growing the vote.”On Thursday, however, Trump spoke to a gathering of fracking industry leaders, promising to lift environmental regulations and open more federal land to drilling ― probably not exactly what Graham had in mind. Graham’s comments came moments after the senator spoke at a gathering of conservatives to discuss clean energy efforts. In his speech, Graham urged Republicans to join the ranks of climate change believers, and criticized the party’s lack of environmental awareness.“Does anybody know what the environmental platform of the Republican Party is?” Graham asked. “Neither do I.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
1,POLITICS,"Donald Trump Presidency Would Mean The 'Decimation Of Public Education,' Says Top Teachers Union Leader",Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/randi-weingarten-donald-trump_us_57e41377e4b0e28b2b52bd62,"""The guy’s narcissism makes him so dangerous.""",2016-09-22,"American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten is a surrogate for Hillary Clinton, whom she has worked with for decades.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_183_1992_1115%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Randi Weingarten has been an outspoken surrogate for Hillary Clinton. She spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August, and her American Federation of Teachers was the first national labor union to make a presidential endorsement in the 2016 cycle.The reason she’s so worried about Donald Trump, she told a small gathering of reporters Wednesday, goes far beyond what he would do to schools in this country. Think launching a war based on a bruised ego and fundamentally changing what it means to be president of the United States. “The guy’s narcissism makes him so dangerous,” Weingarten said. “You have no idea sitting here whether he would get us into a war simply because he’s mad at someone. There’s not someone who’s been elected as president who is as mercurial, who is as dangerous, as what this guy says any day of the week.”Weingarten has already heard from teachers around the country who are worried about what effect Trump’s rhetoric is having on students. A teacher in Dearborn, Michigan, for example, told her she had a student come up and ask whether she and her family will be deported. In March, The Washington Post reported that third-grade students in Fairfax County, Virginia, told a child with darker skin that he would have to leave if Trump becomes president. And at a high school basketball game in Indiana, students from a predominantly white school chanted “Build the wall!” ― a Trump refrain ― when playing a predominantly Latino school.“If the guy running for president mocks a disabled reporter the way he did, what do you do if you are a schoolteacher now after that? ... When we try in schools to stop bullying, to increase tolerance, to celebrate diversity, how do you have the president of the United States doing exactly the opposite? How do you create an environment that respects each other, that teaches people if that happens?” she asked. Weingarten said AFT is considering having town hall meetings allowing teachers to step forward and testify about this “Trump effect” and what is happening in schools.The labor leader has also spoken out about Trump’s $20 billion voucher proposal, which would use federal funds to create state-run block grants allowing students to enroll in private and charter schools. Weingarten said it would take away federal funds for low-income students, students with disabilities and other public school resources, as well as Pell Grants used to attend college. “It’s the decimation of public education,” she said, “and no one should pretend it’s anything other than that.”The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment.Weingarten has already been talked about as a possible education secretary in a Clinton administration, but she said she wasn’t focused on that prospect and said it was “ridiculous” to speculate about it right now.“My focus right now is on doing everything in our power to save our country and save civilization,” she said, “which means to get Hillary Clinton elected.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

One protester was shot, and four police officers were injured as protesters looted stores and officers shot rubber bullets. Jordan has long been criticized for his seeming unwillingness to wade into political waters ― Kareem Abdul-Jabbar once said he had chosen “commerce over conscience” ― but that appears to be changing. In July, Jordan wrote in a letter released on ESPN’s The Undefeated that he felt he could “no longer stay silent” in the wake of a series of police shootings. “As a proud American, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement and angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers,” Jordan wrote. “I grieve with the families who have lost loved ones, as I know their pain all too well.”Jordan’s own father, James Jordan, died in 1993 after he was found in a creek. He had been shot in the chest."

Then he told reporters he wouldn’t be taking questions about Sunday’s game.“I’m not going to answer any questions today and it’s no offense to you guys,” Sherman told the crowd of reporters, as seen in the video below filmed by The News Tribune of Tacoma. “I think the state of things in the world today is very interesting.”Sherman used the forum to address recent fatal police shootings of black men in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and in Charlotte, North Carolina, and to talk about the importance of the national anthem protests against police violence led by the 49ers’ Colin Kaepernick and other NFL athletes.Then, still without taking any questions, Sherman walked out of the room. Scroll to read the whole transcript below.During his two-minute speech, Sherman said that certain NFL players are trying to take a stand and “raise people’s awareness,” but their message is still being ignored.“I think the last couple days a couple more guys have gotten shot and killed in the middle of the street ... and I think people are still missing the point,” Sherman said. “The reason these guys are kneeling, the reason we’re locking arms, is to bring people together to make people aware that this is not right,” he continued. “It’s not right for people to get killed in the street.”Sherman explained that he tries to inspire kids when he’s doing community service. Though he warns kids to comply with the police for their safety, he said “there’s still a chance of them getting shot and no repercussions for anyone.”“Something needs to be done,” Sherman continued. “And so, when a guy takes a knee, you can ignore it. You can say he’s not being patriotic, he’s not honoring the flag. I’m doing none of those things. I’m saying, straight up, this is wrong and we need to do something. So thank you guys, have a blessed day.”After walking out of the press conference, Sherman answered reporters’ questions in the locker room, NBC’s Pro Football Talk reported.At least 15 black people have died during police encounters since Aug. 26, when San Francisco’s Kaepernick began taking a knee during pre-game national anthems in protest of police violence, according to The Guardian.Read Sherman’s full transcript below:But I’m not going to answer any questions today and it’s no offense to you guys. I think the state of things in the world today is very interesting. I think you have players that are trying to take a stand and trying to be aware of social issue and try to make a stand an increase people’s awareness and put a spotlight on it and they’re being ignored. Whether they’re taking a knee or whether they’re locking arms, they’re trying to bring people together and unite them for a cause. I think the last couple days a couple more guys have gotten shot and killed in the middle of the street. More videos have come out of guys getting killed, and I think people are still missing the point. The reason these guys are kneeling, the reason we’re locking arms is to bring people together to make people aware that this is not right. It’s not right for people to get killed in the street."

When the Tony Award winner discusses her body of work, however, she sees herself as the master of an entirely different medium.“I think of myself as a painter, and I do these paintings every year — a new collection of paintings,” she told The Huffington Post in an entirely. “My gallery setting is a concert hall. In the moment of the concert, it’s like a gallery showing. I bring out my portrait work onstage with my brilliant musicians, and we give people an experience.”Watch Buckley sing “Memory” from the musical, “Cats,” below. Buckley’s 2016 “collection,” as it were, it called “Story Songs.” The centerpiece of the new show, which opens Sept. 22 at Joe’s Pub at the Public Theater in New York, is a new song by up-and-coming composer Joe Iconis. The song itself, “Old Flame,” was written exclusively for Buckley after she wrote Iconic (“Broadway Bounty Hunter,” “Be More Chill”) a fan letter last spring.“I’ve been a huge fan of his for a while — he’s amazing and so funny,” she said. “Old Flame,” she added, “is unlike anything I’ve ever done before. I was so inspired by what he wrote.”From there, Buckley began collecting music by the likes of Stephen Schwartz, Jason Robert Brown and even Radiohead for the new show with her longtime musical director, Christian Jacob. The result is a diverse assortment of “character pieces,” the type of which have become her signature.As it turns out, “Story Songs” caps off what Buckley describes as a “great, great summer.” In August, she wrapped an acclaimed run as “Big Edie” in a Los Angeles production of the musical, “Grey Gardens,” directed by Michael Wilson. Part of her summer was also spent filming M. Night Shyamalan’s forthcoming thriller, “Split.” The film, which opens in January, sees Buckley as a psychologist to the film’s protagonist (James McAvoy), a man with 23 different personalities.Watch the trailer for “Split” below, then scroll down to keep reading. Now that she’s back in New York, Buckley can’t wait to check out the Broadway revival of “Cats,” and see how Leona Lewis fares as Grizabella, the role for which Buckley won a Tony Award in 1983. She’s considerably less enthusiastic, however, about another spectacle: the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The famously outspoken star hasn’t minced words on Twitter when it comes to Republican nominee Donald Trump, and she remains dumbfounded by voters who support him.“That anyone is being buffaloed into this is just ludicrous,” she said. “It’s very disheartening.”All of the “frenzy,” however, makes Buckley all the more eager to focus on what she loves: her art. “I feel really blessed that I have these wonderful relationships with some great artists that I get to collaborate with,” she said. “I’m very, very blessed.”Betty Buckley brings “Story Songs” to Joe’s Pub at the Public Theater in New York from Sept. 22―25.

5,POLITICS,"Ending Private Detention Would Turn System 'Upside Down,' Says Immigration Enforcement Chief",Roque Planas and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigration-enforcement-private-detention_us_57e40391e4b08d73b82ff35c,The Department of Homeland Security is reviewing whether it should stop relying on for-profit companies to run detention centers.,2016-09-22,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Sarah Saldaña says the agency was holding more than 3,400 people as of earlier this week.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e407ae1700002a00ac66ea.jpeg?cache=gnQXcM9L76&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Shutting down for-profit detention facilities would hurt Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s ability to do its job, agency director Sarah Saldaña said Thursday amid a review over whether the government should do just that. “It would pretty much turn our system upside down,” she said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing, “because we are almost completely contractor-run with respect to our detention facilities.” Saldaña’s comments fly in the face of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson’s recent decision to review whether ICE should continue relying on private prison contractors to run its detention centers. The Department of Justice announced that it would phase out most of its use of privatized prisons for long-term inmates. Criminal justice reformers welcomed the surprise change in policy, but critics noted that ICE would still rely heavily on privatized facilities despite the change. The DOJ decision also does not apply to jails used by the U.S. Marshals Service, which has played a growing role in immigration enforcement since 2005. Johnson responded by ordering a review of ICE’s use of privatized facilities to lock up immigrants. An advisory council called by Johnson has until Nov. 30 to submit a report evaluating whether privatized immigrant detention centers should be eliminated. ICE officials pushed back from the start on the idea that the DOJ decision should apply to immigrant detention as well because they have different missions. Immigrant detention is meant to be short-term and non-punitive, while the criminal system is punitive but should also have rehabilitative services, an official said in August.Saldaña is correct to assert that eliminating private detention centers would fundamentally reshape the system. Roughly two-thirds of immigration detention centers are run as for-profit enterprises by private corporations, according to Texas-based advocacy organization Grassroots Leadership. Congress requires ICE to keep 34,000 detention beds available for immigrants on a daily basis. Saldaña said ICE would not be able to maintain 34,000 beds if it ended its use of private detention centers, in response to questioning from Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.). She said later that more than 34,000 beds were filled as of a few days ago.But many immigrant rights defenders question why the federal government needs such a massive detention system. The Border Patrol caught 337,117 people crossing illegally into the United States last year ― about one-fifth of the number of apprehensions at the border in the year 2000. Central American unaccompanied minors, who are not supposed to be placed in immigrant detention centers unless they are accompanied by their mother, have made up a growing number of immigrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. The Obama administration largely abandoned the practice of family immigrant detention in 2009, when it shut down a Texas facility infamous for putting children behind barbed wire. But it opened two new family detention facilities ― both privately run ― in 2014, amid a surge in mothers and children being apprehended at the border. Most families are now held for fewer than 20 days, Saldaña and other administration officials have said. Some families are held far longer, such as the mothers who have been involved in hunger strikes at Berks County Family Residential Center in Pennsylvania. Saldaña said she “take[s] very seriously how long we detain families,” but that some are in mandatory detention or awaiting deportation. “When they are losing their appeals and we are preparing to remove them, we don’t detain them for the purpose of punishing them, but to prepare them,” she said.

6,BLACK VOICES,Charlotte Police Chief Says Don't Expect To See Video Of Keith Scott Shooting,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/keith-lamont-scott-video_us_57e3f48ce4b0e28b2b529219,Scott's family has requested to see footage of his killing.,2016-09-22,"Charlotte mayor Jennifer Roberts and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police chief Police Chief Kerr Putney hold a news conference on Thursday, after Tuesday's fatal police shooting in the city.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Footage of Charlotte police fatally shooting a black man this week will not be released publicly anytime soon ― if at all, the city’s police chief said Thursday.Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department Chief Kerr Putney made the announcement alongside Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts, amid outrage at the police shooting of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday. It followed a second night of protests in the city’s central neighborhood, which turned violent in places.“When should you expect it to be released? You shouldn’t expect it to be released,” Putney told reporters, noting that he never specified “full transparency” in the video’s release. The chief insisted that withholding the video from the public is in the interest of the Scott family.“If you think we should publicly display a victim’s worst day, that is not transparency,” he said. “We’ll release it when we believe it is a compelling reason.”He did, however, note that the video fails to establish that Scott was holding a gun when he was shot.“The video does not give me absolute, definitive, visual evidence that would confirm that a person is pointing a gun,” Putney said.The Scott family has requested to see the footage and Putney said he was “working on honoring that request.” He did not elaborate on when the family might see the video. Police and witnesses to the shooting, which include members of Scott’s family, disagree on the facts of the incident.Officers were at a Charlotte apartment complex near the UNC-Charlotte campus attempting to serve an outstanding warrant to someone when they encountered Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Police described Scott as sitting in his vehicle and holding a gun. He refused to comply with police orders, posing a threat to officers, the officers said. North Carolina is a state with open carry laws. But Scott’s family insists he didn’t have a gun at all and was holding a book, as he read while waiting for his son. Police said they later recovered a handgun but no book at the scene. Scott was the sixth resident to be killed by Charlotte police in the past 12 months. The District Attorney has already issued decisions in at least two of the cases and found police were justified in both incidents. Only one of four fatal shootings before the officer killed Scott were captured on body camera footage. It’s unclear in the fifth incident whether the footage was nonexistent or the department is withholding it. The city spent $7 million last year to equip patrol officers with body cameras. The sum did not provide for SWAT and tactical officers.Police have frequently argued body cam footage should not be released publicly so as not to impact investigations and because the footage should be considered part of an officer’s personal records.A new state law set to take effect Oct. 1 will make it even more difficult for members of the public to view police dash camera or body camera footage. The law broadly exempts footage and people seen or heard in the recording may only view the video by filing a special request ― which may still be denied. "

9,ARTS & CULTURE,Just Try To Look Away From This Absurdly Flat Mouse Found In A 17th-Century Book,Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mouse-latin-textbook-preserved_us_57e42405e4b0e28b2b52d47a,What a cute li'l mummy.,2016-09-22,A mouse that was squashed by 19th-century pupils at the Cathedral School in a Latin textbook that was published in 1684.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e42522180000c7063167b8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Well, that’s one way to get rid of a pest ― and your pesky Latin homework ― all in one fell blow. The Latin textbook featured above, published in 1684, became an unlikely tomb for a mouse when 19th-century students at the Salisbury Cathedral School in the U.K. put their learning supplies to an unconventional use. The textbook ― and mouse ― are preserved now at the Cathedral library, along with other snippets of the printed word past, such as manuscripts handwritten on vellum nearly a thousand years ago.If you want to see the adorably preserved corpse in person, head to Salisbury Cathedral for a guided tour of the library, which this month opened to the general public for the first time. In the past, you would have needed a valid academic institution behind you and a serious research purpose for your visit. (Does “I need to see a perfectly flat rodent with my own two eyes before I die” count? Hey, it does now!)Otherwise, take a gander at a few more angles of the dearly departed mouse, and other Salisbury Cathedral library treasures, below."

West, who serves as an executive board member for the Golden State Warriors, was the last member of the Warrior organization to speak with Kevin Durant before he signed with the team. West believes it is highly unfair for fans to criticize the superstar, and that it’s actually admirable he put winning ahead of everything else.Additionally, the 78-year-old West ― also known as “The Logo” for his silhouette representing the NBA ― discussed commissioner Adam Silver, specifically as it relates to gambling and the league’s progressive nature surrounding a variety of topics.Perhaps most surprisingly, West revealed that the Lakers ― whom he captured one championship with as a player and six more as a front office executive ― was not the team he “always” wanted to play for.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

11,ENTERTAINMENT,Warpaint's Theresa Wayman On The Band's ‘Vivid’ New Album And Inevitably Questioning Her Career,Kira Brekke,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/warpaints-theresa-wayman-on-politics-being-dark-and-inevitably-questioning-her-career_us_57b1dbc2e4b069e7e505e9ac,"""I kind of wonder what I’m doing.""",2016-09-22,"Jenny Lee Lindberg, Stella Mozgawa and Theresa Wayman of Warpaint perform on Aug. 23 in Dublin, Ireland.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e085581800006c32bd2825.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There’s a quiet intensity to Theresa Wayman, the guitarist and vocalist for indie art-rock band Warpaint. She sat beside me on a hotter than hell summer day wearing a flowy short dress, knee-high socks and vaguely smudged black eye-makeup. She was clearly a bit tired from the “huzzah” of her musician’s life but enveloped me in a lovely conversation for nearly 40 minutes. Since the women-only quartet’s 2008 EP, “Exquisite Corpse,” the group has been releasing echoey, ethereal sounds that are easy to distinguish from the oversaturated pop-music scene. But they’ve changed things up with their newest release, “Heads Up,” out Sept. 23. They’re still as dark and delicious as ever, but they’ve expanded into catchier and faster beats. In a way, their new music is easier to digest. As Wayman wrapped herself in a cardigan and fiddled with her necklace drinking a soda, we spoke about the band’s past records, it’s “moody” reputation and how she defines success. The guitarist was humble and spoke with conviction, at times getting lost in her thoughts.Did you feel pressure to make a more energetic, dance-y album, especially in the current landscape of music?You definitely can’t get a hit song on the radio that’s not energetic in America. That’s never going to happen ― not that that’s, like, what we were intentionally aiming for or anything. But I don’t really feel pressure. If anything, I feel pressure to try to find what’s next that’s not happening right now.But you did that when you initially started recording years ago. I guess so, yeah. But I think that, as an artist, that’s something that fuels me. So I’m always searching for what I feel like is new territory. But there are certain things that have been mainstays in our musical influence for years and years before they were even as popular as they are now. Such as things like hip-hop and trip-hop and electronic music. Stuff like that.What are your perceptions of the current music scene?In a positive way, I think that everything is wide open. That’s really exciting because anyone can do anything and ... the music that’s being made now is generally a mishmash of so many different influences. But a lot of pop music is really innovative, and I love that. I’m starting to really appreciate the clarity in pop music. I feel like it’s really brave ... in the sense that it’s revealing and that it’s people making decisions and sticking to them in a way. It’s a huge statement ... like, “I am this and you take it and do what you want with it. Either you like it or you don’t like it.”Maybe that’s just the way I define it because I’m coming from a past where I’ve been more hidden. Our band, in general on our last two albums, was more hidden and sort of reverb and [had] like a dreamy, impressionist way of being. And it’s nice. I think some of that was an aesthetic choice, but some of it, too, was maybe being unsure. And so ... I think this album is more vivid and more sure of itself, and intentionally so. What’s the chemistry like between the bandmates? If you were on a road trip, who would be the annoying backseat driver, who’d be the driver, who’d be getting the snacks?Well, I’m just going to say we kind of all fill all roles at different points. There’s clearly differences in our personalities, but I don’t know if I care to define it on the record. Just kidding, but we actually all ... switch off playing these roles with each other. One day someone’s more the ‘mom’ and the other one’s the ‘kid’ and then it switches and that’s nice. I mean, don’t get me wrong, there’s definitely conflict. We’ve gotten really good at hearing each other out and respecting each other knowing ultimately where everyone’s coming from and not getting wrapped up in a moment of irritation.How do you define success?I feel like, if we are doing our best and we are playing at the top of our game, then we will actually succeed in a larger way and I definitely invite that. I’d love to be more recognized for this album than we were for the last two and to have our popularity continually grow. I’m into that because I feel like, also, we’re doing something unique that kind of deserves that attention. What’re your thoughts on Warpaint sometimes being depicted as dark and ominous?I’m OK with all those adjectives. I know that we are moody. We have moody music and we are kind of dark. There’s like a somber quality to our music, for sure. But then it’s also groovy and our personalities can be very bubbly and we laugh a lot and that comes across when we’re playing as well ... We have fun with each other so that’s kind of a nice juxtaposition. I like it when bands are emotional in their music, in whatever way. It doesn’t mean it has to be slow or minimal or something, but I just like emotionalism. We’ve seen music become more political lately. Where do you think politics fits into music?Anybody who wants to put politics in their music should. And it’s probably a good thing because sometimes, as a musician, with everything that’s going on in the world, I kind of wonder what I’m doing. Like, should I even be doing this? Is it even important? Given the fact that there’s a lot of other ways in which the world needs help. So sometimes I question the whole thing in general. I love it when people are political in their music. Who are you listening to right now?Honestly, I’ve been listening to Twenty One Pilots. They’re really kind of political, too. Not necessarily political but he’s talking about the inner life and struggle and sort of like bringing it to light and letting it be released in a way, which is super cool.On Warpaint’s first EP, you collaborated with John Frusciante, the former guitarist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. What do you think about the band’s new album? It’s a case of: They should keep writing music and keep doing it. They do what they do and I don’t think it’s really about whether it’s good or not, in a really weird way. It’s good to me, 100 percent, because I know their intention behind it. But I know them ― or I know a couple of them more than others. I know where they’re coming from so I feel like that’s what matters to me. It’s not music I listen to, but I think that Flea is an incredible artist, in general, and he’s an incredible bass player obviously ― which is who he is and the way he lives his life. I know there’s intention and there’s integrity behind what he’s doing.This interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity."

16,LATINO VOICES,What Hillary Clinton Told Us About Mexico And The Political Power Of Young Latinos,"Alfredo La Mont, HuffPost Mexico",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-mexico-young-latinos_us_57e2cbdde4b0e80b1b9fc9d6,"In an exclusive Q&A with HuffPost Mexico, the Democratic nominee answered questions about U.S.-Mexican relations, the Latino vote and more.",2016-09-22,Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton talked to to HuffPost Mexico about her campaign and how she would envision her presidential administration conducting U.S.-Mexico relations.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e2d4fe1700002a00ac633c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mexico has featured prominently in the 2016 presidential election, often as a catalyst for hostility and anti-trade sentiment among GOP voters. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump launched his unlikely candidacy on the central promise of building a wall (financed by Mexico) between the United States and its southern neighbor. The real estate mogul turned presidential candidate has repeatedly and falsely accused Mexico of sending criminals, rapists and drug dealers into the U.S. Trump’s rocky relationship with Mexico reached its nadir in late August after a surprise meeting with current Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto resulted in protests and a Twitter feud over who would pay for the wall. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, has taken a decidedly cautious and subdued approach when it comes to Mexico. A proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, Clinton and her campaign have repeatedly criticized Trump’s controversial rhetoric directed toward Mexico and Mexican immigrants, while maintaining her focus on U.S. voters. As a result, while many Mexicans are clear on Trump’s position toward their country, they’re not as sure where Clinton stands. In an exclusive Q&A for HuffPost Mexico, the Democratic presidential nominee took some time to answer questions over email, touching on issues related to Mexican-U.S. diplomacy, Latin America and the role Latino and Hispanic youth will play in the upcoming election.What is your personal and professional relationship with Mexico and Latin America?I have visited Mexico many times since 1972 for vacation and work. In fact, Bill and I spent part of our honeymoon in Acapulco in 1975! And during my official visits to Latin America as First Lady, I developed strong personal relationships with leaders in the region. As Secretary of State, I visited Mexico five times and made dozens of trips to countries in Latin America. Through these relationships, we were able to start the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas and create regional strategies to fight international drug cartels and gang violence.There’s enormous potential in our relationship with Mexico if we get it right. Not only do we share a 2,000-mile-long border with Mexico, but our economies and cultures are highly integrated. And decades of immigration have strengthened our familial ties. I’ve seen firsthand how local, state and federal officials from each country work together every day to manage our border security and ensure the safety of American and Mexican citizens from natural disasters, public health threats and crime.Of course, we still have a lot of work to do to address the challenges we face, including poverty, ongoing violence, human rights abuses, corruption and migration. As president, I’ll work closely with our partners in Mexico and Latin America, leading the region toward solutions — through relationships founded on mutual respect.Do you have any Mexican Americans on your senior staff? Can you tell us what experience or insight they bring to the 2016 U.S. presidential election?I’m proud to say that Hillary for America mirrors the diversity of our country. Over 50 percent of our staff is female and approximately one-third are people of color ― figures that roughly match national statistics. I think this is a great indication of what the federal workforce would look like under a Clinton-Kaine administration. Mexican Americans play an important role at every level of this campaign. My treasurer is Jose Villarreal; Amanda Renteria is our national political director; Carlos Sanchez, our deputy political director. They all bring a depth of experience to the campaign from working in the private sector and on Capitol Hill. Jorge Silva, our director of Hispanic media, and Cristóbal Alex, our deputy national director of voter outreach, are both hard at work to make sure we engage with voters leading all the way up to Election Day. And those are just a few of the many Mexican Americans involved in this campaign. I’m so lucky to have them working alongside me.How do you envision the next 10 years with your Latin American allies and neighbors, in terms of trade and security?Too often, we look east and we look west, but we don’t look south. No region in the world is more important to our long-term prosperity and security than Latin America. And no region in the world is better positioned to emerge as a new force for global peace and progress. Strong ties between the United States and our partners in the Americas are one of our great competitive advantages in the 21st century. We have more in common with Latin America than just our proximity. We share common values, interests and heritage. Our economies, our communities and even our families are intertwined. So instead of building a wall, we should be building a new era of partnership and prosperity.To get there, we have to set common goals and work toward them together. We need to help our partners and allies in Latin America address ongoing challenges like poverty, violence, human rights abuses, corruption and migration. And we should start by working with our Latin American communities here in the United States, to help strengthen our partnerships throughout the region.What kind of help do you expect from Mexican partners to create lasting immigration reform?America is a nation of immigrants, and we should treat those who come to our country with dignity and respect. That’s why we can’t wait any longer for comprehensive immigration reform. In my first 100 days as president, I’ll put a bill before Congress that includes a pathway to citizenship, fixes the family visa backlog, and strengthens our economy.Comprehensive reform will bring millions of workers into the formal economy to pay taxes and compete on a level playing field. And it will add $800 billion to our GDP, creating new jobs and more growth. It will also help secure our border in a more humane, targeted way that will benefit both of our nations ― like ending the flow of weapons to Mexico, and ensuring refugees seeking asylum in the U.S. have a fair chance to tell their stories.We also need to do everything possible under the law to keep families together. So as we fight for reform, we must also defend and expand DACA and DAPA. What happens next door matters to us ― for both our security and our prosperity.We should remember how much we stand to benefit from Mexico’s success, and how much Mexico stands to benefit from ours at meeting these shared challenges. A strong Mexico will mean safer American communities, a stronger American economy, and given the connections between our people, a more vibrant society. To make that a reality, Mexico’s leaders need to take steps to support economic reform, strengthen the rule of law, and restore its citizens’ feeling of security and trust in government. Continuing to work together on these challenges will be key to ensuring that North America remains the most dynamic, secure and prosperous region in the world.What was your biggest lesson from the 2008 U.S. presidential election?The 2008 campaign was a tough race, but I’m grateful for all the lessons I learned. One major takeaway was remembering to take criticism seriously, but not personally.I’ve faced a lot of criticism in my life and throughout my career. And even in the face of losing, I had to remember why I got in the race in the first place. I had to remember the people I was fighting for ― and it’s those same people I’m fighting for in my campaign today.Everything I learned from 2008 has made me a better candidate this time around. And that’s a good thing, because the stakes in this presidential campaign are higher than ever before. My team and I have improved our strategy, and we’re focused on earning every single one of your votes. And most importantly, we’re still guided by the ideals that have been central to my entire career: that every child in our country should be able to live up to his or her God-given potential. How does your campaign plan to win the Latino youth vote?I’m not taking anything or anyone for granted in this election, and I know I’m going to have to work hard to earn every single person’s vote. Latino youth are a growing and vibrant part of our democracy. As one of the fastest-growing populations in the United States, Latinos will play an even greater role in determining the direction of our country in the coming years.That’s why my campaign has ramped up our efforts to engage, energize and mobilize millennial Latino voters. I want every young Latino to know that I’m committed to passing comprehensive immigration reform, creating a debt-free future for college graduates, tackling climate change and strengthening our investments in good-paying jobs.In the weeks ahead, I am going to continue my commitment to meet young Latinos where they are, hearing from them about the challenges they face and the priorities they value.Is there a Latino or Hispanic American who stands out to you ― a hero, or someone whose life work you admire in particular?The contributions of Latino and Hispanic Americans to our nation are countless and inimitable. Two of my heroes that come to mind are Cesar and Helen Chavez. They spent their entire lives fighting for farmworkers to receive the fair wages and benefits they deserve. And it’s really their determination and tirelessness in the face of countless obstacles that’s inspired me, and that’s helped countless workers also stand up for their right to be treated with respect and dignity.I’m proud to have the support of Dolores Huerta, Cesar and Helen’s partner in their movement, and another indefatigable advocate of worker and immigrant rights.I also have enormous respect and admiration for DREAMers like Astrid Silva and Juan Salazar who I’ve met along the campaign trail.

17,LATINO VOICES,What Hillary Clinton Told Us About Mexico And The Political Power Of Young Latinos,"Alfredo La Mont, HuffPost Mexico",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-mexico-young-latinos_us_57e2cbdde4b0e80b1b9fc9d6,"In an exclusive Q&A with HuffPost Mexico, the Democratic nominee answered questions about U.S.-Mexican relations, the Latino vote and more.",2016-09-22,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton talks to an undocumented farm worker Maria Licea, 49, and her 9-year-old daughter Jasmin Aguilar.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e3054b1b00002d00ef14bc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mexico has featured prominently in the 2016 presidential election, often as a catalyst for hostility and anti-trade sentiment among GOP voters. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump launched his unlikely candidacy on the central promise of building a wall (financed by Mexico) between the United States and its southern neighbor. The real estate mogul turned presidential candidate has repeatedly and falsely accused Mexico of sending criminals, rapists and drug dealers into the U.S. Trump’s rocky relationship with Mexico reached its nadir in late August after a surprise meeting with current Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto resulted in protests and a Twitter feud over who would pay for the wall. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, has taken a decidedly cautious and subdued approach when it comes to Mexico. A proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, Clinton and her campaign have repeatedly criticized Trump’s controversial rhetoric directed toward Mexico and Mexican immigrants, while maintaining her focus on U.S. voters. As a result, while many Mexicans are clear on Trump’s position toward their country, they’re not as sure where Clinton stands. In an exclusive Q&A for HuffPost Mexico, the Democratic presidential nominee took some time to answer questions over email, touching on issues related to Mexican-U.S. diplomacy, Latin America and the role Latino and Hispanic youth will play in the upcoming election.What is your personal and professional relationship with Mexico and Latin America?I have visited Mexico many times since 1972 for vacation and work. In fact, Bill and I spent part of our honeymoon in Acapulco in 1975! And during my official visits to Latin America as First Lady, I developed strong personal relationships with leaders in the region. As Secretary of State, I visited Mexico five times and made dozens of trips to countries in Latin America. Through these relationships, we were able to start the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas and create regional strategies to fight international drug cartels and gang violence.There’s enormous potential in our relationship with Mexico if we get it right. Not only do we share a 2,000-mile-long border with Mexico, but our economies and cultures are highly integrated. And decades of immigration have strengthened our familial ties. I’ve seen firsthand how local, state and federal officials from each country work together every day to manage our border security and ensure the safety of American and Mexican citizens from natural disasters, public health threats and crime.Of course, we still have a lot of work to do to address the challenges we face, including poverty, ongoing violence, human rights abuses, corruption and migration. As president, I’ll work closely with our partners in Mexico and Latin America, leading the region toward solutions — through relationships founded on mutual respect.Do you have any Mexican Americans on your senior staff? Can you tell us what experience or insight they bring to the 2016 U.S. presidential election?I’m proud to say that Hillary for America mirrors the diversity of our country. Over 50 percent of our staff is female and approximately one-third are people of color ― figures that roughly match national statistics. I think this is a great indication of what the federal workforce would look like under a Clinton-Kaine administration. Mexican Americans play an important role at every level of this campaign. My treasurer is Jose Villarreal; Amanda Renteria is our national political director; Carlos Sanchez, our deputy political director. They all bring a depth of experience to the campaign from working in the private sector and on Capitol Hill. Jorge Silva, our director of Hispanic media, and Cristóbal Alex, our deputy national director of voter outreach, are both hard at work to make sure we engage with voters leading all the way up to Election Day. And those are just a few of the many Mexican Americans involved in this campaign. I’m so lucky to have them working alongside me.How do you envision the next 10 years with your Latin American allies and neighbors, in terms of trade and security?Too often, we look east and we look west, but we don’t look south. No region in the world is more important to our long-term prosperity and security than Latin America. And no region in the world is better positioned to emerge as a new force for global peace and progress. Strong ties between the United States and our partners in the Americas are one of our great competitive advantages in the 21st century. We have more in common with Latin America than just our proximity. We share common values, interests and heritage. Our economies, our communities and even our families are intertwined. So instead of building a wall, we should be building a new era of partnership and prosperity.To get there, we have to set common goals and work toward them together. We need to help our partners and allies in Latin America address ongoing challenges like poverty, violence, human rights abuses, corruption and migration. And we should start by working with our Latin American communities here in the United States, to help strengthen our partnerships throughout the region.What kind of help do you expect from Mexican partners to create lasting immigration reform?America is a nation of immigrants, and we should treat those who come to our country with dignity and respect. That’s why we can’t wait any longer for comprehensive immigration reform. In my first 100 days as president, I’ll put a bill before Congress that includes a pathway to citizenship, fixes the family visa backlog, and strengthens our economy.Comprehensive reform will bring millions of workers into the formal economy to pay taxes and compete on a level playing field. And it will add $800 billion to our GDP, creating new jobs and more growth. It will also help secure our border in a more humane, targeted way that will benefit both of our nations ― like ending the flow of weapons to Mexico, and ensuring refugees seeking asylum in the U.S. have a fair chance to tell their stories.We also need to do everything possible under the law to keep families together. So as we fight for reform, we must also defend and expand DACA and DAPA. What happens next door matters to us ― for both our security and our prosperity.We should remember how much we stand to benefit from Mexico’s success, and how much Mexico stands to benefit from ours at meeting these shared challenges. A strong Mexico will mean safer American communities, a stronger American economy, and given the connections between our people, a more vibrant society. To make that a reality, Mexico’s leaders need to take steps to support economic reform, strengthen the rule of law, and restore its citizens’ feeling of security and trust in government. Continuing to work together on these challenges will be key to ensuring that North America remains the most dynamic, secure and prosperous region in the world.What was your biggest lesson from the 2008 U.S. presidential election?The 2008 campaign was a tough race, but I’m grateful for all the lessons I learned. One major takeaway was remembering to take criticism seriously, but not personally.I’ve faced a lot of criticism in my life and throughout my career. And even in the face of losing, I had to remember why I got in the race in the first place. I had to remember the people I was fighting for ― and it’s those same people I’m fighting for in my campaign today.Everything I learned from 2008 has made me a better candidate this time around. And that’s a good thing, because the stakes in this presidential campaign are higher than ever before. My team and I have improved our strategy, and we’re focused on earning every single one of your votes. And most importantly, we’re still guided by the ideals that have been central to my entire career: that every child in our country should be able to live up to his or her God-given potential. How does your campaign plan to win the Latino youth vote?I’m not taking anything or anyone for granted in this election, and I know I’m going to have to work hard to earn every single person’s vote. Latino youth are a growing and vibrant part of our democracy. As one of the fastest-growing populations in the United States, Latinos will play an even greater role in determining the direction of our country in the coming years.That’s why my campaign has ramped up our efforts to engage, energize and mobilize millennial Latino voters. I want every young Latino to know that I’m committed to passing comprehensive immigration reform, creating a debt-free future for college graduates, tackling climate change and strengthening our investments in good-paying jobs.In the weeks ahead, I am going to continue my commitment to meet young Latinos where they are, hearing from them about the challenges they face and the priorities they value.Is there a Latino or Hispanic American who stands out to you ― a hero, or someone whose life work you admire in particular?The contributions of Latino and Hispanic Americans to our nation are countless and inimitable. Two of my heroes that come to mind are Cesar and Helen Chavez. They spent their entire lives fighting for farmworkers to receive the fair wages and benefits they deserve. And it’s really their determination and tirelessness in the face of countless obstacles that’s inspired me, and that’s helped countless workers also stand up for their right to be treated with respect and dignity.I’m proud to have the support of Dolores Huerta, Cesar and Helen’s partner in their movement, and another indefatigable advocate of worker and immigrant rights.I also have enormous respect and admiration for DREAMers like Astrid Silva and Juan Salazar who I’ve met along the campaign trail. One of my first campaign events was a roundtable with DREAMers. These young people no longer wanted to live in fear or secrecy. Instead, they stepped into the public as undocumented.That’s not just brave – it’s a real testament to their belief in the American dream. People like Astrid and Juan remind me that we can’t ever stop fighting for comprehensive immigration reform.You had a special moment with the daughter of two undocumented immigrants who was afraid that her parents would be deported.

(Reuters) - Residents of Charlotte, North Carolina, woke up to a state of emergency and the National Guard and State Highway Patrol deployed to their city on Thursday after a second night of unrest sparked by the fatal police shooting of a black man.According to police, Keith Scott, 43, was shot and killed by officers on Tuesday after he refused to drop a handgun. His family and a witness to the shooting said Scott was holding a book, not a firearm.A peaceful rally in response to the shooting turned violent on Wednesday as protesters threw rocks and bottles at police in riot gear, smashed windows and doors and looted stores in downtown Charlotte. Officers fired rubber bullets, tear gas, flash-bang grenades and used pepper spray to disperse the crowd.One protester was shot and gravely wounded by a civilian, and four police officers suffered non-life threatening injuries, city officials said on Twitter.Scott’s wife, Rakeyia Scott, issued a statement describing her family as “devastated” and appealing for calm. “We have more questions than answers about Keith’s death,” the statement said.Protesters smashed windows and glass doors at a nearby Hyatt hotel, whose manager told Reuters that two employees were punched. The slogan “Black Lives Matter” was spray-painted on windows.Demonstrators were also seen looting a convenience store after smashing its windows and a shop that sells athletic wear for fans of Charlotte’s National Basketball League team, the Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans.It was the second night of unrest in North Carolina’s largest city and one of the biggest U.S. financial centers. Several protesters and 16 officers were injured on Tuesday night.The turmoil prompted Governor Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency and deploy the National Guard and highway patrol officers to the city to help restore peace.“Any violence directed toward our citizens or police officers or destruction of property should not be tolerated,” McCrory said in a statement.Charlotte’s mayor Jennifer Roberts was considering a curfew as Bank of America told employees not to report to work at its uptown offices, local media reported.There have also been protests in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in recent days demanding the arrest of a police officer seen in a video last week fatally shooting an unarmed black man who had his hands in clear view at the time.The deaths add to a torrent of accusations over racial bias in U.S. law enforcement and calls for greater police accountability for the killings of black people. A study by the Center for Policing Equity released in July shows police used force on blacks at rates more than three times higher than for whites.President Barack Obama spoke by telephone on Wednesday with the mayors of Charlotte and Tulsa, a White House official said.The American Civil Liberties Union urged police to release their camera footage of the incident. Police vehicles typically have a dashboard camera and officers are required to carry cameras on their persons.Roberts said she planned to view the footage on Thursday, but did not indicate if or when it would be made public.“We call for the full release of all facts available,” said William Barber, president of the state’s chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), in a statement.Barber said NAACP officials planned to meet with city officials and members of Scott’s family on Thursday.(Additional reporting by Brendan O’Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky/Jeremy Gaunt)UPDATE: 11:15 p.m. ET ― This article has been updated to reflect that the shooting victim is not dead, as officials initially said."

Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in 2013, when a federal judge found that New York City’s police were using it to disproportionately target black and Latino men during routine traffic stops.Pressed on the constitutionality aspect, Ryan repeated that he’s not familiar enough with the issue to have an opinion.“I just haven’t ― I’m not a Judiciary Committee guy,” he said. “I would defer to [House Judiciary Committee chairman] Bob Goodlatte about the constitutionality of police tactics. I can’t speak to that.”He also had nothing to say about his party’s presidential nominee advocating racial profiling as a national law enforcement strategy.“I don’t have an answer for you because it’s not something that I have familiarized myself with, the constitutionality of it, the efficacy, whether it worked well in New York City or not,” Ryan said. “That’s just ― that’s my point.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
21,POLITICS,The Infuriating Reason Wells Fargo Got Away With Its Massive Scam For So Long,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wells-fargo-fraud-republicans_us_57e4192be4b0e80b1ba0d583,It's all about the fine print.,2016-09-22,Senate Banking Committee Chair Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) was skeptical of CFPB’s oversight during a hearing Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e1ac381800006c32bd2c3f.jpeg?cache=488X30fISh&ops=crop_0_518_3913_2148%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"How did Wells Fargo get away with ripping off its banking customers for so long? The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the City of Los Angeles recently fined Wells Fargo $185 million for five years of misbehavior, but now congressional Republicans are asking why this didn’t happen faster.Their bewilderment, however, is in itself rather bewildering, if not downright disingenuous. Not only has the GOP consistently opposed the very existence of the CFPB, but Republicans have more recently registered strong opposition to specific new rules proposed by the agency that would have helped bring Wells Fargo’s misconduct into the open sooner.Those rules concern Americans’ rights to band together to sue banks and other companies over shenanigans of the sort Wells Fargo was caught engaging in: Opening up millions of bank and credit card accounts for their customers without them knowing about it.“If there were ever a textbook case where consumers needed protection this was it,” Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said in his opening remarks Tuesday. Wells Fargo customers were surprised to get debit cards in the mail, rack up fees on accounts that they didn’t know existed, get calls from collection agencies over unpaid fees and see their credit ratings plummet.Shelby, who has consistently spoken out against the CFPB and its proposed new rules, said regulators should explain why they waited until 2016 to step in. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) raised the same issue with The Huffington Post later that day.Yet Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) helped answer that very question at the hearing: Wells Fargo customers weren’t allowed to join together and file class action lawsuits against the bank. Those kinds of suits would’ve more quickly brought justice to thousands. But Wells Fargo, like all big banks, has strict provisions in place to protect itself from ever being subjected to these kinds of lawsuits ― or any kind of public suit filed by a customer. Indeed, Wells Fargo customers agree they won’t sue the bank when they sign up for their accounts.Buried in the fine print in bank customers’ checking account and credit card contracts are provisions that block them from joining with other customers facing similar problems, Warren explained. Instead, individuals are forced to go through “arbitration,” a private closed hearing before a judge who is typically hired by the bank. Forced arbitration made it easier for Wells Fargo to cover up its tracks, CFPB director Richard Cordray told Warren at the hearing on Tuesday. Indeed, just last year a federal court in California tossed a lawsuit filed by two Wells Fargo customers who had accounts created without their knowledge. The court ruled that their cases had to be resolved privately in arbitration, as per their contract with the bank. Not only were these two customers banned from joining with other aggrieved people to sue the bank ― they couldn’t even publicly bring individual suits against Wells Fargo. “The bank invoked fine print on a real account to block redress on a fake account,” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) explained during the Senate hearing.“If we had class actions on this back in 2010, 2009, 2008, then the problem never would have gotten so out of hand,” said Warren, who came up with the idea for the CFPB in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Here’s why this matters, as explained by Paul Bland, the executive director of Public Justice, a nonprofit law firm that represents consumers:“If a bank systematically cheated 10,000 customers in the same way, the bank could use its arbitration clause to stop those customers from going to court together,” Bland wrote in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee earlier this year. “Each individual had to figure out the scam, figure out what their rights were and then spend time and money fighting the bank. In the incredibly inefficient system that banks foisted on their own customers, everyone was essentially on their own. In contrast, a class action could offer all 10,000 people a fair shot at justice.”The House financial services hearing was considering new rules proposed by the CFPB that would limit forced arbitration and make it easier for people to file class actions.With forced arbitration, bank customers often have little idea that they’ve signed their rights away. And few have the resources to take up grievances via private arbitration ― in some cases, banks will force customers to pay the costs of the hearings upfront.Even if customers do confront the bank, the whole process is hidden from the public. “A feature of arbitration that the banks particularly love is that it’s nearly always all secret,” Warren said on Tuesday. “Filings and documents aren’t available. Even if the customer wins, there’s no public record of it like there would be if we were in a court case.”Outside of banking, companies use arbitration to settle sex and racial discrimination cases filed by their employees, which does little to stop those kinds of issues. Other employees facing similar harassment have no idea when a private arbitration takes place. They’re left alone; the practice continues. Earlier this year, Fox News tried to force a sex harassment case filed against its chairman, Roger Ailes, into arbitration ― but it was too late. Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox anchor who filed the case, did so publicly, hoping to get around the arbitration rules. The result: Fox ousted Ailes and a widespread culture of harassment was outed to the public.While forced arbitration has been widely criticized by consumer advocates, conservative justices on the Roberts Supreme Court have issued rulings protecting companies’ right to use the secret systems.Shelby and other congressional Republicans argue that arbitration is faster and more effective in redressing the complaints of wronged customers than a jury trial. The CFPB “downplays or ignores [arbitration’s] potential benefits to individuals,” Shelby said in a statement in April.Yet the only benefit the obscure provision seems to have provided in the Wells Fargo case was to prolong the amount of time the bankers could rip off their customers.If the Republicans who want to gut the CFPB succeed, that “would make it impossible for it to ever stop this kind of fraud again,” Bland told HuffPost.And Wells Fargo might not be the only bank engaged in the practice of opening phony accounts, according to a recent report from the National Employment Law project. Banks, desperate for revenue, are getting more aggressive in marketing and selling services to their customers, and the chances for malfeasance are high.On Wednesday, the law firm that tried unsuccessfully to file a class action against Wells Fargo last year put out a call to find customers similarly wronged by other banks.Whether they’ll be able to get those cases into a public courtroom remains to be seen.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

The U.S. Justice Department has launched a separate, civil rights investigation about the use of force by officers.At a news conference in front of the Tulsa County courthouse, lawyers for Crutcher’s family released enlarged still images from the police videos they said showed the vehicle’s window was closed and stained with blood after Crutcher was shot.“He is not threatening to anyone,” lawyer Benjamin Crump said. “How can he be reaching into the car if the window is up and there is blood on the glass?”Crutcher’s family called the shooting a criminal act and is seeking charges.About 200 people gathered for a peaceful protest in front of Tulsa’s Civic Center Plaza on Tuesday night, holding signs reading: “Justice 4 Crutch” and calling for Shelby to be arrested.Scott Wood, a lawyer for Shelby, told the Tulsa World that Crutcher ignored repeated commands from the officer.“He has his hands up and is facing the car and looks at Shelby, and his left hand goes through the car window, and that’s when she fired her shot,” said Wood, who could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.Police said they received two calls of a car being broken down and blocking a road. Shelby’s unit was one that stopped to investigate. Police also said a vial of PCP was later found in his vehicle.‘BAD DUDE’In one video shot from a police helicopter, a person is heard saying Crutcher is not following police instructions.A voice from the helicopter then says: “That looks like a bad dude too, could be on something.” An officer is seen with a weapon drawn before Crutcher drops to the ground, and a female officer can be heard on police radio saying: “Shots fired.”The video shows Crutcher on his back with what appears to be blood oozing from his torso.A separate police dashcam video also shows the officer with a weapon drawn and following Crutcher as he walks to his vehicle with his hands in the air. A pop is heard as he appears to place his hands on the vehicle and he falls a few seconds later.Crutcher’s twin sister, Tiffany, said her brother was a church-going man who had enrolled at Tulsa Community College to better his life.“That big ‘bad dude,’ his life mattered,” she told a separate news conference on Monday.(Additional reporting by Susan Heavey in Washington and Nick Oxford in Tulsa, Okla.; Writing by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Andrew Hay and Peter Cooney)"

One officer was sent to the hospital after being struck in the head by a rock, police said.Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts urged for calm.“The community deserves answers and (a) full investigation will ensue,” she said on Twitter, adding in a subsequent post, “I want answers too.”Scott was shot by officer Brentley Vinson earlier in the day, according to Charlotte-Mecklenburg police. The shooting occurred when officers were at an apartment complex searching for a suspect with an outstanding warrant and they saw Scott get out of his vehicle with a firearm, the department said.Vinson fired his weapon and struck Scott, who “posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers,” the department said in a statement.Vinson, who joined the Charlotte police force in July 2014, is black, according to the department. He has been placed on paid administrative leave.NATIONAL DEBATEThe fatal shooting came amid an intense national debate over the use of deadly force by police, particularly against black men.Police did not immediately say if Scott was the suspect they had originally sought at the apartment complex. WSOC-TV, a local television station, reported that he was not.Detectives recovered the gun Scott was holding at the time of the shooting and were interviewing witnesses, police said.Protesters and Scott’s family disputed that the dead man was armed. Some family members told reporters that Scott had been holding a book and was waiting for his son to be dropped off from school. Shakeala Baker, who lives in a neighboring apartment complex, said she had seen Scott in the parking lot on previous afternoons waiting for his child. But on Tuesday, she watched as medics tended to Scott after he was shot, she said.“This is just sad,” said Baker, 31. “I get tired of seeing another black person shot every time I turn on the television. But (police are) scared for their own lives. So if they’re scared for their lives, how are they going to protect us?”About 200 people gathered earlier Tuesday night for a peaceful protest in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where a white officer killed an unarmed black man last week in an incident captured on police videos.Lawyers for the family of Terence Crutcher, 40, disputed that he posed any threat before he was shot by Tulsa Officer Betty Shelby after his sport utility vehicle broke down on Friday.(Reporting by Brendan O’Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Tom Heneghan)"

26,POLITICS,John Lewis Calls For Federal Observers To Be Placed At Polling Stations On Election Day,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-lewis-federal-observers-elections_us_57e2b7cae4b08d73b82eda54,But a 2013 court decision restricted the Justice Department's authority to dispatch officials.,2016-09-21,"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), listens to Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), speak during a discussion on the state of voting rights in America on Sept. 21.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e2c4c3130000930639d965.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Civil rights icon John Lewis called on the Obama administration Wednesday to dispatch federal election observers to polling stations in states that have recently restricted voting rights. But it wouldn’t be easy. The Georgia Democrat pointed to a wave of states that began enacting voting restrictions after the 2010 midterm elections, chipping away at a key achievement by the civil rights movement to end racial discrimination at the ballot box. This year, 14 states will have new voting restrictions in place for the first time in a presidential election year since the 1965 Voting Rights Act.“In past few months and years I’ve traveled across the country and I know that there is a deliberate persistent systematic effort to make it harder and more difficult for the disabled, student, senior, minority, the poor and rural voters to participate in the democratic process,” Lewis said during a voting rights roundtable on Wednesday. “That’s not right, not fair, and it’s not just.”In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, leaving it to Congress to revise the law. Lewis called it a “shame” and “disgrace” that Congress has not acted. Though House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) supports bringing up a reauthorization of the act for a vote and controls the chamber floor, he has left that task to the whims of his members. Judiciary Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) opposes updating the law. In the aftermath of the ruling, recent restrictions passed by states include new photo I.D. requirements, a cutback in early voting days, and the elimination of same-day registration.“In certain states we should ask for federal protection, federal observers,” Lewis said. “The election could be stolen on Election Day at polling places.” In past elections the Justice Department assigned poll observers to large number of states. In 2006, the federal government sent 800 monitors to 20 states. Those numbers took a drastic hit in the 2014 midterms after the Supreme Court’s ruling; monitors were sent to just seven states. This year the Justice Department can only send observers to five states, according to a Reuters report. Eleven states had met the department’s criteria for needing monitors. The cutbacks make it harder for the department to keep an eye on regions with a history of racial discrimination and past polling problems.The DOJ declined a Huffington Post request for comment on Lewis’ remarks.The department has not announced how many observers it will dispatch on Election Day. “Our ability to deploy them has been severely curtailed,” Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in July of the high court’s ruling.
