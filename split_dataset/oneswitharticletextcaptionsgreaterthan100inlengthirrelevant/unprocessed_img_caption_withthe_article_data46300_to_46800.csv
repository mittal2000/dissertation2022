0,BUSINESS,Working While Sick Isn’t A Hillary Thing. It’s An American Thing.,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-presenteeism_us_57d6e18fe4b00642712ea22b,Many think taking sick days is a sign of weakness.,2016-09-12,"Hillary Clinton walked out of her daughter's apartment building on Sunday for the cameras. Earlier in the day, she'd left an event because she wasn't feeling well.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d6e9601800002f00313fb4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s not just Hillary Clinton. Working while sick is a widespread American phenomenon, ingrained in our public policy and embedded in our workaholic, and often male-dominated, office culture.By attending an event on Sunday while sick with pneumonia, Clinton succumbed to “presenteeism,” or showing up to work when you’re really not feeling well. The goal: to demonstrate that you’re a hard worker and that you’re not fragile or weak.That’s a particularly important notion for the country’s first major-party female presidential nominee ― and judging by some reactions, Clinton succeeded on that score.Working while sick is considered rather heroic in some circles. A 2014 survey found that about one-quarter of U.S. workers say they always go to work when they’re sick. Sixty-seven percent said those who did their job while ill were hard workers, according to the survey from the National Sanitation Foundation.Arriving early, staying late and demonstrating total commitment to one’s job at the expense of one’s health and family is part of the subtle masculinity contest going on at the highest levels of the workforce, Jennifer Berdahl, a professor at the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia, recently told The Huffington Post.In this way, white collar work has almost morphed into a “physical feat.” It’s “extreme” work, Berdahl said. (Even though you’re sitting down most of the time.) This is particularly true in traditionally male professions like law and business consulting, she said.“Complete work devotion isn’t necessarily a man’s thing, but it’s been constructed that way,” Berdahl said.So it seems pretty clear why Clinton didn’t just take a timeout. The former secretary of state has been dealing with a flood of right-wing conspiracy theories about her health in recent weeks and likely wouldn’t have wanted to fan those rhetorical flames. (Oh, well.)People who show up to work sick do so for a number of reasons, but broadly speaking they feel they have no choice, concluded one meta-analysis of previous studies first published last November. Some know they’ll be penalized for taking sick time. Others believe they’ll be judged negatively for taking time off.One assumes that Clinton also felt a strong commitment to attend a memorial for those who died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which took place during her time as a New York senator. Still, Clinton had a choice. While taking a sick day may have hurt her politically, it certainly wouldn’t have been financially devastating. Many Americans can’t afford to be ill. The U.S. is the only wealthy developed economy in the world that doesn’t mandate some form of paid sick leave. Thirty-five percent of workers aren’t paid when they take time off because they’re ill. The percentage is much higher for low-income workers and those in the service sector.So, a lot of people are showing up sick and maybe infecting co-workers ― and sometimes customers.Indeed, People magazine reported on Monday that several senior staffers on Clinton’s team were also sick. It’s unclear if any of them took time off, but the suggestion that illness spread among them would seem to indicate that presenteeism has infected the campaign.Makes sense. There’s only about two months left until the election and the pressure is on. One doubts Clinton will give herself much time to relax and recover from her bout with pneumonia.However, if elected, she may help ensure that more people can take a sick day. Clinton’s platform calls for guaranteed paid timeoff for serious medical reasons for all Americans. Donald Trump’s does not."
1,QUEER VOICES,Last Words: Ginger Minj Reflects On ‘RuPaul’s All Stars Drag Race’,James Michael Nichols,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/drag-race-all-stars-ginger_us_57d6c287e4b03d2d459b603b,"""I don’t know if it changed me, but it changed my life.""",2016-09-12,"""Theater is my passion, my entire life, and it lead me to drag.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d6c798180000e000313ef5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Throughout the second season of “RuPaul’s All Stars Drag Race,” Huffington Post Queer Voices will interview each departing queen on the Friday following the air date of their elimination episode. Check HuffPost Queer Voices weekly to hear these queens reflect on their time on the show and their legacy as queer artists and performers.The third episode of “RuPaul’s All Stars Drag Race” was highly entertaining, with each of the contestants portraying some of the “baddest bitches” in herstory in a giant, theatrical number that gave each of them a chance to shine.The much-beloved Katya came in the bottom two alongside “glamour toad” Ginger Minj, leaving the power of elimination in the hands of Alyssa Edwards following her lip-sync win.The decision was a complicated one, with Katya technically coming out as the bottom contestant, but Alyssa recognizing the fan backlash that would ensure from sending season seven’s Miss Congeniality home so early. As a result, Ginver Minj got the boot and became the third queen to sashay away this season.The Huffington Post caught up with Ginger last week to discuss how things panned out on the show and what we can expect from her in the future. The Huffington Post: Let’s talk about your life between season seven of “Drag Race” and the premiere of “All Stars.” How did it change and what did you do with the platform that the show gave you?Ginger Minj: I had no time between season seven and “All Stars”! But changes occurred out of nowhere. I gave it a shot and overnight became known around the world. I don’t know if it changed me, but it changed my life.How does it feel to be pitted against people that you care about and have worked extensively with in such a direct way? How did this play out specifically with Katya?It sucked! Katya, for the last two years, has been my best friend. The last thing you want to do when you care about someone is hurt them. I knew no matter what, I would hurt her, and she would hurt me. She wanted to stay but would feel guilty if I left, and I felt the same way. There was no way to leave feeling good.Alyssa broke the agreement all of the girls made ― why do you think she did this? How did you feel in that moment?Something in my head told me from the time we were announced as the bottom two that I would go home. I don’t feel it was personal... there was some reason, I am not sure what it is or how it benefits her or why she decided to flip the script, but it’s not like she broke a rule. She was told to pick and she did.Did you feel like there were politics at play in Alyssa’s decision? Can we expect you to, as Ru put it, “get revenge” later in the season?I feel like the revenge thing is not specific against Alyssa. It’s just against the system, like you wanna say screw you, this is why I shouldn’t have been sent home! I feel like there were politics. Katya is one of the most beloved in “Drag Race” history and no one wants to be responsible for sending her home. But she earned that love and admiration. You have to think of it as a game and there is no rhyme or reason as to why we make decisions, but hopefully they get you one step closer to the prize.You are an incredibly talented performer, particularly in the tradition of Broadway. How do you hope to utilize this skill set post-”Drag Race?”I want to be on Broadway. I want to sing and act and pretend to dance. Theater is my passion, my entire life, and it lead me to drag. I hope for more opportunities.Was there anyone who was not on “All Stars” that you think deserved to be there?Out of 100 girls yeah, a lot that truly deserve to be there! Porkchop, she’s infamous within the community.What can we expect from Ginger Minj in the future?Well, I have a lot goin’ on! I’m releasing an album in a couple of weeks. We worked really hard on it for a year and a half. And I just filmed a pilot for a TV show that’s in the top five for project to get the greenlight, and I’m a main character in that.Stay tuned for more from this season’s queens. Missed the previous interviews with the eliminated queens? Head here for CoCo Montrese and here for Tatianna."
2,POLITICS,"How Donald Trump Bought, Squabbled And Sued His Way To Becoming A Force In Florida",Sam Stein and Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-force-in-florida_us_57d70e37e4b09d7a687f0421,It wasn't just the attorney general he hoped to influence.,2016-09-12,"Donald Trump and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi attend the Palm Beach Lincoln Day Dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Palm Beach, Florida.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d7120d1300002a0039b851.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Years before he cozied up to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Donald Trump attempted to make similar inroads into the state’s top law enforcement office. On Oct. 3, 2006, the real estate mogul cut a $500 check to Walter “Skip” Campbell, the Democrat running for attorney general, according to campaign finance reports. Twenty-five days later, he reversed course, writing a $500 check to Campbell’s Republican opponent, Bill McCollum. As the election neared and McCollum’s prospects brightened, Trump gave a $1,000 check to the pro-McCollum group Citizens Speaking Out Committee, Inc. Three years later, when McCollum was making a run for governor, Trump was once again there to help. In January 2010, he held a $500-per-head fundraiser for McCollum’s gubernatorial campaign at his posh resort, Mar-a-Lago.The money that Trump gave McCollum was dwarfed by the $25,000 his foundation contributed to Bondi before she opted not to join a lawsuit against Trump University. But it still illustrates a side of Trump that has complicated his run for the presidency. His contention that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton engages in pay-to-play politics has been undermined by his own history of deploying his vast financial resources and celebrity to influence politicians. This was especially true in Florida. “I would consider Trump to be a fairly significant player in politics,” said Ron Book, a longtime Florida lobbyist. “Any notion that Trump didn’t directly communicate with a broad array of Florida political figures over the last decade would just be misleading the public.”By the time Trump hosted McCollum at Mar-a-Lago, his university and a seminar program to which he’d lent his name ― The Trump Institute ― were earning reputations as fraudulent enterprises. And numerous complainants were asking the attorney general’s office, which McCollum headed, to help them recuperate money. McCollum told The Huffington Post that he was personally unaware of the complaints, saying the cases were likely handled by consumer protection officials. But the issue wasn’t exactly hidden from public view. In May 2010, the New York Daily News reported that McCollum’s office was looking into the complaints. His office ultimately never took legal action, passing the matter along to Bondi. McCollum said he never talked to Trump about the seminars, nor did Trump ever press him for legislative or business favors at Mar-a-Lago or when the two met separately at Trump Tower in New York. The meetings, instead, were geared toward building a fairly common type of political relationship: McCollum wanted financial support and Trump, he imagined, wanted access. “I was aware of the fact that he was a businessman and prominent,” McCollum said, noting that he had to run against a wealthy self-funder in current Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R). “It didn’t make him a special target for me. But it would show me as a candidate that he had the means to contribute and was known to make contributions. So I hoped he would contribute to me.”“I’m not surprised that he contributed to both sides, to [Walter] ‘Skip’ [Campbell] and me both in that ‘06 race,” McCollum went on. “A lot of people do that. Especially businesspeople who didn’t have a particular passion for one political party or another. They were hoping to get an audience.”As his business empire expanded through Florida, Trump pursued an audience and favors in many venues. In addition to backing multiple attorneys general, he donated to state senators, governors (Jeb!), lieutenant governors, and House members. He used affiliated companies to skirt donation limits. And his contributions occasionally followed Florida politicians outside the state. When Bondi took over as chair of the Republican Attorneys General Association in 2014, for example, Trump made a $5,000 donation to the group. Trump often operated at the intersection of business and government. Starting in 2013, he began employing a high-powered lobbyist in the state. And around that same time, he turned Mar-a-Lago into a fundraising base, hosting events for Republicans in its ballrooms year after year. By 2016, he was bragging about how much money he’d brought in for local party hacks.“Nobody would have believed this five or six years ago,” Trump said in his speech before Palm Beach County Republicans. “We started, what, five years ago? And we were sort of on the poverty level at that point, right? We weren’t like this … My hand is falling off. I’m taking picture after picture after picture. Hundreds and hundreds of pictures. I was just telling Pam [Bondi] they’re getting $25,000 a picture and I’m getting nothing, right? This wasn’t like that five years ago, was it?”Trump hasn’t shied away from his history of political donations. On the presidential campaign trail, he’s openly conceded that he gave to politicians for the purpose of currying favor. What’s underappreciated, however, is the extent of the favors he tried to curry. In Florida, Trump wasn’t just trying to fend off investigations into his for-profit university. He was invested in building golf courses and constructing buildings; securing tax breaks and defying landscaping regulations around the properties he owned. And he wasn’t above petty squabbling to get his way. Asked about Trump’s reputation, one Republican operative told HuffPost: “It’s very mixed. A lawsuit a day.”Mar-a-Lago was the site of one such infamous fight. In October 2006, Trump and Palm Beach officials battled over the installation of a giant American flag on the property. As Politico reported in detail, the town fined Trump $250 a day for as long as the flag stood, saying it violated ordinances. Trump took the battle to Nancy Grace’s TV show before using his favorite weapon ― the lawsuit. He sued the city for $25 million. Trump eventually dropped the case after the city agreed to drop its fines. He was allowed to have a slightly downsized flag and said he would donate $100,000 to veterans charities.These kinds of squabbles weren’t an aberration. In Doral, a city of 50,000, trouble started when Trump bought a golf course in 2012. He whined about the condition of utility poles around the property and complained on Twitter: “In my opinion, one of the worst utility companies in the country is Florida Power and Light.” Trump also went to war with homeowners who lived around the course. He thought their $500,000 homes were enough of a blight that in the process of renovations, he planted a dense wall of palm trees around the course. “What happens is when you are on, as an example, the first green on the golf course, you are staring at houses with laundry hanging out their window in some cases, he said at the time. “It’s not appropriate for the finest resort in the country.”The neighbors, who prized the view of the famous course, complained to Doral officials, and Trump and Co. alleged that some trees had been damaged or chopped do. One resident claimed her backyard had become a dumping ground for golf course refuse that attracted rats. But Trump was undeterred. He hired the law firm of a former U.S. Attorney for the state to individually sue eight residents. And he didn’t stop there. In late October 2014, Trump gave a $5,000 check to a group called Citizens For a United Doral. The group was a small-time shop, taking in checks totaling all of $130,000. Its principal, Gustavo Garagorry, refused to answer questions about what he exactly did. But Sasha Tirador, a political consultant with GR Strategies, the firm that was paid to do much of the group’s work, revealed that it was involved in one local race in particular: a city council contest between the incumbent, Bettina Rodriguez-Aguilera and a former councilman, Pete Cabrera.Why would Trump be interested in this race? Rodriguez-Aguilera had not voted for a budget that would have included $2.5 million for the Miss Universe Pageant, which Trump ran at the time. But, in addition to that, she had sponsored a bill to help the 250 or so “angry residents at City Hall who lost scenic views of golf courses after billionaire Donald Trump planted giant areca palms between their yards and his golf courses,” according to the Miami Herald.Cabrera won the election.When contacted by HuffPost, Rodriguez-Aguilera was shocked to learn about Trump’s involvement with Citizens For a United Doral. “[Trump] had done a lot of negative things to our residents,” she explained, saying her opposition to him was just. “Those were the right things to do at that time.” Ultimately, Doral bureaucrats investigated the palm tree issue and found there were gopher-sized holes in the city’s landscaping ordinances. The trees were legal and the city eventually worked out a compromise with the golf course, which Cabrera helped negotiate. “I think it’s safe to say he won no fans around his resort by ringing it with palm trees,” said Evan Owen, the communications manager for the city of Doral. “The city amended its landscaping code to prevent repetitions of this.”The dispute over the palm trees wasn’t without fallout, though. Doral officials had been planning to give Trump a key to the city, but balked as his golf course renovations caused public backlash. Doral Mayor Luigi Boria, who had favored awarding a key, backtracked. “Trump doesn’t deserve my key” he said. But by that point, Trump had enough clout to get his superficial recognition (he let it be known that he was “thinking about moving his whole corporate office to Doral”) ― and enough political support, too. The mayor reversed course again, a few days after the Miss Universe Pageant was hosted in Doral. The city council took up a motion to consider awarding the key, and the member who introduced it was none other than Cabrera. Trump is “more than deserving of a key,” he said. This past month, Cabrera helped beat back a measure that would have reassessed property taxes on Trump’s Doral golf course. Cabrera and the Trump campaign did not return a request for comment.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

This is the story of their journey, which has yet to end, as the closing of borders has continued to tear them apart.HAMBURG, GERMANY – Mazen, 25, was walking in downtown Raqqa when the sound of a loudspeaker crackled above the noises of the city.“Head toward the National Hospital to identify the bodies there,” a voice boomed in formal Arabic, echoing from a nearby mosque’s tower. “There are 28 bodies.”Mazen found himself walking toward the hospital with a crowd of Raqqa residents, unsure what to expect. Once inside, however, he recognized the body of his 17-year-old cousin, Mustafa, with a bullet wound in his neck.In shock, Mazen took the body, got into a taxi and went to a relative’s house near the city’s graveyard. There, he called Mustafa’s father, Al-Mu’tasim Khalaf.It was January 10, 2014, and Mustafa had gone missing a few days before. Khalaf had no idea that his son was among the 28 prisoners taken earlier that month by the burgeoning armed group in the city, the so-called Islamic State.Over the past two years, Khalaf and his wife, Tamadur al-Muhawish, had kept their distance from the different armed groups that found footholds in their city. A father of three sons and seven daughters, Khalaf sold agricultural tools for a living. The family had supported the initial peaceful demonstrations against the longstanding government of President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 but did not affiliate with the armed opposition groups that sprang up after the government violently cracked down on protesters.In late 2013, fighters from ISIS began to infiltrate Raqqa, targeting anyone who refused to pledge allegiance to their self-proclaimed caliphate. Militants, dressed in black from head to toe, would crucify fighters from armed opposition groups, leaving their corpses on public display for days.They were quickly becoming a formidable force, and in January 2014, ISIS militants arrested 28 young men, all between the ages of 16 and 21. Armed opposition factions arrested a number of the militants in retaliation, and eventually the two parties agreed on a prisoner exchange. But ISIS never held up their end of the deal.“I did not believe my cousin when he told me,” said Khalaf. “My son had done nothing wrong. All he wanted was freedom.”Mustafa was a high school student when the anti-government demonstrations began in 2011 and had rushed to the streets to protest with his friends. Later, he became frustrated with the Islamic State’s increasing presence in the city, his father said, feeling the uprising had been hijacked. Khalaf thinks his son was killed for his anti-Islamic State beliefs.“For three months after his death, I was not able to sleep,” said Khalaf.During those three months, ISIS threatened the grieving family to either pledge allegiance to the group or be arrested as “infidels.” To save their lives, the Khalaf family decided to leave the country. They fled Raqqa for Turkey on April 15, 2014 – just two and a half months before ISIS took total control of Raqqa. Mazen, the cousin who had found Mustafa’s body, was detained shortly afterward and is still missing today.Moving between cities in southern Turkey, the Khalaf family struggled to make ends meet. A few of the daughters found work tailoring clothes, but their income was not enough to survive and their savings were running out.By the summer of 2015, Khalaf had decided to leave for Europe, taking his three oldest children with him. Not having the money needed to smuggle the entire family at once, his wife Tamadur and the family’s youngest six daughters stayed behind in Turkey.Khalaf and his eldest children arrived in Germany in July 2015 and applied for asylum. Worried that reunification applications would take a long time, as European laws continued to change with the steady influx of refugees, Khalaf asked a cousin who was still in Syria to sell a piece of their family land. He sent the money to Tamadur, hoping the rest of the family would be able to join them in Germany using the same smuggling route.Tamadur and the girls set off from the Turkish coastal city of Izmir on January 27, 2016, crossing the Aegean Sea in a rubber dinghy. Following their registration at the Greek island of Lesbos, they headed north toward the Macedonian border.But Macedonia was starting to clamp down on its borders, leaving Tamadur and the girls stranded with thousands of other refugees in the unofficial refugee camp of Idomeni, Greece. Near an abandoned train station on the Greek border with Macedonia, Tamadur and the girls lived in a tent for an entire, freezing month.“Every time I talked to them, they were scared or sick,” said Khalaf.Tamadur and her daughters were registered with a United Nations program that allowed 200 people to cross the border every day, but by the time their turn came, Macedonian authorities canceled the agreement. On March 9, Macedonia sealed its border completely.The family has been separated for 18 months now. Tamadur and the six youngest daughters are stuck in Athens, seven of the 57,000 refugees currently trapped in Greece as a result of Europe’s crackdown on the influx of displaced people.“I thought that by leaving Syria, I might start over and stop constantly thinking of Mustafa,” Tamadur told Syria Deeply. “But every time [my children] ask me about their father, I break into tears because I do not have an answer for them.”Khalaf sends a portion of his monthly stipend to Tamadur, who is staying at a friend’s house. Tamadur said she had not received any humanitarian aid and urgently needs medical attention for her thyroiditis.Khalaf and the oldest children have received their residency permits and are attending German-language courses. The application for family reunification is pending, and the family’s only means of communication is through phone messaging services like Viber and WhatsApp.“Now all we can do is wait,” said Khalaf.This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply.

It reserved the right to respond with all forms of firepower to any violation by “armed groups.”Rebel groups fighting to topple President Bashar al-Assad did not immediately declare publicly whether they would respect the ceasefire, but rebel sources said they would do so, despite reservations about a deal they see as skewed in Assad’s favor.A rebel commander in northern Syria said there was “cautious calm” at the start of the ceasefire.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group, said calm prevailed on most frontlines after the ceasefire took effect.Russia is a major backer of Assad, while the United States supports some of the rebel groups fighting to topple him.The agreement’s initial aims include allowing humanitarian access and joint U.S.-Russian targeting of jihadist groups, which are not covered by the agreement.The agreement comes at a time when Assad’s position on the battlefield is stronger than it has been since the earliest months of the war, thanks to Russian and Iranian military support. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed in the conflict and 11 million made homeless in the world’s worst refugee crisis.Hours before the truce took effect, an emboldened Assad vowed to take back all of Syria. In a gesture loaded with symbolism, state television showed him visiting Daraya, a Damascus suburb long held by rebels but recaptured last month after fighters surrendered in the face of a crushing siege.“The Syrian state is determined to recover every area from the terrorists,” Assad said in an interview broadcast by state media, flanked by his delegation at an otherwise deserted road junction. Earlier he performed Muslim holiday prayers alongside other officials in a bare hall in a Daraya mosque.He made no mention of the ceasefire agreement, but said the army would continue its work “without hesitation, regardless of any internal or external circumstances”.The ceasefire is the boldest expression yet of hope by the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama that it can work with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war. All previous diplomatic initiatives have collapsed in failure.The Obama administration opposes Assad but wants to shift the focus of fighting from the multi-sided civil war between Assad and his many foes to a campaign against Islamic State, an ultra-hardline jihadist group that controls swathes of Syria and neighboring Iraq.The ceasefire deal is backed by foreign countries ranging from Assad’s ally Iran to Turkey, one of the main supporters of groups fighting to overthrow him.But maintaining the ceasefire means overcoming big challenges, including separating nationalist rebels who would be protected under it from jihadist fighters who are excluded.The rebels say the deal benefits Assad, who took advantage of the aftermath of the last failed truce hammered out by Washington and Moscow in February to improve his forces’ position on the battlefield.The capture of Daraya, a few kilometers from Damascus, has helped the government secure important areas to the southwest of the capital near an air base. The army has also completely encircled the rebel-held half of Aleppo, Syria’s largest city before the war, which has been divided into government and opposition-held zones for years.BOMBING BEFORE TRUCE TAKE EFFECTIn the hours before the ceasefire took effect, fighting raged on several key frontlines, including Aleppo and the southern province of Quneitra.The commander of a Free Syrian Army (FSA) group in northern Syria said government warplanes had been bombing “like crazy” on Monday, hitting one of his bases.“They are using their planes to hit everywhere - Aleppo, Idlib, the rural areas,” Hassan Haj Ali, commander of the Suqour al-Jabal group, told Reuters.Under the agreement, Russian-backed government forces and opposition groups are expected to halt fighting for a while as a confidence building measure. Opposition fighters are expected to separate from militant groups in areas such as Aleppo.But distinguishing protected rebels from jihadists is difficult, particularly with regards to a group formerly called the Nusra Front, which was al Qaeda’s Syria branch until it changed its name in July.The group, which now calls itself Jabhet Fateh al-Sham, has been playing a vital role in the battle for Aleppo allied with other rebel factions. It remains excluded from the ceasefire, and other rebel groups say government forces or their allies can use its presence as an excuse to hit other targets.Washington has said the ceasefire includes agreement that the government will not fly combat missions in an agreed area on the pretext of hunting fighters from the former Nusra Front. However, the opposition says a loophole would allow the government to continue air strikes for up to nine days.Nationalist rebel groups, including factions backed by Assad’s foreign enemies, wrote to Washington on Sunday to express deep concerns. The letter, seen by Reuters, said the opposition groups would “cooperate positively” with a ceasefire but believed the terms favored Assad.It said the ceasefire shared the flaw that doomed the previous truce: a lack of guarantees or monitoring mechanisms. It also said Jabhet Fateh al-Sham should be included, as the group had not carried out attacks outside Syria despite its previous ties to al Qaeda. Jabhet Fatah al-Sham said the deal aimed to weaken the “effective” anti-Assad forces, and to “bury” the revolution.A source in the opposition told Reuters the powerful Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham, which fights in close coordination with Jabhet Fatah al-Sham, would back the cessation of hostilities in an announcement later on Monday."

Now, apparently, he thinks Putin is ""a stronger leader than Obama.""",2016-09-12,"While in Congress, then-Rep. Mike Pence was a strong critic of Vladimir Putin's treatment of journalists in Russia.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the Republican vice presidential nominee, praised Russian President Vladimir Putin last week by saying that he has been “a stronger leader” than President Barack Obama. As a congressman, however, Pence denounced Putin’s treatment of journalists.Pence co-founded the bipartisan Congressional Caucus for Freedom of the Press in 2006. Its members wrote a letter to then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, urging her to pressure Russian leaders to uphold press freedom and investigate why journalists critical of Putin had been killed.“As the co-founders of the Congressional Caucus for Freedom of the Press, we are especially concerned about the persecution of journalists in Russia, which has been occurring with increasing frequency, severity, and impunity,” the letter read. “An independent media is essential to maintaining the principle and practice of democracy, and the right of freedom of expression is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, and other international agreements to which Russia is a part,” it continued.Russia consistently ranks among the countries where members of the press have the least freedom, and journalists there face constant scrutiny and danger. The Russian government routinely censors media organizations, and there are few independent news sources in the country. At least 34 journalists have been murdered in Russia since Putin took office in 2000, many by government or military officials, according to data from the Committee to Protect Journalists and the Glasnost Defense Foundation, two organizations that track journalist deaths in Russia. Few of these cases have been investigated.Pence’s letter singled out the case of Paul Klebnikov, editor-in-chief of Forbes Russia magazine, as “a tragic example of the kind of murder of journalists that have gone unresolved under President Putin’s Administration.”Klebnikov, who had spent years investigating corruption and graft in Russia, was shot and killed in Moscow in 2004, after his magazine published a list of the wealthiest Russians. He was “the twelfth reporter to be killed in mafia-style assassinations in direct reprisals for their journalism in Russia since President Putin came to power in 2000, and not one of the murderers has been brought to justice,” according to the letter. Klebnikov’s case remains unsolved.Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Pence’s Democratic counterpart on the caucus, called the GOP vice presidential nominee’s newfound praise of Putin “appalling.”“Mike Pence and I founded the Congressional Caucus For Freedom of the Press to highlight attacks on journalists around the world, believing that a free press is an indispensable ingredient for a democratic society,” Schiff told The Huffington Post in a statement. “Mike always associated himself closely with Ronald Reagan, and to now see him and Donald Trump lauding Vladimir Putin as he invades his neighbors and crushes democracy and dissent in Russia is appalling,” the statement continued. “Vladimir Putin hasn’t changed from 2006, but unfortunately it seems that Mike Pence has, and he is no longer willing to condemn the Russian strongman.”Pence unsuccessfully tried to pass a federal “shield law” while in Congress, which would protect journalists from revealing the identities of anonymous sources. But last year, as governor of Indiana, Pence suggested creating a state-run media outlet to compete with independent news sources. He quickly retracted the proposal after widespread opposition — which included critics dubbing it “Pravda on the Plains.”The campaign for GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump did not respond to a request for comment."

The court threw out his multiple convictions in June. Last week, the Department of Justice announced that it wouldn’t seek a retrial of McDonnell or his wife on charges that he accepted lavish gifts and other favors in exchange for using his position as governor to help a Virginia businessman who wanted to promote health supplements.“I was blessed with a faithful and competent legal team, who advocated my cause zealously at every step, committed to prevailing,” he said in a statement after the DOJ announcement.A group of supporters set up a fund to help McDonnell with his legal expenses, but those efforts have only raised about $578,000. Among top donors to the cause was former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who donated $10,000 in 2014, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.Beyond the McDonnell case, it is expected that his vindication by the Supreme Court will reverberate in other federal corruption prosecutions ― including those of Sen.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d70af71300002b0039b82d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More than 25 years ago, Gloria Estefan defied the odds when she walked onto the American Music Awards stage. That emotional 1991 performance came less than a year after the singer had been left “paralyzed” by a horrific bus accident ― by medical standards, it was basically a miracle.Estefan sat down with HuffPost Live on Monday and opened up about the accident, which is featured prominently in “On Your Feet!,” the hit Broadway musical based on her and her husband’s life and rise to fame.In March 1990, then 34-year-old Estefan, her husband and her son were on a tour bus traveling through a “freak snow storm” in the Poconos when a tractor-trailer rear-ended them. Estefan broke two vertebrae.During her conversation with HuffPost, the Cuban-American artist recalled the day Dr. Michael Neuwirth told her she might never walk again. “I’ll never forget, he came into my room and he said ‘OK, this is what science says: It’ll be very difficult for you to [walk], hopefully you can walk... but I doubt you’ll be able to ever perform again. Now, having said that, I can tell you that I’ve seen a lot of things that we’d consider miracles and that it’s up to you what happens with your life.’”Estefan took these words to heart, spending countless hours in the months following on her physical therapy with the hopes of walking again.“I fought like hell,” she said. “I was doing rehab seven hours a day. At the beginning it was floating in the pool for three months because I couldn’t move my limbs. And then step by step, every day I focused on one small goal that I could achieve, and I looked at the big picture but [each] day is what I focused on. And that’s the way to get through any hardship, I think.”And Estefan says her swift recovery was mainly motivated by her family.“My dad was in a wheelchair, so I was very cognizant of what that entails,” she said. “So I knew that I would fight my hardest so that my family wouldn’t have to go through that if it was going to be up to me... I also thought, ‘Ok you know what, I’m going to focus on just getting my life back, being able to stand up and walk.’ I didn’t worry about the career until after.”But Estefan’s career was certainly also in limbo after the accident, which happened not long after a string of hits had helped her and her husband soar to global stardom. “Literally when we crashed, or when we got rear-ended by that 18-wheeler, Emilio was on the phone with his brother reading him the headline in The Miami Herald,” she recalled. “[There was] a picture of us holding a crystal globe, and it said ‘Gloria and Emilio Estefan Have The World in Their Hands’ and then boom, so talk about one-second you’re at the top...’”Watch the artist open up about the accident and the “euphoric” moment when she made her comeback on the AMA stage in the video above.

I assumed it was irritation",2016-09-12,"Reuters journalist Nick Brown works at his laptop at a cafe in San Juan, Puerto Rico, August 8, 2016. Picture taken August 8, 2016. (REUTERS/Alvin Baez)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d6ac691800006c32bd0c77.jpeg?cache=WJA5RRyJjh&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Nick BrownSAN JUAN, Sept 12 (Reuters) - It began with what felt like a punch in the throat.I assumed it was irritation from the cigar I’d smoked on my deck that afternoon in mid-June. But the sensation hung on. Within three days, I had a 102-degree Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius) fever, chills and bed-drenching night sweats.For two weeks, symptoms came in waves. A skin rash. Joint pain. Then a dull throbbing behind my eyes. There was pain and redness too, in a certain exclusively male region, which ibuprofen didn’t relieve.Then, I felt better. But a week later, the symptoms staged a comeback, with more eye pain and something new - small welts on my eyelids and temples. I had sporadic headaches, was so exhausted I slept 10 hours a night and even failed to wake up for a flight.My mother was the first to suspect I was infected with the virus that arrived in Puerto Rico in December 2015, four months after I’d begun an assignment as Reuters’ San Juan bureau chief.Initially, I laughed off her internet diagnosis as the overwrought worries of a long-distance mom. But I agreed to see my long-time physician during a visit home in late June.After listening to my symptoms and learning I’d been working in San Juan, Dr. Kevin Wallace of Murray Hill Medical Group called the New York City Health Department and arranged to have my blood sent for screening. Eight days later, I got the news.Mom was right. I had Zika.EVOLVING KNOWLEDGEHundreds of thousands of people are estimated to have been infected with Zika in the Americas since the virus was detected in Brazil early last year. Most have no symptoms or experience only a mild illness.But it can penetrate the womb in pregnant women, causing a rare but crippling birth defect known as microcephaly. In adults, it has been linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, a temporary paralysis. And it can be passed on through sex, a unique characteristic among mosquito-borne viruses. There is no vaccine or treatment.Last month, the U.S. government declared a public health emergency in Puerto Rico, the hardest hit among states and territories. More than 17,800 infections have been reported on the island, including more than 1,500 among pregnant women, and one case of microcephaly in an aborted fetus.As a journalist and a patient, I’ve had access to some of the brightest minds studying Zika. But the virus has confounded experts at the highest levels and launched a global race to understand its risks.Each month, new findings have led to changes in how the public is advised to stay safe. Compared to what we know about other diseases, such as flu and even Ebola, we are in new territory.In my case, doctors were hard-pressed to explain why my symptoms returned about three weeks after the initial infection. Nor could they tell me how long I could be at risk for Guillain-Barre. Another mystery: were condoms enough to protect against sexual transmission?In the weeks since I’ve recovered, that is proving to be one of the toughest questions to live with.Both men and women can infect their sexual partners. In one case, scientists identified Zika virus in semen six months after the man’s symptoms appeared, though it’s not clear how long it can cause new infections.Public health officials have warned couples not to conceive for at least six months after either a man or woman returns from a Zika outbreak area, even if they show no symptoms.My wife and I, both in our early 30s, have had to consider how dangerous my bout with Zika could be to our plans to have children some day.Our most intimate decisions now are affected by the uncertainty surrounding Zika: how long can I infect my partner? How likely is it that my baby would become sick if I do? Given how rapidly the expertise about Zika has evolved so far, how much faith should we put in the current thinking?SHRUGGING IT OFFWhen I took the one-year post in Puerto Rico, I figured my biggest health risk would be sunburn.Even when Zika began circulating on the island, I didn’t worry. My wife Julie, a lawyer and publishing industry pro, had decided to stay at home in Brooklyn during my assignment, and we weren’t planning to have kids for at least a couple of years. So we gave Zika little more than a shoulder shrug.I’m not sure when I was infected. I picked up more mosquito bites in San Juan than Twitter followers. I didn’t always use bug spray. I worked from home, an apartment in a colonial building without window screens, and kept the deck doors open to save money on air conditioning.Locals are used to mosquito-borne illnesses, including dengue and chikungunya. Some, more concerned about pesticides than Zika, successfully fought aerial spraying with Naled. Many also are concerned about Zika’s threat to tourism, which could compound the island’s vast economic challenges.One friend grew indignant when I mentioned writing this piece. “You’re a journalist,” she said. “You have a responsibility not to perpetuate hysteria.”When I got sick, I didn’t consider going to a doctor in Puerto Rico. The economic crisis has made medical care unpredictable, and the waits are long. When I sought treatment for allergic reactions earlier in my stay, doctors refused my corporate health insurance and demanded cash.Instead, I waited a few days to see Dr. Wallace during my visit to New York. I was his second potential Zika patient, though the first ultimately tested negative for the virus.Eight days after my blood sample was submitted, a woman from the city health department called.Have you heard from your doctor? she asked.“No.”“Oh?” she said. “You haven’t spoken to your doctor at all?”I broke a long pause, saying, “Feel free to let the cat out of the bag.”“Well,” she said, “you tested positive for Zika.”The way it is supposed to work, the results are sent to the patient’s doctor in time to break the news before the city “interviewer” calls to address public health concerns. But Dr. Jay Varma, deputy commissioner of the New York City Health Department, acknowledged that doesn’t always happen.MIXED REACTIONSSome friends in Puerto Rico teased me when they learned I had Zika. Many of them had experienced chikungunya or dengue, and had stories about months of muscle pain or weeks in bed. Friends from the states, on the other hand, showed grave concern, offering thoughts, prayers and condolences. Some kept their distance for weeks. A few questioned whether it was safe for me to be around babies.The evidence shows Zika clears the bloodstream quickly, and the virus doesn’t spread through casual interactions.Julie and I weren’t quite sure how to react. We didn’t take it too seriously at first. I posted a glamour-shot selfie on Facebook with the caption: “This is the face of a man with Zika.”As the weeks passed, it became clear that Julie and I were also a little rattled - and not fully on the same page. She canceled a planned long weekend visit to Puerto Rico. She wanted to minimize her exposure to Zika and arranged instead for us to meet in Florida.This disappointed me. I had hoped to show her my new favorite places on the island. I clung stubbornly to the view that Zika fears were largely overblown. She reminded me that, given the unknowns about Zika’s impact on pregnancy, I was in no position to call the shots.“Try to see it from a woman’s perspective,” she said.We have heard a lot of different things about Zika, even from doctors, and she doesn’t totally trust the idea that the virus is manageable with the current medical advice.What if Zika poses a threat for months or years after infection? If so, could that jeopardize our future plans to start a family? What if we got pregnant before we planned to?We’ve had to manage our different anxieties over the “what ifs” of Zika.FOR SCIENCEThere’s plenty the experts are still figuring out, and that has been reflected in the shifting opinions about my case.Ingrid Rabe, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told meZika generally lasts a few days. While she couldn’t address my specific case, she speculated that a return of symptoms like mine could indicate the presence of a second virus.A few weeks later, Dr. Varma told me it was possible, in severe cases, for symptoms to last longer or recur.Of three acquaintances in Puerto Rico who developed Zika, all have complained, like me, of lingering health problems, in one case for longer than a month.Two weeks into my infection, Dr. Wallace couldn’t tell me whether I remained at risk for Guillain-Barre. The city health interviewer, after consulting with doctors, told me the paralyzing condition would most likely have set in within days of Zika infection, so I was probably out of the woods.Again, the information shifted over time. The CDC’s Rabe later told me it could take “a few weeks” for Guillain-Barre to appear. So far, I haven’t had any symptoms consistent with Guillain-Barre, and here’s hoping it stays that way.Guidance on sex lacked precision as well. The city health interviewer recommended we “use condoms every time” for six months, reflecting CDC guidelines.When I asked whether Zika can spread via saliva or oral sex, the city health interviewer didn’t answer directly. She said it can spread via “sexual activity,” and that saliva is “currently not being tested.” Rabe later told me “there’s been no evidence” that saliva can spread Zika.The city health interviewer asked if I would join a CDC study gauging how long Zika can be spread through semen and urine. I’m one of 140 participants, though protocol calls for up to 250.The study is a bit awkward. But, as a writer always looking for a good story, I could not pass it up.Every two weeks, a study test kit arrives by FedEx in a box with dauntingly detailed instructions on how to produce and package my samples, then overnight them back to the center’s Colorado lab. I also answer a somewhat blush-inducing questionnaire about my recent sexual activity.The CDC staffer assigned to my case sends cheery emails to let me know she has received my samples and sex report, an interaction that feels slightly too intimate. But I endure it in exchange for a $50 Visa gift card for each sample, and, more importantly, for the chance to learn and to contribute to science.The downside: I don’t learn my results until the study ends in December.(Reporting by Nick Brown; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Lisa Girion)"

Others have risked their lives to reach Europe.The number of female-headed Syrian households in Jordan has risen to nearly 40 percent from a quarter a couple of years ago, CARE said. With men struggling to find work or absent, more women are taking up jobs or even setting up small businesses.“We are seeing something very similar to what happened during World War One and Two across Europe whereby women are forced to take on new roles - and there are both positive and negative aspects to this,” CARE policy adviser Howard Mollett told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.In Greece, Syrian refugees estimate half of refugee households to be female-headed. Some have lost male family members in the war, while others are trying to join husbands already living in Europe.Batoul, a Syrian mother who rarely left her home before the war broke out, told CARE how she had spent months travelling thousands of kilometres alone with her baby to try to join her husband in Germany.The first thing she wants to do on reaching Germany is learn the language and look for a job. “My husband is traditional but he will support this. Women are strong and we have a new role to play,” she told CARE at a camp in Serbia.EXPLOITEDAid workers say women refugees arriving in the Balkans are highly vulnerable, generally having less money and fewer resources than men.CARE said some mothers travelling on their own formed sexual relationship in the hope the man would protect them and their children while they were on the road.Women have also described being forced to have sex to secure services and travel documents.Mollett said some of the camps in Europe were shocking and lacked lighting, locks on showers and toilets and separate sleeping sections to keep women and children safe.“While I was in Greece over the past month, multiple stories emerged of human traffickers and other predatory individuals preying on women and children in the official camps as well as those living homeless in the street,” he added.The report, entitled On Her Own, also highlights increasing poverty among refugees with four fifths in Jordan now living below the poverty line.Mollett said rates of child marriage among refugees had almost doubled since the start of the war partly because of increasing destitution.The U.N. refugee summit aims to forge a more humane international response to refugee and migrant crises.It will be followed by a summit of world leaders hosted by U.S. President Barack Obama aimed at generating new funding and boosting refugee resettlement.(Editing by Ros Russell; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, which covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.

Some have lost male family members in the war, while others are trying to join husbands already living in Europe.Batoul, a Syrian mother who rarely left her home before the war broke out, told CARE how she had spent months travelling thousands of kilometres alone with her baby to try to join her husband in Germany.The first thing she wants to do on reaching Germany is learn the language and look for a job. “My husband is traditional but he will support this. Women are strong and we have a new role to play,” she told CARE at a camp in Serbia.EXPLOITEDAid workers say women refugees arriving in the Balkans are highly vulnerable, generally having less money and fewer resources than men.CARE said some mothers travelling on their own formed sexual relationship in the hope the man would protect them and their children while they were on the road.Women have also described being forced to have sex to secure services and travel documents.Mollett said some of the camps in Europe were shocking and lacked lighting, locks on showers and toilets and separate sleeping sections to keep women and children safe.“While I was in Greece over the past month, multiple stories emerged of human traffickers and other predatory individuals preying on women and children in the official camps as well as those living homeless in the street,” he added.The report, entitled On Her Own, also highlights increasing poverty among refugees with four fifths in Jordan now living below the poverty line.Mollett said rates of child marriage among refugees had almost doubled since the start of the war partly because of increasing destitution.The U.N. refugee summit aims to forge a more humane international response to refugee and migrant crises.It will be followed by a summit of world leaders hosted by U.S. President Barack Obama aimed at generating new funding and boosting refugee resettlement.(Editing by Ros Russell; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, which covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.

16,POLITICS,Never Forgetting 9/11 In The Worst Possible Way,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/never-forgetting-911-in-the-worst-possible-way_us_57d4431ce4b03d2d459abd05,"The words of lawmakers promise one thing, but the heroes of Sept. 11 see very different deeds.",2016-09-11,Kenny Anderson and Ray Pfeifer wait outside Mitch McConnell's office hoping to plead for his help passing a new 9/11 bill.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d45c601800006c32bd095b.jpeg?ops=crop_2_141_1278_646%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The lawmakers on Capitol Hill opened their mouths and said the words again as they prepared to leave town for the weekend that would mark 15 years since terrorists flew planes into the World Trade Center.The words were some variety of “never forget.”“This weekend America will remember not only the horror of those attacks, but also the heroism of our response,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Thursday on the Senate floor, spilling a little bit of the glory on himself.“It is impossible to forget the horrible events of that day, and the pain and grief and mourning that our country felt,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) also pledged to never forget in his part of a 10-minute remembrance ceremony on the steps of the Capitol on Friday.He added the proviso that it was up to the people who lived through those grim days to ensure that kids who did not witness Sept. 11 appreciate what the sacrifices meant.“Do they fully understand what happened that day? Will they ever? Can they?” said Ryan, who recalled how he couldn’t get a flight home and had to drive.The words sound right. But forgive the people who actually responded to the nightmare of that clear, warm September morning if they don’t think the lawmakers understand, or don’t believe their pronouncements. Forgive them if they look askance at three men who ― just last year ― never used their power to ease the way for a new 9/11 health and compensation law, who never even signed on as sponsors of that legislation.“These guys. That’s a typical politician bullshit line,” said Ray Pfeifer, a former New York City firefighter who counts himself lucky to be still battling cancers linked to Sept. 11. “They want to be patriots when it’s convenient for them.”And when others are in need, it’s usually not convenient.Pfeifer and dozens of other responders had to spend much of last year traveling to Washington to remind all those lawmakers who say “never forget” to pass a new law before the old one expired.Pfeifer came with his wheelchair. Others toted oxygen tanks to aid their damaged lungs. Jon Stewart came twice, bringing cameras and a spotlight. Eventually, the bill passed on the last day of the legislative year, attached to a massive government funding bill.Any of the leaders could have made it easy. They could have put the bill on their respective chambers’ floors the way they expedite so many other bills, the way McConnell put two anti-Obamacare votes on the Senate calendar on Thursday.They did not. They made ailing responders lobby them for months while using the 9/11 bill as leverage to move items on their own agendas such as lifting an oil export ban.“The way they passed that bill was so ugly — the way it was put on at the last minute, at the last second,” Pfeifer said. “There was no reason why sick 9/11 guys should have been down there. It should have been a kumbaya moment, where we signed the bill and we all, as bipartisans, got on the Capitol steps and praised this thing. But they didn’t want to do that. That was wrong.”Nine months after the bill’s passage, and with nothing at stake, Ryan held that kumbaya moment. And there’s a basic reason why someone like Pfeifer would not be impressed. For first responders, remembering 9/11 is not just about honoring that terrible day and their losses and sacrifices. It’s also about why they were willing to sacrifice in the first place, and why nearly all of them would do it again, regardless of the cost. It’s a day that shows in the clearest way what good people do when others are in desperate need: they act, especially if it’s their job.But that’s not how Congress rolls.And as responders like Pfeifer look at the country today, they see plenty of people who need help and need lawmakers to step in. They see the mosquito-borne Zika virus that causes terrible birth defects. They see the entire city of Flint, Michigan, poisoned by its own water system — and legislation to help those people going nowhere. They see a Senate that won’t vote on Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland because one party hopes its side will get to fill the vacant high court seat next year.“It’s so wrong what they’re doing,” Pfeifer said of Garland, although his own views tilt conservative. “You could vote him down, you could do whatever you want to do, but how do you not vote? That’s another crime that’s going on in this country. It’s wrong.”So when politicians say “never forget” this year — or tweet it on Sunday, as they all will surely do — the meaning of those words is somewhat different for people who still live the consequences of 9/11. There is no forgetting. For them, the words are a reminder of what Congress put them through, and continues to put others through.When Pfeifer hears about Zika, about Flint, about a Supreme Court seat going empty for months on end, he hears the emptiness of the uttered words and knows the he and other responders are fortunate because Congress eventually acted in their case, even if it treated them with callous disregard along the way.There is no assurance that Congress will do anything to redress the impacts of this year’s deadlocked Supreme Court verdicts, or be moved to help lead-poisoned children, or even feel especially responsible if more children are born with microcephaly because lawmakers were slow to respond.“There’s so much stuff that you learn, and I get so upset now,” Pfeifer said. “This is stuff that’s right up front — they should just get it done.”That’s what Pfeifer will never forget.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

17,SPORTS,Solidarity Demonstrations Take Over NFL Opening Weekend,Maxwell Strachan and Peter Andrew Hart,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/national-anthem-protest-seahawks_us_57d30e04e4b00642712d7c90,The movement has spread across the league following Colin Kaepernick's lead.,2016-09-11,Kansas City Chiefs defensive back Marcus Peters raises his fist in the air as the National Anthem plays before Sunday's football game against the San Diego Chargers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d5d9e91800001034bd0b3e.jpeg?ops=crop_17_1063_1628_1234%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Weeks after San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick used the national anthem to protest social inequality, NFL players from around the league got political on Sunday, the 15-year anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.Players from the Seattle Seahawks joined arms while standing during the national anthem. Several players from the opposing Miami Dolphins kneeled, as the Denver Broncos’ Brandon Marshall had done on Thursday.In Sunday’s earlier game, the Kansas City Chiefs also locked arms while cornerback Marcus Peters raised his fist into the air. New England Patriots Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty both raised their fists for the anthem ahead of Sunday’s late game against the Arizona Cardinals, as several Tennessee Titans had earlier.The demonstrations were sparked by San Francisco’s quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who opted to sit during the national anthem in protest of the mistreatment of people of color in the U.S., causing an uproar.“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick had told NFL.com’s Steve Wyche. “To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” Earlier in the week, Seahawks wide receiver Douglas Baldwin Jr. revealed over Twitter that the team hoped to “honor the country and flag” at the game. Linebacker Bobby Wagner said that any action would be a “team thing.” Details of the plan emerged Saturday.Nate Boyer, a free agent long snapper and former U.S. Army Green Beret who spent a summer with the Seahawks, told Fox Sports Radio about the team’s motivation to demonstrate.“They realize that 9/11 is a very important day in our nation’s history,” he said. “The Seahawks, and probably every team, will be honoring those who serve in camouflage and also those in blue who served on such a difficult day. Shortly after 9/11, our country seemed more unified than I had ever experienced and was the most unified it has been since I have been alive. Since that date, we have grown farther apart in our unity. Standing together this Sunday is key to making progress. What the team will do is a powerful sign of unification.”The display of unity comes a little over a week after Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane sat during the national anthem prior to one of the team’s preseason games. Lane said that he made the decision as a show of solidarity with Kaepernick. “I wasn’t trying to say anything, just standing behind Kaepernick,’’ Lane said afterward.The Chiefs released a statement explaining their own demonstration:After having a number of thoughtful discussions as a group regarding our representation during the national anthem, we decided collectively to lock arms as a sign of solidarity. It was our goal to be unified as a team and to be respectful of everyone’s opinions, and the remembrance of 9/11. It’s our job as professional athletes to make a positive impact on our communities and to be proactive when change is needed. Together we are going to continue to have conversations, educate ourselves and others on social issues and work with local law enforcement officials and leaders to make an impact on the Kansas City community.The Dolphins encouraged players to stand during the anthem, but said the team would respect the right of individuals to observe the anthem as they see fit. The demonstrations come amid heightened debate over social inequality and concern over police violence ― issues that have caused athletes to speak out with increasing urgency.Along with protest, Sunday’s games saw players participating in acts of patriotism in tribute to the victims of the September 11 attacks.Some players, including New York Giants Odell Beckham Jr. and Victor Cruz, wore patriotic equipment."

The ceasefire will not apply to the jihadist groups Islamic State or Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, previously known as the Nusra Front until it broke formal allegiance to al Qaeda and changed its name.The U.S. on Saturday warned insurgents they would face “dire consequences” if they cooperate with Jabhet Fatah al-Sham, which fought alongside a range of mainstream and Islamist rebel groups during intense battles in recent weeks in southern Aleppo.More air strikes hit Aleppo and Idlib province on Sunday after scores of people were killed in aerial bombardment on Saturday.One strike in the town of Saraqeb hit a civil defense center where civilian rescuers are based, injuring several, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitor of the war said."
23,RELIGION,God's Wonderful Sense Of Humor,"Matthijs Kronemeijer, Contributorwandering European, political science student",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gods-wonderful-sense-of-humor_us_57cb423ce4b07addc412df67,Last week at Pub Theology we touched on a bit of doctrine that I really like. It's about God's wonderful sense of humor. We,2016-09-11,"An angel on his/her cell phone on one of the flying buttresses of St John's Cathedral, Den Bosch, Netherlands. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57cdcd441600005d1ec00b45.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week at Pub Theology we touched on a bit of doctrine that I really like. It's about God's wonderful sense of humor. We came on it via the topic of fish, which is not coincidental – one of our regulars is in a doctoral program in fisheries and wildlife, while another particularly enjoys catching fish and eating them. In fact the day before we were treated on a very large and very tasty pike, the very same fish that according to legend once instructed the future King Arthur about Might and Right. Similarly, fish can help us understand what God's sense of humor is like. For the sake of drama we do well to imagine a really large fish. Think for example of a 50-foot whale spouting a big fountain of water in the air – the kind of unique sight you'd travel to California to witness. But then the same whale also turns into the sea monster Leviathan that ""God has created to play with"", according to the tragic book of Job (40:29), and/or regurgitates the prophet Jonah, who has just finished his psalm of praise in the whale's belly. Both tragic stories like Job's, and funny but serious stories like Jonah, give us an idea of God's sense of humor. An aspect of this new doctrine that I find particularly amusing is that lots of people can agree on it. Even though they may have overlooked it until now, Jews and Muslims, Protestants and Catholics can all find it in their scriptures. It's almost staring them in the face. After all, humor by definition means the ability to perceive, and express, the comical or unexpected. The Word of God is full of the comical and the unexpected. My wife, who often makes me laugh, mentioned the story of King Saul hunting for David in the mountains of Judea. Saul then goes into a cave ­to relieve himself – exactly the cave where David is hiding. What is the point of this smelly episode? Read the story for yourself, if you want to know. A more tragic fact about this doctrine is that lots of people do not believe in it. They may be unaware of it, since all they've ever learned about the Bible or the Quran focused on abstract or depressing bits of doctrine. Even more worryingly, some Christians and other religious folks display a level of humorlessness in their daily behavior and attitudes that suggests they urgently need a conversion experience. Didn't Jesus have a thing to say about watching the way people live their lives? For others, their all-too-secular worldview dogmatically prevents them from understanding anything about God at all. It would be comical if it weren't so tragic. It is not hard to believe in God's sense of humor, or at least to begin believing. All one needs is a particularly odd bit of creation. Wild animals are great, but pets are good too, and most of the time, humans will also work. For me personally, it's hard not to think of my wife when I think of God's sense of humor. To be sure, there's tragedy here as well ­– to be intimately part of anyone else's life also opens one's eyes to the real tragedies ­that are there – but it's the kind of tragedy that calls on you to love that other person all the more. God's sense of humor is where we can find God as a humane and approachable God, one who is aware of our daily ups and downs. It is like a very colorful and very big tent, set up close to us, where we can laugh, get together as real people and see a little bit of God's splendor ­– almost like the circus we would go to every year with our mom or dad when we were little, but one that is close by, always available and always new. We'd come out refreshed and see the world around us with different eyes. To end on a more down to earth note: what God's sense of humor means to me is that it shows how things can be different. Lots of things can be different, and different for the better: our lives, our jobs, our churches, our universities, and even the politics of this country. It is a thoroughly hopeful perspective, that I wish on everyone. Who'd want for a different one? "

Forty-seven percent say the United States will be safer from terrorism if it stays out of other countries’ affairs.The results mark a shift since 2013, when an Economist/YouGov poll found that 61 percent of Americans favored staying out of other countries’ affairs, with just 39 percent advocating taking action against countries and groups promoting terrorism. While Democrats and independents have both moved toward the latter position since then, the biggest move was among Republicans. Seventy-six percent of Republicans now say the U.S. should intervene against those countries and groups, up 21 points in the past three years.Americans also report feeling somewhat less safe than they did in 2013. Thirty percent of Americans say we’re now safer from terrorist attacks than we were in 2001, while 29 percent say we’re about equally safe and 32 percent that we’re less safe. Three years ago, 40 percent of Americans said safety had increased since the attacks, and just 18 percent said the country was less safe than it was on 9/11.A recent Pew Research survey also found rising concerns about terrorism, with the change mostly driven by Republicans.Coupled with those increased fears is a decreased resistance to security measures. In the 2013 Economist/YouGov poll, 32 percent of Americans said that security and surveillance measures went too far in restricting civil liberties, with 41 percent saying they were about right, and 14 percent that such measures didn’t go far enough. In the most recent poll, just 17 percent of Americans say such measures go too far, while 49 percent say they’re about right, and 23 percent say they don’t go far enough.Other metrics have seen less change.The 27 percent of Americans who say the Obama administration’s policies have made the U.S. more safe, the 38 percent who say they’ve made the country less safe, and the 22 percent who say they haven’t had much effect are similar to the 26 percent, 33 percent and 22 percent, respectively, who said so in the previous survey, with answers remaining divided along partisan lines.A relatively stable 36 percent of Americans say the U.S. has recovered from the terrorist attacks, while 32 percent say it has yet to recover, and 20 percent don’t believe that it ever will. Just 14 percent believe that people focus too much on the memory of 9/11. Fifty-one percent believe the attacks are commemorated about the right amount, while 27 percent would like to see more attention paid to them.Young Americans are the most likely to say there’s too much focus on 9/11 ― 23 percent of those under 30, compared to just 8 percent over age 65, say people put too much of a spotlight on the attacks.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 8-Sept. 9 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here. More details on the polls’ methodology are available here.Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov’s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample, rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error."
