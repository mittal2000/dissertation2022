0,POLITICS,Obama Power Plant Rules Face Key Test In U.S. Court,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-climate-strategy_us_57ea747ce4b0c2407cd9718a,Industry groups and 27 states claim the administration's Clean Power Plan is illegal.,2016-09-27,"U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during the dedication of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, U.S., September 24, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ea74fb1b00007f08ef2819.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s climate change strategy, federal rules curbing greenhouse gas emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants, faces a key test on Tuesday when opponents try to convince a U.S. appeals court to throw out the regulations.Twenty-seven states led by coal-producer West Virginia and industry groups are challenging the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan rules before 10 judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.They argue that the EPA overstepped its regulatory authority under the federal Clean Air Act when the agency issued the rules, which the U.S. Supreme Court has put on hold while the case is litigated.During Tuesday’s arguments, these opponents will face off in court against the EPA, 18 states, corporations including Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google, and a number of cities that support the regulations.The Clean Power Plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels, with each state assigned its own emission reduction target and tasked with designing its own plan to achieve that goal.Power plants are the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions. Nearly 1,500 coal- and gas-fired power plants together emit nearly two billion tons per year of carbon dioxide.The Clean Power Plan is the main tool for the United States to meet the emissions reduction target it pledged to reach at U.N. climate talks in Paris last December.“It’s an invasion, in our estimation, of the state regulatory domain,” Scott Pruitt, the Republican attorney general of Oklahoma, one of the states suing the EPA, said at a Washington event this month.Richard Revesz, director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University’s law school, said the suing states were exaggerating the regulatory reach of the EPA.“The Clean Power Plan, while certainly a very important rule, is not the boundary-breaking behemoth that the petitioners make it out to be,” Revesz said.The Clean Power Plan, if it survives the legal challenge, could prompt a faster shift to renewable energy sources and accelerate the closure of the country’s oldest coal plants.The fate of the Clean Power Plan was thrown into question on Feb. 9 when the Supreme Court made a surprise 5-4 decision to grant a request by the challengers to put the rule on hold while the appeals court considered the matter.The eventual appeals court ruling could decide the case, even if it goes to the Supreme Court. The Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia left the court ideologically split with four conservatives and four liberals. A 4-4 ruling by the high court would leave in place the appeals court ruling.GARLAND STEPS ASIDEThe arguments will be heard by 10 judges rather than 11 because the court’s chief judge, Merrick Garland, has recused himself from the case. Garland is Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia. Of the 10 judges who will hear the case, six were appointed by Democratic presidents.A 5-5 ruling would leave the regulations in place.A ruling is unlikely before the end of the year and possibly not until after Obama leaves office on Jan. 20.The outcome of the Nov. 8 presidential election could be pivotal for the regulations. If Republican Donald Trump wins, the government could reverse the rules or decline to appeal to the Supreme Court should the appeals court strike them down. If Democrat Hillary Clinton is elected, the losing side in the appeals court ruling could be expected to take the case to the Supreme Court.If the case does reach the high court, it may not make it in time for the justices to hear it during the court term that begins next Monday and ends in June.(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)"
1,POLITICS,One Issue That Could Reshape America For A Generation Was Snubbed At The Debate,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-presidential-debate_us_57e98ec3e4b082aad9b6227d,Neither candidate said what he or she plans to do with the Supreme Court.,2016-09-27,"People pause near a bus adorned with large photos of candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump before the presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, on Sept. 26.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― The next president could very well set the course of the Supreme Court for far longer than the duration of his or her White House stay, and yet neither candidate gave the subject any play on Monday.Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump had more than 90 minutes to make their respective cases to the American public at the first of three televised presidential debates in the lead-up to Election Day. But neither nominee spent any time describing their vision for the nation’s high court, let alone the federal judiciary ― a huge part of a president’s legacy.Part of the blame lies with Lester Holt, who delivered a solid moderator performance but never brought up the subject of the Supreme Court ― a curious move in a debate centered on domestic policy issues.It was a monumental missed chance, if only because it could’ve reminded millions of voters about an ongoing Supreme Court vacancy that’s breaking all kinds of records ― and helped people understand the intimate ties between a candidate’s policy agenda and the future of the courts.Clinton has said she wants to build on some of the accomplishments of President Barack Obama, but she has robust policy aspirations of her own ― many of which will undoubtedly be targeted through litigation and are almost certain to land eventually before the Supreme Court.“After years of accusing liberals of judicial activism, conservatives are wholeheartedly relying on Republican-appointed judges to undo progressive achievements,” Clinton wrote in a January op-ed in The Boston Globe. “They’re using radical legal strategies to accomplish through the courts what they’ve failed to do through legislation, like dismembering the Voting Rights Act or attacking unions.”Trump doesn’t have his rival’s policy chops. And on the campaign trail, he has made clear that not even sitting federal judges or the Constitution itself are out of bounds for his cheap shots. In the face of those indiscretions, he likes to brag that even principled conservatives will eventually bow to him based on whom he might nominate to the Supreme Court.“Even if you can’t stand Donald Trump, even if you think I’m the worst, you’re going to vote for me,” a confident Trump said at a Virginia rally last month. “You know why? Judges.”His not-so-short list of potential candidates to the high court is clearly aimed at that on-the-fence crowd ― those who may recoil at the thought of Trump as commander in chief but who may be willing to stomach him as long as he’s the appointer in chief. Just look at Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who last week succumbed to Trump in part due to his Supreme Court promises.All of this and more could’ve been explored at length at Monday’s face-to-face between Clinton and Trump. Instead, the Supreme Court was a big no-show.“It’s disappointing that one of the most critical issues facing our democracy, the future of the Supreme Court, didn’t get any airtime in tonight’s debate,” Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, said in a statement. Aron’s group has pushed for a hearing for Merrick Garland, Obama’s choice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia.Here’s hoping the next debates fix this oversight. With one existing vacancy and the potential for as many as three more in the next four to eight years, the court is likely to shape America’s constitutional future for far longer than the next president will."

5,HEALTHY LIVING,Check Your Privilege Before Talking About Obesity And Personal Responsibility,"Yoni Freedhoff, U.S. News & World Report",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/check-your-privilege-before-talking-about-obesity-and-personal-responsibility_us_57ea8a9ee4b024a52d2aa2b1,Many people's realities make lifestyle reform a nearly impossible luxury.,2016-09-27,"Personal responsibility-based healthy living efforts require privileges -- such as time, stability and personal health -- that the vast majority of people don’t possess.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ea8e611b00007f08ef28af.jpeg?cache=uYEv7XFruF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I was sitting and chatting with a journalist this past weekend. She’s hearteningly passionate about her work, and hers is a health beat. She wanted to know how she and the media as a whole might do better at helping the public adopt healthy habits in the name of improving obesity and other chronic diet and lifestyle responsive diseases.I think my answer may have surprised her. “Not that there aren’t ways the media could improve upon their reporting,” I said, “but I’m not sure it really matters in that the folks who both read about healthy living and have lives that are appropriately and realistically conducive to change are an incredibly privileged and small subset of the population.”Spelling that out more succinctly here, personal responsibility-based healthy living efforts require privileges that the vast majority of people don’t possess.First, there’s the privilege of time. Yes, we all share the same 24 hours a day, but there’s little doubt that for some, the time required to intentionally exercise, shop for fresh, whole ingredients, prep foods and cook rightly play second fiddle to working long enough hours to pay for their and their family’s necessities. There’s also the time involved in caregiving responsibilities, which could include looking after children with special needs, aged parents or an ill spouse.Working in Canada where health care is socialized and so too are the bulk of my office’s programs, I have the fortune of being able to work with people from every socioeconomic strata, and I can tell you that though everyone possesses the theoretical ability to focus on healthy habits and lives, many people’s realities make lifestyle reform a nearly impossible luxury.The longer public health and public opinion focus their attentions on the personal-responsibility narrative of obesity and other chronic non-communicable diseases, the longer we’ll wait to see population level changes. If any amount of desire, guilt or shame were sufficient to drive sustained change, we’d have been rid of the so-called lifestyle diseases decades ago. We’re not going to swim our way out of this flood, as not everyone can afford swimming lessons, not everyone has the time for swimming lessons and even though knowing how to swim is an undeniably good thing to know how to do, not everyone is interested in taking swimming lessons."

As a solution for change, the Charlotte-native urged the African-American community to take control of their spending power by boycotting big corporations.“The biggest way to effect change is through spending power. If you don’t respect us, then we don’t respect you,” Hamilton wrote. “Not all corporations are bad. Not all white people are bad. However, there is an ugly underground culture in this country full of those who feel that people of color are inferior. If we stop empowering these big corporations who support the folk who want us gone, then we will show our power and cripple their pockets.”In addition to his call to action, the Grammy Award winner also added that he does not advocate hurting innocent people of any race or group.“There is nothing cool about senseless violence. However, we can no longer ignore that liberty and justice never, ever applied to us all. America, the world is watching,” he wrote.Hamilton’s moving piece comes on the heels of former “Grey’s Anatomy” star Isaiah Washington urging African-Americans to boycott work, school and shopping on Sept. 26 ― which also marks the first presidential debate ― to show that black lives matter.Read more of Anthony Hamilton’s heartfelt op-ed here."

The spots, which will run on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and as online ad content, attack the Republican presidential nominee on a variety of fronts, ranging from economic (the minimum wage) to social (abortion policy, marriage equality and sexism).The hook, though, is the backdrop: an oncoming locomotive bearing down on the viewer.The image is meant to play off the #TrumpTrain hashtag that Trump’s supporters often use to populate their posts and allude to their candidate’s gains in the polls.“That’s a dangerous ride that must be stopped, so we encourage everyone to #StopTheTrumpTrain and vote for Hillary Clinton,” read Priorities USA’s statement announcing the ads.The ads will be running in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida and Ohio, a Priorities USA spokesman said. And though they’re scheduled to run in the lead-up to Monday night’s debate, the group is not ruling out the possibility of keeping them online afterward as well."

The GOP presidential nominee’s advisers have repeatedly stressed his lack of preparation, lowering the bar so far that, as The Huffington Post’s Amanda Terkel put it, “if he doesn’t vomit, he’s exceeding expectations.”Yet the American public’s expectations for Trump’s performance don’t seem to be historically, or even unusually, low. By a 10-point margin ― 53 percent to 43 percent ― likely voters say they expect Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to do better than Trump in the debates, according to a September CNN/ORC poll. But that’s a relatively small gap compared to past election cycles.In four of the previous six presidential elections, pre-debate polling from CNN and Gallup found a wider gap in expectations, YouGov’s Will Jordan noted on Friday. In two elections, 2000 and 1992, the “expectations gap” between candidates was only a couple of points smaller than it is this year.This year’s relatively close margin may be because neither Trump nor Clinton has the advantage of presidential incumbency. Although Bill Clinton was seen as a somewhat stronger debater than incumbent George H.W. Bush in 1992, recent sitting presidents have otherwise been perceived to hold a wide advantage in debates. The open election in 2000 saw a relatively modest expectations gap between candidates, although Barack Obama was seen as a much stronger debater than John McCain in 2008.Polarization may also play a role, with expectations lining up broadly along party lines. According to CNN’s most recent poll, 88 percent of Democratic likely voters and 75 percent of Republican likely voters expect their party’s nominee to be the better debater. In contrast, four years ago, only two-thirds of Republicans expected Romney to do a better job than Obama.Trump also has to contend with higher expectations from independent voters. Forty-eight percent of independent voters expect him to do a better job than Clinton in the debates. When Romney and McCain debated Obama, only one-third or fewer independents expected the Republican candidates to prevail. CNN’s survey was conducted at the beginning of September, so it’s possible that expectations for Trump have since taken a slide ― but given his increasing strength in horserace polling over the same time period, that seems somewhat unlikely. Research shows that media coverage of the debates often matters at least as much as the public’s reaction to them, so the conventional wisdom that Trump will do poorly certainly gives him some advantage.Going into Monday night, however, the electorate’s expectations for Trump don’t seem to be exceptionally forgiving.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Bush announced their support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Sunday in a bid for party unity ahead of Trump’s first debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton.The Bush family and many connected to it remain cool to Trump. Former President George H.W. Bush reportedly plans to vote for Clinton in the Nov. 8 election, former Trump rival Jeb Bush has said he will not vote for Clinton or Trump, and George W. Bush has avoided the presidential race while helping raise money for Republican congressional candidates.But a number of former Bush appointees have decided to endorse the New York businessman, who is in a tight race with Clinton and is to debate her one-one-one at Hofstra University on Monday night in Hempstead, New York.Fifty former Bush appointees were on a list of people described as founding members of a coalition of Bush alumni supportive of Trump. The list was provided by a Republican official close to the Trump campaign.The list included former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, former Treasury Secretary John Snow and former Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson.The list also included former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former Veterans Affairs Secretary Anthony Principi and former deputy White House political director Matt Schlapp, who is chairman of the American Conservative Union.Thompson, in a statement, explained his decision to be on the list.“Americans want to trust our leaders again, to know that they are fighting for everyday Americans by creating jobs, growing our economy, defending our nation from terrorism, and respecting the voters enough to be straight-forward and honest with them,” Thompson said.Trump has struggled to rally many in the Republican Party behind him. On Friday, he received the endorsement of former rival Ted Cruz, but many establishment figures remain skeptical about him, such as Ohio Governor John Kasich."
11,POLITICS,"Republicans Ask Democrats To Trust Them On Flint Funding, Offer No Reason To Trust Them",Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flint-funding-cr-wrda_us_57e97d8ae4b08d73b832e1f3,"This should end well, believe me.",2016-09-26,House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Speaker Paul Ryan promise they'll get to Flint later. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e99ded1700002900ac7595.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As a government shutdown suddenly looks possible, Republicans are imploring their Democratic colleagues to agree to a short-term spending bill now and trust that they will address the Flint water crisis in other legislation later. The only problem? The bill Republicans say should be the vehicle for Flint ― a long-awaited water resources measure ― is supposed to move through the House this week without Flint.House GOP leaders contend that they want to address the Michigan water crisis in the so-called Water Resources Development Act, not the short-term bill, known as a continuing resolution. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday that Flint “should be dealt with in the WRDA bill,” and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Monday that the water resources bill was “the best place” to address it.So it is perhaps curious that House Republicans are trying to move the bill without Flint aid. “The sooner we get the WRDA bill through in the House, the sooner we can begin conference,” McCarthy said.But McCarthy didn’t commit to making sure Flint was eventually attached. In fact, even if the House passes the water bill, they would need to vote on an additional piece of legislation to set up conference. And with lawmakers set to leave town after this week for the next month and a half, Flint aid would almost certainly be delayed until November at the earliest ― if it happens at all.That’s a big reason why Democrats are insisting that Flint be part of the CR, particularly when Republicans are willing to attach emergency Louisiana flood aid to the government funding bill.There is an amendment from Michigan Democrat Dan Kildee to add Flint aid to the WRDA measure, but there’s a good chance the House Rules Committee doesn’t allow a vote for the same reason that the legislation doesn’t currently include money: It’s in the jurisdiction of other committees, namely, Energy and Commerce, and Appropriations.Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) told the Rules Committee on Monday night that he opposed including the amendment because it would set a precedent for local drinking water provisions in WRDA. And asked Monday if he would support Rules giving the amendment a vote, McCarthy dodged the question by noting that he’s not on the Rules Committee.McCarthy was enthusiastic about a WRDA conference, however, noting that “there are other issues” lawmakers could address in conference ― potentially even California drought provisions, other sources suggested.But Democrats have no guarantees on Flint if it isn’t in the CR. And if Republicans want to dig in on not including the aid in the continuing resolution, Democrats could block government funding, betting that the GOP takes the brunt of the blame over a shutdown.Meanwhile, WRDA has its own issues. House Transportation and Infrastructure ranking Democrat, Peter DeFazio of Oregon, withdrew his support of the legislation last week after Republicans stripped a section allowing the government to use the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to dredge harbors. DeFazio also sent the Rules Committee a letter on Monday calling out an $810 million project to build athletic fields and a splash park.If most Democrats follow DeFazio’s lead, Republicans will be looking to pass the bill almost entirely on their own, meaning Flint provisions could imperil the legislation.All of this is to say Democrats have a number of reasons to demand Flint funding in the CR. And if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is intent on keeping the funding out, Congress could be heading toward a government shutdown that no one expected."

But James did speak out against recent police killings that have amplified Kaepernick’s protests, saying that they have created a “scary-ass situation” for those who, like him, are parents of young black children.“My personal feelings is that I got a 12-year-old son, a 9-year-old son, a 2-year-old daughter, and I look at my son being four years removed from being able to drive his own car, being able to leave the house on his own,” James said. “It’s a scary thought right now to think, if my son gets pulled over, and you tell your kids, if you just comply, if you just listen to the police that they’ll be respectful and things will work itself out.”“And you see these videos that continue to come out,” he continued. “It’s a scary-ass situation ― that if my son calls me and says he’s been pulled over, that I’m not that confident that things are going to go well and my son is going to return home.”Watch James’ comments on police brutality:James and fellow NBA stars Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade took the stage before the ESPY Awards in July to speak out against police violence. James said Monday that while he plans to stand for the national anthem, he is happy Kaepernick and other NFL players who have joined the protests have continued pushing the conversation.“I don’t have the answer, none of us have the answer,” James said. “But the more times that we can talk about it, the more times we can conversate about it. Because I’m not up here saying that all police are bad, because they’re not. I’m not up here saying all kids are great and all adults are great, because they’re not.”“But at the same time, all lives do matter,” he said. “It’s not black or white, it’s not that. It’s everybody. But it’s tough being a parent right now, when you have a pre-teen. But the conversation has continued from the ESPYs speech that myself, CP, D-Wade and Melo had, and that’s definitely a good thing.”James has spoken out against police killings of African-Americans in the past, too. He was among the NBA players to wear “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirts during warm-ups in 2014, after a New York police officer killed Eric Garner in Staten Island. James posted images referencing the police shooting death of Ferguson, Missouri, teenager Michael Brown in 2014, and he, Wade and their then-Miami Heat teammates, posed in hoodies after the killing of unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012.The NBA and its players’ union said in a statement last week that they anticipated players would bring Kaepernick’s protest to the basketball court, and other NBA players and coaches spoke out about the issue during media sessions on Monday.Toronto Raptors guard Kyle Lowry struck a similar tone as James, saying the killings made him nervous to be a parent.“Me having two younger black kids, making sure people are aware that me growing up, definitely getting pulled over was a scary thing, and definitely was a nervous thing,” Lowry said, the Toronto Star reported. “I think now we have to use our voices.”Lowry’s teammate DeMar DeRozan said he will likely protest.“I had a close friend of mine a couple of weeks ago who was murdered by the police, shot 17 times,” DeRozan said, via the Star. “It was something I haven’t spoke out about. It was more so of just understanding what’s going on in our society and how much I can help. And that’s what it’s all about. So most definitely I think we will, and I will (protest), for sure.”Stephen Curry, who has backed Kaepernick’s protests, reiterated that stance while saying he would stand for the anthem before Golden State Warriors games this season. At the Knicks media day, Anthony said his team would act collectively to address police brutality. John Wall similarly said his Washington Wizards would “talk as a team, as a group, and figure out what we want to do.”San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, meanwhile, said he would respect any of his players’ decision to protest during the anthem if they chose to.“My players are engaged citizens who are fully capable of understanding what their values are, and what they think is appropriate and inappropriate, and what they feel strongly about,” Popovich said. “Whatever actions may or may not be taken are their decisions, and I’m not going to tell anyone ahead of time that if they don’t do A, B and C, they’re going to be gone or traded. I think that’s ignorant.”Los Angeles Lakers guard Nick Young has previously said that he has considered kneeling during the anthem once the season begins. "

Or at least, that’s what Trump’s campaign wants you to believe.In the run-up to the first presidential debate Monday night, Trump’s team has been working to lower the bar so far for him that it’s basically just lying on the ground. Story after story talks about how Clinton is spending her time poring over wonky policy details in briefing books while Trump is just hanging out.Trump senior adviser Jason Miller sent a memo last week stressing that Clinton “has more debates under her belt than almost any presidential candidate in history,” whereas Trump has been in a one-on-one debate only once. “Hillary Clinton is on the ropes and needs to change the game,” Jason Miller, the Trump campaign’s senior communications adviser, said in a memo. “Given her extensive experience debating, high level of preparation and scripted nature Clinton’s campaign no doubt views [the Monday debate] as the best opportunity to alter the trajectory of the race. ... [Trump is] not rehearsing canned 30-second sound bites or spending hours in the film room like an NFL player. He will be prepared, but most importantly, he will be himself.”This sort of expectation-managing creates an imbalanced scenario in which, as long as Trump shows up on time and manages not to puke or something, pundits will declare him the winner.And the Trump team is certainly making its own preparations. Politico reported Friday that the campaign is building a detailed “psychological analysis” of Clinton by analyzing videos of her 16 years of debates. The two candidates’ differential treatment was clear during a Sept. 7 veterans forum, the first such event during the general election. The moderator, NBC News host Matt Lauer, challenged Clinton on the use of her private email server and repeatedly interrupted her to stop her from filibustering. But with Trump, Lauer lobbed softballs like, “What have you experienced in your personal life or your professional life that you believe prepares you to make the decisions that a commander-in-chief has to make?” “Candidates should expect to be challenged. They’re applying for a challenging job. But where Mr. Lauer treated Mrs. Clinton like someone running for president, he treated Mr. Trump like someone running to figure out how to be president, eventually,” New York Times TV critic James Poniewozik wrote in a scathing review the following day. Clinton’s team, meanwhile, sent out a press release on Friday with the headline, “Clinton Campaign: Trump Cannot Pass Debate Test If He Repeats These Debunked Lies.” Trump lies all the time ― and often gets away with it. During the Sept. 7 forum, Trump again repeated the falsehood that he opposed the invasion of Iraq, and Lauer did nothing to call him out. “The debates are about each candidates laying out their vision for America, not making things up. Donald Trump should ― as Hillary Clinton will ― be expected to present his solutions for the problems that the country is facing,” Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri told reporters on Friday.There’s a good reason for pre-debate wrangling: Scoring a knock-out could have enormous consequences. With a far closer race than many political observers anticipated, any development that could shift the polls even a few percentage points is desirable. Political science research has shown that although debates don’t result in major poll changes, polls can shift by two or three percentage points during debate season. That doesn’t necessarily mean candidates’ performances during those events were the sole cause of the swing, but there does seem to be some effect. Big debate moments can also come to define a candidate for the rest of the race and beyond, for better or worse ― Richard Nixon sweating next to a cool John F. Kennedy, Al Gore sighing while George W. Bush spoke and Michael Dukakis’ emotionless response to a hypothetical question about his wife being raped and murdered. And a strong debate performance can re-energize a candidate’s base, much as it did in 2012, when Republican Mitt Romney pulled off a surprisingly strong showing against President Barack Obama ― a jolt the Clinton campaign could use right now as it tries to excite Democrats. While Clinton will have the hurdle of meeting the public’s high expectations, Trump will have to debate the first female presidential nominee in history ― which comes with its own challenges. Clinton is traditionally a strong debater, and has benefited from the missteps of men who simply don’t know how to deal with a woman on the stage. In 2008, Obama’s “You’re likable enough, Hillary” line backfired during a debate before the New Hampshire primaries, coming off as condescending in what was supposed to be an attempt to contrast his charisma with her more serious style. Clinton ended up winning in New Hampshire. But more famous is what happened during the 2000 Senate race in New York, when Republican Rick Lazio walked out from behind his lectern and over to Clinton, invading her personal space and demanding she sign a campaign finance pledge. Clinton tried to shake his hand as he pointed and towered over her. The maneuver was a disaster and has essentially become the textbook example of how a man can screw up when debating a woman.There will certainly be a big audience no matter what happens during Monday’s event: More than 100 million people could tune in, exceeding previous records, for the 9 p.m. ET debate at Hofstra University in New York. A presidential debate commission official told The Huffington Post that several thousand journalists applied for credentials, and they expect more than 1,000 to actually attend. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The committee will “provide advisory support to Mr. Trump on those issues and policies important to Catholics and other people of faith in America,” according to a Sept. 22 press release.Santorum, who has compared fighting same-sex marriage to fighting terrorism, will join over 30 other advisors on the committee including Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, Matt Smith, president of the Catholic Advocate and Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List. Together, they will aid Trump in strategizing around key issues like religious liberty, judicial nominations and pro-life activism.Santorum, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in February, endorsed Trump for president in May saying that he had a “long heart-to-heart” with the nominee and that he is “committed to working with Donald and his Administration to ensure that conservative priorities are advanced — not simply judicial nominees, but nominees to key administration positions.”The addition of the former Republican senator to Trump’s roster continues to up his campaign’s anti-queer ante. Trump has previously stated that he would “strongly consider” appointing judges to the U.S. Supreme Court who could reverse marriage equality. He’s also said he believes North Carolina should be able to choose to discriminate against queer people and most recently pledged to sign the First Amendment Defense Act, which the New Civil Rights Movement notes is “a bill that would allow discrimination against same-sex couples by any person, business, or institution.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
15,POLITICS,Trump's About To Face His Biggest Test Of 2016,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-debate-teleprompter_us_57e9508ce4b0e80b1ba33921,No script. No teleprompter. No coaching.,2016-09-26,Donald Trump got through the GOP primary debates by insulting his opponents on stage and ducking from policy discussions. It's unclear whether a similar strategy would have good results against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Monday night's first general election debate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e955d01a00002d005b4c93.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A month of scripting Donald Trump’s words and hiding him from all but the friendliest of interviews is about to pay off brilliantly Monday night at his first general election presidential debate.Or it’s about to come crashing down around Republicans whose presidential nominee cannot possibly get through 90 uncoached minutes without reverting to his natural state.“Give me steep odds,” joked one Republican National Committee member privately when asked if Trump could make it through the evening without saying something outlandish.“Wasn’t it Pilate who said: ‘What is truth?’” joked another, when asked if Trump could check his propensity to toss out falsehoods.Party leaders who started the primary season a year ago never imagining that the reality TV host could wind up as their nominee spent much of early August wondering whether a random name atop their ticket who said nothing at all could have been outperforming Trump. If only he would stick to attacking Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and laying out basic Republican themes, rather than insulting a Mexican-American federal judge and the family of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq, he could have a decent shot at the White House.Now, thanks to an intervention by the Trump family five weeks ago that brought in new campaign leadership, Republicans have accomplished exactly what they thought they could. Trump has turned an 8-point Clinton lead into a virtual tie in the latest national polls.The plan itself was simple in concept. While original campaign manager Corey Lewandowski guided Trump to the Republican nomination with the strategy of “Let Trump be Trump,” his new handlers have insisted on the exact opposite.Just a few months ago, a Trump campaign event meant a stream-of-consciousness discourse about his poll numbers, some insults about his opponents, a promise to build a wall along the southern border and to force Mexico to pay for it, the renegotiation of existing trade deals, and a promise to get tough somehow with Muslim immigration and the so-called Islamic State.Starting a month ago, the teleprompters that he used to ridicule go with him everywhere. The rambling of his primary events has given way to prepared speeches containing mainly Republican boilerplates about lower taxes, fewer regulations, more school choice, more domestic energy production, more military spending ― with nods to trade, the border wall and terrorism.An actual unscripted remark from Trump has become rarer ― an exception rather than the rule ― and has been mostly saved for evening rallies, when Trump appears to want to please his supporters with more off-teleprompter excursions. It was at a nighttime rally in Pensacola, Florida, earlier this month that Trump suggested that Iranian sailors who use gestures they shouldn’t be using toward U.S. Navy ships would be blown out of the water. It was at an evening Miami rally that Trump said Clinton should lose her Secret Service detail because of her support for stricter gun laws, and suggested that would result in violence against her.Even more importantly, Trump has all but ended media interviews with organizations other than Fox News, and even those have favored morning show hosts and Trump supporter Sean Hannity. While Clinton, once derided by Republicans for not holding news conferences, has staged several brief ones with the reporters who travel with her, Trump has not had a news conference since July and has had only a single brief discussion with traveling reporters earlier this month.That strategy has resulted in Monday night’s first debate looming as the first real trial by fire.During the primary debates, Trump made his mark largely by promising to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, insulting his rivals on stage and then retreating into the background when the discussion turned to policy.It’s hard to imagine that technique working in a general election setting, where Trump has to win over not only the solid Republican base, but also groups he has struggled with, such as suburban, college-educated women. These key voters likely will not be impressed with “Crooked Hillary” insults, and almost certainly will expect a president to know basic facts about the United States and the world off the top of his head.Neither self-discipline nor command of facts is a Trump characteristic, and 90 minutes of a one-on-one confrontation, with no prepared script and no coaching permitted, could test the limits of the campaign’s new model.Trump has bragged about how he doesn’t study. Monday night could offer a glimpse into whether that strategy is a winning one for the nation’s highest office.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

But people connected to the Speyer Legacy School say it is an LGBT-inclusive environment and the administrator’s sexual orientation had nothing to do with his departure. In a city where the one percent jostle for the opportunity to pay tens of thousands of dollars a year for elementary school, Speyer stands out for its focus on “accelerated learners.” A “group of high-powered mothers” that includes Malena Belafonte, the daughter-in-law of singer and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte, started the K-8 school in 2009, according to the New York Times. (Belafonte declined to comment on the lawsuit and referred questions to the school. “We just launched our fashion platform, which is what we are focusing on,” she said.) But despite its powerful benefactors, Speyer is relatively new, and the high-stakes lawsuit could hurt its reputation and cause parents to opt for the school’s older, more established competitors — especially if the allegations are true.Alan Cohen, 63, served as the assistant head and head of the lower school, grades K-4, for about a year, ending in June 2016. Cohen told The Huffington Post he has been an educator for more than 30 years, and was attracted to the job because of the opportunity to work exclusively with gifted children, a population that has been “swept under the rug,” he said. “These are our future leaders.” (New York City offers a public school program for gifted kids, but there are not enough slots for qualified applicants.) But Cohen soon encountered problems at Speyer, according to his lawsuit. Cohen claims that Barbara Tischler, the head of the school, met with him last fall to discuss a report she received from the school psychologist that a staff member was asking about Cohen’s sexual orientation. Cohen was upset that he was being asked this, but acknowledged he was gay, according to the lawsuit. (Tischler did not respond to requests for comment.) Cohen says staff members discussed his sexual orientation and the wife of a board member offered to set him up on a date. In the lawsuit, he cites a case in which a staffer he says it was “common knowledge” was gay was up for a promotion, but Tischler allegedly suggested Cohen talk to the staffer about how she could dress more feminine.Cohen claims to have seen a document in March showing his contract was going to be renewed and he was getting a 3 percent raise. But the next month, he says, his contract was not renewed. He says Tischler told him he was “not a good fit,” which came as a shock, because he says he had only received positive feedback about his work. He claims he was replaced with a female teacher who is married to a man and has “far less experience.” (This person only holds an interim position, according to the school’s website.) Cohen said it was not one person at the school who had a problem with his sexual orientation, but instead “systemic.” The school “was not progressive” in “any form or fashion,” he later added. But current and former employees of the school, who asked to remain unnamed because of pending litigation, disagree with that characterization. A senior administrator at Speyer who identifies as LGBT told HuffPost that she has never felt discriminated against because of her sexual orientation. “They’ve never mistreated me, they’ve always respected me and they value me as a person,” she said.A former Speyer administrator who also identifies as gay said the school was happy to have her openly out because she provided a role model for students who may be exploring their sexual orientation. When her son was born, her wife received a “lovely basket” with onesies and other baby gifts, her family was invited to school events, and she felt like her performance was judged on its merits, she said. “It’s really a wonderful place,” she added. “That’s an emphasis that they have. It’s important that kids feel safe, and you can’t help kids feel safe unless the grown-ups feel safe.” If Cohen’s allegations prove true, the discrimination would be a “clear violation” of New York City and New York State Human Rights Laws, said Samuel Bagenstos, a law professor at the University of Michigan, in an email. Under federal law— which is not implicated in this case — the issue is less settled. The EEOC says discriminating against people due to their sexual orientation violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but the courts haven’t fully resolved whether they agree, Bagenstos added. The burden of proof will still be on Cohen to show he was intentionally discriminated against based on the fact that he’s gay, said Merrick Rossein, a law professor at CUNY. The second stage would “require the school to come forward with a legitimate non-discriminatory reason” his contract was not renewed, Rossein added. “This, for me, is putting my integrity on the line,” Cohen said. “This is about being very proud of who I am.” "

It’s almost $5,000.”It’s not clear whether Domino’s has set any restrictions on her pizza consumption for the coming 12 months, or whether she’s entitled to other items on the menu. After all, she didn’t even order a pie in the first place.But, perhaps further proving the old adage that honesty is the best policy, her bosses at Spacetel Wireless are also rewarding her with an extra week of vacation — with full pay."
19,POLITICS,New Law Allows Californians To Rescue Pets From Hot Cars,Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-pets-hot-cars_us_57e91347e4b0e28b2b54d02f,Good Samaritans don't have to fear prosecution for breaking into vehicles.,2016-09-26,It's now legal for Californians to break into locked cars to rescue animals if there's reason to believe they are in imminent danger.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e924b71b00003007ef22ed.jpeg?cache=aoIfQSNQMA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California is now one of a handful of states that allows bystanders to break into hot cars to rescue animals without facing legal ramifications.Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed AB 797, the so-called Right to Rescue Act, into law on Saturday following a series of pet deaths across the state.According to AB 797’s requirements, rescuers must have no other way to gain access to the animal and must have a reasonable, good-faith belief that the animal is in imminent danger. They must also contact law enforcement before entering, must use no more force than necessary and must remain at the scene, with the animal in a safe location, until law enforcement arrives.It only takes 10 minutes for temperatures inside a car to become dangerously hot, according to the Humane Society, which supported the bill. On a 70-degree day, car temperatures can reach 89 degrees within 10 minutes. When it’s 72 degrees outside, it takes about an hour for car temperatures to reach 116 degrees.In California, it’s already a crime to leave an animal unattended in a vehicle under dangerous conditions like excessive heat or cold, or with a lack of ventilation, food or water. The state also has good Samaritan laws that protect people who rescue someone during an emergency situation.“AB 797 will save lives,” said Dan Felizzatto, Los Angeles County deputy district attorney, in a statement backing the bill last month.“Every year, hundreds of animals suffer, and many die, in Los Angeles County from being left in hot vehicles. By the time a citizen spots an animal trapped in a hot vehicle the situation is often dire, and requires immediate action,” he said.Law enforcement and peace officers alerted by bystanders may not always respond to the scene in time, Felizzatto said.“AB 797 provides a legal framework for a good Samaritan to follow in order to remove an animal from a hot vehicle, without fear of legal repercussions,” he added.Florida, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Ohio and Vermont have all enacted laws that support such break-in rescues. In Michigan, lawmakers are considering making it a felony offense if a pet dies in a hot car."

Evidence of the plumes is visible in recent observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope, William Sparks, an astronomer with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, said in the briefing. The new report confirms similar observations that were made in 2013.The plumes provide additional evidence that beneath Europa’s icy surface lies a vast underground ocean of liquid water. In addition, they suggest that it might be easier than some had thought to search for signs of life on the moon, which has long been considered one of the likeliest places to find extraterrestrial life in the solar system.“If there are plumes emerging from Europa, it’s significant because it means we may be able to explore that ocean of Europa for organic chemicals or even signs of life without having to drill through unknown miles of ice,” Sparks said.Here’s an artist’s illustration of water vapor plumes erupting from Europa’s surface:Scientists estimate the plumes rise about 125 miles from Europa’s surface before raining back down. If there’s life in the subsurface ocean, it could be brought to the surface by the water jets, becoming visible to a visiting spacecraft. “Who could ask for more?” Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the SETI Institute and a noted expert on the search for extraterrestrial life, said in an email to The Huffington Post. “Europa, one of the choice locations in the solar system for biology, is possibly offering it up to us on a platter. Rather than sending a lander and a drilling rig capable of making a 10-mile hole in granite-hard ice, all we may have to do is send an orbiter around this intriguing moon, outfitted with a catcher’s mitt. We grab some of that plume, bring it back to Earth, and look for evidence of alien microbes in the comfort of our labs.”The live-streamed announcement capped days of intense speculation over just what NASA would reveal at the briefing.Some had wondered if the space agency might announce that alien life had been found. But in the hours leading up to the briefing, NASA threw cold water on that idea, saying “Spoiler alert: NOT aliens” in a pair of blunt tweets, including this one:Europa is one of at least 67 known moons of Jupiter. Scientists have long speculated that its cracked crust hid a vast ocean. In fact, the suspected ocean might hold more water than all of Earth’s oceans combined, The Washington Post reported.“We know that on Earth, everywhere that there’s water, we find life,” Robert Pappalardo, a scientist with a planned Europa mission, said in a video released earlier by the space agency."
