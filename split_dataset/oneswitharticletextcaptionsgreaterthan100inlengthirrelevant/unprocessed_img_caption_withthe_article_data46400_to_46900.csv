0,QUEER VOICES,Jon Voight Likens Donald Trump To Mother Teresa At Values Voter Summit,Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jon-voight-donald-trump_us_57d3fed2e4b03d2d459ab14c,And evangelical leaders explain why they support Trump,2016-09-11,"“You’re always going to have people picking apart this great man,” actor Jon Voight (right) send of Trump. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d414ca180000e000313ac2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At the annual Values Voter Summit this weekend, Christian conservative leaders and attendees offered interesting and sometimes bizarre explanations for why they’re supporting the thrice-married, often offensive and insulting Donald Trump in interviews with me for SiriusXM Progress. Outside the conference of evangelical activists at which Trump spoke on Friday, a group of religious leaders opposed to Trump staged a protest, explaining that the Republican nominee didn’t exemplify Christian values when he mocked a reporter with disabilities and called women “pigs.”But former GOP Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, a former Ted Cruz supporter, called the protest “nonsense” and repeated her view that, “God had a hand in the political process” in making Trump the GOP nominee. She also dismissed Trump’s praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying only that, “there isn’t a dime’s worth of similarity between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.”Christian Broadcasting Network host David Brody, responding to Trump’s claims that he will be “better for the gay community” than Hillary Clinton, observed that evangelicals will “look the other way on that” because they “believe Donald Trump will support conservative nominees” for the Supreme Court and they “look at it in those terms and don’t look at it as a man, if you will.”Then there was actor Jon Voight, who said he traveled to the conference in Washington specifically to introduce Trump from the stage. The Academy Award winner, who explained that he’d supported Trump from the beginning of his run, responded to the protest of religious leaders outside of the event by comparing Trump to Saint Mother Teresa and the Nobel laureate and theologian Albert Schweitzer. “Well, I’m a Catholic and I’m speaking to this group of Christians, and I’m happy to be doing it,” Voight said. “There will always be naysayers. There are people who are naysayers against Mother Teresa, trying to find something against her. They did it with Albert Schweitzer, and I was so enamored with what Schweitzer was doing in Africa.”“And,” Voight continued, referring to Trump, “you’re always going to have people picking apart this great man.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, anti-LGBT rights advocate and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Oh, my God, that really just happened!” he shouts as he watches the scene from above.”Look at the people running!” a woman beside him says as she points to the ground below.Carnival blamed rough currents and wind conditions for pushing the vessel off course while departing the harbor city of Messina on Aug. 28. “The ship’s officers were forced to increase the vessel’s propulsion motors to control the ship’s movement and bring it back on course,” they said Sunday in a statement to The Huffington Post. “In the process, the force of the ship’s propeller wash in the harbor impacted a nearby floating dock and some small vessels which were damaged. No injuries were reported. The company sincerely apologizes for the matter and has been in close contact with Italian authorities to examine what transpired.”The local port authority estimated the damage to be around $280,800, according to a statement obtained by local media.“The cruise ship caused damages at two piers, one beyond repair, a number of ancillary facilities (such as anchor lines of the boats) damaged, a pilot of the mooring sunk and another dozen small boats in poor condition,” the statement read. “The estimated amounts of damages are over 250,000 EUR.”Though the Vista is Carnival’s largest ship, the cruise line hopes that it won’t be for long. Carnival recently announced that they have ordered two 180,000-ton ships. The world’s three largest cruise ships, owned by Royal Caribbean, each have a gross tonnage of more than 225,000.Both new Carnival ships will be powered by liquefied natural gas and are expected to make their debuts in 2020 and 2022.CORRECTION: Earlier versions of this story incorrectly stated that the three Royal Caribbean ships weighed more than 225,000 tons or could carry that amount.

After about age 11, she outgrew Justice and we hadn’t gone in the store for years. He ended up always begrudgingly trying on clothes from the boys’ departments along with his older brother. But he hated it. He avoided trying on clothes at all costs. Back-to-school shopping was a chore he dreaded to the extreme.Every time we made a trip to your next door neighbor store, Target, my son would longingly look in the windows of Justice and say, “I wish I could shop there.” But we never went in. There was just something off-putting about those words on your window, reading, “Just for Girls,” that kept us away time and time again. My son doesn’t identify as a girl, at least he hasn’t for as long as he has been able to communicate, although he has always acted like a stereotypical girl, played exclusively with stereotypical girls toys and has almost exclusively female friends.We’ve all been on a journey to understand his gender non-conformity, but finally my husband, myself and my two older cisgender children are all on the same page, and we’re just looking for ways to support our gender creative, in-transition, born-male child. He may one day be LGBTQ+. He may not. We’re open to whatever, as long as he’s happy, true to himself and not hurting anyone.Well, this year I was planning a trip with my son to Justice over spring break for some much wanted “sparkly” clothes. All excuses aside, I was going to take the plunge. I was literally planning on going the day after HB2 became NC law, March 23.This new law would ban transgender people from using public restrooms, showers, locker rooms and changing facilities that aligned with their gender identity. For example, a trans man who has a full beard, the build of a man, the voice of a man due to hormone blockers and testosterone injections, dresses like a stereotypical male, and for all intents and purposes appears very outwardly masculine would now be legally required to use the women’s restroom, if his gender markers weren’t changed on his birth certificate, or he wasn’t assigned male at birth. And vice versa ― trans women who haven’t changed their birth certificates are legally required to use men’s facilities.Instead of going to Justice that day, I ended up glued to my laptop, trying to understand what to make of this new, horrific anti-trans, excruciatingly discriminatory law based on hyped up fears over a “potential” crime that has never actually happened. I wondered what this meant for my son’s future, especially if he ends up transitioning to female.The summer came and went. My son settled on “boys” back to school clothes, and two pairs of “girls” Twinkle Toe sneakers, along with a hot pink, peach and purple backpack, and pink lunchbox shaped like a purse.I mentioned my son’s Justice wish to a group I founded and lead for parents of gender non-conforming and trans children. I wondered out loud whether a clothing store that touts itself as “just for girls” would be open to a boy trying on their clothes. Because of HB2, I wondered whether they’d have a legal right in N.C. to deny my son entry to a female dressing room.Thanks to a hero mom friend, all the vetting out was done. She did something I had been putting off. She physically went to your store, spoke to the store manager on duty, and asked questions from, “Would you let a boy try on clothes here?” to “What would you do if another customer made rude comments to a little boy looking at or trying on clothes here?” And much more.My friend reported all good news back to our group. The store manager assured her that “everyone is welcome at Justice,” and any rudeness or discrimination from fellow customers would not be tolerated. She spoke of how Justice’s parent company, Ascena, helped donate without question after the Orlando massacre at Pulse Nightclub. We definitely had an advocate at this store.Then, another hero friend sent my son a Justice e-Gift card that I could use right from my phone. It was then a done deal. We were going shopping.My son wanted to go immediately, but we had to get to school and it was 7:15 a.m. on a Tuesday. I told him, “maybe Friday.” So Friday afternoon at 4:45, I was leaving work and I decided to call the store to make sure our advocate was working. She was; however, she stated her shift was over at 5:15, but that the girl taking over after her was just as welcoming.We rushed to get there, and just around 5:10, we arrived. There were no other customers in the store. My son’s eyes were huge and overwhelmed with possibilities. The Justice store manager came right over to greet us, didn’t bat an eyelash, and basically took on the role of my son’s personal shopper for the evening.After getting a feel for what colors, textures and patterns he liked, our advocate showed us several possibilities, from sequined mini skirts to slim jeggings. My son LOVED them all. We went to the changing room, and my son couldn’t get those clothes on fast enough. Once that first outfit was on, he posed and admired himself in the mirror, spun around in circles to see the skirt poof out, and studied himself from all angles in every possible combination of outfits. It was pure joy. This ― in stark contrast to how he tries on “boys” clothing in other stores, when he won’t even put an outfit all the way on or refuses to try on at all. My son dropped his usual shopping doom and gloom look and suddenly sprang to life in these clothes. He even encouraged me to take pictures of him in the different outfits. There was no denying he became a different, more confident and happier child when wearing pretty things.I was blown away by the fact that our advocate Justice manager stayed well-past her shift’s end, just to continue working with us. She made my son feel beautiful and totally free of judgment. I want to thank her for that precious, precious gift. I rarely get to see my son reaching his full potential, his absolute true self in public. She encouraged that and even helped bring it out. I felt so much hope for the future.We left the store two hours later with two full bags, and I snapped a picture of my son standing by the store window that reads, “just for girls.” He was beaming and clutching his bags of new clothes, standing beside those words, “just for girls,” challenging the notion.I will leave you with a few pictures I took of some of his new outfits. Please look at his smile. This is as genuine as it gets. I think his cheeks hurt from smiling so much when we left.I want to say an extra special thank you to Ascena Retail Group, and to the Raleigh branch of Justice, at Poyner Place behind Triangle Town Center. I want to say a super-duper thanks to store manager, Stephnie, who went waaaaay above and beyond, for giving my son a safe place for two hours of his life that will no doubt impact his future in a big way.Thank you, thank you, thank you.Your most recent fan for life,Martie Sirois, parent of a gender non-conforming 10-year-old boy transitioning to become someone even more beautiful than he already is.Originally published at www.gendercreativelife.com*Since the publishing of this letter, Charlie has enjoyed a solid year in fifth grade wearing clothing and hair accessories from Justice, despite questions and confusion from some peers. For pronouns, Charlie now uses “they/them/their(s)” instead of “he/him/his.” Charlie identifies as non-binary (Enby), and gender non-conforming. When pressured to answer “are you a boy or a girl,” Charlie says, “I’m just a person.” Charlie’s parents founded a group called S.E.A.R.CH. (Safe Environment for the Acceptance of Rainbow CHildren), which is a playgroup for TGNC (Trans and/or gender non-conforming) children ages 12 and under, and discussion group for parents. This fall, S.E.A.R.CH. will celebrate its first year anniversary of being a permanent, year-round, monthly program of their local LGBT Center. "
5,GREEN,IUCN Congress Emerges with Global Goal to Close the Domestic Ivory Trade,"Dr. Cristián Samper, ContributorPresident and CEO, Wildlife Conservation Society",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iucn-congress-emerges-wit_b_11960428.html,,2016-09-11,2016-09-11-1473574928-1210695-2016030314570219202321509CristianSamper_7836_AfricanElephantRuahaNationalPark_TZA_031714_hrthumb.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-11-1473574928-1210695-2016030314570219202321509CristianSamper_7836_AfricanElephantRuahaNationalPark_TZA_031714_hrthumb-thumb.jpg,"As thousands of conservationists gathered in Honolulu for the IUCN World Conservation Congress this week, it was more than clear that IUCN members needed to take a strong stand if Africa's elephants were to have a chance at survival.By the close of the congress, the global conservation community had stepped up to say: No more domestic ivory sales. Elephants have had enough of the ivory trade and so has the world. The final vote overwhelmingly approving Motion 007 calling for closure of domestic elephant ivory markets across the globe was vital, for the news about Africa's elephants is as bad as bad news gets. The 2016 IUCN World Conservation Congress passed a strong measure in Hawaii calling for the closure of global domestic ivory markets. Image: Cristián Samper/WCS.At the start of the meeting in Hawaii, WCS's Andrea Turkalo issued a scientific paper for which she served as lead author showing that it will take almost a century for Africa's forest elephants to recover from the intense poaching they have suffered since 2002. At the same time, the results of the Great Elephant Census, funded by Microsoft founder Paul Allen, were released.Undertaken by a team of scientists and conservationists -- including WCS's Dr. Paul Elkan, Falk Grossmann and other WCS field staff, working in cooperation with government wildlife departments -- the census has documented that savanna elephants have declined at a rate of 27,000 -- or 8 percent -- per year, with a total of 144,000 lost in less than a decade. The surveys also revealed that several populations, particularly in West and Central Africa, are at dangerously low levels -- risking local extinction.The shutting down of domestic ivory markets would send a clear signal to traffickers and organized criminal syndicates that ivory is worthless and will no longer support their criminal activities. In addition to the threat those activities pose to wildlife, they have been responsible for widespread security problems in local communities.  Cristián Samper at the Dzanga Bai research station of WCS's Andrea Turkalo, the site of recent research indicating that African forest elephants could take close to a century to recover from recent poaching. Image: Elizabeth Bennett/WCS.The close of domestic markets would play a critical role in preventing the sale of illegal ivory under the cover of a legal trade, making it much easier for law enforcement agencies to do their jobs and much harder for the syndicates to profit from their nefarious trade.As we leave Hawai'i, many in the conservation community, including government representatives, will now head to a major meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Johannesburg. There, we remain hopeful the delegates will be emboldened by the IUCN vote to adopt a resolution submitted by African governments that also calls for closure of domestic ivory markets.Through our policy advocacy and 96 Elephants campaign, WCS has fought to protect elephants on several levels - local, national, and international. We have been encouraged by efforts of several U.S. states -- including Hawaii, New York, and California -- to ban ivory sales even as the United States and France have closed their markets and China and Hong Kong SAR have promised to do the same.  WCS Vice President for Field Conservation Programs Joe Walston loads a piece of carved ivory on a conveyor belt to be crushed in Times Square. Image: Julie Larsen Maher/WCS.Other key steps have included reinforcement of site-based anti-poaching and protected area management actions. At the same time, a growing number of countries across Africa are taking more effective law enforcement actions against poachers and in their ports, while more than a dozen countries across the world have burned or crushed their stockpiles of confiscated ivory. All these actions have kept momentum behind shutting down the ivory markets that have devastated elephant populations.In September 2015, US President Obama and Chinese President Xi committed to ""enact nearly complete bans on ivory imports and exports."" While China has not taken the final step needed to shut down its domestic ivory market, it has committed to close its market soon - an action likely to inflict a grave blow to ivory criminals. Through a series of social media mini-campaigns developed in China, thousands of Chinese travelers have taken pictures documenting their pledge to ""Bring No Ivory Home"" on shouhudaxiang.org. Graphic courtesy WCS China Program.It is important to note that the IUCN ivory motion highlighted the leadership of African nations behind the movement to save elephants, including African-led efforts such as the Cotonou Declaration of 2015; the African Elephant Action Plan and associated African Elephant Fund; and the Elephant Protection Initiative. Africa's leadership has been inspiring to all. Their elephants and their communities are suffering and the world must heed the call to put an end to the ivory trade, once and for all.The movement to protect Africa's elephants gives us all hope that the elephant will continue to be a vital part of Africa's magnificent natural heritage. WCS will not halt in this effort as we work to stop the killing, stop the trafficking, and stop the demand."
6,POLITICS,"Putin's View Of Trump: A Pushover, A Weaker Version Of Neville Chamberlain","Paul Abrams, ContributorLast person on Earth not on Facebook",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/putins-view-of-trump-a-pu_b_11954946.html,The latest joke in our absurd presidential campaign is that Russian President Vladimir Putin sees Donald Trump as a strong leader.  This is causing belly-laughs in the Kremlin.,2016-09-11,"Russia's President Vladmir Putin gestures, during a joint news conference with Italy's Premier-elect Silvio Berlusconi (not visible), after talks in Berlusconi's Villa Certosa, in Porto Rotondo, on the island region of Sardinia, Italy, Friday, April 18, 2008. (AP Photo/Luca Bruno)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb829f7240000510057381c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The latest joke in our absurd presidential campaign is that Russian President Vladimir Putin sees Donald Trump as a strong leader. This is causing belly-laughs in the Kremlin. People in Putin's inner circle say that Putin considers Trump a buffoon, easily manipulated by flattery, without a scintilla of knowledge or depth about the world outside his golf courses. Moreover, Trump's stated willingness to recognize Putin's annexation of Crimea, to lift sanctions, not to object to the occupation of an area in Ukraine, to withdraw promises of support for NATO allies in the Baltic, and for NATO as a whole, is the Russian dictator's dream. Putin was a big winner in the Brexit vote as it shook the strength of the EU, a rival political power (and was probably bemused at Trump's happiness that it was good for business of his golf course in Scotland. Geopolitical benefit for Putin vs. more business (perhaps) for Trump's golf course is, in Trump's world, a win. Keep that in mind.)According to Putin insiders, he sees Trump as a weaker, far more ignorant, wholly self-absorbed version of Neville Chamberlain. Easy-pickin's.Putin also knows Trump cannot resist a good deal, ie, that benefits him personally. If Trump were president, Putin knows he can offer bargain-basement terms on choice property in Moscow and in St Petersberg, for example, for Trump's company to build hotels in exchange for geopolitical concessions from the U.S. that have no impact on Trump's wealth. And, here's the kicker: Trump would walk away believing HE got the better of Putin, and brag about it!Putin, remember, was KGB. He has used psy-ops on U.S. leaders before. Learning that George W. Bush was religious, Putin displayed a cross around his neck at their first meeting, pointing out that his grandmother had given it to him. Soon thereafter, W proclaimed that he had looked into Putin's eyes, seen his soul, and that he was someone we could work with. Indeed, Bush, who also looks like Hercules compared to Trump, is an object lesson in claims of ""global strength."" When Putin invaded the Republic of Georgia, and took permanent control of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, what did the 'strong' Bush Administration do? Nothing. Trump likely has no idea where Georgia is, and has never heard of, and cares nothing for those two other states.When Putin did the same in Crimea and now occupies part of Ukraine, what did the Obama Administration do? Impose sanctions (those are the ones Trump will lift) of increasing scope, reiterate its commitment to the Baltic States (the ones Trump would betray), and provide aid to the Ukrainian government. Who acted with more strength, Obama or Bush? There has been speculation that Putin might not seek another term. But, if Trump were the US President, it is hard to believe that this psyops master would give up on the opportunity of a lifetime, having a U.S. leader literally eating out of his hand with little effort. Now, of course, Putin must publicly disavow such favoritism, and build up Trump as a tough opponent in order to insure his election. But there is no reason to believe it. After all, as presidential candidate, Trump has already signaled his readiness to appease Russia, hired a campaign manager who waged another campaign to undermine NATO, and even begged Russia to violate U.S. law to hack the Clinton campaign. And, of course, has undisclosed ties to Russian oligarchs himself.What more could Putin want? He is licking his chops. Brace yourselves for an October surprise."

Commissioners and staff traveled to 28 foreign countries, convened 33 major conferences, collecting information and ideas from hundreds of expert witnesses on a comprehensive range of security threats, but also security opportunities. Our focus was consistently on the differences the world of the early 21st century would represent from the 20th. Very early in our deliberations we became convinced that the new era of terrorism would visit the American homeland sooner rather than later and with potential catastrophic consequences.Early on, in interim public reports, we warned that, ""Terrorists will likely attack the United States and Americans will die on American soil, possibly in large numbers."" In our final report to the new George W. Bush administration eleven days after its inauguration, we repeated that stark warning in print to the President and in person to the Secretaries of State and Defense and to the new National Security Adviser.We were specifically and deeply concerned that the three principal agencies with responsibility for border protection, the Coast Guard, Customs Service and Border Patrol, were accountable to three separate Cabinet officers in separate Departments and did not possess a common communications system or data base. Watch lists were haphazard and often not shared. Thus, our first recommendation was to create a U.S. Department of Homeland Security responsible to one Cabinet officer who would be accountable to the President, Congress and the American people.The new administration did not undertake that effort until more than nine months after the tragedy of 9/11, and it is still attempting to achieve full effectiveness. Nonetheless, the great government of the United States, in the eight months between our urgent recommendation and 9/11, could, at the very least, have created that communication system and data base among the border agencies and vastly increased the chances of identifying the terrorist plotters.We Americans are steadfast, even courageous, in responding to attacks on our nation. We are less than steadfast at anticipating, preparing for, and preventing those attacks. We who write these words believe that future terrorist attacks are virtually inevitable. They may or may not utilize commercial aircraft in their purposes. But a cyber shutdown of our air traffic control system might cost multiple numbers of casualties beyond 9/11, a similar cyber attack on our highly computerized financial systems would wreck our economy, and much of the rest of the world, until repaired. And who is to determine whether a highly contagious viral pandemic was the work of nature or biological terrorists.A great nation such as ours cannot function on perpetual high alert, nor will we become a frightened people. But eternal vigilance requires informed, serious and concerned citizens. We owe it to those who perished to do nothing less.Given our experience, as vivid in our memories today as it was watching thousands of our fellow citizens perish on television fifteen years ago, one should not wonder why these thoughts are still on our minds.Convinced of peril yet unable to generate administrative or legislative action, against the backdrop of that intense experience, we cannot help but ponder whether, possibly for the remainder of a lifetime, we could have and should have done more."

He’s boasted about the size of his penis on national television. He’s bragged about his wealth and how beautiful his buildings are. He’s taken joy in insulting fellow candidates and reporters and even attacked the family of a soldier killed in Iraq. And he’s long shared stories of his sexual promiscuity.But those who attended the Values Voter Summit, the annual gathering of religious conservatives where Trump spoke on Friday, were willing to look past those actions. While they acknowledged that Trump hasn’t exactly been a saint, they said they were willing to forgive him.“I know that Donald Trump may not be Jesus Christ but he’s a lot better option for me than Hillary Clinton is,” attendee Hannah Holt told The Huffington Post. Holt added that Trump’s behavior “should bother anyone,” but that Democratic candidate Clinton wasn’t perfect either.“I mean, your husband was on a public stage in a public forum as one of the leaders of this entire world and was fooling around. Neither candidate is a good option in that area,” she said.In his remarks on Friday, Trump spoke about the power of religion to bring people together, but he did not talk about his own faith. He even bragged about how many evangelicals had supported him in the Republican primary.“All across the nation, a lot of people said: ‘I wonder if Donald will get the evangelicals?’ I got the evangelicals. I’m going to make it up to you too, you watch,” he said. “There are no more decent, devoted, or selfless people than our Christian brothers and sisters here in the United States.”Many attendees admitted that they were uncomfortable with Trump’s boasting.“As far as his values and morals go, we’re all a little bit iffy about it because you know he’s said some things that are kind of on the line. He is technically a conservative but he says thing a lot of the time that we don’t agree with,” Mitsy Cardoso said.For some, Trump’s boastfulness and his other flaws simply humanize him.“The thing I appreciate is that even though he has a life that I don’t necessarily agree with and I hope I’d make better choices, I think it tells everybody a story that all of us make mistakes, we’re not perfect,” Joe Tegerdine said.Heidi Pezdek, who came to the summit from Indiana, said that while Trump’s actions did “not reflect Christian values,” she believed recently he had changed and was becoming more Christian.“We are not looking for a perfect candidate. We’re looking for a candidate that takes good counsel and has strong leadership skills,” she said. “We’re not looking for a pastor or a perfect person and as Christians, we all know that we’re all works of progress.” Clinton is a Methodist and has spoken about how her youth minister got her involved in public service. Trump has questioned whether his Democratic rival really is Christian.Joseph Guagliardi, a student at Liberty University, admitted that Trump didn’t display Christian values. “As far as Christian values go, I’m not really sure where he’s at with that, but basically for me, I’m just seeing more of His values in him than I do in Hillary,” he added.Forgiving Trump is something that Christianity encourages, Nancy Elliott said.“The great thing about Christianity, it’s about forgiveness and when a person recognizes that the path they’re on is wrong, has been wrong, they change that direction and I think God forgives them and I think we have to too,” she said. Elliott added that she was fine with Trump’s bragging about constructing the most beautiful hotels and buildings because “that’s probably just truth. Is there a problem telling truth?”But it’s not clear how much exactly the businessman wants to be forgiven. Asked last year if he had ever asked God for forgiveness, Trump said he wasn’t sure if he had.“I just go on and try to do a better job from there,” Trump told Frank Luntz last year. “If I do something wrong, I think, I just try and make it right. I don’t bring God into that picture. I don’t.” Trump did recently say on the campaign trail that he had regrets, but declined to get into specifics.While attendees were willing to give Trump’s faith the benefit of the doubt when it came to his religion, they applied a different standard to President Barack Obama, whom they said didn’t act like he was a Christian.“I do not believe he’s shown signs of Christianity. He is so in the tank with Planned Parenthood that kills babies, I find it hard to believe that is very inconsistent, murder babies. I don’t see the fruits of Christianity in him,” Elliott said. “He may be, I hope he is. I have no ill towards the man, but he doesn’t show the roots of a believer.” Asked whether Obama is a Muslim, as Trump has suggested, Elliott said she didn’t know. “He states he is, but we look at people by the fruit that they portray,” Pezdek said. “So, I’m still looking for the fruit that bears that statement out.” The GOP nominee shares in his 2004 book, Trump: Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life, some of his thoughts on God using descriptive language that is unmistakably Trumpian.“I do not think I am God. I believe in God. If God ever wanted an apartment in Trump Tower, I would immediately offer my best luxury suite at a very special price,” he writes. “I believe God is everywhere and in all of us, and I want every decision I make to reflect well on me when it’s time to go to the big boardroom in the sky. When I get permanently fired by the ultimate boss, I want the elevator to go up, not down.”To Samuel Stover, the passage from Trump’s book shows a misunderstanding of God. “I definitely think he lacks the perception of how powerful God is in some ways,” Stover said. “You know that he’s just somebody that we’re offering, oh you can have a suite. But he’s someone we offer our lives to and as a Christian, that’s what we choose to do. It’s a life commitment.” Still, he said, Trump had a point.“If an apartment suite is the best that I have for God, then that’s what I’d like to give him.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Chief among their concerns is Trump’s seemingly unwavering support for Putin, who the two argue has “repeatedly shown himself to be an adversary of the United States.”“Putin, during his long tenure, has repeatedly pursued policies that undermine U.S. interests and those of our allies and partners,” Vickers and Morell said. “He has steadily but systematically moved Russia from a fledgling democratic state to an authoritarian one. He is the last foreign leader you should be praising.”The editorial comes after Wednesday night’s debacle of a forum, where Trump said he would keep saying “great things” the Russian president as long as Putin continues to compliment him.“I’ve already said, he is really very much of a leader,” Trump said of Putin. “I mean, you can say, ‘Oh, isn’t that a terrible thing’ ― the man has very strong control over a country.” But “control over a country” has been at the expense of the Russian people themselves, Morell and Vickers argued. At home, Putin has jailed and killed political opponents. He has jailed and killed journalists. He has neutered the Russian media to the point that he is in complete control of the message reaching the Russian people. He has the popularity that you so admire only because he determines what the Russian people hear about him and his government. Do you support Putin’s violation of Russian law and his tramping of the civil rights of his populace, explicitly protected in the Russian constitution?Well, Trump, do you?

He then further questioned her mental health. “Personally, I think she’s an unstable person,” he said.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The women were wearing hijabs and pushing two babies — an 11-month-old and a 15-month-old — in strollers. Police say Xhelili tried to rip the hijabs off their heads, then hit the women in the face, pushed over one stroller and rattled another, CNN reports.“Get the the fuck out of America, bitches,” Xhelili also allegedly shouted. “This is America — you shouldn’t be different from us.”The mothers and children were not seriously injured.

At the time, Trump did not disclose that the donations all came from him, and regulators did not identify the companies as being part of Trump’s real estate empire.The contributions included $500 from Trump himself; $500 from 40 Wall Street LLC, a company Trump controls; $500 from VH Property Corp DBA Trump National Golf Course, a Trump company that operates mainly in California; and $500 from Wollman Rink Operations LLC, a company Trump created to manage an ice skating rink in Manhattan’s Central Park.The four contributions were first identified by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, a group supporting Trump’s rival, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump identified all three companies as under his control in his personal financial disclosure report to the Office of Government Ethics, filed in the summer of 2015. A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond on Friday to questions from The Huffington Post. At the time of the gifts, Crist was a Republican, but in recent years the former governor has run as an Independent and as a Democrat. The donations from Trump appear to be the latest example of the Republican nominee using his maze of business interests and corporations to get around laws that limit how much one individual or company can donate to a particular political campaign. During the GOP primary campaign, Trump bragged about how he used campaign contributions to effectively buy political support for his business interests. “When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me,” Trump said.But Trump’s cavalier attitude towards election law has repeatedly gotten him into trouble with regulators, and sometimes resulted in serious fines. In the 1980s, Trump admitted to using his web of companies to contribute tens of thousands of dollars beyond the legal limit to the campaign of the chairman of the New York City Council. And in 1993, Trump paid a $15,000 fine to the Federal Election Commission for exceeding the legal limit of contributions to federal candidates. More recently, Trump has come under fire for using his tax-exempt nonprofit, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, to give $25,000 to a PAC supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi’s reelection bid. Such donations violate nonprofit tax laws, and Trump was fined $2,500. The donation to Bondi was made during a short window of time in September of 2013 when Bondi’s office was deciding whether to investigate Trump University, the Republican nominee’s now-shuttered seminar program.Trump is facing lawsuits in multiple states alleging that the company defrauded customers. Bondi, however, decided not to pursue legal claims against Trump over Trump University.Trump later hosted a fundraiser for Bondi at his home in Palm Beach in March 2014. He held a similar fundraising event for Crist in June 2005 in Manhattan, helping to introduce the attorney general to wealthy New Yorkers.

If not now, when? ― Emma Watson,” a graphic posted by Trump’s account said. (It was also posted on Trump’s Facebook and Twitter accounts.) The saying ― which has been quoted and repurposed by many luminaries over the years ― is a variation of a quote attributed to Hillel the Elder, an important rabbinic authority from more than two millennia ago.Although its origins may not be widely known, many social media observers joked that Trump should know better, given that she converted to Orthodox Judaism before marrying her husband, Jared Kushner, in 2009.Watson, known for her role as Hermione in the “Harry Potter” film series, did say those words during a 2014 speech announcing a gender equality initiative at the United Nations. Hillel’s original quote is longer. “If I am not for myself, who is for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?” Hillel is quoted as saying in the tractate of the Mishnah known as “Ethics of the Fathers.” Of course, Trump most likely does not personally run her social media accounts. If anything, it is one of the tasks assigned to her army of unpaid interns.Donald Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The incident is also notable because, in referencing Watson’s speech on gender equality, Ivanka continues to lend a veneer of female empowerment to her father’s presidential campaign, despite the elder Trump’s long history of misogynist comments.Some of Ivanka’s efforts to make her father’s candidacy more women-friendly have already backfired. The Trump campaign’s proposed child care tax credit, reportedly championed by Ivanka, has been widely panned for excluding the poorest families."

We will take care of them,” said Syed Mokbul Hossain, chair of Tampaco and a former member of parliament.“My company is fully compliant and I’ve never sacrificed on quality, as my clients are mainly multinational companies.”Tampaco’s website says its clients include several local companies and global brands including British American Tobacco and Nestle.Fire department officials initially identified the factory as a garment packaging plant, but later clarified that it packs food and cigarettes.The fire will further tarnish the industrial safety record of one of the world’s top garment exporters.In the Rana Plaza disaster, 1,135 mainly garment industry workers were killed when a building collapsed outside Dhaka.That sparked demands for greater safety in the country and put the onus on multinational companies sourcing clothing from Bangladesh to act.The disaster led to the creation of two international coalitions designed to help fund improvements to building and fire safety at thousands of garment factories across Bangladesh.“So far our focus was only on readymade garment factories, but now this disaster has opened our eyes to the fact that we should also focus on other factories,” Syed Ahmed, the head of the Department of Inspection for factories in Bangladesh, told Reuters.The latest incident comes weeks after over 100 people fell ill when they inhaled gas that leaked from a fertilizer plant in the town of Chittagong in southern Bangladesh.(Writing by Euan Rocha; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Clarence Fernandez)"

Columbus was no friend to First Americans.gen·o·cideIn the old days, the “Indian” problem was taken care of with disease, soldiers and guns. Presidential orders were signed, soldiers dispatched, bounties given to militia all with the singular purpose of killing Native Americans. It didn’t matter whether those natives were armed, unarmed, elderly, women or children.According to the government and the collective consensus, the only good Indian was a dead Indian.Any Native American who was able to survive the slaughters, diseases, internment, starvation and forced marches were relegated to reservations. Often these lands designated for reservations were not homelands nor extremely desirable lands.I wish I could say America has recognized its fault in practically wiping out an entire ethnic group. I wish I could say that amends have been made in ensuring that Natives have the best education, medical care and work opportunities in the country. I wish I could say that as a whole Native Americans are thriving. None of that rings true generations after Wounded Knee, The Long Walk or the Trail of Tears.For those of you who have never set foot on a reservation, I urge you to visit one and I don’t mean a casino. I mean the dirt poor areas where water doesn’t run freely from a tap. It has to be hauled in over a rutted dirt road. Electricity... perhaps if you are lucky or have a generator. Don’t even think about the luxury of wi-fi. Please excuse the suspicious nature of its inhabitants... they have reason for that.When I was a kid, I remember how many, many people were still living in shacks covered in tar paper. This wasn’t out in the middle of nowhere. This was in one of the bigger towns on the Navajo reservation. I went with my family down to Mexico once and marveled about how much it reminded me of the reservation. People there also lived in shacks that looked like they were built with found materials. Mexico was pretty close to third-world at that time.The reservation has changed some since then but not enough. I am ever the optimist but at times I feel resigned that it won’t change. Lately, I’m feeling that resignation dissipating with the events unfolding in South Dakota.It fills me with extreme pride to see so many tribes united in the cause that is the Standing Rock protest. Standing Rock isn’t just about oil. Standing Rock isn’t just about water. Standing Rock is a test. There is a roar coming from North Dakota. This is the moment you can choose to listen to that roar of our voices, to recognize that we are people, we belong here and our cause is valid.So far the mainstream media has chosen to be fairly silent in reference to Standing Rock. Apparently, spray tan and non-truths play and pay better than warpaint and ethics. Much has been done to try and silence the voices of protesters at the site. Of the mainstream coverage that has emerged sparingly, one network has painted them as violent anarchists using white biased coverage (CBS, I’m talking about you). Never mind those attack dogs set loose on a little girl. She’s not your little girl though, so why should you care?MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell has been one of very few to broach the subject and do so in a stellar manner.Some of you might be offended by my characterization of America and feel like this doesn’t represent you. If that is the case, then I challenge you. I challenge you to do something! Recognize it, talk about it, and share it! Sign a petition, attend a protest, challenge your lawmakers, donate to the cause. Turning a blind eye or worse yet assuming it’ll work itself out only perpetuates the notion that Native Americans aren’t human, don’t belong here and should cease to exist altogether.A version of this post originally appeared on SurlyBird.wordpress.com."
17,POLITICS,"Yes, Conservatives Are Still Questioning Whether President Obama Is Really A Christian",Sam Levine and Christine Conetta,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-christian-conservatives_us_57d446dee4b00642712dd499,"“There’s a lot of public, media stuff that says he’s not.""",2016-09-10,Several attendees at the Values Voter Summit said they don't think President Barack Obama is Christian.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d44bbd1800006c32bd0946.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― It was a yes-or-no question that shouldn’t have been hard to answer: Is President Barack Obama a Christian?Donald Trump has fueled speculation that Obama might be Muslim since 2011, when he questioned whether the president was really born in Hawaii. Obama eventually released his birth certificate, but the GOP presidential nominee still refuses to disavow so-called “birthers.”Still, the absurd conspiracy theory seemed to be an old story ― one that has been debunked so many times and that Obama himself has made fun of. But several people The Huffington Post asked Friday about Obama’s faith at the annual Values Voter Summit, a conference for religious conservatives, showed that Trump has very much succeeded in raising questions about the president’s religion.“I do question it, I really do,” said Linda Roller, referring to Obama’s Christianity. “One of the latest things I saw was even a symbol with his hand that was similar to a Muslim saying Allah is the only God.”Roller went on to say that she didn’t think Obama was Christian because he didn’t share her beliefs.“I mean just the fact that he is very liberal and the fact that he believes in abortion for instance,” she said. “And that he believes in a lot things that I don’t believe in because I try to use the Bible as my guide.” Several people echoed Roller. Many believed that even though Obama said he was Christian, his actions, particularly support for pro-abortion rights and for Planned Parenthood, suggested otherwise.“He states he is, but we look at people by the fruit that they portray,” Heidi Pezdek said. “What I’m looking at is his stand for abortion and support for Planned Parenthood, which is murder, murder in the womb, and his strong support of the LGBT lifestyle community.”Nancy Elliott said she didn’t believe he’s shown signs of Christianity. “He is so in the tank with Planned Parenthood that kills babies,” she said. “I don’t see the fruits of Christianity in him. He may be, I hope he is. I have no ill towards the man, but he doesn’t show the roots of a believer.” When asked whether she thought Obama was a Muslim, Elliott replied, “I don’t know. They say he was raised as a Muslim.”A CNN/ORC poll from last September showed that just 39 percent of Americans think Obama is a Christian. Twenty-nine percent of those surveyed said they think he is a Muslim.“I’m not too sure,” Values Voter Summit attendee Joseph Guagliardi said. “While he does claim to be a Christian, I’m not sure how you can be for abortion and be a Christian because as Christians we believe in pro-life.” Joe Tegerdine said actions were more important than stated beliefs when it came to Christianity.“If you look at somebody’s policies and the way they behave and the way they act, it speaks more about your Christianity than what you say. So I take what Obama says literally at face value, but I take what he does to heart,” he said. “I think he’s proven through his behavior that he may not be as Christian as he may claim.”Obama has spoken extensively about his Christian faith on several occasions.“For me, and I know for so many of you, faith is the great cure for fear,” he said at the National Prayer Breakfast this year. “Jesus is a good cure for fear. God gives believers the power, the love, the sound mind required to conquer any fear.” The president said in 2006 that an attack suggesting he wasn’t a “true Christian” during his race for a U.S. Senate seat in Illinois “nagged” at him. Obama has said that while he was not raised in a particularly religious household, he found the power of Christianity while working as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago.“Without a vessel for my beliefs, without a commitment to a particular community of faith, at some level I would always remain apart, and alone,” he said in 2006. “It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. I didn’t fall out in church. The questions I had didn’t magically disappear. But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God’s spirit beckoning me. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth.” Obama left his church, Chicago’s Trinity United Church of Christ, in 2008 after comments of his pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, criticizing the United States emerged. Despite Obama’s references to his faith, Tristen Jimenez said he still hadn’t seen enough evidence that the president is a Christian.“I don’t know enough facts to answer that yes or no, there’s a lot of public, media stuff that says he’s not. At the end of the day, I don’t know,” Jimenez said. “I want to say [he is] just because he is our president and you want to have trust and faith in that, but you know, I don’t know his heart; I don’t know what’s in his head.” Asked whether Obama is Muslim, Jimenez said “he could be anything.”While attendees at the Values Voter Summit didn’t hesitate to question Obama’s faith, they seemed more than willing to take Trump at his word that he was a Christian, despite constant boasting from the GOP nominee about his sexual promiscuity, lies and other unchristian actions.When Roller, the woman who questioned Obama’s faith because of something he did with his hands, noted that she didn’t know what church the president went to or who his pastor was, the HuffPost asked if she knew what church Trump attended.“No I do not,” she said."
18,POLITICS,Maker Of Dangerous Opioid Is Spending Big To Stop Legal Pot In Arizona,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dangerous-opioid-maker-spending-big-to-stop-arizona-legalization_us_57d45eb2e4b06a74c9f50515,Insys Therapeutics has been accused of illegally marketing its oral spray of fentanyl.,2016-09-10,Law enforcement officials in Arizona process marijuana seized from Mexico. Would legal pot reduce imports from Mexico?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d4613c1300002a0039b286.jpeg?cache=RX8aErM3Ii&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A controversial pharmaceutical company that makes a highly addictive opioid donated $500,000 to a campaign fighting a ballot measure in Arizona that would legalize recreational marijuana.Proponents of the measure, Proposition 205, see Insys Therapeutics, the company behind the major contribution, as emblematic of the way the makers of dangerous painkillers block legalization efforts to pad their own profit margins. Marijuana is a cheaper and safer alternative to drugs that the likes of Insys sell, the advocates argue.“We are truly shocked by our opponents’ decision to keep a donation from what appears to be one of the more unscrupulous members of Big Pharma,” said J.P. Holyoak, chair of the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, in a statement. “You have a company using profits from the sale of what has been called ‘the most potent and dangerous opioid on the market’ to prevent adults from using a far less harmful substance.”Insys currently only markets Subsys, an oral spray form of fentanyl, a powerful painkiller linked to the opioid epidemic, according to its most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Arizona-based firm is also developing a synthetic cannabis product, which it said would improve on a product it sold in the past, but has discontinued.The company has endured multiple investigations in recent years for allegedly illegal marketing of Subsys. The state of Illinois sued the company in August, arguing that Insys had marketed the drug to physicians for “off-label” uses, meaning those not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Arizona and Oregon have also investigated the company’s sales tactics.The scrutiny has corresponded with a drop in revenue from Subsys. Insys’ net revenue went from $148 million in the first half of 2015 to $129 million in the first half of 2016, according to its SEC filing. The drop was “attributable” to a 27.7 percent decrease in Subsys sales, which the company partly offset through price increases.The accusations are particularly problematic, because of the risks associated with the abuse of fentanyl-based drugs like Subsys. As Holyoak notes in his statement, Dr. Andrew Kolodny, executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, told CNBC that fentanyl is “the most potent and dangerous opioids on the market.”The United States is in the midst of a deadly opioid epidemic. More than 28,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses in 2014 ― the most on record ― according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Opioids include illegal drugs such as heroin, but the largest increase in overdose deaths from 2013 to 2014 was due to synthetic opioids like fentanyl.Some reports indicate that fentanyl has grown in prominence after the demise of OxyContin, an opioid released by Purdue in the 1990s. (Purdue’s aggressive marketing of OxyContin is blamed for enabling the overprescription and abuse that gave rise to the current opioid crisis.)The celebrated musician Prince, who died at age 57 in April, is perhaps the most famous person to overdose on fentanyl.Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, the political action committee opposing Prop. 205 that received the donation from Insys, enjoys the backing of top Arizona lawmakers in the state, including Gov. Doug Ducey (R). Insys is the first donor the group lists in a line at the bottom of the site acknowledging the sources of its “major funding.” The other backers Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy publicizes are the Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Empire Southwest LLC, and Pima Medical Institute. The Arizona Chamber and Empire Southwest each contributed $50,000 to ARDP, and Pima gave $40,000 in the 12-month period ending in August, according to the latest campaign finance report.Adam Deguire, the group’s campaign manager and a former chief of staff to Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon (R), told the U.S. News & World Report that ARDP would not be returning Insys’ donation. Insys is based in Arizona, whereas the Marijuana Policy Project, a pro-legalization group, is based in Washington, D.C., Deguire noted.Barrett Marson, communications director of Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, said location is less important than motive in this case.“Obviously Insys isn’t concerned about prohibition of marijuana, it is concerned about profits,” Marson said.Registered voters in Arizona favored passing Prop. 205 by a 10-point margin as of the end of August, according to an Arizona Republic poll.Medical marijuana has been legal in Arizona since 2010, but criminal penalties for its recreational use remain heavy.The federal government still classifies marijuana as a “Schedule I” drug, a category it reserves for the most dangerous and addictive substances that have no acceptable medical use."
