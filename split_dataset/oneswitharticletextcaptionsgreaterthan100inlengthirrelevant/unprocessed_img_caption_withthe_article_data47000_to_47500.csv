Shamefully, we have tens of millions of people living in poverty.",2016-09-04,"PHILADELPHIA, PA - JULY 25: A delegate holds a sign that reads 'Stronger together' on the first day of the Democratic National Convention at the Wells Fargo Center, July 25, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. An estimated 50,000 people are expected in Philadelphia, including hundreds of protesters and members of the media. The four-day Democratic National Convention kicked off July 25.

It is well past time that American workers receive their fair share of that wealth. Americans work extremely long hours and are incredibly productive. Yet, for the last three and a half decades, they have not received the just fruits of their labor. From 1948 to 1979, two-thirds of aggregate income growth in the United States went to the bottom 90 percent. But from 1979 onward, nearly two-thirds of growth went to the top 1 percent. Meanwhile, the aggregate income of the bottom 90 percent actually declined! We are the wealthiest country in the world at the wealthiest moment in our history. Shamefully, we have tens of millions of people living in poverty. The middle class is being squeezed out, caught between those with unprecedented wealth and those who suffer food insecurity, who go to bed hungry.This rising and perilous income and wealth inequality did not happen by accident. It is the foreseeable consequence of a persistent upward redistribution of wealth, resulting from decades of public policies that favor corporations and the wealthiest Americans over everyone else. These public policies constitute a war on workers. Attacks on unions, privatization of public functions, huge tax breaks for those at the top, deep cuts to domestic spending, weakening of regulations protecting workers, an eroding minimum wage, and attacks on our Social Security system are all part of the war. Predictably, they have resulted in stagnating wages and longer hours for everyday workers, and the income and wealth inequality we see all around us.Fortunately, workers can help themselves this November 8. Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have concrete plans to reverse these destructive policies, stop the upward redistribution of wealth, and make sure that workers receive their fair share. In sharp contrast, Donald Trump and the Republican Party have concrete plans to double down on the war on workers.It is long past time that workers receive a substantial raise. Total compensation packages should be increased. That means take-home pay should be larger. So should deferred compensation, in the form of larger Social Security checks at retirement. So should Social Security's life insurance and disability insurance benefits, earned with every pay check. And, Social Security's protections should be expanded to include other vital protections, including paid sick leave and paid family leave. Workers' ability to fight for higher compensation should be strengthened. So should regulations protecting workers' health and safety.Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party advocate a substantial, long-overdue increase in the federal minimum wage, while Donald Trump and the Republican Party are fine with a starvation federal minimum wage. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party want to protect and strengthen workers' ability to bargain with their employers, while Donald Trump and the Republican Party propose to intensify their war on collective bargaining. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party want to improve worker health and safety, while Donald Trump and the Republican Party want to further weaken these protections. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party favor paid family leave, paid sick days, and paid vacation. Donald Trump and the Republican Party apparently do not think these benefits, available to workers around the world, are worth even mentioning. The stance of the two parties and their presidential standard bearers are well exemplified by their divergent Social Security positions.  In their new book, Stronger Together, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine identify and repudiate the ""years of mythmaking, claiming we cannot afford Social Security and that the only solution is to cut the benefits on which 90 percent of American seniors rely."" In sharp contrast, Donald Trump and the Republican Party are aggressively promoting the myth. The Republican Platform, in fear-mongering fashion, labels its Social Security plank, ""Saving Social Security, ""(emphasis added), and claims that Social Security's ""current course will lead to a financial and social disaster."" Hillary Clinton, Tim Kaine, and the Democratic Party advocate expanding Social Security's modest but vital benefits. They recognize that an expanded Social Security is a solution to many challenges facing the nation, including a looming retirement income crisis and our immoral, destabilizing income and wealth inequality.In contrast, Donald Trump and the Republican Party want to cut and privatize -- that is, dismantle -- our Social Security system. While Donald Trump promised during the primaries that he wouldn't cut Social Security, this is clearly a lie. Immediately after he clinched the nomination, his top policy adviser told a closed door meeting, that Trump would indeed be open to cuts, the Trump campaign is filled with policy advisors who support cuts, the Republican Platform advocates cuts and privatization, and Trump's past statements, prior to running, advocate cutting and privatizing the program he slanderously labeled a ""Ponzi scheme."" He apparently understands the politics though, having warned Republicans in 2011 that openly advocating cuts to Social Security would cost them at the ballot box. Clinton's book title and her campaign rallying cry, Stronger Together, could be used to describe Social Security. Stronger Together describes perfectly Social Security's conceptual underpinning. Social Security recognizes that all of us face common economic risks. Rich or poor, any of us can die prematurely, leaving young children behind. Rich or poor, any of us can suffer a devastating, disabling accident or illness. Rich or poor, all of us hope to grow old. When we do, we need, for a dignified and independent retirement, a guaranteed steady income which we cannot and will not outlive. Social Security recognizes that the best way to protect ourselves and our families against the economic consequences of those risks is to join together and pool them, sharing both our risks and our responsibilities. Stronger together.Under the powerful watchword, Stronger Together, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party advocate raising the income and improving the economic security of every one of us, while eliminating gender and racial income and wealth inequalities. In stark contrast, Donald Trump and the Republican Party scapegoat, seeking to turn us against each other - against immigrants, against Mexican-Americans, against Muslim-Americans. Keep us divided, so we are too weak and distracted to fight together for what we have earned. The Republican divide-and-conquer strategy is nothing new. President Franklin Roosevelt recognized and confronted it, when, a few days before the 1936 presidential election, in a speech defending Social Security against vicious and misleading attacks, he proclaimed, ""It is an old strategy of tyrants to delude their victims into fighting their battles for them.""That strategy is alive and well in the person of Donald Trump. In the election of 1936, Americans understood who was with them and who was not. After their electoral victory, Roosevelt and Democrats in Congress successfully fought for laws providing a federal minimum wage, maximum hours, and protection of collective bargaining. They succeeded in increasing Social Security's benefits and expanding its protections to the families of workers. Like workers in 1936, today's workers should see that the Democratic Party and its presidential standard bearer are with them, while the Republican Party and its presidential standard bearer are against them. If today's workers, like those in 1936, recognize the truth and vote accordingly, the Democrats will win on November 8. Armed with that victory, Clinton and her Democratic allies can fight to increase the minimum wage, expand Social Security, and improve worker security, rights, and wellbeing in numerous other ways. That will be something to celebrate for many Labor Days to come."
1,ENTERTAINMENT,"The Venice Diaries 2016: 'Franca', 'Nocturnal Animals', 'The Bleeder' & Wim Wenders' 3D 'Beautiful Days'","E.

When it comes to fashion, Ford has conquered it, he ""shut it down"" as fashionista Rachel Zoe would say. Fragrances, well as a Jasmin Rouge aficionado myself, I'll say he got that down. Sunglasses, check. Bespoke menswear, check. He's even got a song named after him, by Jay-Z. And film? Wow, yes, yes, oh yes. Nobody does haunting images on the big screen quite like Tom Ford.In his latest oeuvre, well his second after a seven year hiatus from filmmaking, Ford puts together another stellar cast -- which includes Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams and Michael Shannon -- and then mixes up the batch by throwing in a story within the story, a book that fills up the pages of the movie script. It's brilliant, of course we all knew that before going into the Venice Film Festival, where Nocturnal Animals world premiered. As proof of its magnificence, it was impossible to get a hold of any publicists for the movie and the press conference seemed more like a Justin Bieber public appearance than a film delegation meeting the press. Lets face it, even if he's yet to make his first record, Tom Ford is a rockstar.Nocturnal Animals does not disappoint, in any way, shape or form. From the first frame to the last it's haunting and can't-turn-your-eyes-away captivating. I'll admit, the first shots of the voluptuous burlesque women inspired by Fellini made me wonder, and I wrote it down, if Ford's genius had gotten so big for his shoes that people around him were too scared to say something was a bit heavy handed. But once the intent of those images, beautiful and grotesque at once, was known, I quickly crossed out that sentence from my notebook. The story within the story has to do with a book Jake Gyllenhaal's character Edward has written. Edward is Susan's ex, a chronic insomniac played by Amy Adams. In his novel, he tells the tale of a family, Tony (again Gyllenhaal), his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their daughter India (Ellie Bamber), who are harassed and attacked on a desolate Texas road, by three rednecks -- including the chilling Aaron Taylor-Johnson -- one dark night. The outcome requires another phenomenal character, detective Bobby Andes, played by personal favorite Michael Shannon, to come in and help bring the story home. Ford comfortably weaves three threads into Nocturnal Animals, the past of Susan and Edward, her present with new husband Armie Hammer, and the story of Tony and his family, with Andes. The result is spellbinding. At the press conference, Ford confessed that what captured him in the book his film is based on, the 1993 novel Tony & Susan by Austin Wright, is ""loyalty -- that's very important to me. When you find those people in your life, you hold on to them. [It's a] cautionary tale of what can happen when you let go of people.""Gyllenhaal instead confessed that what drew him to the script was ""the color of paper the script was printed on, a particular hue of red I'd never seen."" But of course, once opened, the pretty packaging held ""one of the best scripts I'd ever read. Gripping and emotional and somehow went into a space where the metaphor of heartbreak stepped into real life.""For Adams, the pull was this ""very personal story... I wanted to be a part of telling this story of loss and regret."" But she admitted that, ""when I first started preparing Susan, I didn't like her. And I can't play a character I don't like so I had to find my way into her."" This is where the true talent of Ford's directing came in, she confessed ""Tom's skilled hand was so patient. I really credit Tom for trusting that the stillness and the silence would be filled with the story."" As Ford added, about regrets, those we all have once we stop being 20 and 30, he shared that someone once said to him, ""midlife is when you get to the top of the ladder and find out all along you've had it on the wrong wall."" And he also disclosed his secret for picking stories that stay in our heart, long after his haunting images are gone, ""I think I may be old fashioned but I believe there needs to be a moral to a story. If you leave a theater and it doesn't stay with you, it doesn't haunt you, it's not worth it."" Nocturnal Animals releases in mid-November. Franca Sozzani, to those of us who love fashion, is a legend. Her signature long, blond, wavy hair I've seen from NYC to Florence, from Dubai to Saudi Arabia and now Venice. She's a journalist, and has been the Editor in Chief of Vogue Italia since the late 80s. But she's also a mother, and her son Francesco Carrozzini has made a tribute film to his mother, titled Franca: Chaos and Creation. While I've yet to watch the film, it was interesting to burst in on the press conference for the documentary, since Sozzani and Carrozzini have an explosive dynamic. Hidden beneath the surface of her beauty, and his talent, there are crosscurrents these two feel, quite obviously, about each other's work. As the daughter of a strong mother who claimed something similar to what Sozzani declared -- that ""in the moment I leave work the magazine could burn down!"" -- I know that's true, but to some extent. My mother was always the artist, and while I never lacked for anything, as I'm sure Carrozzini never did either, I felt mom's aloofness during her hard days of creation. But creative women are forever struggling with that, the idea that they have to be mothers and wives and then also powerful work machines. I see that struggle even in Sozzani beautifully put together persona. I yearned to hear her secret for that ever blissed-out look that always completes her outfits. ""I've never stopped dreaming,"" she admitted, and perhaps that's why film is so powerful. Because even when we have, stopped dreaming, or forget to, cinema reminds us to -- with a vision on the big screen. A technicolor dream. The Bleeder I knew I needed to watch in Venice because it stars Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts. Those two could read the phone book, and as long as they do, together, I would listen to them from A to Z. Their chemistry in this film, though Watts is only on screen for about 15 minutes tops, is so powerful that it left me wanting for more. The Bleeder is the story of real-life Rocky inspiration Chuck Wepner, the boxer most famous for having gone fifteen rounds with Mohammad Ali, before being defeated by Ali. Directed by Oscar nominated filmmaker Philippe Falardeau, The Bleeder is the kind of film that cannot be separated from its stars. I dare not think of it without Schreiber, who holds the audience's attention from the first shot to the last, and the real life chemistry that Watts brings to her role as Wepner's second wife and salvation, Linda. When I asked Schreiber if Wepner is somehow Shakespearean, he enthusiastically answered, ""he's absolutely Shakespearean! But you're talking to a guy who thinks everyone is Shakespearean."" Then, pushing him further, I asked him what makes him so, and Schreiber continued, ""the duality, the conflict, the human tragedy, also his vulnerability, his openness, his innocence, his naiveté; he doesn't hide his mistakes, he makes them beautifully out in the open, exquisitely clumsy. And that's Shakespearean."" The Bleeder screens next at the Toronto International Film Festival. Finally, Wim Wenders latest, The Beautiful Days of Aranjuez in 3D. Why 3D? Wenders was quick to point out, because ""3D is a very tender language and technology, it's a very kind technology, it corresponds to our two eyes if you use it naturally... I don't think I could have included you in any other way."" And include us in he does, into an delicately intimate conversation between a man and a woman, sitting at a table somewhere in the countryside outside Paris, while a man with a typewriter, sitting inside, seems to write their dialogue. Is this God? Are the couple Adam and Eve, since there is an apple on the table? Could be, but they are also every day men and women, struggling to find a way to communicate even though words and thoughts are exchanged between them.At first, I'll admit I felt slightly confused by The Beautiful Days of Aranjuez, but the more time passes after watching it, the stronger I appreciate Wenders genius to be. Apart from the great luxury of watching lavender on the big screen in full 3D wonder and the filmmaker's wonderful choice of music -- including a live performance by Nick Cave -- Wenders teaches us, his audience, a new way to breathe. He slows down our inner rhythm to match his art and it all somehow makes for an outer-worldly experience.And that's what cinema is all about, after all, finding new eyes to help us view the world. Even if those eyes turn out to be bulky 3D glasses!All images courtesy of La Biennale, used with permission. "

3,ENTERTAINMENT,"Liev Schreiber in Venice: Movie Star, 'The Bleeder' and Persol Visionary Talent of 2016","E. Nina Rothe, ContributorCultural Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/liev-schreiber-in-venice_b_11859308.html,,2016-09-04,2016-09-04-1473018931-7003015-AwardWinningCeremonyPersolAwardLievSchreiberAlbertoBarberalaBiennalediVeneziafotoASAC.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-04-1473018931-7003015-AwardWinningCeremonyPersolAwardLievSchreiberAlbertoBarberalaBiennalediVeneziafotoASAC-thumb.JPG," Laura Didoni for Persol, Liev Schreiber and Venice Film Festival Director Alberto BarberaJust what makes a movie star? While there are as many different answers as there are stars, journalists and audience members, to me a real rockstar of the big screen is someone with an oversupply of the ""C"" word: Charisma. Sitting at a roundtable with six other journalists, and by sheer luck right next to Liev Schreiber at a junket for Philippe Falardeau's The Bleeder, it was clear that Schreiber held us captive with his palpable magnetism. While I hardly could pull my gaze away from his strong face, his engrossing tone of voice and the brightest blue eyes this side of the Grand Canal, if I did manage to glance at my colleagues across the table, men and women alike were mesmerized. And all completely and utterly star struck. That is a real movie star. But perhaps the true wonder of someone like Schreiber is that he's not just a movie star -- which in itself would be enough -- he's also a filmmaker, a father, a TV star, a loving partner to co-star in life and film Naomi Watts, and a man. What we all felt at that table was the sort of respect that true men command, and it was exhilarating for those twenty-odd minutes.This year at the Venice Film Festival, Schreiber is promoting The Bleeder, the story of real Rocky inspiration Chuck Wepner, the boxer who went fifteen rounds with Mohammad Ali, only to then loose to the champ. Schreiber also accepted this year's Persol Tribute to Visionary Talent Award, a prestigious prize that has gone to the likes of Frances McDormand and Jonathan Demme in past years. And he's doing all of this, a grueling schedule in Italy before stepping off to Toronto to begin it all again, with class and grace. When I asked Laura Didoni, the Global Luxury Brands Director for Luxottica Group, why Persol had chosen Schreiber, she explained ""Liev Schreiber is a person who is really constantly reinventing himself,"" then continued ""La Biennale and Persol saw in Liev something very close to our brand. He's a very respected Shakespearean actor, so he has a theater heritage, something we have in common really going back to ancient arts. But still he's also made cinema, as an actor and director, very eclectic, and that's why there is a connection, we feel. We have a very unique heritage as well, while also trying to keep an expression that is very fresh. We experiment sometimes, but we never forget where we are coming from. There are a lot of similarities in our stories.""Persol itself has a heritage deeply rooted in Italian cinema and history, from its roots, which Didoni explained by saying that ""the brand was founded in 1917 and the first style was created to protect tram drivers in Turin, from the dust and the elements, because trams were open."" Then came the iconic Fellini, La Dolce Vita and Marcello Mastroianni's glasses, and of course Steve McQueen, whose love of the brand still holds a special place in cinematic history. So, considering the definition of elegance that Didoni gave me, ""effortless authenticity,"" then continuing ""we [at Persol] think you have something special, everyone has something special, you don't need to follow anyone else or anything else... That's elegance!"" I believe wholeheartedly that Schreiber was their perfect choice. And the perfect choice to play Wepner, a man whose courage and virtue, although maybe hiding just beneath the surface, were there all along, plentiful and sincere.What is it about boxing that every good actor in his career has to make a movie as a boxer?Liev Schreiber: I don't know what the connection between actors and boxing is, but I suspect it has something to do with fear. But it wasn't the boxing that interested me about this story, it was the kind of rabbit hole of narcissism that the character goes down I found compelling.Do you think that has a connection with acting?Schreiber: (laughs) Absolutely!Do you think Chuck Wepner is Shakespearean?Schreiber: He's absolutely Shakespearean! But you're talking to a guy who thinks everyone is Shakespearean. That's why I'm asking! What's Shakespearean about him?Schreiber: The duality, the conflict, the human tragedy, also his vulnerability, his openness, his innocence, his naiveté, he doesn't hide his mistakes, he makes them beautifully out in the open, exquisitely clumsy. And that's Shakespearean. What is your experience with fame, and how to handle it?Schreiber: If we believe the central lie that is at the core of fame, which is that we are the most interesting person in the room, the room quickly becomes empty, and it's a very lonely existence. I think we all struggle with the desire to be appreciated and adored and loved by many. I think actors do it publicly, athletes do it publicly, whereas most of us do it in private and therefore are able to manage it. Whereas when you have real returns from this kind of a feeling, life gets dangerous. I think having children certainly helped, because you realize you must be able to pay attention to them. I mean to try to teach your kids to look at the world with as much wonder as it looks at you is important and hard and I think Chuck's life is a beautiful analogy of that story and he learned it so well. You see him now with his family and he's a remarkable husband, a great dad and a really, really beautiful guy. But I think it's because he went through that battle. I certainly think his battle with his own demons was much much worse than fifteen rounds with Mohammad Ali.What did you learn about boxing?Schreiber: I've been boxing around fifteen years, not seriously, just as a way to keep fit and it's a sport I enjoy. I was a competitive fencer and it felt a lot like fencing initially. I never really boxed with anyone trying to hurt me... I mean I've had my nose broken a couple of times but it's not as bad as people think it is. I think that's the fascination with boxing. It doesn't hurt to get punched in the face as much as you think it does. There are few nerves and it's all psychological. It's the terror of being punched in the face that's so crippling. It's not the pain. I think initially I was so terrified of being punched in the face that my feet were frozen. And it's when you actually get punched in the face that you go, ""oh, that's not so bad"" and you loosen up and you're able to see it. The instinct to move towards danger rather than away from it... is very strange. It's something Chuck possesses in great quantity, he always moves forward, moves forward. And this is a man who's been punched by the likes of Sonny Liston, George Foreman and Mohammad Ali. Arguably the most powerful punchers in the history of boxing and he moves forward, forward, forward and that says everything about the man on many levels.You were talking about redemption before, Chuck's redemption, so how much do you think that redemption has to do with the woman that he ends up with?Schreiber: So much of it has to do with it. I think his redemption is looking for himself and he finds himself in loving another person. And maybe the answer to the riddle of narcissism, you know, we often find out who we are through giving something, through being generous and taking the attention off of ourselves. And I think the redemptive thing for him was to be loved by a one person rather than millions. Working with Ms. Watts, what was that like?Schreiber: (giggles, yes a grown man giggle) We can't do it very often because we have kids together so if one person's working the other takes care of them. But this is not a character that's particularly close to Naomi, as a person she's kind of a demure English girl, so it was really fun to see her walk out of the wardrobe trailer with the red wig and the fake boobs and the leopard print tights... Not many people know how funny she is so I was really enjoying it. Was she worried that you were getting so much into these fights?Schreiber: No, she enjoyed it, she loves seeing me get punched in the face. We were talking before about the danger of fame. When did you have your ten minutes of madness?Schreiber: I'm having it right now. As we speak. I started in the theater, a microcosm of it, it was very good training for an actor, because it's a microcosm of fame. If you go through that you come out the other side and go, eh uh, I want something with more continuity, what am I doing and what am I doing it for? Am I learning anything, am I giving anything, and that helps because then you get to the film business and it gets crazy! And then you get to TV and it gets even crazier. Is it crazier on TV?Schreiber: Suddenly you are in everyone's living room and there is an intimacy that people feel with you that until you experience that, you really don't know what fame is. To have millions and millions of people think they know you, and feel intimate with you, it's a very strange feeling. Talk to you on the street, and call you ""Ray"". It's very complicated when someone comes up to you and does that, part of you feels genuine gratitude because they spent that much time with you and they consider what you did worthy of their attention, so there is a real feeling of gratitude, and at the same time, a human instinct to share in the intimacy, but you don't have the intimacy because you don't know them. But they, because they've watched the show, have a level of intimacy with you that you're not aware of. And it's a very strange relationship.Why did you want to become an actor in the first place?Schreiber: Probably some tragic level of narcissism that I've come to terms with, but certainly in the beginning I really liked having people's attention. I still do. Well, it's a really good feeling. What you do with it is important. Nothing really compares with live theater. You know you repeat a play eight times a week, it will drive you fucking mad. What changes every night, the one thing that makes it survivable is the audience. A new character comes in every night and does the play with you. And you feel their attention, if you're doing your job right, they're connected, they are energized and they're enjoying it. They are following you and they are leading you and they are nudging you, and you feel by their laughter, by their lack of laughter, by their reactions, you feel connected.And you've got a team, you share something and you're going to hunt together and you're not alone. Probably many actors started someplace feeling very alone, for one reason or another, and want to change that. I think Chuck's an example of that. He's not an actor but somebody who really felt he had to make his impression on the world so much so that he was going to withstand being punched by the greatest fighter of all times for fifteen rounds. And not go down, by sheer will, because he had to let people know that he was one of them. And that's such an alienating tough position and it's a testament to the success of the Rocky franchise, because we all feel that. It's ironic that we all feel alienated but that's what Stallone tapped into. The Bleeder screens next at the Toronto International Film Festival.

4,POLITICS,Unions Need To Make More Political Donations,"David Macaray, ContributorDavid Macaray is a playwright and author (""How to Win Friends ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/labor-day-blues_b_11861578.html,"If the National Rifle Association (NRA), with a membership of barely five million, can strike terror in the hearts of America's lawmakers, surely 14.8 million union workers have the ability to make some noise.",2016-09-04,"In this July 21, 2016 photo, striking union members rally outside the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, N.J. On Thursday Aug. 4, the strike by Local 54 of the Unite-HERE union will have lasted 35 days, making it the longest in the city's 38-year casino era. (AP Photo/Wayne Parry)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb829051f00000002253ac3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As my late friend, zoology professor Mark Rowland, liked to say when addressing the emotional issue of pro-life vs. pro-choice: ""Some people see the uterus as half-empty, and others see it as half-full."" That mordant, binary sentiment could apply to the current state of organized labor. According to some observers, the once vaunted American labor movement is either already dead or is in the process of dying a hideous death. Granted, these pessimistic observers consist largely of sheltered academics, Chamber of Commerce officers, and Michigan Republicans. But other, more optimistic observers happily note that, with 14.8 million people belonging to unions (11-percent of the workforce), the U.S. labor movement is still a vital--if unfocussed and demoralized--force to be reckoned with. Do the math. If the National Rifle Association (NRA), with a membership of barely five million, can strike terror in the hearts of America's lawmakers, surely 14.8 million union workers have the ability to make some noise. Union people will tell you that there are two legislative moves required to level the playing field. The first is passage of the EFCA (Employee Free Choice Act), which would make ""card check"" the law of the land, effectively eliminating the bureaucratic morass and stalling tactics regularly used by management. While hypocritical businessmen pretend that, like the powdered wig set of the 18th century, they abhor Big Government, when it comes to workers being allowed to freely join a union, they beg the feds to intervene, beg them to step in and make joining a union as complicated a procedure as becoming a U.S. citizen. And this isn't an ideological or constitutional issue for these profit-takers; it's an economic one. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2015), the average weekly wage for a union employee is $980, and the average weekly wage for a non-union worker is $776. Simple as that. The second thing is repeal of half the provisions in the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act (including prohibition of secondary boycotts and sympathy strikes). This anti-labor law, passed over the veto of President Truman, defanged the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (the Wagner Act), ushered in the toxic phenomenon of ""right to work"" states, and rendered organized labor more or less powerless by cutting its nuts off.Beginning in the late 1970s, in response to the implementation of UAW ""emergency concessions,"" and continuing into the early 1980s, when President Reagan declared ""open season"" on organized labor by firing more than 11,000 PATCO workers (air traffic controllers), union activists have been engaged in a lively debate over how best to spend AFL-CIO funds. One thing the House of Labor has plenty of is money.While some people want to see the lion's share of AFL-CIO discretionary spending used for national organizing drives, others want to see it spent on stuff like advertising, community awareness, ""education"" and political donations. Not that the Democrats have done organized labor any favors lately, but I've always favored the political donation route. Consider: If reactionary, draconian laws were what crippled us, then progressive, labor-friendly laws must be what makes us whole.An officer with an International that must remain nameless, once suggested a crazy idea. Given that the AFL-CIO spent an estimated $50 million trying (and failing) to organize Walmart, and given that lobbyists and donors are the mother's milk of politics, and given that money has already poisoned the well, the AFL-CIO should consider bribery.They should identify 50 congressmen who could a make difference in the outcome of critical labor votes and then have a bag man discreetly deliver each of them $200,000 in cash. Don't call it a ""bribe."" Call it a ""donation."" Donations of $200,000 to 40 key House members and 10 key senators would amount to $10 million, which the AFL-CIO could easily afford. It's clean, it's quick, and it beats the hell out of wasting money on futile Wal-Mart campaigns. In return, unfair labor laws are repealed and the American worker is given a fighting chance. Let's not get all self-righteous. After all, isn't this how the military-industrial complex functions? Hasn't the Saudi royal family, going all the way back to FDR, donated millions of dollars to the U.S. to gain preferential treatment? As Tom Hagen said to Santino Corleone, ""It's business, Sonny!"""

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit largely upheld that ruling last month. But on Thursday the full court split sharply on whether to rehear the case, with a majority declining to do so and six judges dissenting.“The will of Michigan’s people, expressed through their legislature, was to have the same system as the large majority of states, containing the large majority of voters, of all types of races and parties,” wrote one of the dissenting judges.In its emergency request to the Supreme Court on Friday, the state included this and other case history, insisting that requiring voters to vote for individual candidates ― rather than in one shot for a party’s entire ticket ― doesn’t harm Michigan voters and is in fact accepted across much of the country.“Michigan has joined 40 other states by requiring voters to actually vote for each candidate they intend to support — in other words, by eliminating straight-ticket voting,” read the state’s filing, which was addressed to Justice Elena Kagan. “This change is not a burden on voting — it is the very act of voting.”Lawyers for the state set a hard deadline of Sept. 8 for the court to act, pointing to ballot printing deadlines set by law and other logistics ahead of Election Day. Perhaps to account for that timeline, Kagan asked proponents of straight-ticket voting to respond to Michigan’s request by Sept. 7.In light of the Supreme Court’s makeup and the divisiveness of voting rights matters, it’s unlikely a majority of the justices will side with Michigan’s request. One voting rights expert, Richard Hasen, predicted the state’s chances weren’t that good.Friday’s filing is the latest in a string of actions the Supreme Court has been asked to take to put on hold lower court rulings that could impact the November elections. Its most prominent move so far, an order preventing North Carolina from enforcing its restrictive voting law, found the justices divided across ideological lines."

Tom Ridge (R), and real estate investor/reality show contestant/former NFL player Shawn Bullard. As the roundtable meeting wrapped up (and press was allowed back in), Bullard praised Trump. “I appreciate you coming here today,” said Bullard. “I have been a Trump supporter since I was in college back in 2001. I believe that you are the answer. I’m a full supporter. And also ... you have actually inspired me.”Daphne Goggins, the Republican leader of Philadelphia’s 16th Ward, told Trump, “What you’re saying about the Democratic plan ― that plantation that they want black people on ― it’s the truth. I will say it again.”The Huffington Post asked the Trump campaign about the implication of Goggins’ remark ― that at the meeting, he had characterized Democrats’ economic policy as “a plantation” ― but a campaign spokeswoman did not reply.Right after the roundtable discussion, Trump talked with Shalga Hightower, whose 20-year-old daughter Iofemi was killed in neighboring New Jersey in 2007 by gang members, some of whom were undocumented immigrants.In his comments, Trump returned to a familiar theme: all the violent crimes he claims are committed by undocumented immigrants. “These people coming in and they shouldn’t be here. And they’re killing not only children, they’re killing people that are in the military, retired military people. A 90-year-old man was killed. It’s a terrible situation,” he said.An estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants currently live in the United States. There is no evidence that they commit crimes at higher rates than American citizens.Together, the two Philadelphia events showcase the difficulty that Trump faces in seeking to appear concerned about problems of poverty and crime in communities of color, while also pushing his law-and-order platform, which has been accused of painting minorities as imminent threats to their neighbors.On Saturday, he is set to visit Detroit for a much-hyped visit to a black church. The candidate will sit down privately with Bishop Wayne Jackson and discuss issues of race, opportunity and education. Their talk will be aired later.But even before he goes, that trip too has highlighted Trump’s struggles with speaking to communities of color. Earlier this week, he canceled a planned speech at the black church in favor of the pre-taped interview with pre-approved questions.On Wednesday, Trump made a quick trip to Mexico to met with President Enrique Peña Nieto, an apparent attempt to mend some fences with Latino voters. Yet just hours later, the GOP nominee took the stage in Phoenix and delivered a dark and scathingly angry speech about the perils of both legal immigration and undocumented migration.The following day, nearly a half-dozen members of his newly formed National Hispanic Advisory Council resigned.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

What matters is that he built a ""huge"" audience in front of which he performed well.",2016-09-03,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., August 31, 2016. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb828b6250000cf003a1aa0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Late last year, as the primaries were just heating up, pundits and commentators were busy trying to make sense of the Donald Trump phenomenon. His stump speeches were more akin to the stream of consciousness rantings of an out-of-control id than what was expected from a serious presidential candidate. He frequently contradicted himself and, more often than not, told bold-faced lies. He insulted groups and individuals, making his party's leaders squirm. And yet his crowds were huge and passionate and his poll numbers were high and getting higher. The political class was baffled.One Sunday morning, the Washington Post and New York Times both ran what purported to be ""analysis"" pieces arguing that Trump might not be as right-wing as some feared. Their methodology was questionable, at best. Both authors argued that maybe the best way to discern the candidate's real policy positions would be to take his contradictory pronouncements on any number of issues and attempt to reconcile them. Both concluded that maybe the candidate was indulging in his own crude form of triangulation and that the real Donald Trump was neither a true conservative nor a liberal, but a moderate, at heart!The entire exercise was as amusing as it was wrong-headed. What they didn't understand then, and what apparently many pundits still don't get, is that policies, or even words themselves, don't matter to Donald Trump. It's the performance and the reaction it gets that counts. All the rest is misdirection designed to confound gullible analysts and garner more attention.This game of misdirection was on full display during the past few weeks leading up to Trump's big immigration performance on Wednesday. The speech had been scheduled and then cancelled a few weeks back--all of which made its delivery more anticipated. And so while Hillary Clinton was raising money, delivering serious policy addresses, and staving off more bad news related to her never-ending email saga and issues related to the Clinton Foundation, Trump was titillating the media with the possibility that his position on immigration might be evolving.Was he moderating his views to appease Republican office-holders who needed their standard-bearer to moderate his positions? Was he attempting to broaden his own appeal to win Hispanic and African American voters? Was he finally making the long-awaited shift to becoming ""a real presidential candidate?""While television pundits bloviated and the columnists filled pages of newsprint speculating about his intentions, Trump gleefully led them all on a wild goose chase. Even the candidate's supporters got caught up in the game. Some attempted to explain away a possible shift, arguing that ""he never really meant that stuff about mass deportations or the wall"". Others worried that any softening would cost him dearly since his base support came from hard core nativists who believed that the wall would be built, Mexico would pay for it, and all ""illegals"" would be deported. The day before his much hyped ""policy speech"" on immigration, Trump announced that he would fly to Mexico to meet with that country's president. All eyes were now just where he wanted them--on him. The media frenzy grew. It was ""all Trump, all the time"". One network even featured a countdown clock in the corner of the screen counting down the seconds to the ""big speech"". What was thought to be ""a bold and risky"" meeting in Mexico turned out to be a rather ho-hum affair. The wildly unpredictable controversial American candidate met with the wildly unpopular Mexican president and both said little that was of interest to anyone. It was left to the media to make the absence of fireworks into a big story. And then it was on to the speech.What I always find intriguing about Trump policy speeches is the delivery. Whenever he attempts a major policy address he has taken to reading his remarks, rather awkwardly, from a teleprompter. But Trump, being Trump, can't help but go off-script. He reads a line and then makes a comment--as if to agree with what he just read. The overall effect is a bit comical. The speech was reported by Trump opponents to be ""an exercise in hateful rhetoric"" filled with misstatements of fact and by supporters to be a ""restatement, with added details, of Trump's hardline position"" on immigration. In reality, it was both and more--it was a show, and, for Trump, that's what matters.Fact checkers had a field day pointing out that Trump misstated, exaggerated, or just plain made up statistics or claims contained in his remarks. To his already bigoted position on which immigrants would be allowed into America, Trump added new, deeply disturbing criteria--new immigrants must be shown to ""share our values and love our people"" and that they be selected on the basis of ""their likelihood of success in US society"".But the speech was also filled with Trumpian contradictions. At one point, the candidate reaffirmed that there would be no amnesty and that those here illegally would have to return to their countries, while in another place he suggested that those who are here illegally who have families and are working hard could stay--but then left that hanging without clarification. One network, falling for this misdirection, ran a lower third saying ""Trump softens, hardens, softens stand"".In the end, however, it's important not to be carried away with analyzing what he said or attempting to discern what he meant. It's a fool's errand trying to make sense out of nonsense. Because for Donald Trump, the policy formulations don't matter, neither do the misstatements, exaggerations or contradictions. What matters is that he built a ""huge"" audience in front of which he performed well. He appeared presidential in the afternoon and then reverted to hate-filled demagogue at night--and his folks loved the incitement and loved him. Like everything else he does, it was a show. All the rest was misdirection designed to confound and draw more attention--and he loved every minute of it. Follow @jjz1600 for more. "

LIVE on June 29, 2014 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/BET/Getty Images for BET)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bada5203c000066000b3f24.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yesterday morning I awakened and checked my Twitter feed. Immediately my eyes were drawn to the statement issued by Gabrielle Union on Nate Parker and his rape allegations. Reading through her op-ed, I found myself like, her, in a ""state of stomach churning confusion."" Like Gabrielle, I am a survivor of sexual violence. On two occasions, I was drunk and unable to give consent. Like Union and Parker's victim, the only witnesses were me and my assailant(s). As I write these words, I am mindful of the terrible position that Union has been placed in as a star of the forthcoming film, Birth of a Nation. As a fellow survivor, I respect the courage that it takes for any survivor to speak out against sexual assault. And while I agree with Union's stance that there needs to be more discussion on what exactly constitutes ""affirmative consent,"" I find myself troubled by her opinion piece and the way in which it is being used by rape apologists to deflect attention away from Nate Parker's actions 17 years ago and onto more neutral territory - society's pervasive problem with rape culture. When I see men and women who have been rabidly defending Parker based upon the fact of his acquittal avidly retweeting her statement, you know there is some form of misdirection occurring. Equally disturbing is how the media has taken one sentence from Union's article and used it to inaccurately frame the content and intent of her op-ed. Repeatedly, the lead in sentence on social media has been, ""As important and ground-breaking as this film is, I cannot take these allegations lightly."" This is clickbait at its finest - for it implies that Union has taken a stand on Nate Parker himself when in fact her article is really a stance on rape culture as a whole. Parker continues to enlist the protection of women to shield him from the social ramifications of his actions. By stating he is married - he implies he is not a rapist. By stating he is the father of daughters, he is stating he is not a rapist. By bringing his daughter to a press conference, he used her visage to buoy his family man image. By having a prominent Black actress who is a survivor of sexual violence write an op-ed that benefits him and the film, he is being protected from having to face the consequences of his actions that were a contributing factor in the death of a young woman.   ""Parker continues to enlist the protection of women to shield him from the social ramifications of his actions.""  As I read her article, Union managed to simultaneously indict society for its tolerance of rape culture while giving Parker a pass. She writes, ""On that night, 17-odd years ago, did Nate have his date's consent? It's very possible he thought he did. Yet by his own admission he did not have verbal affirmation; and even if she never said ""no,"" silence certainly does not equal ""yes."" Although it's often difficult to read and understand body language, the fact that some individuals interpret the absence of a ""no"" as a ""yes"" is problematic at least, criminal at worst."" She continues, ""Regardless of what I think may have happened that night 17 years ago, after reading all 700 pages of the trial transcript, I still don't actually know. Nor does anyone who was not in that room."" By retreating to the well-worn, ""well, we weren't there, so we don't know what really happened"" statement, Union utilized a common tactic used to perpetuate rape culture. However, she also acknowledges between the lines of her statement that in fact Parker did rape his victim because he did not have his victim's consent - since a woman or man incapacitated by alcohol or drugs cannot give consent. In her paragraph outlining the various types of survivors who remain silent about the crimes committed against us, Union essentially asks that we focus our attention on the victims of sexual assault - not the perpetrators. But true change can only occur when both are addressed. Parker has of yet to make any sort of definitive statement acknowledging that he raped his victim, outside of an EBONY interview that focused largely on his lack of knowledge of what consent meant while in college and his male privilege. Contrary to what Parker stated, sexual consent has been a topic on college campuses well before 1999. With expert subtlety, Union redirects the conversation away from Parker's actions by stating that we should instead use the film as an opportunity to discuss consent and challenge rape culture. Union states, ""I believe that the film is an opportunity to inform and educate so that these situations cease to occur on college campuses, in dorm rooms, in fraternities, in apartments or anywhere else young people get together to socialize."" I disagree. In fact, I would argue that every survivor that has had their voice silenced will see Parker's face up on that screen and be re-traumatized. In the gang rape scene, they will see their powerlessness and the complicity of a patriarchal society. His presence, on film and in person, is a reminder that sexual violence is less important than box office receipts. It is a reminder that if you have privilege - whether as an elite college wrestler or a Hollywood director and actor - that people will find a million ways to justify the right for a rapist to tell their story and live free from any sort of long-standing consequences. In this case, Nate Parker and Jean Celestin, his co-writer on the film, will never have to hear the dissenting voice of their accuser today. They are alive and legally - not morally - exonerated while their victim is dead.   ""If a rapist manages to skate a conviction based on a technicality, society will hold you accountable instead.""  One does not need to see the film in order to learn more about rape culture. One does not have to watch Birth of a Nation in order to learn more about affirmative consent. In fact, I would argue that by NOT watching the film, one is taking a more assertive stance against acts of ""non-affirmative consent."" We can do better. Union can do better. One can choose to hold Parker accountable (such as opting not to see the film) and challenge rape culture. They are not mutually exclusive. In fact, I argue that by doing both, society is sending an even larger message against the very system of male privilege, entitlement, and toxic masculinity that Union and Parker state we should be taking a stand against. By not seeing Birth of a Nation, the message will be sent that if a rapist manages to skate a conviction based on a technicality, that society will hold you accountable instead.Need help?

Then he went to Phoenix, and Mr. Hyde came back out.Trump gave what was billed as a major speech on immigration, which turned out to be exactly what he'd been saying all along on the subject. The big difference? It was in (gasp!) a numbered list read off a TelePrompTer. As for the policies, there wasn't much difference at all from what he's been saying throughout the campaign so far.Deportation force? Check! [Trump called it a ""deportation task force"" which was about the only real change.] Big, beautiful wall? Check! [It will now have magic tunnel sensors!] Mexico pays for the wall? Yep! [""They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it.""] Deportation for all? Oh, you bet! [Only change seems to be that some will have to wait a little longer to be deported.] Dreamer kids? Deport 'em all! Two million ""criminal aliens"" deported in the first hour he's in office? Count on it! Softening? Pivot? Nope! [Fooled ya again, suckers!]No word on whether Trump enjoyed a taco bowl at any point during his big Mexico/immigration day. The fallout from his hardliner speech in Phoenix was swift, as several of the ""Latino advisors"" Trump had recently met with quit the effort in disgust and publicly renounced their support for Trump's campaign. So, it looks like that whole minority outreach thing is going swimmingly, folks!Tomorrow, Trump is apparently planning the same sort of minority outreach to African-Americans. That should be interesting, to put it mildly.If it even happens, that is. The negotiations for this visit have been pretty convoluted, so far. Ben Carson was apparently the instigator of this trip, designed to introduce Donald Trump to some actual African-Americans in Detroit (where Carson grew up). Not a bad idea, on the face of it. But the Trump campaign is about as nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs about what could happen.At first, Trump was supposed to address the congregation at a Great Faith Ministries International service. This was then changed to just an interview with the pastor, held in private, to be broadcast publicly a week later. Just to be certain there wouldn't be any surprises, the Trump campaign demanded all questions be submitted in advance, in writing. Then Team Trump carefully wrote out answers for Trump to parrot back. No word on whether a TelePrompTer would be allowed, or if Trump would be allowed to just read from prepared notes. And the icing on the cake: Trump's campaign would be allowed to edit the interview after it happened, ""so that the final version reflected the campaign's wishes."" You can see what we mean about that cat nervously eying all the rocking chairs, right?The New York Times helpfully provided excerpts from the prepared answers Trump was supposed to read. Most of it is commonplace progressive-bashing Republican boilerplate, with faint overtones of racial condescension: ""If you want a better America, you must break from the historical hold that Democrats have had on people of color and move to options that allow you to achieve your potential."" The most amusing part of the script was the answer Trump's handlers prepared for the first question: ""Are you a Christian and do you believe the Bible is an inspired word of God?""As I went through my life, things got busy with business, but my family kept me grounded to the truth and the word of God. I treasure my relationship with my family, and through them, I have a strong faith enriched by an ever-wonderful God.Translation: ""My family's religious! Didn't you see my wonderful kids at the convention? All their religious faith has got to have rubbed off on me a little bit, right?"" You've got to love that last term: ""an ever-wonderful God,"" which was obviously included in a pathetic attempt to make all of this sound like something Trump would spontaneously say. Now that the prepared script has been leaked, it will be interesting to see how far Trump actually strays from the words he's been told to say, that's for sure.Trump's campaign did go into some frenetic damage control after the New York Times exposed all their careful preparation. They now say they will refrain from editing the interview themselves (awfully big of them, don't you think?). They also have promised that Trump will actually speak to more than just one person, and ""would indeed address the congregation for a few minutes and would spend a half-hour casually speaking with church members individually."" So it looks like there will still be plenty of room for a few monstrous gaffes after all....At the very least, though, Donald Trump is putting himself out there. Hillary Clinton seems to have largely disappeared in the meantime, which has coincided with a noticeable drop in the polls for her. She's still beating Trump, mind you, just by a thinner margin. But the trendline should be worrisome for Democrats. Hillary has slipped a point or two from the bounce she got after the Democratic National Convention, but is still in relatively healthy shape. Donald Trump hasn't really benefited much from this slip, as most of the restless voters have moved instead to third-party candidates. This is also a worrisome trend, since up until now the Libertarian and Green candidates seem to have drained votes from both major candidates in equal proportion. Hillary Clinton is doing a much better job than Trump of running ads and setting up her ground game, but it is time for her to stop appearing only in front of well-heeled donors and return to campaigning in earnest. Especially after the F.B.I. released another document dump on the subject of her email server today.In other amusing news from the Republican campaign trail (down-ballot), John McCain and Marco Rubio handily won their respective GOP primaries this Tuesday. McCain wasted no time in running very quickly away from Donald Trump afterwards, releasing a web video where he warns of the dangers of the upcoming Hillary Clinton presidency.It was revealed this week that Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, also running for re-election, would cut his own children off from receiving their inheritance if they committed more than one felony, or had (or sired) more than one child out of wedlock. Nothing like family values, eh? I mean, it's not like Republicans are usually big fans of providing incentives for family members to get abortions or anything, right?What else... Sarah Palin did a face-plant it on a rock-running trail, causing herself a head injury. From what she posted afterwards, it's really kind of hard to tell the difference between Palin ranting with a concussion and all of Palin's previous mangling of the English language. Oh, and Iowa Republicans running for Senate all seem to be using exactly the same kids in all their campaign ads. That should be interesting, when their television ads run right after each other!And finally, we conclude this introductory section with a plug for an election information site that caught our eye. It's called ""ProCon"" and it lists in detail all the candidates' positions on all kinds of specific issues. Complete with quotes and history, it is a valuable resource to compare all the presidential candidates (even some from primary season who didn't make the cut) on whatever issue matters most to you. So check it out!Three Democrats were mildly impressive this week: Debbie Wasserman Schultz won the primary for her House seat, Joe Biden compassionately dealt with a heckler at a campaign speech, and Hillary Clinton actually reacted quickly to a news story and introduced a new policy idea to combat rampant greed and price-gouging among drug companies with monopolies on common medications. That last one, in particular, is worth at least an Honorable Mention because it showed leadership and showed Team Clinton could react quicker than they usually do to a big news story. Is her plan workable? Hard to tell, but it's notable for being just about the only plan out there to directly attack companies who jack up the price of medication by hundreds of percent just because they can.But this week's Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week award goes to President Obama, for setting a record that will forever be part of his legacy. Last week, Obama commuted the sentences of 111 offenders, some of them serving life in prison for heinous crimes such as selling LSD at a Grateful Dead show. Obama is using the power of the pen to bring relief to people who were sentenced at the height of the ""mandatory minimum"" Drug War craze -- people who would get far less punishment for the same crimes today.Obama's total for August alone was 325 commutations -- the most of any U.S. president in a single month, ever. His overall record is equally impressive, now standing at 673 commutations, which is more than the previous 10 presidents combined.With Obama entering his final months in office, we can probably expect to see hundreds more federal prisoners obtain either commutations of their sentences or outright pardons. This is normal for the end of any president's term, in fact (although Obama's numbers are a lot higher).Now, even 673 commutations is nowhere near enough. Tens of thousands of people were sentenced under Draconian drug laws in the 1990s and 2000s who should also have a chance to be freed or fully pardoned. But Obama has made great strides towards dismantling the worst excesses of the era, as the Drug War slowly winds down after roughly a century of political exploitation.For doing what he can -- more than any previous president in a single month, in fact -- President Obama has certainly earned another Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week award.[Congratulate President Barack Obama via the White House contact page, to let him know you appreciate his efforts.]To use a baseball metaphor, Anthony Weiner just got his third strike and is now out -- of his marriage.Yes, our Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week this week is none other than ""Carlos Danger"" himself, Anthony ""Let Me Show You My"" Weiner.Weiner's first foray into getting publicly caught sexting pictures of his... um... last name, to women he was not actually married to, cost him his House seat. His second public humiliation for doing exactly the same stupid thing cost him any slim chance he might have had at becoming mayor of New York City.His third boneheaded sexting adventure is already proving to be the costliest one for Weiner yet, as it has already cost him his marriage (to Hillary Clinton's closest advisor), and put him under investigation from the local child welfare agency. This was because he actually (shudder) sent one of his sexts to yet another woman who was not actually his wife, which included his young son on the bed with him.That's really about all that needs to be said about that. Hopefully, three strikes means he will forever be out of the public eye, and we'll never have to give him another MDDOTW award ever again. Hopefully, at any rate.For being a serial peter-tweeter, Anthony Weiner is easily (we were going to say ""hands down"" but then we reconsidered that imagery) this week's Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week. Three strikes, you're out... as Carlos Danger rides sadly off into the sunset.[Anthony Weiner is actually a private citizen, and our blanket policy is not to provide contact information for such persons.]Volume 406 (9/2/16)Today's talking points have a theme. The theme is: ""When reaching out to minority voters, it's best if you don't then smack them in the face."" Three of these come straight from prominent Latinos who previously (right up until he gave his Phoenix speech) supported Donald Trump. The first two deal with Trump's much-ballyhooed African-American outreach. As always, enjoy and use these talking points responsibly (heh). Not funny at allIt is 2016, but apparently some people's sense of humor is stuck in about the 1950s, it seems.""I see the Trump campaign's outreach to minority voters is going about as well as anyone really should have expected. While much attention was paid to Trump's speech about immigration, Team Trump was also out there trying to woo the African-American vote. By tweeting a cartoon depicting Hillary Clinton in blackface. No really -- that's their idea of what constitutes acceptable humor in this day and age. And I guess that's their idea of how to reach out to minority voters, too. Seems more like a smack in the face than any definition of 'outreach' I've seen."" What is Trump scared of?This one is just too, too funny.""Donald Trump is heading to the wilderness known as 'Detroit,' but don't worry, he'll have Ben Carson there to explain stuff to him. Trump will also grant an interview to a second actual African-American, a pastor at a church there. But it seems Team Trump is absolutely terrified by the prospect. First they decided that Trump wouldn't actually be speaking to the congregation. Then they demanded that all the questions be submitted in advance. The original plan was also that 'aides would... edit the taped interview so that the final version reflected the campaign's wishes.' Even that wasn't enough cotton padding, they also decided to write out Trump's answers in advance, in the hopes that he wouldn't say something outrageous. When this all was exposed by the media, Trump's campaign quickly backtracked and said they wouldn't actually be editing the interview themselves, and that Trump will speak for 'at least 10 minutes' to the congregation. Gee, I wonder why they're worried? Donald Trump speaking in front of the biggest African-American audience he's ever faced, about his supposed deep religious feelings? What could possibly go wrong?"" Beautiful outreachTrump apparently has his own convenient place to shop for new wives. No surprise, really.""Donald Trump, among his other business enterprises, runs Trump Model Management, an agency for foreign models to work through in New York. But to listen to actual models who used to work for Trump's agency, the place was nothing more than a multi-layered scam. The biggest revelation was, according to more than one model, that Trump was 'bringing in all of these girls from all over the world and they're working illegally.' No work permits were ever even applied for, and the models were told precisely how to lie to immigration agents when entering the country. I guess it's not all that surprising that Trump would completely ignore immigration law to his own profit, since we're still waiting to find out exactly how his current wife entered the country. What she described, in fact, was precisely what a model in New York would have to do to fool the immigration folks by working here on a tourist visa, stating: 'Every few months you need to fly back to Europe and stamp your visa.' Trump promised there'd be a press conference to explain Melania's immigration history, but I'm not exactly holding my breath waiting for that to happen. If Trump were truly serious about cracking down on employers for immigration violations, he'd have to start with his own company, and what are the chances of that happening?"" A big fightThese next three are all from prominent Latinos who used to support Trump but now can't anymore (from two separate articles about Latinos fleeing the Trump campaign). The first is from ""leading Latino conservative"" and ""prominent surrogate for Trump"" Alfonso Aguilar, on hoping for a Trump pivot, and on why he can no longer support Trump:Last week, you could tell, there was the real possibility of a pivot. I think there was a big fight within the campaign, and I think the restrictionist forces won. No time for being scammedThe next two are from former members of Trump's ""National Hispanic Advisory Council"" who can no longer live with supporting Trump (there are others who have fled the council, it's worth mentioning, but due to space limitations we're only going to quote two of them). The first is from Ramiro Pena, a pastor at Waco's Christ the King Church.I am so sorry but I believe Mr. Trump lost the election tonight. The ""National Hispanic Advisory Council"" seems to be simply for optics and I do not have the time or energy for a scam. Coming soon -- Trump TV?Texas lawyer Jacob Monty was telling anyone who would listen what his reaction to the speech was, as he also exited Trump's Latino outreach council.The speech was just an utter disappointment. We were out there defending him. And then to be just lied to like that -- it doesn't feel good. It's not okay. Foul play?This last one comes from David Kochel, former campaign strategist for Jeb Bush, on the subject of who exactly Trump's speech was supposed to impress.It has to be [the Trump campaign's] calculation that they can drive up turnout in white working-class areas of battleground states to dizzying heights. Otherwise this move makes no sense 69 days from the election. The ""softening"" of Trump's immigration policy died tragically on Wednesday night in Phoenix. Foul play is suspected.Chris Weigant blogs at:Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"

We already compose a full circle of global citizenship and interdependent community, now it's time to bring the economy full circle too. As the second dirtiest industry in the world after oil, the fashion sector is the key to advancing sustainability globally. Fashion needs to take bold action to ""close the loop"" from ""cradle to grave"", from production in the labs and factory floors to the personal production on our selves in the way we wear, use and re-use our garments, in order to slow down the degradation of our environment. H&M has made unprecedented commitments to sustainability and to shape the future by relentlessly challenging the status quo of the present. ""Just as when my grandfather founded H&M in 1947, we are a company with a long-term view and strong values. Our sustainability commitment is deeply rooted in our culture. We are well aware of what a gift it is to grow up and live in a democratic state that respects the environment and human rights, and it is in this spirit that we also want to operate globally - today and tomorrow,"" Karl-Johan Persson, CEO Hennes & Mauritz.  Karl-Johan Persson, CEO of H&M greeting guests at the inaugural Global Change Award.The Persson family hails from Sweden where  less than 1 percent of waste ends up in the garbage. As the first EU green capital (Stockholm) and one of the most environmentally progressive nations in the world, sustainability is a core social and family value for Swedes and an inspiration for Swedish companies to maintain a harmony between man and land in the way they do business. In this spirit, Stefan Persson founded the H&M Foundation, a global, privately funded non-profit with a mission to marry passion and values, sustainability and innovation, with solutions to change our world. Sweden is the land of Alfred Nobel, and a quest for great ideas and empirical excellence remains interwoven in the social psyche. Like Mr. Nobel who believed that even if only one out of thousands of ideas is good then the time spent was worthy, Mr. Persson and his family have invested equally in the quest for great minds and new approaches. Last year, the H&M Foundation launched the Global Change Award, one of the world's biggest challenges for early stage innovation and the first such initiative in the fashion industry. Akin to the Nobel Prize for fashion, the award seeks to disrupt the industry by selecting the best early stage ideas and incubating them toward the goal of a circular fashion industry. ""Moving towards a circular fashion industry is of immense importance. Even though it's challenging, it also opens up great opportunities, and makes clear business sense,"" Karl-Johan Persson.  Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, who presented the awards, with CEO Karl-Johan Persson.The circular approach represents a shift from the linear ""take, make, waste"" production and consumption model to a model where products and valuable resources are being used in closed loops, according to the H&M Foundation. The Global Change Award seeks new concepts that can speed up the shift from a linear to a circular fashion industry, with the ultimate goal of protecting people, the planet and ameliorating our living conditions.Nominees for the award are selected, and narrowed down by an esteemed expert panel which includes supermodel and environmental activist Amber Valetta, Vikram Widge, Head of Climate and Carbon Finance at the World Bank Group, and more leading sustainable fashion experts.  Amber Valetta, super model and sustainability activist is part of the expert panelWinners receive a 1 million euro grant, distributed among them through a public online vote, and a yearlong accelerator program provided by KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Accenture. Winners walking down the historic stairs of Stockholm's famous Stadshuset, City Hall, where the Nobel Prize Gala is held. Last year, the selected awardees included innovators using citrus plants and green algae to make textiles, converting waste cotton into reusable materials, and using microbes to recycle polyester waste, all ground-breaking ideas that could change the industry for good. ""Sharing new ideas is key for the fashion industry to become circular. By selecting and promoting the projects of brilliant, creative and concerned people, the Global Change Award is making a significant contribution to accelerating this beneficial change."" Franca Sozzani, Editor-in-Chief Vogue Italia and GCA jury member.Fresh ideas are the foundation for change, but scaling and growing them is an enormous challenge in every sector. It takes a Goliath to help shine light on the strength of David. Fortunately, this is where only a company with the global reach of H&M and the heart and drive of the H&M Foundation comes in. ""We know for a fact that winning the Global Change Award opens a lot of heavy doors and it will give you a boost through funding, coaching, access and validation that you probably can't find elsewhere. If you want to reinvent one of the largest industries in the world, this is the place to go,"" Erik Bang, Project Manager for the Global Change Award. In today's era of modern communications, attention and audience building can be more valuable than investment and financing. All five of last year's winners credit the Global Change Award with giving them the public awareness, access and network that would have taken them a lifetime to achieve, if they were lucky. ""The grant of course was welcomed, but the attention we have received from this award has played a very important role. When you work in a lab, you can be doing great things that no one ever sees or cares about. Winning the Global Change Award puts our work on display and raises awareness,"" Michael Hummel, Aalto University Helsinki and 2015 GCA winner. Creativity, consideration and consumption need to learn to live in symbiosis. We need to leverage a mass movement toward quality not quantity, goodness and humanity not purposeless consumption and instant gratification. A new generation is demanding fashion to be an agent for change and H&M is hearing that siren call loud and clear. The Global Change Award is the platform for positive social change that will help build the groundwork for the heroes of tomorrow.
