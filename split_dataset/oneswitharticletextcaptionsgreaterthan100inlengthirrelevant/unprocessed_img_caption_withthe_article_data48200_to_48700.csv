And if it doesn’t, U.S. track star English Gardner proved you can still win Olympic gold.The 24-year-old sprinter told USA Track & Field that after Thursday night’s time trial for the relay, which advanced them into the final, she returned to the apartment she shared with her parents in Rio and never touched her spike bag. During warm-ups Friday night, she left her bag in a tent. About 10 minutes before the race was to start, she prepared to practice hand-offs with Allyson Felix. She went to her bag to get her shoes: “I opened my bag, and it looked like stuff had been moved around. And there was only one spike in it.”“I’m normally not a person to forget my shoes. That’s kind of like, you know, a soldier showing up to a war without his guns,” said Gardner, who ran the third leg of Team USA’s relay. Felix overheard Garnder and was able to save the day by lending her a spare set of her spikes ― which were custom-made for Felix’s narrow feet and roughly a half size larger than Gardner’s typical 7.5 shoe. “It was nothing an extra pair of socks couldn’t fix,” Gardner told USA Track & Field. Taking to the track in her borrowed spikes, Gardner ― along with Felix, Tianna Bartoletta and Tori Bowie ― blazed to a gold medal-winning finish of 41.01 seconds.Felix on Sunday told NBC that she always packs extra spikes. “I’m kind of the momma of the group now,” she said. It wasn’t the first time the veteran’s quick thinking helped Team USA. The Americans were almost shut out of gold medal contention Thursday when Felix and Gardner dropped the baton during the handoff in the qualifying round. Felix told Gardner to pick up the baton and keep running, even as the team finished in a dismal 15th place. But since the team completed the race, they were able to appeal their elimination on the grounds that a Brazilian runner in the next lane had bumped Felix, disrupting the handoff. Following Friday’s gold medal-winning race, Gardner thanked her teammate and tried to return the shoes, but Felix refused them. “You keep those,” Felix told Gardner, according to USA Track & Field. “You earned a gold medal in them.”"

A cause of death was not listed on the bureau’s website but, according to TMZ, Pearlman died from “an ongoing cardiac problem.” The celebrity news site states the official cause of death is listed as natural causes. TMZ notes the producer died Friday at a hospital in Miami, before he was scheduled to have surgery. He was reportedly transferred to the hospital from prison, where he was serving a 25-year sentence. Pearlman, who earned the nickname “Big Poppa,” was one of the most successful producers of the 1990s, known for creating bands such as The Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, LFO and O-Town. Pearlman managed the bands under his own record label, Trans Continental Records. In 1998, Pearlman’s business practices came into question when the Backstreet Boys filed a lawsuit against the producer over an unfair contract. People reports that, according to court documents, the band claims to have received just $300,000 while Pearlman somehow earned millions. *NSYNC filed their own lawsuit against Pearlman in 1999, after dealing with similar monetary issues, and in 2002, Aaron Carter also sued the producer. In 2006, it was discovered that Pearlman’s crooked money dealings went beyond his boyband empire. Investigators learned that Pearlman had been part of a massive Ponzi scheme and had swindled investors out of more than $300 million.In 2008, he was convicted of fraud, money laundering and conspiracy. He pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison. The judge told Pearlman he could reduce his sentence if he repaid the people he cheated, but he never paid, People reports. Pearlman was also plagued by allegations of molestation, after accusations were published in a 2007 Vanity Fair article titled “Mad About The Boys.”In 2014, Lance Bass told The Hollywood Reporter that he would “hear things” about Pearlman.“He would always have young boy limo drivers for Trans Continental Records; those limo drivers would always be put into different boy bands,” he said. “I’d hear rumors that he would molest the boys before they would even get into the groups. I don’t know how much of that is true, but to me, where there’s smoke, there’s fire.”Upon hearing the news of Pearlman’s death on the weekend, *NSYNC members Bass, Justin Timberlake and Chris Kirkpatrick paid their respects on Twitter. “He might not have been a stand up businessman, but I wouldn’t be doing what I love today wout his influence,” Bass wrote. This post has been updated to include information about Pearlman’s cause of death. "

It is quite simple: refuse to answer for whom they are going to pull the lever for president. That way, they believe, they will not alienate the Trumpistas, while also not attaching themselves to him.But, Meet the Press's Chuck Todd is not going to let them get away with it. He set his baseline standard in 2014 during the race for the Senate in Kentucky. In the debate between Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D-KY) and Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Grimes said her vote for president in 2012 was private and personal, and did not disclose for whom she voted.That was too much for Todd. It was fine, for example, for McConnell to have lied flat-out to more than a half-million Kentuckians about the fate of their healthcare if McConnell were elected, and did the bidding of his paymasters to take it away. McConnell had just claimed that the state exchange, KyNect, was ""only a website."" That was non-disqualifying.But, it was disqualifying to Todd for Grimes not to disclose for whom she had voted for president.Well, OK. Each of us has standards, this is Todd's. Indeed, when challenged on it, he doubled-down.  It was clearly his moral Rubicon, forcing him to shed his 'honest broker' role and to reveal his judgment.Now, two years later, Todd will have to apply this standard to nearly every Republican running for the House or Senate. Their strategy of refusing to disclose will run into Todd's buzzsaw. Nor will it be sufficient to state they are not voting for Trump. They will have to say for whom they are voting. Otherwise, Chuck Todd will state unequivocally that they are 'disqualified'. And, he will repeat it. He has no choice. It may or may not sway many elections. But, Meet the Press is the longest running Sunday gab show. Some swing voters may take some cues from his insistence that they are disqualified."
8,POLITICS,Jerry Falwell Jr. Seriously Compared Trump To Winston Churchill,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jerry-falwell-donald-trump-winston-churchill_us_57b8a976e4b0b51733a3cffe,The scramble to boost Trump's losing campaign is getting desperate.,2016-08-20,"Jerry Falwell Jr. introduces Donald Trump at a rally in January at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b8ab7d1800002100bcc091.jpeg?cache=2IJEB18DtW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Campaign leadership shakeup? Check.Sort-of apology? Check.Offensive outreach speech aimed at African-Americans and delivered to a white audience? Check.The struggling presidential campaign of Donald Trump has tried many things in recent days to revive the GOP nominee’s dimming chances against Hillary Clinton.Now, we can add a prominent surrogate’s comparison of Trump to legendary British prime minister Winston Churchill to the growing list of Hail Mary passes by the campaign and its allies.“We need a leader with qualities that resemble those of Winston Churchill, and I believe that leader is Donald Trump,” evangelical Christian leader Jerry Falwell Jr. wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post on Friday. “As Churchill did, Trump possesses the resolve to put his country first and to never give up in a world that is increasingly hostile to our values.”The analogy to Churchill comes not from anything Trump has done yet, but from the strength with which Falwell believes Trump will confront the global jihadist terror threat, just as Churchill stood up to the Nazis.Falwell, president of Liberty University, a conservative Christian institution in Virginia, was an early endorser of Trump. In the aftermath of the terror attack in San Bernardino, California, in December, Falwell said that if more people carried guns, “we could end those Muslims.” (Falwell later clarified that he meant Muslims who carry out acts of terror, rather than all Muslims.)In other ways, Falwell’s Washington Post op-ed reads more like a typical conservative indictment of Democratic foreign policy. Just as Trump is the “Churchillian leader we need,” in Falwell’s telling, President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Clinton are, conversely, the “Neville Chamberlains of our time” for brokering a deal with Iran to eliminate its nuclear weapons program. (Chamberlain was Churchill’s immediate predecessor, best known for trying to appease German dictator Adolf Hitler with the cession of a portion of Czechoslovakia.)Many conservatives have called the Obama administration’s Iran accord a foolhardy, Chamberlain-esque deal with the devil. The White House, nonproliferation experts and even many top Israeli security officials argue that while it is imperfect, it is the best shot at preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.But Falwell clings to the hardline conservative myth that Republican leaders in Congress could have done more to stop Obama’s foreign policy. “All of this was enabled by a feckless establishment Republican Congress,” he wrote.In fact, congressional Republicans are limited in their ability to obstruct Obama by the Constitution’s separation of powers. They are able to hold up legislation related to domestic policy proposed by the president, but as commander in chief, he can negotiate certain foreign agreements and prosecute counter-terrorism efforts as he sees fit.In his Friday op-ed, Falwell also urged conservatives to vote for Trump out of concern for the liberal Supreme Court justices Clinton would get to appoint.“If Clinton appoints the next few Supreme Court justices, not only will the Second Amendment right to bear arms be effectively lost, but also activist judges will rewrite our Constitution in ways that would make it unrecognizable to our founders,” he wrote.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
9,POLITICS,Why Progressives Are Cautiously Optimistic About Hillary Clinton,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-progressives-cautiously-optimistic-hillary-clinton_us_57b7951de4b0b51733a3a699,The Bernie Sanders wing insists the momentum is on its side -- and they will fight to keep it that way.,2016-08-20,Progressives wonder whether Hillary Clinton's embrace of independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' more populist policies will last once she takes office.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b7975e170000ae02c74572.jpeg?cache=JyNY2GGJQb&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Courting Republicans turned off by Donald Trump is an increasingly prominent part of Hillary Clinton’s general election strategy.That has some progressives nervous that Clinton will take them for granted once in office, making their policy priorities disposable as well.Many other veteran liberal insiders and activists, however, are unfazed by Clinton’s electoral strategy and bullish about her presidency. They believe that the candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) helped solidify a leftward shift in the party’s center of gravity that Clinton recognizes.And while these progressives claim to hold no illusions about Clinton’s personal views or ties to special interests, they have more confidence in their ability to exert pressure on Clinton and other party leaders than they had even four years ago.The argument for progressive skepticism was laid out by former Sanders supporters like economist Robert Reich and ex-NAACP head Benjamin Jealous in a recent New York Times story.In a race against Trump, Clinton’s ideology and agenda matter far less than her non-Trumpness ― or ability to meet a basic threshold of responsibility and sound temperament, according to the skeptics. Clinton, in turn, can make the case for her candidacy based less on progressive policies she would pass than a better-than-him personality argument, weakening her mandate to govern liberally, the Times’ interviewees fear.Other observers ask a separate, but related question: If Clinton is courting Mitt Romney voters, neoconservative thought leaders and Bernie Sanders supporters alike, whose core interests will she fight for once in office? She cannot please all of them at once, and with progressives lacking an alternative in the two-party system, she is more likely to view their priorities as expendable, the theory goes.Progressive optimists respond by noting that Clinton has not actually compromised her domestic policy platform to appeal to these “swing” voters. She still supports expanding Social Security, a public health insurance option, debt-free college and raising the federal minimum wage to at least $12. Most crucially of all, Clinton’s opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the massive trade accord negotiated by President Barack Obama, has only grown stronger over time. She now promises to oppose it before the election, after the election ― a tacit reference to the lame-duck session of Congress ― and as president.The Democratic nominee is not coy about mentioning these plans on the campaign trail. Clinton put them at the center of her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in July, as well as in a key economic policy address in Michigan last week.Progressives observers say Clinton’s shift reflects that of Democratic rank-and-file voters embracing populist economic policies. The electorate is younger, more diverse and decidedly more liberal.And if Clinton had not reconciled herself to that before, then she certainly has after Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, won over 43 percent of the popular vote in the Democratic presidential primary. The only Democrat to rival Sanders in popularity is Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), an irrepressible foe of Wall Street.“The Democratic Party is not the same party it was eight years ago, let alone 20 years ago when Clinton was in the White House with her husband,” said Richard Yeselson, a contributing editor at Dissent magazine and former strategic researcher for multiple labor unions. “It’s better than it was for the left right now. And she saw it, she is no idiot.”But to quote Elizabeth Warren, “personnel is policy.” And one of Clinton’s first hires, the appointment of former Interior Secretary and Democratic Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar, as her transition chair, has spooked these same progressives. Salazar, now a lobbyist at Wilmer Hale, a powerful Washington law firm, is a staunch advocate of fracking and the Trans-Pacific Partnership ― twin progressive bugaboos ― with big business ties to match.Progressives now fear Clinton is already repeating some of the Obama administration’s worst missteps. While liberals were basking in the historic glow of Obama’s presidency, Obama was appointing Department of Justice officials who would fail to indict any senior Wall Street executive for fraud in the wake of the financial crisis. He also allowed a top housing official left over from the Bush administration to hold up much-needed relief for distressed homeowners.Progressive optimists promise they have learned from their own mistakes during the early years of the Obama administration, when they believe they were too acquiescent to the Democratic president.“We recognize that that was some of our failure from 2008 and 2009,” said Shane Larson, legislative director of the Communications Workers of America, one of the few labor unions to back Sanders during the primary. “A lot of progressives sat back and waited for the manna to fall from heaven, not recognizing that the other side’s forces, the corporate side, are always mobilizing and have their tentacles everywhere.”Warren was also not yet a senator when Obama took office, depriving her of the platform in the media that she has used so effectively. One can easily imagine Warren, a higher-profile Sanders and allies like Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) taking their case to cable TV if a Clinton appointment is not to their liking. “Clinton does not want to see multiple Antonio Weiss-style fights,” a senior aide to a progressive House Democrat said, referring to an Obama nominee for a top Treasury post. Weiss withdrew himself from consideration after Warren launched a public campaign against him. As a banker, Weiss had worked at a firm that specialized in tax inversion, a technicality through which companies reincorporate overseas to avoid U.S. corporate taxes. (Obama has since named Weiss to a role that did not require Senate confirmation, where he supervises White House policy for the Puerto Rican debt crisis.)A key test for Clinton will be whether she re-nominates to the Supreme Court Merrick Garland, Obama’s centrist nominee who is stuck in limbo due to Republicans’ refusal to grant him nomination hearings.The aide to a progressive house Democrat said Clinton is “even cool on Senate Democrats’ push to get her to renominate Garland,” indicating she is acutely aware of progressive trepidation about Garland.The greatest hope of business-friendly Democratic groups may lie in Congress, where the party’s gains are likely to be limited enough to circumscribe the power of the Sanders-Warren wing. Even if Democrats retake the Senate, which looks eminently possible today, little of Clinton’s agenda will be achievable without control of the House, a prospect that remains all but impossible.Jim Kessler, senior vice president for policy at Third Way, one such business-friendly Democratic group, told HuffPost in an April interview that divided government will give new attention to the kinds of policies his organization prefers.“If we want things to get done, we will have to find ways to get progressive policy ideas through but understand we need to get votes from the center and from the right,” he said.Of course, foreign policy is a different story entirely. It is both an area where progressive suspicion of Clinton is greatest thanks to her support for the Iraq War and Libya intervention, and one where progressives have the least leverage. The president is, after all, the commander in chief and requires far less approval from Congress to make pivotal decisions in the international arena.“There is much less scrutiny on foreign policy appointments,” the senior House aide concluded. “The left is not well-organized on that issue, Bernie didn’t talk about it, there aren’t big left-flank pressure groups on foreign policy the way there are for domestic matters.” "
10,POLITICS,A Rock Star And Two Ex-Politicians Hope To Save America From Trump,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/three-questions-donald-trump_us_57b77fbce4b0b51733a39358,People just need to ask three simple questions -- and get their friends and neighbors to ask as well.,2016-08-20,Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic (right) wants Americans to stop being distracted by the horse race and the personalities.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b784bd170000d002d1ff0c.jpeg?ops=crop_7_93_3493_1514%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Could the answer to a presidential nominee who attacks Muslims, Latinos, judges, reporters, Gold Star families, fire marshals and even crying babies be a few questions?An unlikely trio made up of a former Republican congressman, a former Democratic congressman and the ex-bassist for Nirvana think that maybe the solution lies in getting regular Americans to ask three questions — and to insist on answers from the politicians.Donald Trump is a demagogue who won’t deliver on his promises, they say. Once Americans grasp that, the voters will start looking elsewhere.“I predict that this will burn out, the Trump strongman promise of a savior will fail, and adherents will come to the realization that he is a false savior,” said former Rep. Bob Inglis (R-S.C.), who lost his re-election bid in 2010 after he embraced the truth of climate change.“They’ll be looking for, I hope, a more serious conversation after that,” Inglis said.Hillary Clinton’s emails? They’re a sideshow. Trump’s bankruptcies? Immaterial. Democrat or Republican? Also, mostly irrelevant. Too much attention focuses on the presidential race as entertainment and sport.“It’s the horse-race politics, and it’s not the policy. It’s politics and personality,” said Krist Novoselic, the Nirvana and sometimes Foo Fighters bassist, who spends much of his time these days reading legal decisions and policy papers, as well as pushing his own voter system reforms.The three issues that Inglis, Novoselic and former Rep. Brian Baird (D-Wash.) think really matter are climate change, the federal debt and a dysfunctional political system corrupted by money.These are the three questions:“What specific actions will you take, and what will you ask the American people to do to reverse global climate change and ocean acidification?”“What specific actions will you take, and what will you ask the American people to do to fix the growing debt of the United States?”“What specific actions will you take during your campaign and your time in office, and what will you ask the American people to do to help restore the respect and confidence of the American people in their elected government?” There is no one correct answer to each question. The idea is to force politicians to provide thoughtful answers ― and to make them prove they’re not pandering by also laying out the sacrifices the voters will need to make.“No candidate should get away with these really facile platitudes of ‘Oh, I’ll fix it, believe me, I’ll fix it.’ Tell me how,” said Baird, who is the primary force behind the initiative.To finance it, Baird has tapped the few hundred thousand dollars he had left in his campaign coffers when he decided not to seek re-election in 2010. He started with a social media campaign in New Hampshire, a state that is politically savvy but that receives little attention after the presidential primaries move on.This year there’s also a bellwether Senate contest in New Hampshire, featuring Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. Baird’s social media effort is pushing voters to call on both candidates to answer the three questions.It’s not entirely clear how successful he has been, but The Huffington Post reached out to the candidates’ campaigns to see if the main points were at least on their radar. For the most part, they are in the Granite State.Hassan’s campaign pointed to positions she has on climate change, debt and reforming the political system. Similarly, Ayotte’s campaign pointed to her stances on the environment and debt, although it did not have much to say about government dysfunction and money in politics.Inglis suggested that embracing all three questions could be a way for Ayotte — or any other Republican — to inoculate herself against Trump’s downward pull on the polls.“This one, I hope, has the DNA of if you’re someone as good as Kelly Ayotte, you’re sort of welcoming the questions — yeah, let’s talk about that,” Inglis said. “The first two really set up the third. If you’re going to talk to people straight about the deficit, if you are going to talk to people straight about climate change, then you are restoring faith in the process.”And doing that tells voters you’re no Donald Trump ― even if, like Ayotte, you plan to vote for him.“We’re calling on candidates to be responsible,” Novoselic said, “and we’re calling on voters to hold the candidates responsible.”None of the three men see their project as a magical cure for political dysfunction, but they hope it’s something that will gain traction and recognition. Baird has even come up with a hand symbol for the three questions that looks a lot like an OK sign.“Gradually, the ship turns. Gradually, voters are going to say, ‘Wait a second, he may be entertaining, he may be funny, he may tap into my anger, but that’s not going to solve the problem,’” said Baird.“We have to do two things: tap into younger people who say, ‘That’s my future on the line,’ and [reach] adults, grownups, who say, ‘I don’t want to leave an overheating planet, I don’t want to leave a crushing debt, and I won’t vote for somebody who won’t say what they’re going to do about it. Period,’” Baird said.None of that is to suggest that prying people away from Trump will be easy because millions are drawn to him for misguided reasons, said Inglis.“Challenges are globalization, automation, the decline of the suburbs, and the basic cultural change — that’s what has people upset,” Inglis said. “And add the subtext of all that is the loss of the prerogative of defining normality. Particularly if you’re a white male, you’ve had the prerogative of defining normality.”He also admits that instead of letting go of the angry rhetoric, former Trump supporters might grow even angrier at losing the promise of salvation.“What happens once your savior is found out to be a false savior? Do you then look for an adult in the room? Or do you leave the room? Or do you burn down the room?” Inglis said. “And that’s an open question, really, about what happens once people are disappointed in this showman-strongman.”Novoselic hopes their project at least offers people a way to step back, reflect and maybe take a more constructive approach.“You do what you can do. You hug your wife. You can’t crusade — there’s enough of that, people just crusading,” Novoselic said. “You just do what you do and say, ‘Hey, everybody, here it is. There’s just three questions.’”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The person, who said he was an associate of Manafort and who gave his name only as David, referred queries to a lawyer in Washington, who did not immediately respond to a phone call and an email.In response to a report in the New York Times on Monday, Manafort denied any impropriety in a statement. “I have never received a single ‘off-the-books cash payment’ as falsely ‘reported’ by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia,” he said.The New York Times reported that he had received cash payments worth more than $12 million over five years that were itemized on secret ledgers belonging to Yanukovich’s Party of Regions.Manafort, who resigned as chairman of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign on Friday, had not been the focus of the probe, CNN said, citing the officials.The probe was looking at the work of other firms linked to the former Ukrainian government, including the Podesta Group, a lobbying and public relations company headed by Tony Podesta, whose brother John Podesta is chairman of the campaign to elect Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Manafort’s attorney Richard Hibey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The FBI declined to comment, CNN reported.The Podesta Group has hired an independent legal firm to investigate whether it had been misled by the Centre for a Modern Ukraine, a not-for-profit group linked to the ousted Ukrainian government, a spokeswoman for the group said in a statement.The Justice Department, asked to comment on the report, said it remained “committed to helping recover stolen assets on behalf of the people of Ukraine.”Investigators in Ukraine have said Yanukovych and his party engaged in widespread corruption.

Asked why he made up aspects of the story in the first place, Lochte suggested he had still been feeling the effects of alcohol from the night before.“I don’t know why,” Lochte said. “It was still hours after it happened and I was still intoxicated. I was still under that influence.”But, he added, “I’m not making me being intoxicated like an excuse ― I’m not doing that at all. It was my fault.”The remarks are Lochte’s frankest admission yet that he essentially fabricated a story about paying for vandalizing a gas station last weekend after first saying he was robbed at gunpoint. An apology posted to Twitter on Friday conceded that he was not as “candid” as he could have been about what occurred, but stopped short of a clearer adoption of responsibility.The incident has angered many Brazilians sensitive to their country’s reputation for crime and created an international embarrassment for the United States that could yet upend Lochte’s swimming career.Brazilian authorities recommended on Friday that Lochte and fellow swimmer James Feigen face charges of false reporting of a crime.The Olympic host country’s law enforcement claims that Lochte and three teammates vandalized a bathroom at a gas station and fought with a security guard. The players, including Lochte, have admitted that they paid security guards for the damage. The gas station owner told a Brazilian news outlet that at least one of the swimmers urinated on a wall. Swimmer Gunnar Bentz later said they all did. (Bentz released a lengthy statement claiming that Lochte had pulled a sign from a wall near the bathroom and yelled at the security guards once their guns were out.) Video from the gas station released by Brazilian authorities indeed appears to show the athletes exhibiting boorish, drunken behavior.Lochte’s original account of the incident cast him as something of a hero. The 32-year-old told NBC’s Billy Bush last Sunday that he and teammates Bentz, Feigen and Jack Conger were robbed at gunpoint early Sunday morning on their way to their Olympic village lodgings from a night out.Lochte even claimed to have confronted the gunman and refused to get down on the ground while the man held a gun to his head. This initial account claimed he was forced to hand over his money and wallet but not other valuables.The swimmer, beloved as a colorful runner-up to superstar Michael Phelps, then changed his story in a Wednesday interview with Lauer, clarifying, among other things, that the gun was not at his head but pointed in his general direction.Brazilian officials suspicious of Lochte’s account pulled Bentz and Conger from their return flight to the U.S. on Wednesday for questioning. A Brazilian judge also ordered police to seize Lochte and Feigen’s passports so they could be questioned, but Lochte had already returned to the U.S. on a commercial flight.Feigen has since agreed to give $11,000 to a Brazilian charity in order to retrieve his passport.Lochte apologized for his behavior in a statement posted to Twitter on Friday without explicitly admitting to fabricating the details of what occurred.“I want to apologize for my behavior last weekend ― for not being more careful and candid in how I described the events of that early morning and for my role in taking the focus away from the many athletes fulfilling their dreams of participating in the Olympics,” Lochte said.In the Saturday interview with Lauer, however, Lochte maintained that the gas station guards’ drawn guns made the event confusing and scary. He was not completely certain at the time, he claims, that the money they were being asked to hand over was for the damage they had caused through their drunken antics.“We just wanted to get out of there,” he said. “There was a gun pointed in our direction. We were all frightened.”This story has been updated to include comments Ryan Lochte made in an excerpt of his interview with Matt Lauer released later on Saturday evening."

Friday’s celebrity show of support for efforts to aid refugees around the world came ahead of next month’s U.N. summit there to address the dire global crisis. “I just hope that people will be reminded of our common humanity,” writer and keynote speaker Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie told The Huffington Post before the event, themed around the motto “One Humanity.”“I’ve generally been troubled by the ways in which refugees and immigrants are talked about as though they are not fully human.” “Game of Thrones” actress Natalie Dormer, “The Voice” winner Alisan Porter, former “Hamilton” actor Leslie Odom Jr. were among the artists onstage at the event, which fell on the anniversary of the 2003 bombing of the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, which killed 22 people. Each celebrity spoke with heartfelt messages for humanitarian support in between clips from a 2016 PBS Frontline documentary, “Children of Syria,” telling the story of the Kamil family’s life in Aleppo, Syria, and migration to Germany. Dormer specifically called on the international community to protect women and girls from sexual violence and “engage men and boys in the conversation,” echoing U.N. Women Goodwill Ambassador Emma Watson’s words as the British actress kicked off the feminist HeForShe campaign in 2014. “In most of the conflicts around the world, rape has become a weapon of war, with women directly targeted by fighting parties,” Dormer said.After performances that included the vocal stylings of an “Arab Idol” winner from Palestine, the audience of press, nongovernmental organization workers and members of the public heard from Hala Kamil, who spoke passionately against the violence in her home country. Soldiers took her husband in Aleppo and she’s not heard from him since.A message appeared on screens behind the stage: “tweet your leader” with a designated hashtag, #ShareHumanity. The New York City event comes three months after the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, Turkey, where 55 heads of state and government gathered along with representatives from 173 member nations. However, President Barack Obama did not attend, nor did Secretary of State John Kerry. Also absent were Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Canada’s Justin Trudeau, France’s Francois Hollande and Britain’s then-Prime Minister David Cameron. In fact, Germany’s Angela Merkel was the only leader from the largest global powers to attend the Istanbul summit. (Aid group Doctors Without Borders boycotted the summit, which it dismissed as a “fig leaf of good intentions.”) U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement that he considered the turnout from the world’s richest countries “disappointing.”Conflict in Syria alone has led 12 million people to flee, according to leader of the U.N., which stated in January that humanitarian efforts would require an additional $15 billion in funding. However, “Quantico” actress Yasmine Al Massri stressed before the New York City event the small actions ordinary people could take to help refugees abroad.“You don’t have to belong to an organization. Your government does not have to have a plan or a budget to help refugees. You and your neighbors can buy three suitcases, put some clothes [in] them, put some coats, put some baby things, and find somewhere to send them,” she told HuffPost. “Go online. Go on the United Nations website.”The U.N. will hold its summit to address issues related to refugees and migrants on September 19 in New York City."

My analysis of 6,019 executions (gathered in an original dataset based",2016-08-20,Comparison of numbers killed by ISIS executions and suicide bombings between June 2014 and October 2015 in Iraq.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b790951700002e00d1ff36.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Who is the Islamic State (ISIS) executing, and why? My analysis of 6,019 executions (gathered in an original dataset based on United Nations data) perpetrated by ISIS in Iraq indicates that the vast majority of these killings are done with a clear goal in mind: to consolidate rule in their “state.”ISIS mainly executes civilians that pose a threat to the group’s ability to monopolize the use of coercive force necessary to police territory under their control. Numerous factors contribute to the overall success of ISIS. However, in order to understand ISIS’s most threatening feature—the ability to control territory—it is vital to answer who they execute and why.Of course, suicide bombing is also an important tool for controlling territory. Suicide bombing is largely intended to force the Iraqi government to concentrate its military towards guarding Baghdad—where the vast majority of suicide bombings take place—and away from retaking ISIS-held territory. Considering the Iraqi government’s recent recapture of Fallujah, this tactic seems to be failing.Executions also account for a larger number of civilian deaths than suicide bombings—6019 to 1596 respectively in Iraq between June 2014 and October 2015. Further, executions include some of the most egregious crimes of the group, including beheadings, burning victims alive, and mass drowning. Gathering reliable data on civilians killed in war zones is notoriously difficult. However, five recent reports from the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) provides strong evidence on the who, what, where, when, and why of 6,019 executions perpetrated by ISIS in Iraq between June 2014 and October 2015. Of course, this is not every execution that was carried out by ISIS. But UNAMI makes clear that the data does represent a discernable pattern. One of the most astounding findings revealed by the data is that 58% of the “noncombatants” that ISIS executes are actually captured enemy combatants. This group includes Iraqi Security Forces, police, Kurdish Peshmerga, and Shia, Sunni, and Yezidi militia fighters. In fact, the U.N. even defines a small number of ISIS fighters executed for fleeing the battlefield as “noncombatants.” Defining captured fighters as “noncombatants” may raise some eyebrows among the general public. Most people likely picture women and children when hearing of civilian deaths in war zones, not Shia militiamen or insubordinate ISIS fighters. However, when captured, these fighters are technically considered “noncombatants” under relevant international law.When coding the data I distinguished between “captured combatants”, and “civilians” that never took part in hostilities. The dataset features 2,519 “civilians” executed between 2014 and 2015. Interestingly, the evidence reveals that four groups account for the vast majority of executed civilians.Yezidi civilians account for the majority of the killings at 1,209. Government employees, politicians, and other professionals make up the second largest group at 381. Third, 229 civilians were killed for familial ties to tribes fighting ISIS. And the fourth largest group—at 193—are suspected collaborators with ISIS’s enemies.How does executing these civilians help ISIS control territory?First, the UNAMI reports note that Yezidis are killed for their religious practices. Although Christians are legally allowed to live in ISIS territory—”as long as they pay a special tax”—the Yezidi faith is seen as incompatible with ISIS’s legal rules that govern their “state.”However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the mass killing of Yezidis is more strongly correlated with ISIS’s concern for security rather than than proper legal administration.For instance, my dataset shows that Yezidi militias have fought ISIS in many of the areas that these massacres take place. Further, Yezidi men make up 87% of these killings, and the UNAMI reports are unclear if these men are actually captured fighters. Finally, as the UNAMI reports note, ISIS has allowed Yezidis to live after converting to Islam. This calls into question whether those killed are associated with the Yezidi militia, or refused conversion. However, more research is needed to evaluate the accuracy of my analysis. The second most executed group—government employees, politicians, and other professionals—are likely killed to replace previous regimes and institutions for ISIS’s own. Interestingly, since it is clear that ISIS is not attempting to wipe out every one of these elites, those killed are likely done so when deemed threatening.The family members of tribes fighting ISIS—the third most executed group—have the weakest connection to actual military resistance against ISIS. Unfortunately, this tactic is all too common in warfare, so the logic is quite clear: to deter continued resistance by tribal fighters.The last group—suspected enemy collaborators—are executed to cut off the intelligence supply to ISIS’s many enemies.When compared to other insurgents, the patterns of ISIS’s executions are truly disturbing—but not for the reasons one might think. Many insurgent groups, such as the RUF in Sierra Leone, kill civilians with seemingly no goal in mind. In contrast, ISIS seems to only execute those with some connection to their enemies.In fact, 133 civilians even received a trial—though unfair by the U.N.’s standards—before being executed. This, on top of the evidence already presented, shows that ISIS is attempting to communicate to its public that “law-abiding” citizens will not be executed.According to one of the most authoritative studies on how insurgents control territory—Stathis N. Kalyvas’ The Logic of Violence in Civil War—when insurgents selectively kill associates of their enemies, the majority of the population believes they will not be killed if they abide by the rules of their occupier. However, when insurgents kill at random, everyone feels under threat.According to Kalyvas, when a population has nothing to lose they are likely to welcome any opportunity to resist. But when the majority understands they can survive by following the “law,” they submit to their occupiers.Explaining ISIS’s success in Iraq requires more than just a survey of the patterns of executions by the extremist group. However, the ability to monopolize the use of force in their “state”—to paraphrase the eminent sociologist Max Weber—goes a long way toward explaining why ISIS has been able to control territory. "
16,BLACK VOICES,Hurricane Katrina Survivors Relive Familiar Nightmare In Baton Rouge,David Lohr,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-katrina-baton-rouge_us_57b7a061e4b00d9c3a17dd39,The recent flooding in southern Louisiana has brought back horrific memories for some residents.,2016-08-20,"Linda Chase inside the Celtic Studios, which has been turned into a makeshift shelter amid massive floods in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b7a3fa1700002c00d1ff7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BATON ROUGE, La. — When cataclysmic flooding in New Orleans swallowed her home and stole her belongings, Hurricane Katrina survivor Linda Chase left the city she once loved and began life anew here. For more than a decade, she kept her painful memories buried. That pain, however, resurfaced last week when deadly, historic flooding began to engulf parishes throughout southern Louisiana.It was then, the 60-year-old said, that she found herself experiencing a dark, watery déjà vu.Her painful reliving of the tragic events began to unfold early last Friday, when she looked outside her home and saw water fast approaching her front door.“By the time I made it to my bedroom, the water was coming in,” Chase told The Huffington Post. “I started getting big towels, but it was no use. Before I knew it, the water was up to the electric sockets. I called 911, and nobody was answering.”Chase managed to get in touch with the mayor, who assured her help was coming. While she waited, she sat on her bed and tried to stay calm as rising waters lifted her bed off the floor.“I could see my walls were separating, and the floor planks were coming up,” Chase said. “I could feel them hitting my legs, and I saw my clothes floating in the water. I was getting hysterical [because] it reminded me of seeing the bodies floating in the water around us in New Orleans. ... I was thinking the house was coming down.In the 30 minutes it took the rescue party to arrive, the water had risen to Chase’s chest. Rescuers took her to a Baton Rouge shelter, where a cot, one among countless others assigned to other displaced citizens, is now her temporary home.“I broke down crying on Wednesday,” she said. “That’s when it hit me ... I’ve lost everything again. I had one picture of my mommy and daddy who are deceased. That was all I had of them – their photo in a frame, and it’s gone ... I had to work hard for everything [after Katrina]. I had to work hard to start all over again, and now it’s all gone again.”The devastating mid-August flooding continues to weave a path of destruction as it makes its way south toward the gulf, overflowing rivers and swallowing up homes.As of Friday, 13 people have died, and some 30,000 people have been rescued. Rainfall that choked rivers and streams was so heavy leading up to the flood that it could qualify “as a 1-in-1,000-year rainfall event,” according to Dr. Jeff Masters, director of meteorology for Weather Underground.While the widespread flooding was not caused by a hurricane, it still drenched more than 20 parishes in much the same way that Katrina demolished New Orleans, converting commercial and residential areas alike into great inland lakes.When Katrina struck New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2005, the storm surge toppled levees that protected the city, leaving 80 percent of it flooded. Floyd Norman stayed for the storm and was plucked off the roof of his flooded downtown home by a Coast Guard helicopter. He had no inclination to ride out another hurricane, and left New Orleans without looking back.“I lost everything, [and] I didn’t want to be back in New Orleans,” he said. But he found life repeating itself last Saturday, when flood waters engulfed his Baton Rouge home.“When the water started coming up, I said, ‘Really, again? No, not again. I don’t feel like going through all this over again,’” he said.The water was waist deep in Norman’s house when, for the second time in his 59 years, he found himself being rescued by emergency responders.“It was like a flashback,” he said. “I had just got everything back – everything I’d lost and wanted replaced – and I just lost everything again.”Another double-victim is Anthony Bazile, a 52-year-old retired merchant seaman who lost his mother to Hurricane Katrina. He survived that storm and fled to Houston, Texas. He remained there until recently, when he returned to Louisiana. When the floodwaters rose again last week, he was forced to flee his Baton Rouge home on foot in waist-deep waters.“One guy lost his life because he couldn’t swim,” said Bazile. “All my stuff washed away. I never thought it was going to be that bad.”With the waters came a sea of memories, Bazile said, of the death and destruction he saw during the five days he spent in New Orleans after Katrina made landfall.“I saw bodies floating in the streets when I walked from my house to the French Quarter,” he said. “One lady’s body was tied to a post so it wouldn’t float away. I still visualize that.”Bazile’s roommate, 55-year-old Jean Pace, is staying with him at a shelter in Baton Rouge. She has had three strokes since 2005 and, like Bazile, lost all of her possessions to Katrina. She said she is overwhelmed by the latest catastrophe.“This has brought back a lot of bad memories,” she said. “Even the smell of the water – it smells just like Katrina.”Doris Simon, 56, is another dual survivor. A mother of four who is still trying to determine the amount of damage to her flooded Baton Rouge home, Simon moved to the area after losing everything she owned to Katrina. Today, she finds herself homeless again, with all the possessions she had accumulated since the 2005 storm destroyed.“I’m a fighter and a survivor, but this time it’s taking a toll on me,” she said. “It’s beginning to be too much for me. … I’m really to the point where I just don’t want to do this no more. It’s almost like I wish I wasn’t here. It’s not about the furniture or nothing like that. It’s just psychological. I’m at the point where I don’t want to start over again. I worked hard to replace everything after Katrina, and now I have to do it all over again.”Calvin John, a 47-year-old resident of Denham Springs, said he too is a victim of a “double whammy,” having spent three days awaiting rescue during Katrina. Now a second-time victim of flooding, he is staying in a Baton Rouge shelter as he awaits FEMA assessments of the damage.“[This is] Katrina all over again,” John said. “Now I got to start at the bottom again. I think I got to get out of Louisiana, but I can’t. It’s home. It makes you think that though.”Like several other flood victims interviewed by HuffPost, John believes that despite the fact that the flood waters are continuing to cause widespread devastation, the people in Baton Rouge are already being forgotten.“This hasn’t received enough attention,” said John, who believes the flooding has been largely overshadowed in the press by the presidential election and Olympic Games. “People outside [the area] don’t know how bad it is. I blame that on media.”The media has been heavily criticized in recent days for not devoting enough coverage to the floods, which have left more than 110,000 homes damaged and nearly 100,000 people applying for federal disaster aid. According to The New Orleans Advocate, the first analysis of property loss totals more than $20 billion.While it’s still not clear how much monetary aid people in the area will receive, Jimmy Purvis, chairman of the Board of Directors of Parks and Recreation in Denham Springs, said little thanks is due to FEMA and the Red Cross, which has said it is undertaking the largest relief effort since Hurricane Sandy. Both organizations, Purvis said, were absent when Livingston Parish was in the direst straits.“For over a week we have taken care of people, and now all of a sudden – a week later – the Red Cross wants to ride in on white horses and save us from ourselves,” Purvis said. “My argument is we don’t need their help. And FEMA, they showed up today with boats to rescue people. Where the hell were they a week ago? Last Friday, when the water was coming up, Louisiana people were here. People around here that had boats – those boats became rescue vehicles. ... That’s what we do in south Louisiana.”“I understand rules. I understand security, but they’re saying to throw unopened water away because we don’t know who donated it ― and food, too,” Purvis said.President Barack Obama has also been criticized for not visiting the state or making a statement about the flooding.On the eve of Hurricane Katrina’s 11-year anniversary, as flood waters in most areas recede and the pungent aroma of raw sewage, mold and mildew takes hold, those who have survived this great tragedy are a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.“I love Louisiana,” Pace said. “It’s home. God’s going to work it out. Material things we lost, but we’re grateful we got our life and we can tell a story about it.”Bazile added, “We are going to have tragedies as long as the sky turns blue and the moon sets. It’s just the way of the world. It’s about picking yourself up. Life is important. I can get a lot of these things back again, but I can’t buy another life.”Check out ways to help those affected by the floods here. "

It’s hard to fully understand what they’re talking about. Taking care of yourself is all you’ve ever really known, after all. Sure, you have people that you care about and love and even worry about on a daily basis, but it’s not the same as having kids.Motherhood is so heavy.From the moment you find out you’re expecting, you literally begin to carry the weight of that child. They place that squirming, squished-up infant on your chest for the first time, and in that instant, your life is changed, forever. The feeling is permanently ingrained in my memory. The moment my firstborn entered this world, I felt the heaviness. The connection, the responsibility, and the weight was overwhelming. Despite all the books I had read, forums I had browsed, and blogs I had bookmarked, I felt utterly unequipped, unprepared and totally undeserving of the perfect little human placed in my hands.It’s like God literally takes a piece of your heart, gives it chubby hands and scrunchy lips, and places it outside your body, for you to care for. It’s extraordinarily wonderful and indescribably terrifying. No matter what situation is thrown your way from that moment on, you’re suddenly expected to know how to deal with it, as if birthing a child gives you magical insight into how to raise one. It’s a lot of responsibility, and it’s hard, so hard. SO hard. You love that little piece of your heart, so much, but you almost can’t bear the weight of knowing you can’t undo this, that it will never stop ― not on the weekends, not on vacation days, and not even on sick days. There are no breaks.You think back to the freedom of your child-free life and suddenly understand why people called it “freedom.”Once you become a mother, things that used to seem so easy become so much work, like trying to leave the house on time or running a few “quick” errands. Things that used to feel like basic everyday tasks now feel like luxuries, like having more than 5 minutes to make dinner, folding and putting away the laundry, or sleeping from night until morning. Things are different when the responsibility of another human being lies on your shoulders, when someone else’s needs come before your own, when the world you once knew suddenly ceases to exist, permanently.It’s almost like there’s a timer in your head, ticking, ticking, ticking. Every time you try to “get away” or “take a break” from mothering, it taunts you. You can’t escape it. You try to take a day to yourself, go away for a week, or even just a few hours, but the ticking never stops. You can’t even leave your child with a babysitter without hearing it. When the party starts going longer than expected, it gets louder. You watch the clock, wondering if your kids are still okay, if you can sneak out without being noticed, pushing yourself to stay cool for just 10 more minutes. Or 5 more minutes. Or, ok, now, you have to leave NOW. They probably need you, your kids need you. You can feel the weight, pulling you back, pulling you home to them. The longer you try to get away or ignore it, the louder it gets. You look at the people around you who don’t have kids, remembering what it felt like to be them, to have the freedom to stay late after the party or to make last-minute plans.The weight of being a mother is heavy, indeed. Somedays, it feels like it’s squashing you, requiring more strength and energy than you possess. The constant and unending responsibility seems like more than you can bear. It’s a lot to carry.But that’s the thing about lifting weights, it leads to change. The change doesn’t happen overnight, it’s not instantaneous. But slowly, over time, you begin to transform. Each day you get a little stronger, until one day, you wake up and realize you hardly feel the weight at all. The weight has become easier to carry. It becomes second nature, a part of who you are. You carry it with you without even noticing it’s there. You have transformed into a stronger, more capable, more selfless version of yourself without even noticing.Motherhood is so heavy, but you’re strong enough to carry it.――――-(See original article published here)Oh, what’s that, you say?

The Middle Eastern country of more than seven million people has never sent more than 10 athletes to compete at a Games, with only eight in Brazil.Abughaush produced a series of upsets to make the final, taking out twice world champion Lee Dae-hoon in the quarter-finals and then gold medal holder Joel Gonzalez in the last four.Victory drew wild celebrations from the Jordanian delegation at Carioca Arena 3, with Abughaush, who is studying business management, delaying his post-bout news conference to take a call from the Prince of Jordan."
