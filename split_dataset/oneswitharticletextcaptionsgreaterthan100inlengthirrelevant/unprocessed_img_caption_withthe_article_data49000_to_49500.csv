They returned to the Addison in Boca Raton, where they’d gotten married last year and, with the help of Daniel Events, transformed the hotel’s Solano Ballroom into a miniature Versailles, complete with vintage French furniture and, fittingly, lots of cake. The theme extended to their colorful wardrobe, too, which included sky-high, powdered wigs, as well as the spectacular performers who kept guests entertained throughout the night. “I’ve always been enthralled and captured by the opulence of that time period and by any type of European monarchy in general,” Walton, who is an actor, told The Huffington Post. When he suggested the theme to the Addison’s staff, “they said it was something they’d never done before, which, for me, meant it was perfect!” The couple’s celebratory mood, however, was shattered in the wake of the June 12 mass shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub which targeted the LGBT community. They opted to keep their party plans in place, however, dedicating the night to the 49 Pulse victims and asking guests to donate money for the families affected by the massacre through the Our Fund Foundation in Wilton Manors. In the end, over $4,000 was donated. “As a Floridian, this tragedy hit home,” Traverso, who is a marketing executive, said. “It made us realize how close to home this hit.

2,BUSINESS,City Planner's Scathing Resignation Letter Perfectly Nails Silicon Valley Housing Crisis,Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/palo-alto-housing-crisis-letter_us_57adc6c8e4b069e7e504ba24,"“A once thriving city will turn into a hollowed out museum,” attorney Kate Downing wrote.",2016-08-12,"In Palo Alto, California, housing is unaffordable for almost everyone who isn't a tech industry millionaire.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57adcd5d170000ae02c72c97.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This is how bad the housing crisis has gotten in Silicon Valley: A lawyer who lives in Palo Alto, California, and advises the city on housing can no longer afford to live there. Citing Palo Alto’s “astronomical” housing costs, attorney Kate Downing explained in a public letter this week why she’s resigning from her position on the city’s Planning and Transportation Commission. Downing, who works for a tech company, has been fighting for affordable housing as a founding member of the citizens group Palo Alto Forward. She says that she and her husband, a software engineer, rent a home with another couple for $6,200 a month but are now moving to Santa Cruz.“It’s clear that if professionals like me cannot raise a family here, then all of our teachers, first responders, and service workers are in dire straits,” Downing wrote in the letter, which was addressed to city council members and residents. “We already see openings at our police department that we can’t fill and numerous teacher contracts that we can’t renew because the cost of housing is astronomical not just in Palo Alto but many miles in each direction.” The Silicon Valley tech boom has brought jobs and economic success to the region, but the housing stock hasn’t kept pace with the influx of new workers. The scarcity of available homes is driving up prices and pushing out low- and middle-income residents, including public servants with jobs that are essential for cities to function. Less than 10 percent of Palo Alto’s city employees actually live there, according to Slate. To escape high rents, many workers live in more affordable communities and have long commutes. Palo Alto Fire Captain Sean MacDonald leaves his home in Sacramento at 4 a.m., driving 147 miles to get to work by 8 a.m. He told Peninsula Press that was just the price you pay to work and raise a family in the Bay Area. The median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Palo Alto was $4,500 last month, according to the real estate site Trulia. The median home price was $2.4 million. Palo Alto borders Stanford University and is home to plenty of residents who’ve made fortunes in the tech industry. Yet the city is making some strides to address the housing crisis, recently committing $14.5 million to preserve a mobile home park that owners wanted to close. Earlier this year, officials began looking into different ways to expand affordable housing.Still, Downing takes issue with the city’s overall approach:Council has ignored the majority of residents and has charted a course for the next 15 years of this city’s development which substantially continues the same job-housing imbalance this community has been suffering from for some time now: more offices, a nominal amount of housing which the Council is already laying the groundwork to tax out of existence, lip service to preserving retail that simply has no reason to keep serving the average Joe when the city is only affordable to Joe Millionaires.In her letter, Downing repeated her past suggestions to boost the housing supply, like enforcing minimum density requirements for developers, legalizing duplexes and easing some restrictions that limit where residences can be built. She envisions a bleak future for Palo Alto if sky-high housing costs continue:I struggle to think what Palo Alto will become and what it will represent when young families have no hope of ever putting down roots here, and meanwhile the community is engulfed with middle-aged jet-setting executives and investors who are hardly the sort to be personally volunteering for neighborhood block parties, earthquake preparedness responsibilities, or neighborhood watch. If things keep going as they are, yes, Palo Alto’s streets will look just as they did decades ago, but its inhabitants, spirit, and sense of community will be unrecognizable. A once thriving city will turn into a hollowed out museum. We should take care to remember that Palo Alto is famous the world over for its residents’ accomplishments, but none of those people would be able to live in Palo Alto were they starting out today.Read Downing’s entire resignation letter on NewCo Shift._____Kate Abbey-Lambertz covers sustainable cities, housing and inequality.

3,POLITICS,Why Trump’s Base Differs From The Typical Republican Crowd,Samantha Neal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-base-different-from-republicans_us_57ae4c2ee4b069e7e5057715,Donald Trump’s supporters are about as conventionally Republican as he is.,2016-08-12,A comprehensive Gallup report identifies the key qualities of those who support Donald Trump and finds they differ from those of other Republicans.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ae4e451700002600c72ed5.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A detailed analysis published Thursday by Gallup’s Jonathan Rothwell finds evidence that disputes the popular “theory of Trump”: the idea that the success of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is predicated on harnessing grievances of the white working class. According to Rothwell, this picture misses the mark. The Gallup study offers the most comprehensive statistical analysis of Donald Trump supporters to date, surveying more than 87,000 U.S. adults from July 8, 2015, through July 25, 2016, to identify the key qualities that characterize Trump’s backers.Two main takeaways emerge: First, the political profile of those who favor Trump is vastly different from that of the traditional Republican voter. Second, the study finds that the aforementioned “theory of Trump” is largely false. Rothwell’s statistical analysis points instead to different significant factors that unify Trump supporters: They tend to live in homogenized, racially isolated pockets of the United States and exhibit lower levels of education. The political profile of the Trump supporter differs from the average Republican ― Trump supporters are significantly further to the right on the ideological scale, the paper finds. They tend to be older, are more likely to be white (non-Hispanic) males, less likely to identify as LGBTQ, and far less likely to hold a bachelor’s degree or have any form of higher education.Compared to the average Republican, they are also more likely to be a veteran or family member of a veteran, more likely to work in a blue-collar occupation, and more likely to be Christian and report that religion is “important to them.” They are slightly less likely to be unemployed and more likely to be self-employed, more likely to be retired, have higher mortality rates for middle-aged whites (a measure for standard of living), and are significantly more likely than other Republicans to oppose trade and immigration.Notably, however, there was no statistically significant difference between the median household incomes for the zip codes that Trump supporters and non-supporters live in. This runs contrary to the theory that Trump appeals to the economic grievances of the white working class. The data suggests that those who view Trump favorably are not experiencing anomalous levels of economic distress along standard measures such as income and employment. Individuals who live in zip codes with disproportionately high shares of white residents, however, are far more likely than others to view Trump favorably. This correlation is further supported by a related finding: Those farther away from the Mexican border are more likely to view Trump favorably.This may not be altogether surprising in light of Trump’s penchant for espousing racially and culturally divisive rhetoric. It provides a powerful example of “contact” or “intergroup” theory, which holds that limited interactions with racial and ethnic outgroups may contribute to prejudicial stereotypes against them. Level of education also proves to be an extremely powerful indicator of support for the GOP nominee. A “one standard deviation increase” in the share of those above the age of 25 with a bachelor’s degree predicts “a 3 to 5 point decrease in support for Trump.”Trump supporters, in other words, are united not merely by working class grievances, but more powerfully by racial and cultural isolationism.“Trump is giving his supporters a misleading account of their ills,” Rothwell said. “He says they are suffering because of globalization … Because of immigration and a diversifying country, but I can’t find any evidence of that [being the case].” "
4,HEALTHY LIVING,Zika Could Be Spreading Beyond Miami's Defined Transmission Area,Erin Schumaker,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zika-could-be-spreading-beyond-miamis-defined-transmission-area_us_57ae29f0e4b007c36e4eccfe,Officials are looking into a new confirmed Zika case outside the Wynwood neighborhood.,2016-08-12,"Fran Middlebrooks uses a blower to spray pesticide to kill mosquitos Aug. 4, 2016 in Miami, as Miami Dade county fights to control the Zika virus outbreak.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ae2e66180000ad02bca84c.jpeg?cache=YSL3oZopep&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Florida Health Department confirmed three new local Zika cases in Miami-Dade county on Friday. One of those cases was located outside of the boundary thought to contain the only local Zika outbreak in the United States ― a less than one-square-mile area in the trendy Wynwood neighborhood of Miami.The health department’s website noted that the investigation into this third case is just beginning and that the department would work to eradicate and control mosquitos in the area of interest. It’s unclear whether this third patient lives and works outside of Wynwood, has never been to Wynwood, or if those things are still under investigation.It appears, however, that experts’ previous criticism of the CDC’s narrow Zika transmission travel warning was on target: “To assume that it’s just restricted to these few square blocks is presumptuous,” Dr. Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston told Reuters on August 1.Despite this new case, Florida Health Department officials reaffirmed the previously drawn Wynwood boundary, stating on their website: “The department still believes active transmissions are only taking place within the identified area that is less than one-square mile in Miami-Dade county.”The three new local cases were announced in conjunction with 10 additional travel-related cases of Zika virus in Florida, four in Orange, two in Miami-Dade, one in Leon, one in Palm Beach and one in Sarasota counties. At last count, Florida had 413 travel related infections, 28 local infections and 58 cases of Zika virus in pregnant women.The situation is especially concerning for pregnant women because the virus is linked to the severe birth defect microcephaly, which causes babies to have smaller than normal heads and can result in developmental disabilities, seizures, seizures, feeding problems, learning issues and vision loss. The virus is also linked to arthrogryposis, a birth defect that causes infants to be born with malformed joints that can’t extend properly.The Florida Health Department could not be immediately reached for comment."

Though the country’s economy is slowly recovering, officials maintain that the unemployment rate will likely stay in the 15 percent range until 2019. Tens of thousands of Spanish citizens are now heading to countries such as Britain, France, Germany, the United States and Ecuador looking for better work opportunities. In 2015 alone, close to 100,000 Spaniards left Spain, the highest figure since the crisis started in 2008. According to the National Statistics Institute, the number shows a 23 percent rise from the year before.The statistics released by the institute also show that there’s an increase in the number of Spaniards returning to the country after stints abroad; 52, 227 people returned to Spain in 2015, which is a 27.5 percent rise from 2014.HuffPost Spain spoke with five Spaniards who have struggled to find stable jobs over the past few years and who have been forced to tread the tricky and often painful road of emigration.Ivan Escalante, 30. Works in Slovakia. Ivan Escalante, who is from the northwestern city of Valladolid, published a blog post on HuffPost Spain in March 2013 titled “Me Against Six Million Unemployed,” in which he shared the details of his frustrating job search. He had studied engineering, learnt two languages and completed a few internships ― but his efforts didn’t land him a job. “Some day it will all come in handy,” he had said hopefully. He mentioned that many of his friends had found work abroad. “I would prefer not knowing which continent I will be living in a month or a week from today, and that a year from now, my life may have completely changed,” he wrote in 2013.Three years later, Escalante has not changed continents, but he has changed countries. After a series of temporary contracts, he recently landed a full-time position in his field in Kosice, the second most prominent city in Slovakia.He doesn’t see himself returning to Spain except in the event of “a miracle.” Still, he misses “those little things that you only value when you don’t have them,” he says, such as the conversations he would have with his family after dinner. “I would like for Spain to be a country in which it would be possible to carve out a future, make plans. ... In short, a place where you could live and not just survive. And I don’t see that happening in the short term,” he says. For him, the main difference between the labor markets in both countries is that in Slovakia, “it’s normal to have an indefinite contract,” he says. “My colleagues can make long-term plans, buy a house, have children. ...In Spain, that’s impossible.”Irene Ruperez, 28. Job-searching in Spain.In October 2012, Irene Ruperez bought a ticket to Berlin. She had graduated with an undergraduate degree in labor relations and journalism and a Master’s in sports journalism and communication, but was finding it really difficult to secure a job in her home country.“I’m kind of running away from the Spanish reality, from the government, and from the disastrous situation that Spain is going through,” she told HuffPost Spain in 2012. Her adventure in Germany, which she describes as “marvelous,” lasted seven short months. But “even though the country is a disaster,” Ruperez says, she felt that it was “impossible” not to miss Spain. In Berlin, she took German language classes, and made some money babysitting for Spanish families. “I also had an interview with eDarling, the dating website, for a position on their office communications team,” she tells HuffPost Spain.  But Ruperez ended up moving back home for a journalism job in Madrid. After three years with the Asturias TV channel, she briefly joined public television station Telemadrid, but she lost that job. Despite being unemployed once again, she says she would not resort to emigrating for a second time.“To people who are thinking about leaving, I would say that it’s not marvelous, that you don’t arrive and live in an apartment like the one in [the TV show] ‘Friends,’ go out every day and pick up the language right away,” she says. “To go is to have a difficult time, miss your family, your friends, your way of life. It’s a battle to find a house, do hundreds of interviews just to be able to have a room to sleep in.”Guiomar Duarte, 32. Works in Paris.In a viral blog post published in 2012, titled “’My Daughter Emigrated Yesterday,” Carlos M. Duarte explained that his daughter, Guiomar, had “emigrated in search of a future that she hasn’t been able to find in her country, and that society, or her parents, have not known how to give her.” He expressed that it was “extraordinarily frustrating for a father to see his children leave,” but that it was also difficult to support them.Guiomar Duarte, who studied advertising and public relations, currently works in Paris, where she organizes scientific events and manages web content for the French National Center for Scientific Research.She says that she originally left Spain for Australia, with a vision to escape the crisis. “I went there because I knew that it would have more, and better, job opportunities. And after a few months, I found work in my area,” she explains.In 2014, she returned to Spain where, thanks to her experience abroad, she found a job within a few months. A romantic relationship eventually led her to France, and she says that’s where she wants to be for the time being. “At some point, I would like to return to Spain, but not yet. My impression is that there is starting to be more work and that things are a little better than they were when I left in 2012,” she notes.Blanca Espigares, 39. Preparing to emigrate from Spain. Despite declaring in a 2012 blog post that she was ready to emigrate, architecture researcher Blanca Espigares has been living in Spain for the past few years, and like many others, has been struggling to find work. “I have tried to survive with shit contracts, few jobs and projects that end up falling through ... until I realized that I’m being foolish,” Espigares tells HuffPost Spain. She’s been actively looking for job opportunities abroad over the past couple of months, and she expects to take a teaching or research job in the fall.  “I’m leaving because of my dignity. When another university contacts you, you can tell that they look at your resume with different eyes. Suddenly you feel that you have value,” Espigares says. “There is a radical difference between the way you are treated abroad and the way you’re treated here.”To her, emigration does not feel that tragic. “I’m living through a lot of drama here, trying to pay rent, asking my parents for 200 euros at the end of each month just to be able to buy food,” she says.Alberto Perez, 56. Unemployed and living in Spain.Alberto Perez (who didn’t want his identity to be known and whose name has been changed upon his request), left for London with his wife a few years ago after feeling that he did not have a “present or a future” in Spain.In the British capital, he worked for a cleaning company as a deliveryman and as a programmer. But when he lost his job, he could not afford to pay rent and stay in London.Right now, he feels that returning to Spain was a mistake; in one week, he receives as many calls from employers in the U.K. as he has over the past seven months in Spain, he says.Perez believes that while emigration should be made a “mandatory” experience, it wasn’t easy. His biggest problem, he says, was with the language: “I’m too hopeless or too old to learn English fluently.”This post originally appeared on HuffPost Spain, and has been translated into English. "

The two-minute long video features Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut as the Hindu goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, with narration by Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan.The video targets Hindu audiences, who make up roughly 80 percent of the Indian population, warning them to maintain cleanliness or risk the goddess abandoning them.“They say that the goddess of wealth and prosperity, Lakshmi, resides where there is cleanliness. But strangely, we litter at the same time we worship Lakshmi,” the video narrates. “So before you think of littering next time, remember that the goddess might walk away from you.”Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his reaction to the video on Thursday, encouraging his followers to share their own efforts to make the country a cleaner place:Modi launched the green initiative, called “Swachh Bharat Abhiyan” or the Clean India Mission, on October 2, 2014 ― the 145th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The mission aims to dramatically improve sanitation and public hygiene by the same date in 2019, which will be the 150th anniversary of Gandhi’s birth.Sanitation and cleanliness are huge issues in India, where some 130 million households don't have toilets and hundreds of thousands die yearly from diseases related to poor hygiene. To address the issue, the government has set aside roughly $1.35 billion to go toward the clean initiative, some of which will be spent building toilets throughout the country, according to Sputnik News.“We learn in our childhood that ‘cleanliness is next to Godliness’ but we forget this while growing up,” says Bachchan, addressing the audience directly at the end of the video. “I, Amitabh Bachchan, request you to please keep your surroundings and your house clean. The ‘Clean India’ drive is not just the Prime Minister’s responsibility; it should be everyone’s.”"

Users chat via instant messenger with an automated bot that poses a series of personal questions. After sharing what led to their eviction, their specific health issues, or any other concerns, the bot crafts an individualized legal document to help resolve the user’s issue. That might be an application letter to file for government housing, for example. Browder, 19, initially launched the site last year to provide legal support for people who wanted to contest parking violations, according to the Guardian. Through the site, users successfully overturned 160,000 parking tickets in London and New York.On Wednesday, the “World’s First Robot Lawyer” expanded its legal services to people facing homelessness in the U.K. “So many people are being exploited, both by lawyers and by morally dubious landlords,” Browder told Mashable. “At the moment, there is no alternative for some people, if they can’t afford to pay a lawyer hundreds of dollars. My ultimate aim is to level the playing field.” Evictions reached a record high in England and Wales last year, the Guardian reported. After receiving a multitude of queries from people facing evictions and repossessions, Browder decided to get help from volunteer lawyers to enable the bot to support homeless people, according to The Post. In the U.K., newly evicted people are eligible for government housing. But the housing application system can be daunting without access to a lawyer or in-depth knowledge of the legal system.Just days old, the website is already being used by people facing housing issues in the U.K., The Guardian reported. Now Browder’s goal is to bring the service to the U.S., according to Mashable, but that may prove complicated as U.S. housing laws vary from city to city.“The issue of homelessness is universal, but the reasons behind it are different depending on where you are,” Browder told The Guardian. “I don’t think I could just replicate this in San Francisco, for example. I’d have to work on something different.”In the meantime, Browder is working on a bot to provide free legal aid to Syrians seeking asylum, according to Mashable. He aims to launch in September. "

These diseases affect your muscles’ ability to react,” he said.In a statement in Dutch, Belgian Olympic officials didn’t mention the water, only saying Van Acker sickened several weeks ago, that her performance was compromised and she was undergoing an intense 36-hour treatment program.World Sailing spokesman Darryl Seibel said that his organization reviews water quality tests from the Rio de Janeiro state government daily. A race or training session has never had to be canceled because water pathogen levels were above the World Health Organisation standard for primary contact, he added.The Rio de Janeiro Olympic Organising did not respond to requests for comment.Many sailors have said they have suffered no ill-effects and downplay any risks, suggesting that the water concerns are overshadowing some of the most exciting and challenging sailing of their lives.However, Van Bladel is not convinced, saying that the impact of Acker’s illness showed on Wednesday when Laser Radial sailors left the light-wind courses of Guanabara Bay for the large waves and heavy winds of the Copacabana ocean course outside the Bay.“The courses yesterday were physically difficult, and her weakened condition showed,” he said, although he added it is impossible to tell for sure if the water caused Van Acker’s illness.“I can’t make that claim, he said. “But the organizers chose this place when they had cleaner venues. Now we just have to deal with it.” .Laser sailors interviewed after Wednesday’s races, which lasted about an hour each, said they were “grueling.”After two second-place finishes in the first four races, Van Acker was fifth overall on Tuesday. She only finished 16th and 15th on Wednesday, dropping to 10th.The top 10 in each class after 10 preliminary races qualify for a medal race. Sailors receive points equal to their finish with the lowest score wining. In the medal round points are doubled.

TBS announced Thursday that the late-night talk show host will executive produce a new show called “Drop the Mic,” according to Variety.The new series is based on a recurring bit from Corden’s “The Late Late Show,” but Corden himself will not appear on the show. The new format for “Drop the Mic” will pit four celebrities against each other for a rap battle. The audience will be able to choose the winner. “‘Drop the Mic’ is such an exciting show, and we can’t wait to begin making it,” “Late Late Show” producer Ben Winston said in a statement. “Every time we have done this segment on ‘The Late Late Show,’ it has become a massive viral moment. Now with TBS as our perfect partner, we hope to create some really memorable television.” Corden’s “Drop the Mic” bit with Cara Delevingne and Dave Franco recently went viral, and celebs like Kevin Hart and Rebel Wilson have also participated in the bit. We can’t help but wonder if it will still be as funny without Corden’s quick wit and charm. But ― as “Lip Sync Battle” has proven ― people are always ready to see their favorite celebs do something a little out of the box. The 16-episode series will air sometime next year. Look out for Corden’s other “Late Late Show” spinoff of “Carpool Karaoke,” which will air on Apple Music. "

12,POLITICS,"Blame Austerity, Not Obama, For Slow Economic Recovery",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/austerity-obama-economic-recovery_us_57ab9a5be4b0ba7ed23eece4,"GOP-led spending cuts have led to ""the most discouraging recovery on record,"" an Economic Policy Institute study says.",2016-08-11,"President Barack Obama discusses economic progress during a speech in Elkhart, Indiana on June 1, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ab9cc01700002600c72704.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Barack Obama often boasts about the economic recovery that has taken place under his watch.Who wouldn’t? The turnaround since Obama took office in 2009 has been stunning.But the president’s rosy tale of triumph has always posed a problem for economic progressives concerned about the slow, weak and narrow nature of the recovery from the Great Recession.How can one acknowledge that the seven-year recovery has been inadequate without giving aid and comfort to conservative partisans hell-bent on denying Obama and his stimulus policies credit for very real progress?A new study by the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, tries to thread this needle with an analysis that argues Republican-driven austerity, rather than any Obama administration policy, is to blame for the incomplete economic turnaround. The bursting of the housing bubble, the financial crisis of 2008 and the ensuing recession destroyed trillions of dollars in wealth, decimating demand for goods and services. The damage was not entirely without precedent, however. The deep recession in the early 1980s had, by some measures, a similar impact, according to EPI.In the final quarter of 1982, the low point of that recession, the economy was operating at 7.6 percent below its potential capacity. In the second quarter of 2009, the trough of the most recent recession, the economy was running at 7.1 percent below its potential capacity. Yet the economy recovered much more rapidly and completely in the early 1980s than in the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009, EPI notes. Measured in terms of payroll growth, it took 51 months for the economy to reach its pre-recession employment peak after the Great Recession, compared with 11 months in the early 1980s. Other figures, not cited in the paper, also point to a disappointing economic recovery. The unemployment rate is close to 10 percent if you count people working part time who want to be working full time, people who have stopped looking for a job, and otherwise discouraged workers.Meanwhile, the typical American household has not seen its income rise since the beginning of the Great Recession.The key difference is in how the government responded to the Great Recession, compared with previous busts, EPI argues.When the federal government wants to counteract a sharp pullback in consumer demand, it uses either monetary policy or fiscal policy. To enact monetary stimulus, the Federal Reserve lowers the target federal funds rate ― the interest rate at which banks lend to one another overnight ― reducing borrowing costs throughout the economy.Boosting economic growth through fiscal policy entails either cutting taxes or increasing public spending. In the early 1980s, the economic circumstances allowed monetary policy to play a bigger role than it could in recent years, EPI argues. Since interest rates were already low in the wake of the Great Recession and inflation was nonexistent, the government needed to rely much more heavily on fiscal stimulus to fill the gap in demand, according to EPI.Obama, understanding this, advocated for the massive stimulus package, some two-thirds of which was on public spending for items like rebuilding train and road infrastructure.But state and local lawmakers ― mostly Republicans ― cut back on spending so severely that total government spending per person ― at the federal, state and local levels ― is lower now than it was at the worst point of the Great Recession, according to EPI.Some of the fiscal austerity at the state and local levels during and after the Great Recession was the result of conservative ideology run amok, such as 19 states refusing federal aid to expand Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act.Much of it, though, was due to the financial realities of those lower levels of government. Unlike the federal government, state and local governments must balance their budgets and cannot borrow at low interest rates with the same ease. The federal government, which continues to enjoy rock-bottom interest rates on its debt, could have more than offset that, however.It chose not to do so after Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 2010. From 2011 onward, congressional Republicans leveraged key deadlines ― from the expiration of the debt ceiling to the funding of the government ― to extract greater and greater spending cuts from the Obama administration, including the automatic, across-the-board cuts of sequestration. EPI concludes it is almost entirely congressional Republicans, not Obama, who should be faulted for the weak economic recovery.“Both in word and deed, Republican lawmakers have embraced and enforced fiscal austerity, and the result has been the most discouraging recovery on record,” writes Josh Bivens, EPI’s research director.Former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, a Republican appointee, in April accused congressional Republicans of stalling economic growth through their insistence on drastic spending cuts.Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank with close ties to EPI, agreed with the thrust of EPI’s analysis.But Baker said the paper somewhat understates the degree of the economic havoc wrought by the Great Recession. It would have benefitted, he suggested, from noting Obama’s middle-class tax cuts as well, including a payroll tax cut extended in 2011 after Republicans retook the House. Doing that would highlight that even with the additional stimulus, the economy has not recovered as heartily as in past cycles. Baker also noted that while Obama may not be responsible for enacting fiscal austerity once Republicans took control of the House, he is to blame for pivoting to deficit reduction in 2010, while he still controlled Congress.Obama convened the Bowles-Simpson fiscal commission in 2010 to recommend major deficit-reduction measures. Had key Republicans like then-House Budget Chair Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) not withheld their support for the commission’s proposals, Baker maintained, Congress might have adopted the commission’s report and enacted deeper austerity earlier.And regardless of the president’s actions, Baker said he wishes Obama had at least used his bully pulpit to push back against the conventional wisdom that budget deficits are always bad. “I know the president can’t wave his wand and make Congress follow, but someone could have explained why we needed to spend more to boost the economy,” Baker said. “You have to explain this again and again and again.”EPI’s Bivens makes a similar point. “Had the Obama administration made such a powerful case for why austerity was hampering growth, it could have educated the public and potentially helped build support for more sensible policy the next time the United States faces a recession,” he writes."

There’s the caipirinha, Brazil’s official national cocktail; churrascarias, their epic steakhouses; and then the brigadeiro, Brazil’s unofficial national sweet. This chocolate confection, which is almost always served as a round, two-bite treat rolled in sprinkles, is like sinking your teeth into a dream ― think chocolate truffle meets dulce de leche.The simple brigadeiro ― pronounced bree-ga-DAY-ro ― might be made up of nothing more than a handful of ingredients, but it is a quintessential part of any Brazilian childhood. It makes an appearance at practically every birthday party ― for children and adults alike, actually. And it’s served at almost every other celebration, too. It’s enjoyed all over the country, and crosses all socio-economic borders. The brigadeiro is basically love translated into a dessert.While it’s often made with sprinkles, brigadeiro can be rolled in just about anything. Brigadeiro boutiques exist in Brazil where over 50 variations of this treat can be found, featuring ingredients such as pistachio, almonds and hazelnuts. But if you’re not planning any trips to this country in the Southern Hemisphere any time soon, you can still get your hands on these sweets by making them yourself. They’re super easy to create in your own home kitchen; with just five ingredients, a pan, and a little bit of patience you can be biting into one of these in no time.Food blogger From Brazil To You has a recipe we love, cooking sweetened condensed milk, chocolate, butter and vanilla together to reach that perfect brigadeiro consistency. At this point you can choose to eat this concoction with a spoon, use it to layer in a cake, or let it cool and roll it into truffles covered in sprinkles. Head on over to her site for the recipe (and you can watch how she makes them in the video below)."
14,POLITICS,You Can Now Message The President On Facebook,Lauren Aratani,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/message-obama-on-facebook-messenger_us_57ab9657e4b0ba7ed23ee736,You might even get a response.,2016-08-11,The White House's Messenger bot automatically sends you this response if you request to message them on Facebook. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57abba4b1700002c00d1e087.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You can officially send a Facebook message to President Barack Obama himself using the social network’s messenger tool, the White House announced Wednesday. Sending letters to the president is nothing new — in fact, people have been doing it since the age of Thomas Jefferson, the White House noted in a press release. But with the rise of Facebook Messenger, which hit 900 million users in 2016, the executive branch has decided to take advantage of the accessibility of instant messaging.“Face-to-face time is a little harder to come by these days, but technology makes it possible for anyone with an internet connection to send a message to the President and his Administration,” Jason Goldman, chief digital officer of the White House, wrote in the press release. It’s “as easy as messaging your closest friends.”Goldman worked with Joshua Miller, the White House’s director of product management, to create a Messenger bot specifically for the president’s Facebook, according to Fast Company.Here’s how it works: Once you open a chat box to message the White House, the bot will greet you. After you hit “Let’s go!” you’ll be prompted for your message to the president. Once you compose your message and hit send, the bot will forward your message to the White House’s Office of Presidential Correspondence.Unfortunately, there’s no guarantee that Obama will read your message. But there is a small chance that it could be one of 10 the president plans to read each night.Since 2009, the Office of Correspondence has sifted through all of the president’s letters each day, choosing 10 for him to read that night. The Office of Correspondence has even posted some of their favorite letters to their “Letters to President Obama” Tumblr account. The creation of the Messenger bot is just one of the many ways the White House has been using social media to connect with American citizens. The executive office runs accounts across multiple sites, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The First Lady even created her own Snapchat account. On digital platforms, “people expect to have a conversation about the things that matter to them as opposed to just receiving press releases or just receiving talking points,” Goldman said in a White House Q&A. “People expect more human moments, more conversational moments, less being talked to and more being talked with.”Of course you can still send handwritten letters to the Oval Office, but if you’re averse to snail mail (or you just don’t want POTUS to see your terrible handwriting), sending a message on Facebook might just be the most convenient way to get in touch with the president. And who knows, you might even get a response. "
