0,RELIGION,Dozens Of Evangelical Leaders Petition Texas To Stop Scheduled Execution,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dozens-of-evangelical-leaders-petition-texas-to-stop-scheduled-execution_us_57b4af0ce4b095b2f5420c4a,"Evangelicals are increasingly seeing the death penalty as a ""pro-life"" issue.",2016-08-17,"Texas death row inmate Jeffery Wood is scheduled to be executed August 24, 2016 for a murder he did not commit.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b4b3fd170000ae02c73d0a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of nearly 50 evangelical leaders are urging the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and Governor Greg Abbott to halt the upcoming execution of death row inmate Jeffery Wood.In a letter signed by 49 evangelicals from Texas and around the country, the Christian leaders said officials have a “moral obligation” to stop the execution, which is scheduled for Aug. 24.Evangelicals have historically been divided on the death penalty. The National Association of Evangelicals has stood in favor of the death penalty since the 1970s, though it updated its stance in 2015 to acknowledge that the Christian ethic could also undergird opposition to capital punishment.“Many of us in the evangelical Protestant community are coming to where the Catholics have been for a while: pro-life in terms of whole life, all vulnerable life, whether in the womb or on death row,” one of the letters signatories, Joel Hunter, told The Marshall Project, a news outlet focused on criminal justice.Among the letters signatories are ten Texas pastors and 39 other national leaders, including Jim Wallis, Lisa Sharon Harper, David Gushee, Tony Campolo and Shane Claiborne. “Our faith compels us to speak out in this case, where a looming execution date threatens the life of an individual with significant mental impairments who never should have been sentenced to death,” the letter, dated Aug. 8, states.Wood was sentenced to death in 1998 for aiding in the murder of Kris Keeran, a gas station attendant who was killed during a robbery in 1996. Wood’s former roommate, Danny Reneau, committed the murder while Wood waited for him in a car outside. Reneau was convicted and executed in 2002.Wood was previously scheduled to be executed in 2008, but a San Antonio judge postponed the execution so officials could determine whether he was mentally fit.Wood’s family describes him as an “eight-year-old in a man’s body” with “debilitating emotional and intellectual impairments” that made him vulnerable to manipulation, according to The Washington Post. His case is unusual ― people who have never killed or intended to kill are rarely sentenced to death. But his conviction falls under Texas’s “law of parties,” which states that a person who “solicits, encourages, directs, aids, or attempts to aid the other person to commit an offense” is criminally liable for that offense.“As the getaway driver, Wood committed a crime, but not one deserving the death penalty,” wrote the evangelical leaders.“It deeply troubles us when the criminal justice system concludes that some of the most vulnerable in society can be executed and disposed of,” the letter stated. “All are made in God’s image, and as a society we especially must protect those with mental illness and disabilities.”"

And when they write books that are fairly recently released, and they say wonderful things about him. And now, all of a sudden, they’re saying these horrible things about him,” Trump said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” in late July. “It’s very sad because he’s a very good person. I’ve always found him to be just a very, very good person. And, by the way, a very, very talented person. Look what he’s done. So I feel very badly.”Trump’s campaign denies that Ailes is advising him ahead of his first debate with Clinton in September. But his embrace of Ailes and his unapologetic misogyny are already sabotaging his chances of wooing female voters in November. He is trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton among women voters by double-digit margins in seven key battleground states, according to a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. And several Republican women told the Atlantic they are so disgusted by Trump and the GOP leaders who are supporting him that they are planning to leave the party altogether after November if it doesn’t disavow the loose-lipped real estate mogul. “I was shocked when I saw the leadership in the party standing by him,” said Susan Alvarez, a self-described “lifelong Republican” in Spokane, Washington. “They helped create Donald Trump by not confronting the racism and paranoia that was infecting the party. By their silence, they validated Trump, and for me that is worth leaving the party over.”Trump cannot win in November without the support of women, who make up 51 percent of the U.S. population. Women decided the presidential election in 2012, when Barack Obama beat Republican candidate Mitt Romney by a historic 12-point gender gap. And Trump has the potential to lose by even bigger numbers among women this year― especially if he takes debate tips from a serial sexual harasser. “His campaign is shaping up to be a reflection of what his presidency would mean: a complete and total disaster for women,” said Marcy Stech, a spokeswoman for the pro-choice women’s PAC EMILY’s List. “Luckily, women can and will be the ones to stop him in November.”Romney’s former campaign manager, Katie Packer, thinks Trump isn’t even trying to appeal to women.“So the GOP candidate is just giving up on the women’s vote altogether,” she tweeted. “Got it.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

3,POLITICS,Voters From Both Parties Expect Donald Trump To Lose In November,Samantha Neal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/both-parties-expect-trump-loss_us_57b33954e4b0c75f49d86312,"And when it comes to this question, voters are usually right.",2016-08-16,Donald Trump is losing substantially on a polling question that exhibits a strong predictive capacity of electoral outcomes. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b33a06170000ae02c737de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump in recent polling by an average of 8 points ― and the difference is even more pronounced when you look at one particular metric, one that measures voters’ expectations of the race. When pollsters sample a question regularly, we tend to see slight variations that only convey a more meaningful trend over time. But this summer, as pollsters have asked voters who they expect to win in November, we’ve seen something radically different from the usual incremental shift.Clinton is outperforming Trump drastically on the expectations question. The University of Michigan’s monthly survey of consumers shows that the net share of households that expect Clinton to beat Trump in the general election rose to 39 percentage points in August. That’s up from 27 points in July and 14 points in June. This means that in a three-month span, UMich has measured a 25-point rise in the percentage of people who think Clinton will win in November ― a substantial shift in public opinion over a relatively short time. Other polls show a similarly sharp increase. According to a YouGov/Economist poll, Clinton led by 12 points on the expectations question in mid-July, expanding her lead to 20 points in late July. The most recent YouGov/Economist poll has Clinton up by 25 points on this question, showing a 13-point increase in just two months in people who believe Clinton will win the election. Clinton’s lead extends across party lines. A substantial number of Republicans who are voting for Trump ― 32 percent, according to the YouGov/Economist poll ― nevertheless expect him to fall short of victory.The phenomenon exists even more strongly at the state level. Forty-five percent of Utah voters believe Clinton will win the White House in November, while a little more than 25 percent believe Trump will win, according to a recent Dan Jones & Associates survey. These results are particularly striking, since Utah, which is largely Mormon, has been one of the most reliably red states in the nation. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney locked down the Utah vote by a landslide in 2012, as did Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) during his own presidential bid in 2008. The last time Utah swung blue in a presidential election was in 1964, when Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson ran against Republican Barry Goldwater.Americans’ expectations for who will win have historically been a better predictor of election outcomes than their own reported vote preferences, according to research conducted by David Rothschild and Justin Wolfers. As we wrote last month:Looking back on the last three presidential elections, the expectations question [who do you expect will win?] predicted the overall outcome much more accurately than the intent question [who do you intend to vote for?] in nearly every poll who asked it in months leading up to the election. At this stage in the 2012 election, Obama led Romney by an average of 25 points on the expectations question...[even when] the voter intent question indicated a much closer race ― Romney and Obama were within 1 point of each other. The same pattern holds in both the 2008 and 2004 races.The predictive power of the expectations question lies in its relative objectivity. When voters are asked about their objective expectations for what will happen, rather than just what they personally intend to do, they are required to take into account a variety of external conditions and preferences independent from their own. The expectations question is a powerful predictor of general election outcomes. And it’s one that Trump is critically losing. That’s no guarantee of a Clinton victory, but it’s also far from the only ominous signal for the business magnate. Clinton has overtaken Trump in the overwhelming majority of key swing states, and the race is tightening in historically deep-red states. Meanwhile, Trump is polling abysmally among voters of color and losing among traditionally Republican voting demographics. It’s not over till it’s over, but if you’re Team Trump, things aren’t looking good.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

But first the board has to formally ask the court to hear its appeal, and the deadline for that is the end of August.If the Supreme Court takes the case, it would be the first time the justices address whether existing civil rights laws protect trans individuals.For now, Grimm is stuck in limbo. Earlier this month the Supreme Court issued an extraordinary order blocking the lower court’s ruling in favor of the teen. In other words, he won’t be allowed into the boys’ restroom when school starts in September.Lawyers for the school board asked Chief Justice John Roberts on Monday to give them more time to file their appeal because they’re so busy defending another anti-trans measure. The firm representing the school board, Schaerr | Duncan LLP, is also defending North Carolina against Department of Justice efforts to block enforcement of a state law mandating that people use only the public restrooms corresponding to their “biological sex.” Roberts declined the lawyers’ request without comment on Tuesday.The lawyers had argued that keeping up with their obligations and deadlines in the North Carolina case had stretched them thin.“Although other lawyers might be retained to assist on the certiorari petition, it will be impossible for those new attorneys to get up to speed on the complex issues and prepare an exemplary petition by August 29, 2016,” the lawyers told the Supreme Court. They asked for a one-month extension on that deadline.That request drew immediate opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union, which has represented Grimm throughout the case. “The Board has had ample time to prepare its petition for certiorari and has no excuse for delaying until the last minute,” wrote ACLU lawyer Joshua Block.The ACLU had already argued vigorously that its client will suffer irreparable harm from the high court’s decision to put its lower court victory on hold. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled in April that Gloucester County can’t discriminate against Grimm because the federal government’s reading of Title IX, which forbids discrimination on the basis of sex, extends to transgender students. The Obama administration would later cite that ruling in issuing broad trans-inclusive guidance to schools and localities nationwide.With the new school year fast approaching, the Supreme Court’s hold on the 4th Circuit ruling raised eyebrows among court watchers. Justice Stephen Breyer, who typically votes with the court’s liberal wing, joined his four more-conservative colleagues to grant relief to the school board “as a courtesy.”In opposing the deadline extension, Block reminded the justices of the toll their earlier order takes on Grimm, who is slated to begin his senior year on Sept. 6.Grimm “experiences irreparable harm each day the School Board’s policy forces him to use separate single-stall restrooms that no other student is required to use,” Block wrote, adding that the teen “experiences painful urinary tract infections as a result of trying to avoid the humiliation of using separate restrooms.” The Virginia teen’s case is one of several ― in North Carolina, Texas and other states ― seeking to establish whether federal law protects transgender individuals in educational settings. Of these, the Texas dispute is being closely watched for its similarities to a multistate lawsuit that ended up blocking President Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration. A federal judge there will soon decide whether to grant a national injunction that would bar the federal government from enforcing its trans-inclusive guidance across the country."

Tanden, for example, is a longtime Clinton confidante, and Boushey has advised the campaign on economic policy.Clinton led Trump by more than 5 percentage points in the Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Friday.Trump, a New York businessman who has never held elected office, has been mired in repeated controversies recently. He drew heavy criticism last week after he suggested gun rights activists could take action against Clinton, a statement he later said was aimed at rallying votes against her.Many establishment Republicans, alarmed by the steady flow of controversial remarks, have distanced themselves from Trump in recent weeks.In May, Trump picked New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to head his own transition team.(Reporting by Luciana Lopez; Editing by Nick Macfie)"

It would have pitted King’s two sons against his surviving daughter, who were at odds over whether to sell the medal.In a joint statement from the siblings, the family credited former U.S. President Jimmy Carter with guiding them to the confidential agreement.The three siblings serve as directors of a corporation formed to manage the estate of King, who had no will when he was assassinated in 1968 at age 39 by a white supremacist in Memphis, Tennessee.Martin Luther King III and Dexter King voted in January 2014 to sell the medal and a Bible their father carried during the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Bernice King objected to a sale, calling the heirlooms “sacred” to the family.Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney had ordered the items to be kept in a court-controlled safe deposit box pending the outcome of the lawsuit.The judge on Monday signed an order in which the parties asked for the suit to be dismissed and agreed the keys to the box should be given to Martin Luther King III, who serves as chairman of the estate board.The judge said in court he did not know any further details of the settlement.“While Bernice has always believed that the Peace Prize and Bible should not be sold, I am grateful that she has agreed not to stand in the way of the Estate’s decisions about how to handle the items,” Carter said in a statement.“As in any mediation, compromises were required, and I am glad that the parties resolved the issues in the interest of the greater good and their parents’ legacy,” the former president added.Last month, McBurney ruled that the Bible, which Barack Obama, America’s first black president, used at his second inaugural in 2013, belonged to the estate."

It's one of the five U.S. properties in the Trump Hotel Collection recently added to the federal list.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b38403170000ae02c739a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"All Trump hotels are now on the government’s list of hotels and motels that have been approved as “fire safe” for federal employees.As The Huffington Post reported in July, a number of Trump Hotels properties were not on the approved list ― meaning that if he were president, Donald Trump’s staffers would not be allowed to stay there.Only the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago was on the Hotel-Motel National Master List, which the Federal Emergency Management Agency maintains to ensure that federal employees traveling on government business stay in lodging that meets certain basic requirements, such as having fire alarms and sprinklers. Federal employees can’t be reimbursed for nights they spend at hotels that aren’t on the list, or attend conferences or events there.Trump Hotels spokeswoman Christine Da Silva told HuffPost shortly after the original story ran that “there are many optional programs such as this which our hotels regularly evaluate. While some of our properties do not participate in this particular program, our hotels are extremely vigilant and adhere to required fire and safety codes.”But in the weeks since the story was published, five hotels in the Trump Collection, as well as Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, have been added to the federal list of hotels approved for fire safety.“When you contacted us regarding the list, we reached out to FEMA. The organization was very responsive and easy to work with so our properties were able to quickly be added,” a Trump Hotels spokeswoman told HuffPost Tuesday.The process for being added to the list is indeed relatively easy, and 87 percent of the 53,423 hotels and motels in the U.S. are on it, according to data from FEMA and the American Hotel and Lodging Association. Properties that aren’t on the list are not necessarily unsafe, and local fire departments and a review of public records did not uncover any outstanding fire safety issues at Trump hotels.The Hotel-Motel National Master List was created as part of the 1990 Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act, which passed in response to deadly fires at hotels that lacked basic fire safety measure like effective sprinklers and alarms. One such tragedy was a fire at the Hotel Dupont Plaza in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on New Year’s Eve 1986, which killed 96 people and injured more than 140.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
9,POLITICS,Baltimore School Cops' Abuse Of Kids Is Rooted In City's Racist History,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baltimore-school-police_us_57b227f7e4b007c36e4fcb44,Charm City's children are arrested at an astounding rate.,2016-08-16,"White high school students gather in front of Baltimore City Hall in October 1954, demanding that black students be barred from previously all-white schools.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b22b32180000ad02bcae5c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Baltimore police officers violated the Constitution by disproportionately stopping, frisking and arresting black residents, according to a damning report from the U.S. Justice Department released last week.But lost in the resulting criticism of the Baltimore Police Department was another, equally concerning aspect of the report: It revealed that the city “has essentially used the Baltimore School Police as an auxiliary force to BPD.” School police can “exercise full police power anywhere within the jurisdiction of the City of Baltimore,” according to the report. This includes making arrests, aiding Baltimore Police officers in investigations and following up on criminal cases.So if Baltimore city cops are systematically violating the rights of black adults in the city, how are their buddies in the school police force treating black kids?They’re arresting them ― a lot.Putting cops in schools leads to the “criminalization of regular, normal adolescent behavior,” said Jenny Egan, a Baltimore public defender who represents juveniles. “When we put police officers in school who aren’t trained, who don’t know anything about adolescent development, and you tell them this is a crime, they’re going to do what police are trained to do ― arrest people.”The data bear that out: Students in Baltimore City Public Schools make up just 10 percent of Maryland’s K-12 school population, but account for 45 percent of Maryland kids arrested in schools. At least 3,390 juveniles were arrested in Baltimore during fiscal year 2015. Ninety-four percent of them were black and 12.6 percent of them (around 427 kids) were arrested in school, according to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services.Despite all those arrests, Baltimore school cops aren’t catching a ton of hardened criminals: Around three-quarters of the kids arrested in Baltimore schools have their charges dismissed or are found not guilty, according to Egan’s analysis of more than 400 school-based arrests from the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 school years.Baltimore School Police officers are trained to operate not as social workers or adolescent behavior specialists, but as warriors, a March investigation by Mother Jones found. One piece of their training literature quotes “One Warrior’s Creed” by retired cop Steven R. Watt. “You may defeat me,” it says, “but you will pay a severe price and will be lucky to escape with your life.”That “warrior” attitude can lead to abuse. Last year, Lakisha Pulley, a school officer, pleaded guilty to three counts of second-degree assault for hitting a middle-schooler in the head with a baton and pepper-spraying two others while they were restrained. This March, officer Anthony Spence was caught on mobile phone video slapping and kicking a teenager. And this sort of behavior has been happening for years: In 2002, school officer Marlon Lynch shot and killed a 13-year-old who was allegedly smoking marijuana and drinking behind an elementary school.So if Baltimore school cops aren’t actually stopping crime — and are sometimes assaulting or killing kids — why are they in schools in the first place? It’s all about history and segregation. A security division for Baltimore public schools was founded in 1967, the same year that Thomas D’Alesandro III became mayor having run on a school integration platform. The timing wasn’t a coincidence, Egan said.“When they got serious about desegregating schools, it was the exact moment that they created a separate [police force] for Baltimore City schools,” she said. “We took these formal ways of segregation and started … using the criminal justice system and police measures to criminalize, in this case, just the presence of black students in Baltimore City public schools.” Although Baltimore had immediately merged its separate school systems following the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, it didn’t redraw any district lines to mix black and white students. Between 1955 and 1963, the number of black children attending all-black elementary and high schools actually increased by 13,000 and 4,500, respectively. Baltimore schools remain de facto segregated to this day, according to a 2013 report from the Civil Rights Project at UCLA. And nearly 82 percent of students in the public schools are black.Shortly after the school security force was established, the Maryland state legislature passed a law making it illegal to disturb school activities, Egan said. This gave officers the green light to arrest students.“The origins of the school police as well as the origins of laws focused on students and children ― like disturbing school activities and making that a crime ― come out of that very charged racial moment,” she said. In 1984, as the crack cocaine epidemic hit cities, then-school Superintendent Alice G. Pinderhughes redesigned the security division to function as an official police force. Personnel titles were changed and, during the tough-on-crime era of the 1990s, the Maryland General Assembly passed a bill confirming that the division held the same powers as a regular police force. Linda Flood moved from the city’s police department to become the Baltimore School Police chief in 1994. Under her leadership, the force received more training and was equipped with marked police vehicles, professional uniforms and firearms.When the No Child Left Behind Act became federal law in 2002, schools across the country were required to report data on student suspensions and expulsions and to justify those decisions. But they weren’t required to report school-based arrests. This had a very unfortunate side effect on student discipline ― at least in Baltimore.“It created this perverse incentive where you couldn’t suspend a kid because the standards were too high and you had to show reason, but you could arrest them,” Egan said.While suspending kids can push them into the hands of police eventually, arresting them is a direct step into the school-to-prison pipeline.That’s what makes the Justice Department’s analysis of the Baltimore School Police so disturbing. An already flawed school police force is traumatizing kids in an overwhelmingly black school system. If that force is also working in tandem with a broken city police department, more African-American kids will be funneled into the criminal justice system just as their lives are starting."

Pat Buchanan, a regular panelist, said it was the first episode McLaughlin had missed in the show’s 34 years on the air, according to the news site Deadline. McLaughlin taped a voiceover, however, to introduce a discussion segment about trade policy, Deadline reported.“As a former Jesuit priest, teacher, pundit and news host, John touched many lives,” the “McLaughlin Group family” said in a Facebook message announcing his death. “Now he has said bye bye for the last time, to rejoin his beloved dog, Oliver, in heaven.” The message didn’t give a cause of death. “The McLaughlin Group,” which aired Sunday mornings on public television stations across the country, featured a panel discussion of current political and policy topics. McLaughlin would typically introduce an issue, then open it up for discussion among four panelists, who included both liberals and conservatives.The current standing roster of panelists for the talk show was Buchanan, a conservative author and former Republican presidential candidate; Eleanor Clift, a Washington correspondent for the Daily Beast; Clarence Page, a syndicated newspaper columnist; and Tom Rogan, a conservative writer and pundit.McLaughlin, who held a PhD in communications from Columbia University, was a columnist for the conservative magazine National Review, and a speechwriter and aide in the Nixon and Ford administrations before creating “The McLaughlin Group” in 1982. His other forays into television included his solo interview show, “John McLaughlin’s One on One,” which aired on public television from 1984 to 2013.McLaughlin’s sheer longevity on television, as well as his no-holds-barred style and grasp of details of insider Beltway political maneuvering, made his weekly talk show something of an institution in Washington political and media class. He pioneered a brash and contentious form of televised political commentary, and was unafraid to grill panelists with questions, interrupt evasiveness and flatly dismiss conclusions he considered wrong.Watch HuffPost Washington Bureau Chief Ryan Grim’s appearance on “The McLaughlin Group” in 2012.But as media modernized to include more diverse faces and less orthodox formats, McLaughlin’s talk show increasingly came to be viewed as an endearing, if out of touch, throwback to a different era of television commentary.Many millennial media consumers’ only knowledge of McLaughlin came from late-night television comic sendups of his retro style. HBO comedian John Oliver in May assembled a minute-long video mashup of McLaughlin’s curmudgeonly expression and tone when introducing discussion topics.McLaughlin also drew mockery from Stephen Colbert in 2008 for claiming that contrary to popular belief, Barack Obama was not the nation’s first black president. “Warren G. Harding was a negro,” McLaughlin said.McLaughlin may have believed a theory about Harding’s African lineage that has since been disproven by DNA testing.McLaughlin had a reputation for inappropriate behavior toward women colleagues. His office manager, Linda Dean, sued him for $4 million in 1988, The Associated Press reported, accusing him of firing her after she complained about his sexual advances. The suit was settled out of court in 1989.Journalists and other Americans familiar with McLaughlin’s work expressed condolences and fond memories."

12,POLITICS,Mothers In Immigrant Detention Vow To Continue Hunger Strike Until They're Released -- Or Dead,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mothers-immigrant-detention-hunger-strike_us_57b3698be4b04ff883990132,Many contend their rights were violated in previous deportation decisions.,2016-08-16,"Hannah Hafter, left, Adanjesus Marin and Marvin Hernandez, protest on Martha's Vineyard, where President Barack Obama is vacationing with his family.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mothers detained in a Pennsylvania family immigrant facility ― some for more than a year ― vow to continue a hunger strike that risks their health and potential deportation to what they say is serious danger in their native countries.Many also have joined a high-stakes legal battle seeking a declaration that their constitutional rights were violated and that they should be entitled to a new asylum hearing. If federal courts reject their claims, some immigrants in detention will have one less avenue to challenge how the government handles their removal proceedings.Twenty-two women are participating in the hunger strike at Berks County Family Residential Center, according to attorneys and activists. Immigration and Customs Enforcement put the total at 18. The women began the action Aug. 8 in protest of their long-term detention with their children. “WE WILL GET OUT ALIVE OR DEAD,” the women wrote in an open letter to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. The women did not list their names, saying they feared retaliation, but included the amount of time they had been in detention and the ages of their children. Four mothers have been detained with their children for more than a year, and six have been held for more than 300 days, according to the letter. The children range in age from 2 to 16. The hunger strikers are part of an often overlooked piece of the family immigrant detention system. The Berks facility holds up to about 100 people and predates two much larger federal centers created after an influx of women and children apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2014. Those facilities, Karnes County Residential Center and South Texas Family Residential Center, have held thousands of women and children, some for lengthy periods. But legal challenges and political pressure led the Obama administration to try to speed up the time frame for families remaining in detention. Johnson told reporters this month that most women and children in family facilities were detained for 20 days or less. The women in Berks are allowed to use the internet and follow the news, one of them said in a phone interview. When they saw Johnson’s comments, which were highlighted by immigrant rights advocates, they decided to begin a hunger strike to call attention to their long-term detention, she said. “I would like to have a meeting with Jeh Johnson face to face and ask him why he’s saying the things that he’s saying when I have been here for almost a year,” the woman, who asked not to be identified by name, said through an interpreter. She said the strikers would continue to refuse to eat as long as necessary to get out of detention.They received support on Monday from protesters on Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, where President Barack Obama is vacationing with his family. The activists called for Berks to be closed.Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said in a statement on Tuesday that 18 women at Berks had refused food for 72 hours or more. The agency “takes very seriously the health, safety, and welfare of those in our care and we continue to monitor the situation,” the statement said. ICE didn’t comment on individual women’s cases, but said there are many factors that contribute to the length of time a person is detained. Many, but not all, of the women involved in the hunger strike are also part of a shared legal battle over their deportation orders. These women were placed into what the government calls expedited removal proceedings at the border, and were not given asylum. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, they filed petitions in federal court ― combined in a case called Castro v. DHS ― saying they should receive new asylum screenings due to legal errors in their previous reviews. The legal fight has turned to whether the women have the constitutional right to appeal at all. The government has argued that habeas corpus, or the right to challenge illegal imprisonment, does not apply to these families and that they cannot turn to federal courts for relief.A federal judge sided with the government in February. The women appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit and are awaiting a ruling.Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, said non-citizens on U.S. soil have always been able to access the courts to challenge the legality of their deportation. The case does not require that the women be released, but Gelernt and other attorneys argue they should be let out as they await a decision. “There is no reason why these women and young children should be in detention for this long,” Gelernt said in an email. “The Administration is seemingly refusing to release them simply because they brought a constitutional test case. We hope the Administration will do the right thing and release them while the case works its way through the courts.”Cristian Farias contributed reporting."

Nearly one-quarter of those surveyed believe problems in the criminal justice system will be the most important issue for the next president. Only 17 percent of respondents said that in a similar January survey. Additionally, 72 percent of millennials surveyed believe “police violence against African Americans is a problem,” an increase of 11 percentage points since the January version of the survey.The poll was conducted prior to the violent protests that erupted in Milwaukee in response to the fatal police shooting of Sylville Smith, a 23-year-old black man. Officers opened fire on Smith on Saturday as he fled a traffic stop, reportedly after confronting police with a gun in hand.The unrest in Milwaukee follows a string of protests against police brutality toward black men and women in major U.S. cities over the past few years. Opinions about the intersection of police violence and race remain sharply divided along partisan lines, according to a USA Today story accompanying the release of the poll. By a margin of 6-1, supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton say police brutality against black Americans is a problem. Supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, however, are split in their responses.Meanwhile, 75 percent of Clinton supporters and 88 percent of Trump supporters say they are “very concerned about the safety of police officers doing their jobs in the current political environment.” While tensions between police departments and black communities continue to fester, Election Day is fast approaching.Younger voters overwhelmingly support a Clinton presidency, according to the poll, which finds that 56 percent of millennials would support Clinton and only 20 percent would support Trump in a two-way race. Meanwhile, 15 percent say they won’t vote. But even when Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein are added to the fray, Clinton gets 50 percent support from younger voters, while Trump wins a meager 18 percent. Johnson walks away with 11 percent and Stein takes 4 percent, while another 8 percent say they’re unsure who they’d vote for and 10 percent say they will not vote.The poll was conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs from Aug. 5-10 and surveyed a national sample of 1,539 adults ages 18-34.

The deluge started with heavy rainfall Friday. First responders have rescued more than 20,000 people; on Tuesday, officials updated the death toll to 11.“I was calling 911, but I couldn’t get them on the phone,” Baker resident Margaret Teague told NOLA.com on Sunday. Teague, whose home in an eastern suburb of Baton Rouge was partially destroyed, lost another home to Hurricane Katrina 11 years ago. AT&T service was down for an unknown number of residents in the metro Baton Rouge region after a switching tower that directs cellular phone traffic flooded, further complicating rescue and evacuation efforts. Teague told NOLA.com her family was among residents bounced from one makeshift shelter to the next before finding one where they could remain.Roughly 120 people from a Baton Rouge Salvation Army shelter had to evacuate after the headquarters flooded with more than six feet of water, The Associated Press reported. Other families had to sleep on the floors of shelters that had run out of beds, state Department of Children and Family Services head Marketa Walters told Reuters. Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), who on Friday declared a state of emergency, was forced to evacuate the governor’s mansion in Baton Rouge with his family. Mike Steele, communications director for the Louisiana Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, told weather.com on Sunday that rescue efforts were “all hands on deck.” Steele said motorists were stranded on Interstate 12, and parts of the highway remained closed. At least 2,700 homes from Baton Rouge to the eastern rural Tangipahoa Parish have flooded, he added. The flooding has prevented some businesses, including those that sell necessities, from opening. “The Albertsons here has food and everything and they will not open,” said Nathan Songy, who lives in a city called Denham Springs. “The corporate store said they had to close the store because it’s unsafe for employees. The police department has asked them to open it because they did not want another Katrina situation where there would be looting.”People are allowed in the store to use the bathroom, but not to buy anything, Songy said. “There was a policeman there and he said, ‘I’m worried for my own safety. I don’t want to have to face them and tell them they can’t buy something here,’” he said.A spokeswoman for Albertsons later clarified the Denham Springs store was not closed due an unwillingness to serve customers, but because it had been “commandeered by Homeland Security and used as a command center and evacuee shelter.” President Barack Obama on Sunday issued a disaster declaration that makes affected parishes eligible for federal relief. According to the Advocate: The federal declaration that Louisiana suffered a major disaster frees the federal government to pay about 75 percent of the state’s expenditures in dealing with the emergency. Higher matches, up to 90 percent federal dollars to 10 percent of state spending, are available depending on how expensive the disaster eventually becomes. Just five months earlier, Louisiana was slammed by springtime flooding. The cost of the latest damage hasn’t been estimated. State Trooper Bryan Lee told The Huffington Post Monday that financial issues aren’t a priority for now.“One of the challenges we’re facing is the interstate system being closed, and getting resources and rescuing people that need to be rescued,” Lee said. “As far as financial issues, that’s something we’re not concerned with right now.” Lee estimated that nearly 4,000 residents were being housed at metro Baton Rouge-area shelters, including 3,000 people at the Celtic Studios ― a movie studio.Jay Dardenne, Louisiana’s commissioner of administration, told the Advocate the state is spending whatever necessary responding to the floods for search, rescue, shelter and evacuation. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which handles disaster- assistance, has been under pressure from Congress to trim how much the federal government gives to states for disaster response. Louisiana has frequent natural disasters from floods and hurricanes, but is poorer than states like California, which faces wildfires. That financial situation complicates Louisiana’s ability to recover from disasters and invest in prevention efforts.Jesse Pines, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University, wrote in a 2014 report that funding for disaster planning and recovery tends to be “lumpy.” “A disaster happens and there’s a big flood of resources to take care of the disaster,” Pines said. “And over time as different disasters hit and there are different funding priorities, there’s less money being invested in prevention.” David Lohr contributed reporting from Baton Rouge. This article has been updated with new information on the death toll and with comment from Nathan Songy and a representative from Albertsons.

Now this. It’s all been back-to-back,” said Baton Rouge nurse Aron Coates, who came to the makeshift shelter at Celtic Studios to offer assistance to flood evacuees. Coates was among several people The Huffington Post interviewed Monday at the Baton Rouge movie warehouse-turned-shelter and the surrounding area where an estimated 3,000 people are being housed. Local media has dubbed the disaster “The Great Flood of 2016,” while the Red Cross said it’s undergoing the largest relief effort since Hurricane Sandy.Like many of her fellow Baton Rougeans, Coates is alarmed at the flood’s devastation and exhausted to see the area and its people beset by yet another tragedy in a matter of months. The mid-August floods mark the second time in 2016 the state had seen more than 24 inches of rainfall from a single event. In March, historic floods hit Louisiana, overflowing rivers and swallowing up homes.In early July, a Baton Rouge police officer was caught on video violently shooting Alton Sterling, a black Baton Rouge man who was selling CDs in front of a friend’s convenience store. Sterling’s death prompted days of intense protests against such use of force in a city of historic racial tension where some residents say police treat the black community like second class citizens.Less than two weeks later, a Missouri man killed three Baton Rouge-area police in an ambush-style attack and prompted another period of mourning in the community. Racial inequality has been a thread woven through many of the state’s recent tragedies, be they natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina or police killings of black, and often poor, residents. Several evacuees who spoke to HuffPost expressed hope that amid the devastation from the deadly floods, residents could find common ground. “What’s happening now is a very tragic thing,” Coates said. “But it’s like Mother Nature is trying to purge everything out and bring us together.” “Right now people aren’t concerned about black versus white,” she added. “We’re all just trying to survive and get everybody back on their feet. So it kind of washed all that away. ...I think in the long run it will be a healing thing.”Pat Payne, 61, has lived in Baton Rouge since 1993. She and her husband, Brian, were staying at the shelter after losing everything in the flood. “There’s nothing left,” Payne said. “What you see on our backs is it.The flooding started Sunday morning when Brian told her water was coming onto their yard.“Then the next thing we knew it was in our house. Everything is ruined. They had to come get us by boat,” she said. Now, the couple plans to leave to stay with friends. “As bad as it is, everybody is coming together and helping each other by doing what they can. It’s good ― it’s good to see that.”Payne noted a Facebook comment Montrell Jackson ― one of the slain Baton Rouge police officers ― made before he was killed. “He said ‘Please don’t let hate infect your heart.’ I hope he’s looking down and seeing that hate is not infecting our hearts.”Ellen Anderson, 55, who has lived in Baton Rouge for two decades said that she, like the Paynes, has lost everything in this flood. Anderson had been living with her son and daughter-in-law.While Anderson was able to escape, her son has been trapped in the home since Thursday. “There was water up to the ceiling. We’re still waiting on them to rescue my son. The water is so high they can’t rescue him,” Anderson said. The current devastation has her looking at recent events differently now. “I think what has happened here is God is letting everybody know that he rules this country,” she said. “Ain’t no white lives matter or black lives matter. Everybody’s lives matter. This disaster shows us all that.”She added, “We’re all together here now and we have to love everybody. We can’t hate nobody.”Like many of her neighbors, Leslie James, a lifelong resident of Baton Rouge, said she’s been overwhelmed by recent events and now the flood. The 55-year-old said despite all of it, her faith has kept her going. “It’s a lot to deal with. We have seen so much division lately with law enforcement and the residents of this city and now this. It can be discouraging, but my faith keeps me encouraged amongst everything else,” James said. “I think this has brought us together the way we used to be. We care about each other, we look out for each other and we’re there for each other,” she continued. “I hope and pray people will continue to come together and that the leaders of the city, state and country will provide us with the necessary help we need to move on with our lives.”The floodwaters that engulfed 54-year-old Elnora Patterson’s house were unlike anything the lifelong Baton Rouge resident said she’s ever seen. “The water was up to the tip of the stop sign on my street. I kept saying, ‘Lord when is this rain going to stop?’ It was nonstop.”The epic floods felt to her like “God is trying to tell us something.” “It’s time for everyone to get their act together. Stop all this nonsense and love each other,” Patterson said. “There was so much negativity before this. We don’t show enough love towards each other, so God had to do something. He had to bring us together and look at us now. We’re all together here and everyone is helping everyone.” With so many residents stripped down to nothing, Patterson said previous divisions don’t matter right now. “We’re all in the same room. We’re together now and that’s what God wanted us to do,” she said. “Sometimes it takes bad things to happen for good things to happen.”Outside Celtic Studios in the heavily-damaged Denham Springs area, resident AJ Herbert said everyone is helping one another despite their losses. An estimated 90 percent of the homes in the area have flooded. “I’m at a loss for words,” said Herbert, a football coach at the local high school. On Saturday, he went out to the subdivision with other motorists who had “jacked up vehicles” to help evacuate residents onto boats. “I was nervous because the current was moving so fast that it was pushing vehicles off the road. One lady we rescued was paralyzed from the neck down. We had to get her and her chair out of her place and into a boat. There was a lot of elderly people.”Herbert guesses he made about 20 trips over 10 hours.“The community really came together,” he said. “It’s sad it takes an event like this to pull people together, but it didn’t matter who you was if you could lend a hand, you was.“There was people who knew they lost everything, but if they was able to help other people they was doing it.”David Lohr reported from Baton Rouge.

Now this. It’s all been back-to-back,” said Baton Rouge nurse Aron Coates, who came to the makeshift shelter at Celtic Studios to offer assistance to flood evacuees. Coates was among several people The Huffington Post interviewed Monday at the Baton Rouge movie warehouse-turned-shelter and the surrounding area where an estimated 3,000 people are being housed. Local media has dubbed the disaster “The Great Flood of 2016,” while the Red Cross said it’s undergoing the largest relief effort since Hurricane Sandy.Like many of her fellow Baton Rougeans, Coates is alarmed at the flood’s devastation and exhausted to see the area and its people beset by yet another tragedy in a matter of months. The mid-August floods mark the second time in 2016 the state had seen more than 24 inches of rainfall from a single event. In March, historic floods hit Louisiana, overflowing rivers and swallowing up homes.In early July, a Baton Rouge police officer was caught on video violently shooting Alton Sterling, a black Baton Rouge man who was selling CDs in front of a friend’s convenience store. Sterling’s death prompted days of intense protests against such use of force in a city of historic racial tension where some residents say police treat the black community like second class citizens.Less than two weeks later, a Missouri man killed three Baton Rouge-area police in an ambush-style attack and prompted another period of mourning in the community. Racial inequality has been a thread woven through many of the state’s recent tragedies, be they natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina or police killings of black, and often poor, residents. Several evacuees who spoke to HuffPost expressed hope that amid the devastation from the deadly floods, residents could find common ground. “What’s happening now is a very tragic thing,” Coates said. “But it’s like Mother Nature is trying to purge everything out and bring us together.” “Right now people aren’t concerned about black versus white,” she added. “We’re all just trying to survive and get everybody back on their feet. So it kind of washed all that away. ...I think in the long run it will be a healing thing.”Pat Payne, 61, has lived in Baton Rouge since 1993. She and her husband, Brian, were staying at the shelter after losing everything in the flood. “There’s nothing left,” Payne said. “What you see on our backs is it.The flooding started Sunday morning when Brian told her water was coming onto their yard.“Then the next thing we knew it was in our house. Everything is ruined. They had to come get us by boat,” she said. Now, the couple plans to leave to stay with friends. “As bad as it is, everybody is coming together and helping each other by doing what they can. It’s good ― it’s good to see that.”Payne noted a Facebook comment Montrell Jackson ― one of the slain Baton Rouge police officers ― made before he was killed. “He said ‘Please don’t let hate infect your heart.’ I hope he’s looking down and seeing that hate is not infecting our hearts.”Ellen Anderson, 55, who has lived in Baton Rouge for two decades said that she, like the Paynes, has lost everything in this flood. Anderson had been living with her son and daughter-in-law.While Anderson was able to escape, her son has been trapped in the home since Thursday. “There was water up to the ceiling. We’re still waiting on them to rescue my son. The water is so high they can’t rescue him,” Anderson said. The current devastation has her looking at recent events differently now. “I think what has happened here is God is letting everybody know that he rules this country,” she said. “Ain’t no white lives matter or black lives matter. Everybody’s lives matter. This disaster shows us all that.”She added, “We’re all together here now and we have to love everybody. We can’t hate nobody.”Like many of her neighbors, Leslie James, a lifelong resident of Baton Rouge, said she’s been overwhelmed by recent events and now the flood. The 55-year-old said despite all of it, her faith has kept her going. “It’s a lot to deal with. We have seen so much division lately with law enforcement and the residents of this city and now this. It can be discouraging, but my faith keeps me encouraged amongst everything else,” James said. “I think this has brought us together the way we used to be. We care about each other, we look out for each other and we’re there for each other,” she continued. “I hope and pray people will continue to come together and that the leaders of the city, state and country will provide us with the necessary help we need to move on with our lives.”The floodwaters that engulfed 54-year-old Elnora Patterson’s house were unlike anything the lifelong Baton Rouge resident said she’s ever seen. “The water was up to the tip of the stop sign on my street. I kept saying, ‘Lord when is this rain going to stop?’ It was nonstop.”The epic floods felt to her like “God is trying to tell us something.” “It’s time for everyone to get their act together.

18,POLITICS,North Carolina Took 17 Days To Ask Supreme Court To Rescue Its Voter ID Law,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-voter-id-law-supreme-court_us_57b23f3ce4b0863b0284666a,But the state says it wants the court to act quickly to avoid confusion come Election Day.,2016-08-16,"North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory called his state's voter ID law ""a model"" among the states. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit did not agree, and the state now wants the Supreme Court to address the matter.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b23fcd170000ae02c7353c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The state of North Carolina on Monday filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court so that it can enforce a broad set of voting restrictions that an appeals court in July called one of the worst “since the era of Jim Crow.”That ruling was significant because it found that North Carolina lawmakers purposefully targeted African-American voters, leading the court to invalidate the law in full ― including the voter ID provision and those restricting early voting, same-day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting.North Carolina said that restoring some of these requirements will minimize confusion on Election Day.“Maintaining the status quo ... and permitting this year’s general election to proceed under the same rules as this year’s primary election will avoid voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls,” the state’s lawyer, Paul Clement, a former solicitor general who specializes in Supreme Court practice, wrote in the petition.Notably, Clement didn’t ask the high court to reinstate the provisions eliminating same-day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting ― which means that North Carolina voters who intend to rely on those measures will have them at their disposal on Nov. 8.“This is a big win for plaintiffs” challenging the North Carolina law, wrote Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who specializes in voting rights and election law.But as Hasen noted, the timing of Monday’s petition seems to belie its “emergency” nature, since the original ruling was issued 17 days ago and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) had vowed to be more timely in asking the high court to intervene ― a delay that may tell the justices the state may not really be in a big rush.In a statement, McCrory didn’t address the delay but said the state’s voter ID law remained “a model” among the states, and that allowing the ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to keep it on hold will bring confusion at the polls.“The Fourth Circuit’s ruling is just plain wrong and we cannot allow it to stand,” McCrory said. “We are confident that the Supreme Court will uphold our state’s law and reverse the Fourth Circuit.”But maybe the Fourth Circuit will have the last word. Days after the court’s sweeping ruling striking down North Carolina’s voting restrictions, the state reassured the court that it could comply with its mandate ahead of the election ― which the court saw as a sign that the state was ready to move on.“Because of these assurances, we are confident that North Carolina can conduct the 2016 election in compliance with our injunction,” the Fourth Circuit said earlier this month.The state will need to convince at least five justices that its voting law is worth saving."
19,THE WORLDPOST,Explorers In Poland Are Digging For Legendary Nazi Gold,Jesselyn Cook,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nazi-gold-train_us_57b33fb6e4b0863b0284f882,They're hunting for a treasure-filled train that is rumored to have disappeared in a secret tunnel at the end of World War II.,2016-08-16,Explorers are searching for a Nazi train loaded with looted treasure that is believed to have vanished en-route to Berlin in southwestern Poland at the end of the Second World War.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b37fe51700009504c73995.jpeg?cache=GHzyzBabSs&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rumor has it, a Nazi train loaded with looted gems and treasure vanished en-route to Berlin in southwestern Poland at the end of the Second World War, though many experts dispute its existence. In the midst of international speculation and intrigue, two explorers are literally digging their way to the truth.Piotr Koper of Poland and Andreas Richter of Germany believe the mysterious train was hidden from the Soviet Red Army in a secret tunnel constructed by Nazis near the Polish city of Walbrzych. Soil anomalies detected in the area with radar equipment last year indicate its presence, they claim.Geological experts from Krakow’s AGH University of Science and Technology found no evidence of the train when searching with magnetic equipment, the Associated Press reports, but their findings did conclude that there may in fact be a tunnel located at the site of Koper and Richter’s privately-funded excavation.The pair began the treasure hunt on Tuesday with a team of researchers and volunteers, despite warnings that it could be a pointless mission. “There may be a tunnel. There is no train,” said Prof. Janusz Madej of the university in Krakow, who was involved in the study.In contrast to Madej’s assertion, search committee spokesperson Andrzej Gaik said Tuesday that if the tunnel exists, “there should be a train there.”“The train is not a needle in the haystack; if there is one, we will find it,” he added. “It’s so exciting and we count on success.”While skeptics believe the latest search efforts are a waste of time, Polish media have reported that up to 300 tons of gold could be aboard the train, the Washington Post notes.Koper and Richter believe the dig will take less than two weeks, meaning an end to the decades-long mystery could be in sight."
20,BUSINESS,Who's Responsible For What Happens To Your Broken iPhone? Some Say Apple.,Andy Campbell and Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/apple-recycle-iphone_us_57b3403ce4b0a8e1502583be,A new six-country survey finds many consumers want tech companies to be responsible for helping them recycle.,2016-08-16,"Apple has touted its recycling work, and the company does make a real effort on the issue. But critics say it could do more.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b3487f170000ae02c73834.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The tech giants that manufacture mobile phones should provide the means for consumers to recycle old devices, according to a survey released Monday of about 6,000 people in six countries.The research, conducted by independent polling service Ipsos MORI on behalf of Greenpeace’s East Asia branch, polled adults in China, South Korea, Germany, Mexico, Russia and the United States. Nearly half of respondents overall agreed that it’s up to companies ― as opposed to the government or network providers, for example ― to help consumers recycle their devices. Many manufacturers, like Apple, do give consumers those means. But their practices aren’t perfect.More than half of respondents also said companies are releasing new phone models too quickly. Environmental groups argue that the constant stream of upgrades encourages people to buy a new device instead of repairing their existing ones. As a result, tossed-out iPhones and Androids make up much of the 3 million metric tons of hazardous electronic waste generated each year, according to a 2014 study by the United Nations.“The humble smartphone puts enormous strain on our environment from the moment they are produced ― often with hazardous chemicals ― to the moment they are disposed of in huge e-waste sites,” Chih An Lee, a campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia, said in a statement. “Over half of respondents across the countries surveyed agree that manufacturers are releasing too many new models, many designed to only last a few years.”Issues with recycling modern electronics aren’t new: Tech companies across the board appear to be focusing on smaller, slimmer products over recyclability, as The Huffington Post reported in June.For example, many of Apple’s designs for iPads, MacBooks and iPhones make it hard ― and even impossible ― to repair them or recycle them safely. The company has been fighting a secret war in the states over legislation that would force it to hand over schematics and instructions ― and, much to Apple’s chagrin, proprietary information ― to recyclers.And while Apple offers refurbished models of its products and has a recycling process in place, the company has long been against third-party repair shops. There’s also little way of knowing whether your iProduct is being recycled responsibly in the first place.Apple didn’t return a request for comment, but the company has maintained its dedication to recycling programs. It told HuffPost this year that it helps recycle millions of pounds of electronics equipment every year. Samsung, the world’s biggest smartphone manufacturer, also did not respond to a request for comment.The inability of the average consumer to recycle or repair their devices in the way they want, along with an ever-increasing frequency of new products, helps create a consumer base that’s more likely to buy a new item than go through the process of recycling. But surveyed consumers seem keen on that option.Greenpeace’s answer to the problem is the same one HuffPost has reported on for months: We need products with a design that allows for recycling in the first place.“The new product design,” the Greenpeace report concludes, “should take recycling into consideration from the beginning of the production phase, using the recycled materials instead of virgin materials, and making the products easier to be dismantled at the end.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said Apple is fighting in court against legislation that would force it to hand over schematics and instructions to recyclers. It is lobbying state legislatures on the issue."

The’ve committed to making about 5,000 meals a day for homeless people and other groups in need, according to Reuters. Olympic village is a pretty auspicious spot for collecting foodstuffs. The chefs there are tasked with feeding 18,000 athletes, coaches and officials, and use about 250 tons of raw ingredients for each meal, according to The New York Times. The program will continue through the Paralympics, which start Sept 7.The delicious idea was cooked up by famed Italian chef Massimo Bottura, HuffPost Italy reported. Last year, during Milan’s Universal Exposition, Bottura employed a similar approach to prevent suitable food from the event from ending up in the garbage. He partnered with the Vatican and about 60 acclaimed chefs to launch the Refettorio Amborsiano (Ambrosian Refectory), a dining hall that served leftovers from the Expo to needy people in the city.Bottura and his crew transformed 15 tons of discarded food into delicious dishes and gave them out to homeless people.He got together with David Hertz of Brazil who founded a group that empowers people in need by teaching them to cook.But Bottura told The Times that his initiative isn’t just about rescuing food. It’s about opening up people’s eyes to the world’s global food waste crisis.Up to one third of all food is spoiled or squandered before it’s consumed by people, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. At the 2012 Olympics in London alone, massive amounts of food were wasted. In a single day, one employee claimed to discard 45 pounds of prawns, 30 pounds of fish fillets, 90 pounds of vegetables, and 45 pounds of meat, according to Mother Jones. And while Brazil has made some notable gains in reducing its hunger rates, it hasn’t wiped out the issue.In 2014, the country was removed from the U.N.’s hunger map. The number of undernourished Brazilians had fallen by more than 80 percent in 10 years, the Associated Press reported.In 1992, there were 23 million people living with hunger. A decade later, that figure dropped to 13 million, according to a report released by FAO. To get his project off the ground, Bottura had to first convince the mayor of Rio to provide an empty lot. He then went on to raise $250,000. While donors were generous, the initiative ran over budget and Bottura is now working raise to $190,000, according to The Times.While Bottura may need more funds for the operations, he’s demonstrating how much value can be churned out from what was once considered “garbage.”On Thursday night, for example, guests were treated to a delectable meal that included Italian-style couscous with sautéed beef and panzanella, a Tuscan bread-and-tomato dish.“We mostly hope to become an example for others,” Bottura told HuffPost Italy, “and that work like ours will help favor social integration through a commitment to fighting waste and redistributing resources. We would like to see the commitment to this cultural project expand and multiply all over the world.”"

While donors were generous, the initiative ran over budget and Bottura is now working raise to $190,000, according to The Times.While Bottura may need more funds for the operations, he’s demonstrating how much value can be churned out from what was once considered “garbage.”On Thursday night, for example, guests were treated to a delectable meal that included Italian-style couscous with sautéed beef and panzanella, a Tuscan bread-and-tomato dish.“We mostly hope to become an example for others,” Bottura told HuffPost Italy, “and that work like ours will help favor social integration through a commitment to fighting waste and redistributing resources. We would like to see the commitment to this cultural project expand and multiply all over the world.”"

He denies any involvement.Police began searches in the Uskudar and Umraniye districts of Istanbul, including buildings belonging to an unnamed holding company, the agency said.Since the coup, more than 35,000 people have been detained, of whom 17,000 have been placed under formal arrest, and tens of thousands more suspended in a purge of Turkey’s military, law-and-order, education and justice systems.Erdogan accuses Gulen of harnessing an extensive network of schools, charities and businesses, built up in Turkey and abroad over decades, to infiltrate state institutions and build a “parallel structure” that aimed to take over the country.He vowed this month to cut off the revenues of businesses linked to Gulen, describing them as “nests of terrorism” and promising no mercy in rooting them out.Before the failed coup, in which more than 240 people were killed, the authorities had already seized Islamic lender Bank Asya, taken over or closed several media companies and detained businessmen on allegations of funding the cleric’s movement.As part of the coup investigation, police also searched offices at the main courthouse on the Asian side of Istanbul on Wednesday as they raided the complex with detention warrants for 83 judicial personnel, Anadolu reported.A day earlier police detained at least 136 court staff in raids on three halls of justice, including Turkey’s largest courthouse, on the European side of the city.A former lawmaker from the ruling AK Party, Aydin Biyiklioglu, was also remanded in custody along with seven academics in the Black Sea city of Trazbon as part of the investigation, Anadolu said.

They are due to be sentenced in September and could face a jail sentence of up to 10 years each.Choudary, the former head of the now banned organization al-Muhajiroun, became infamous for praising the men responsible for the 9/11 attacks on the United States and saying he wanted to convert Buckingham Palace into a mosque.Despite his often controversial comments and refusal to condemn attacks by Islamists such as the London 2005 bombings, Choudary has always denied any involvement in militant activity and had never been previously charged with any terrorism offense.Rahman served two years in jail for encouraging followers to kill British and American troops in Afghanistan and Iraq during a protest in 2006.BREEDING GROUND FOR MILITANTSAl-Muhajiroun has been regarded as a breeding ground for militants since it was founded in the late 1990s by Syrian-born Islamist cleric Omar Bakri, who was banished from Britain in 2005, and was banned under anti-terrorist laws in 2010.Police said it was suspected of being the driving force behind the London bombings while Michael Adebolajo, one of the men who hacked to death British soldier Lee Rigby on a London street in 2013, had attended protests Choudary had organized.Last year, the trial of a teenage Muslim convert found guilty of plotting to behead a soldier in London was told he had fallen in with al-Muhajiroun.The group’s influence is said to extend far beyond Britain. Those connected to it include Abu Hamza al-Masri, jailed for life in the United States last year for terrorism-related offenses.Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the gunman who shot and killed a soldier in Canada’s capital and then stormed parliament in 2014, followed Choudary on Twitter, although the preacher told Reuters at the time he had no links to him.“Over and over again we have seen people on trial for the most serious offenses who have attended lectures or speeches given by these men,” Haydon said in a statement.Both Choudary and Rahman say they abide by a “covenant of security” which forbids Muslims from carrying out attacks in non-Muslim lands where their lives and wellbeing are protected.“We’re living in a global community and no doubt Muslims around the world who have their eye on what’s happening in Syria and Iraq or want to know about the sharia (law) will come across us at one point or another,” Choudary told Reuters in 2014.“That does not mean that we’re encouraging people to carry out any acts of terrorism.”"
27,THE WORLDPOST,French Government Defends Towns That Banned Burkinis On Beaches,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/france-defends-burkini-beach-ban_us_57b2f99ae4b0863b02849b0e,An anti-Islamophobic group  has filed a complaint in France's highest administrative court over the decisions.,2016-08-16,"Hundreds walk into the cite des Monts surrounded by policemen in Lupino, Bastia, on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica on Sunday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b2fa36180000ad02bcb004.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government has defended municipal bans on body-covering burkini swimwear but called on mayors to try and cool tensions between communities.Three Mediterranean towns - Cannes, Villeneuve-Loubet and Sisco on the island of Corsica - have banned the clothing garment marketed toward some Muslims, and Le Touquet on the Atlantic coast is planning to do the same.The mainly conservative mayors who have imposed the ban say the garment, which is similar in appearance to a wetsuit, which leaves only the face, hands and feet exposed, defies French laws on secularism.Deadly militant attacks, including bombings and shootings in Paris that killed 130 people last November have raised tensions between communities and made people wary of public places.The socialist government’s minister for women’s rights, Laurence Rossignol, said municipal bans on the burkini should not be seen in the context of terrorism but she supported the bans.“The burkini is not some new line of swimwear, it is the beach version of the burqa and it has the same logic: hide women’s bodies in order to better control them,” Rossignol told French daily Le Parisien in an interview.France, which has the largest Muslim minority in Europe, estimated at 5 million, in 2010 introduced a ban on full-face niqab and burqa veils in public.Rossignol said the burkini had sparked tensions on French beaches because of its political dimension.“It is not just the business of those women who wear it, because it is the symbol of a political project that is hostile to diversity and women’s emancipation,” she said.On Saturday, a brawl broke out between Muslim families and a group of young non-Muslims in Sisco, Corsican, after a tourist took pictures of women bathing in burkinis. The mayor banned burkinis on Monday.Apart from the Paris attacks, a Tunisian deliberately drove a truck into crowds in Nice on July 14, killing 85 people, and a Roman Catholic priest had his throat cut in church by two French Muslims.The string of attacks have made many people jumpy. On Sunday, 41 people were injured in a stampede in the Riviera town of Juan-les-Pins when holiday makers mistook the sound of firecrackers for gunfire.Villeneuve-Loubet mayor Lionnel Luca, member of the hardline Droite Populaire faction of the conservative Les Republicains party, said the burkini was an ideological provocation.“Since the Nice attack, the population is particularly sensitive,” he told Le Parisien.He said the burkini raised hygiene issues and could make rescue at sea more difficult.The advocacy group Collective Against Islamophobia in France on Tuesday filed a complaint against the bans with the Conseil d’Etat, France’s highest administrative court, which is expected to hand down a ruling in the coming days.CCIF spokesman Marwan Muhammad said the bans restricted fundamental liberties and discriminated against Muslim women.“This summer we are witnessing a hysterical political Islamophobia that pits citizens against one another,” he said.Non-Muslims who wear burkinis or garments that are similar to the clothing include some Orthodox Jewish women and those who wish to keep their bodies covered. British celebrity chef Nigella Lawson made headlines when she was photographed wearing a burkini to the beach in Australia."
