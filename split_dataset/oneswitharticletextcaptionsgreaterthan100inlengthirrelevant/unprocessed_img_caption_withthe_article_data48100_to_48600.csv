0,POLITICS,Republican Politicians Downballot Are Better-Liked Than Donald Trump,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-politicians-downballot-are-better-liked-than-trump_us_57bb68e1e4b03d51368a2759,That might not be enough to save them in November.,2016-08-22,"U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) speaks during a session called ""The New Congress"" at the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council meeting in Washington Dec. 2, 2014. Polls show him significantly outperforming Donald Trump in Ohio.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bb6a4b180000ad02bcc610.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Weeks after the party conventions, Donald Trump’s deficit in both national and state-level polls shows no sign of abating. While there’s still time for the race to narrow, the current state of the race raises another question: If he’s still this far behind on Election Day, how will that affect Republicans’ ability to win in other races?Voters in recent years have increasingly tended to select presidential and congressional candidates from the same party. The 2012 election saw fewer than 6 percent of the nation’s congressional districts support different parties for the House than the presidency. In the 81 most competitive House districts, GOP congressional candidates ran on average just 1 point ahead of Mitt Romney, according to Republican pollster Robert Blizzard.Republicans further down the ballot are hoping that won’t be the case this year. To save their Senate majority, they’ll need battleground states to ditch that pattern and split their ticket across party lines, supporting GOP candidates for Senate, even if they prefer Clinton over Trump.There are signs that such a split could play out in some of this year’s marquee races. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) is out-polling Democrat Ted Strickland by 7 points in HuffPost Pollster’s average, despite Clinton’s 2-point edge in the state. In Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, both states where Clinton holds a 7-point lead, incumbents Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) are tied with their Democratic challengers. An exception is Wisconsin, where the relatively scarce recent polling suggests Democrat Russ Feingold’s lead over Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) may be wider than Clinton’s lead over Trump. A new HuffPost/YouGov poll offers another bit of evidence that Trump is under-performing other Republican politicians. Forty-three percent of voters said the Republican candidates running for office in their state were better than Donald Trump, while 12 percent said their state candidates were worse, and 25 percent that they were about the same. (The rest were unsure.)It’s not a new phenomenon for voters to prefer their home-state politicians over the rest of the nation’s officials. Polls have long found, for instance, that Americans like their own representative in the House, even if they think throwing the rest of Congress out would mark a change for the better.But Trump fares notably worse in comparison to other Republicans than Hillary Clinton does compared to other Democratic candidates. Just 31 percent of voters said their state’s Democratic candidates were better than Clinton, while 7 percent said they were worse, and a plurality, 44 percent, that they’re about the same. Forty-eight percent of independent voters said Republican candidates at the state level are better than Trump, while 38 percent said Democratic candidates are better than Clinton.The divide was even starker among members of the candidates’ own parties. Just 17 percent of Democrats said their party’s state-level candidates are better than Clinton; twice as many Republicans, 35 percent, said that other GOP candidates are better than Trump. The question is whether those results are a sign that Trump isn’t dragging down other candidates, or a representation of his potential to do exactly that, especially as House and Senate Democrats seek to link vulnerable rivals to the Trump campaign. Evidence is increasingly pointing to the latter.“Donald Trump’s post-conventions polling slump seems to be having an effect on the Republican Party’s U.S. Senate candidates,” FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten wrote last week, noting that GOP candidates had seen their standings worsen post-convention. “We thought this might happen: There’s been an increasingly strong relationship between how a state votes for president and how it votes for Senate over the past few election cycles. And, indeed, Trump’s tumble has coincided with worsening GOP numbers in key states. It may cost the party the Senate.”HuffPost Pollster’s initial Senate forecast predicts that, were the election held today, Republicans would have just a 22 percent chance of holding on to their Senate majority.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Aug. 11-12 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

1,POLITICS,How Newt Gingrich Is Bringing John McCain's Campaign And Super PAC Together,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-mccain-super-pac_us_57bb58e8e4b0b51733a5124f,Just another tale of super PACs and candidates helping each other.,2016-08-22,A super PAC supporting Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is using material created by his campaign to boost his re-election chances.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bb5a751600002800bfdb32.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When Republican voters in Arizona receive a robocall this week featuring former House Speaker Newt Gingrich endorsing Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), they’ll hear just another example of how super PACs and political candidates take advantage of the loose system of regulations designed to prevent them from coordinating with each other.The robocall comes from Arizona Grassroots Action, a super PAC formed solely to re-elect the 79-year-old senator to a sixth term ― but the audio of Gingrich’s endorsement was actually recorded and posted online by McCain’s official campaign. Gingrich’s Endorsement As Posted By The McCain CampaignPro-McCain Super PAC Using Audio Of Gingrich EndorsementSuper PACs are political committees that can accept unlimited contributions from corporations, unions or individuals so long as they remain independent from political campaigns or parties that they support. This supposed independence has been called into question ever since 2010, the year super PACs were legalized.It is now fairly common practice for super PACs to rebroadcast materials created by the campaigns that they support. Campaigns post stock footage, or b-roll, of candidates interacting with normal people online that super PACs proceed to use in their own ads. There’s the candidate walking with a family ― maybe it’s their own family ― or there’s the candidate wearing protective eyewear while touring a local factory, or there was the brief hilarity of #McConnelling.In this case, the pro-McCain super PAC simply took the audio from an online video shot and posted by the McCain campaign without using the footage.The justification for using the material in this way comes from a limited exception for the republication of campaign materials in news, editorials or commentary to provide a “brief quote of materials that demonstrate a candidate’s position.”The Federal Election Commission has repeatedly deadlocked on how much campaign material super PACs should or shouldn’t be allowed to republish.Campaign finance watchdogs Campaign Legal Center and Democracy 21 have disputed super PACs’ use of b-roll footage originally created by campaigns. In 2014, the two groups filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission against Kentucky Opportunity Coalition, a dark-money nonprofit that supported Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and Senate Majority PAC, the main super PAC supporting Senate Democratic Party candidates.Gingrich’s endorsement is probably intended to help McCain in his primary contest against conservative Kelli Ward on Aug. 30. The winner will face the likely Democratic nominee Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick in the general election."
2,MEDIA,Donald Trump Is Abandoning Every Network But Fox,Michael Calderone and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-fox_us_57bb3ef5e4b0b51733a4f408,Where he's getting a lot of questions about his stamina.,2016-08-22,"Donald Trump has done several interviews in August with Fox News' Sean Hannity, though none with CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, and CBS. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bb448d170000ae02c74b8f.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump, who never seemed to meet a camera he didn’t like, became a constant TV presence throughout the Republican primary, a bonafide celebrity crowding out a field of more conventional senators and governors. He understood the power of the medium, knocking out one TV interview after another before most politicians finished their morning coffee. As Republican standard-bearer, however, Trump has mostly retreated to the relatively cozy confines of Fox News. And it seems to be in response to having badly damaged his own candidacy during a high-profile sit down on another network.On July 31, Trump spoke with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos for an interview on “This Week,” during which he publicly questioned whether the Gold Star mother of a Muslim army officer had been forced into silence because of her religion. Since that attack on the Khan family, Trump hasn’t appeared on the network. Nor has he appeared on any others except Fox News and Fox Business (save for a phone interview with CNBC on Aug. 11).Indeed, the last appearance Trump made on CNN was June 13, according to an official with the cable network. The last time he was on NBC News was July 24, three days after officially becoming the party’s nominee. He hasn’t appeared on MSNBC since a May 20 episode of “Morning Joe,” a show he’s since repeatedly railed against. And he hasn’t been on CBS since July 17, as part of the rollout for vice presidential pick Mike Pence. Since he sat down with Stephanopoulos, however, Trump has appeared at least 11 times on Fox News. That includes three interviews with Sean Hannity, his top TV booster who has also recently amplified conspiracy theories about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton’s health. Hannity, who admits to privately advising Trump, told The New York Times Sunday that he “never claimed to be a journalist.” Among those 11 interviews was a sit down on Aug. 12 with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who was filling in for Hannity and who mentioned at the beginning of the interview that he was “not pretending or even playing the role of a journalist.”“Well, that’s good,” Trump responded. “I like that.”Once on Fox News, Trump seems to get easy set-ups about his fitness for office. Take Huckabee, for example, who told the Republican nominee that his “stamina is pretty amazing.”“You’re doing events starting early in the morning. Wednesday night, we didn’t finish dinner until well after midnight. And I’ve watched you through this process. Where do you get that stamina to do this?” the former Arkansas governor asked. Five days later, host Ainsley Earhardt had a similar question when speaking to Trump before he appeared at a Hannity-hosted town hall. “How do you have the stamina to keep going and going and going?” she asked. “You’ve only taken two days off this month, Hillary’s taken seven days off.”Days later, Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro ― apparently unsatisfied with Trump’s first two replies ― began an interview in similar fashion. “You have had a banner week,” she told the candidate. “I don’t know how you do it. But you have given at least four or five major speeches, you have been to Louisiana, you just gave a speech this afternoon.”Trump didn’t offer up any meaningful tips as to how he has so much stamina to keep up a busy campaign schedule, though perhaps cutting down on cable news appearances is one of them. Either way, his retreat to Fox News is a remarkable change in strategic focus, having earlier pledged to win the election based on his skill at generating free media coverage. Trump, of course, has long been a fixture on the conservative-leaning network, having spent three hours and 20 minutes there in June, according to progressive watchdog Media Matters, which was more than he appeared on the other major networks combined. But it appears that he’s now calculated that the risk of venturing too far from the conservative-leaning network is too great. In June, 18 of Trump’s 29 interviews across six networks were on Fox News, according to additional research provided by Media Matters. In July, he did nine interviews on Fox News and just six combined across ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC. None of these networks have had him on in August.For Trump’s supporters, this might be received as good news ― an illustration of a candidate finally recognizing that his freewheeling style carries risk. Ironically, it puts him closer in line to the mindset of the Clinton campaign, which has heavily managed and restricted the former secretary of state’s media availability. UPDATE: Trump, who appeared Monday morning on “Fox & Friends,” will head to “The O’Reilly Factor” Monday night. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Just days after the media heralded a “new Trump” because he said he felt bad for hurting people’s feelings, Donald Trump is back at it again with some mean tweets. Trump tuned into MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Monday and didn’t like what he saw, so he threatened to “tell the real story” about co-hosts Joe Scarborough “and his very insecure long-time girlfriend,” Mika Brzezinski. In another tweet, he called Brzezinski an “off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!”Scarborough responded by tweeting that Trump should look in the mirror. On Thursday, Trump forayed into seeming presidential by expressing contrition apparently for the first time. “Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don’t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing,” he said during a speech in Charlotte, North Carolina. “I have done that. And believe it or not, I regret it. And I do regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.”Although Trump never specified which of his many, many insults he regretted, his shift in tone won him many favorable headlines regarding his latest apparent “pivot.” Monday’s mean tweets show his tendency to return to form.Trump once confessed during a phone interview on “Morning Joe” that he has very thin skin. Arthur Delaney is a co-host of “So That Happened,” the HuffPost Politics podcast:Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) told the State Journal-Register newspaper last week that a $400 million payment to Iran was a “ransom” paid for the release of U.S. prisoners. Kirk said:“We can’t have the president of the United States acting like the drug dealer in chief, giving clean packs of money to a ... state sponsor of terror. Those 500-euro notes will pop up across the Middle East. .... We’re going to see problems in multiple (countries) because of that money given to them.” The Obama administration said the payment was “leverage,” not a ransom. The money was part of a fund Tehran used to purchase U.S. military equipment when the shah was in control of Iran; it was frozen after the Islamic Revolution. The U.S. and Tehran settled a dispute over the money, with Washington agreeing to pay the $400 million, plus $1.3 billion in interest, but delayed that first payment in January by several hours “to retain maximum leverage” until it ensured the release of the prisoners, The New York Times reported. On Twitter, a number of people called out Kirk for using racially charged language to insult the president: Kirk, who is running against Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, withdrew his support for Donald Trump in June. (h/t Raw Story)"
5,POLITICS,Judge Blocks Federal Government From Enforcing Transgender Guidance In Schools Nationwide,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/judge-blocks-transgender-bathroom-law_us_57b4932fe4b04ff88399dd0d,A Texas-led coalition of states said the initiative is an exercise in federal overreach.,2016-08-22,"The Harrold Independent School District -- which has 100 students, none of whom is transgender -- is the unlikely battleground over whether U.S. schools must provide bathroom rights to transgender students.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal court late Sunday night barred the Obama administration from enforcing a broad set of guidelines instructing states and localities on how to accommodate transgender students attending public schools ― including their need to use restrooms that align with their gender identity.U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, of the Northern District of Texas, enjoined the policies nationally and blocked the federal government from conducting any litigation or attempting to bring school districts in compliance with them.The guidelines, released jointly by the Departments of Justice and Education in May, were an effort to extend existing civil rights protections to transgender students, who often face barriers locally that stigmatize them, including harassment by classmates or incorrect record-keeping by school administrators.“Taken together, we hope these new resources provide clarity for everyone ― from state and local leaders to educators to students and families ― about how to create a safe, welcoming and supportive learning environment for every student,” Vanita Gupta and Catherine Lhamon, the civil rights heads at DOJ and DOE who addressed the guidelines to school districts nationwide, said at the time. But weeks after the move, Texas led a group of 13 states in suing the federal government to stop its implementation, arguing that the Obama administration was overstepping its authority under Title IX, one of a number of anti-discrimination statutes that courts and the government have read to cover gender identity discrimination.“These new mandates, putting the federal government in the unprecedented position of policing public school property and facilities ... run roughshod over clear lines of authority, local policies, and unambiguous federal law,” the states said in a July motion seeking a nationwide injunction against the federal guidance.O’Connor’s ruling agreeing to the injunction is meant to ease fears that the guidance would disrupt the coming school year in Texas, which kicked off Monday.Dena Iverson, a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice, said in a short statement that the government is disappointed in the ruling and is considering its next steps.Under Title IX, every state and locality that receives federal funding for schools must agree to abide by it. Congress specifically designed the law to prevent sex discrimination in education settings, but a series of rulings and regulations have interpreted it to also cover discrimination against transgender individuals.Texas and other states ― including North Carolina, which is embroiled in its own legal battle with DOJ over a controversial anti-trans bathroom law ― have argued that this interpretation goes beyond what the law says, presenting them with a “Hobson’s choice” between compliance or risking losing millions in federal funding.“The Joint Letter is an unlawful attempt to rewrite the terms attached to Title IX monies,” wrote the attorneys general for the states in their July motion. “Because Congress did not provide clear notice that funds subject to Title IX were linked to an ‘all comers’ restroom and intimate areas policy — and in fact allowed separate-sex facilities — the Joint Letter is unconstitutional.”O’Connor did not go that far in his ruling, but stated that the Obama administration nonetheless should have gone through the proper administrative channels ― including a period of notice and comment for the public ― before sending them to states and localities.“Permitting the definition of sex to be defined in this way would allow Defendants to create de facto new regulation by agency action without complying with the proper procedures,” O’Connor said.But critics of Texas’ legal tactics ― which resemble its lawsuit against the Obama administration over its executive actions on immigration ― say that the state manufactured a controversy where there was none.A day after the states announced their lawsuit, The Texas Tribune reported that the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) had actually shopped around an anti-trans bathroom policy to a small Texas school district. That district would later become the nominal plaintiff in the lawsuit.Joining Texas in its legal efforts are the states of Alabama, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Tennessee, Arizona, Maine, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Utah, Georgia, Mississippi and Kentucky. Ten other states, led by Nebraska, are seeking similar relief in a separate lawsuit.Paxton, who led the effort, was pleased with the issuance of the injunction, which he said is a response to the Obama administration “attempting to rewrite the laws enacted by the elected representatives of the people.”“That cannot be allowed to continue, which is why we took action to protect States and School Districts, who are charged under state law to establish a safe and disciplined environment conducive to student learning,” Paxton said in a statement Monday.The American Civil Liberties Union and its local Texas chapter, plus Lambda Legal, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the Transgender Law Center, and GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders issued a joint statement condemning how the injunction could affect transgender students. The groups had filed a legal brief in the case in support of the government.“A ruling by a single judge in one circuit cannot and does not undo the years of clear legal precedent nationwide establishing that transgender students have the right to go to school without being singled out for discrimination,” the groups said, adding that the decision “targets a small, vulnerable group of young people ― transgender elementary and high school students ― for potential continued harassment, stigma and abuse.”The administration is expected to seek an emergency stay of O’Connor’s order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which could then lead to a further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.Earlier this month, the high court stepped into the debate over transgender rights and bathroom access when it agreed to temporarily put on hold a ruling in favor of a trans student in Virginia who sued his school district after it enacted a policy limiting bathroom use according to each person’s biological sex.This post has been updated with more details from the ruling and responses to the injunction."

A new study shows that repetitive texting and gaming is making millennials physically weaker.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b75c331700001108c74496.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If your phone is permanently affixed to your hand, we have some bad news. A new study published in the Journal of Hand Therapy found that millennials’ hand grips are getting weaker, especially in men, due to all that texting, scrolling and gaming on their smartphones, according to study coauthor Elizabeth Fain, an assistant professor of occupational therapy at Winston-Salem State University.Fain and coauthor Cara Weatherford, a student at the time of the study who is now an occupational therapist in pediatrics, measured participants’ grip strength and “lateral pinch strength,” or with how much force a person can push his thumb into his pointer finger. They tested a group of 237 healthy people (83 men and 154 women) between the ages of 20 and 34, then compared their findings to data taken from a similar group in 1985. Fain and Weatherford found that the entire group of men had both weaker grips and weaker lateral pinches, while the same was true for women between the ages of 20 and 30. Women between 30 and 34 did not exhibit weaker grips or lateral pinches, which Fain attributes to their status as “millennial outliers.”“[They] have not been as fully immersed in the technology typically, therefore [they’re] more likely to be engaged in more physically demanding tasks/roles,” she said.In other words, the eldest female millennials don’t have the same tech habits as their male counterparts and younger members of their generation.Not only is grip important for everyday life, it is also used as an indicator for overall fitness and a potential predictor of health problems and disabilities, Fain explained. In fact, research has even found that a weak grip could be a harbinger of higher mortality rates. A 2015 study published in the journal Lancet found that a lack of grip strength is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality around the world.But this study doesn’t necessarily mean that millennials are at greater risk for health problems. Instead, researchers may need to update what is considered a normal grip strength for a healthy millennial so that doctors can accurately measure grip strength later in life. In one area, the data showed an advantage for millennials, who apparently have stronger thumbs than the older generation. But even this isn’t quite as wonderful as you might think, as the thumb muscles are small, Fain pointed out.“Frequent texting and minimal rest breaks will inflame the small muscles going to the thumb, similar to carpal tunnel,” she said. The most likely risk is for De Quervains tenosynovitis, a painful condition that affects the tendons on your thumb’s side that is onset by repetitive movements in your thumb and wrist, she said.So how much time away from your phone should you get? Fain recommends taking 3- to 5-minute “minibreaks,” warming your thumb up and stretching it into the “L” position, two to three times an hour. If you have tenderness, she recommends using a cold compress until the area is temporarily numb from the ice.And if you’re a Pokemon Go fiend, take note: The next time you fire up your phone and head to the next PokeStop, maybe you don’t try to catch them all. While the study was conducted before Pokemon Go existed, Fain said, your habit isn’t helping. "

Sarah was living at DC's National Airport when an airport employee told her about the transitional home specifically for homeless LGBT youth ages 16 to 24 -- it's the only one of its kind in DC.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b61ee81700001108c74148.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Shelters may soon be safer and more welcoming to homeless people who are transgender. New rules proposed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would allow transgender people to stay in the homeless shelters that correspond to the gender they identify with.“Anybody who is seeking services at a homeless shelter is already in crisis or in need ― and it’s important for them to be treated with dignity and respect,”David Stacy, of LGBT advocacy organization Human Rights Campaign, told The Huffington Post. “A transgender person should have their gender identity recognized and treated appropriately ― and that’s what these regulations do.”The regulations are scheduled to be finalized in September, according to The Hill, and would apply only to shelters that receive federal funding from HUD.Department representatives declined to comment until after the rule is finalized. Current regulations on housing protections for LGBT people were established in 2012 and prohibit shelters from turning away someone because they are transgender, but those rules don’t explicitly say you have to house people according to their gender identity, according to Stacy. The new proposed regulations build off guidelines that HUD issued to shelters last year specifying that transgender people should be allowed access to shelters based on the gender they identify with. But while guidelines are informal ― and it’s up to shelters whether to follow them ― the new regulations would be mandatory and enforceable, according to Stacy. According to a 2011 survey of transgender and gender non-conforming people, a full 42 percent of respondents who had stayed in homeless shelters had been forced to stay in facilities designated for the wrong gender ― and more than half said they had been harassed by shelter staff or residents. The new proposed rules specify that if a transgender person seeking shelter voices where they would feel safest to stay, that choice should be respected, according to Stacy. This means that if a transgender man goes to a sex-segregated shelter and doesn’t feel safe staying with men, the shelter would work with them to figure out a safe housing situation. The proposed regulations have provoked backlash from some conservative organizations.“Why do you have to force other people to feel really uncomfortable, and in some cases unsafe, just to make your political point?” Tim Wildmon, president of the conservative American Family Association, told The Hill. LGBT advocates do not agree that the safety of others would be threatened by transgender people accessing spaces corresponding with their gender identity. “There’s not a real problem here,” Stacy said. “Any person can pose a threat to others, and nothing in these regulations says you can’t deal with appropriate threats. If there are concerns about someone that are not based on factors related to their gender, but based on relevant factors, such as them being violent, those criteria still apply, and they apply equally to all people.” While the proposed regulations would mark a positive step for transgender rights, Stacy would like to see them expanded even further, to apply not just to federally funded shelters but also to state-funded facilities, as well. “The regulations are a best practice for any provider,” Stacy said. “The best way for shelters to achieve their mission of getting more homeless people off the street is to treat transgender people seeking shelter with full respect and dignity.”"

The comments came a day after Duterte lashed out at the United Nations for criticizing the wave of deaths.As recently as Sunday, the number of suspected drug traffickers killed in Duterte’s war on drugs had been put at about 900 by Philippine officials. But this number included people who died since Duterte won the May 9 presidential election.Duterte said in a bizarre and strongly worded late-night news conference on Sunday the Philippines might leave the United Nations and invite China and others to form a new global forum, accusing it of failing to fulfill its mandate. However, his foreign minister, Perfecto Yasay, said on Monday the Philippines would remain a U.N. member and described the president’s comments as expressions of “profound disappointment and frustration.”“We are committed to the U.N. despite our numerous frustrations and disappointments with the international agency,” Yasay told a news conference.Last week, two U.N. human rights experts urged Manila to stop the extra-judicial executions and killings.Yasay said Duterte has promised to uphold human rights in the fight against drugs and has ordered the police to investigate and prosecute offenders. He criticized the U.N. rapporteurs for “jumping to an arbitrary conclusion that we have violated human rights of people.”“It is highly irresponsible on their part to solely rely on such allegations based on information from unnamed sources without proper substantiation,” he said of the United Nations.Senator Leila de Lima, a staunch critic of the president, started a two-day congressional inquiry into the killings on Monday, questioning top police and anti-narcotics officials to explain the “unprecedented” rise in killings.“I am disturbed that we have killings left and right as breakfast every morning,” she said.“My concern does not only revolve around the growing tally of killings reported by the police. What is particularly worrisome is that the campaign against drugs seems to be an excuse for some law enforcers and other elements like vigilantes to commit murder with impunity,” De Lima said.(Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)"

Even for us, the experienced surgeons, it was frightening.”When confronted by doctors, the man, identified by the Times of India as a police head constable, admitted to his guilty pleasure.“I don’t know why I used to swallow knives,” he told CNN. “I just enjoyed its taste and I was addicted.”Doctors spent about two days carefully planning the operation, so as not to harm the patient. Once they were finished, they displayed a tabletop full of blades. Some were open, and others were closed. Some were even rusted and broken, Malhotra said.The man has since vowed not to continue his secret sideshow meal.Once he is healed, he will receive psychiatric care as well.Though it’s not clear what condition he may have, others who have felt the urge to eat non-food items are said to suffer from an eating disorder called pica, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.Such people have been featured in TLC’s popular show “My Strange Addiction.” The series has included people eating glass, household cleaners and toilet paper."

Towns across the country declared Tragically Hip days.“Farewell to Canada’s greatest rock band,” The Toronto Star newspaper said in a headline on Friday.The band’s last hometown show in Kingston, Ontario, has been billed as a national celebration. It was broadcast live, with bars and outdoor venues across the country hosting public viewings.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has said Downie had “been writing Canada’s soundtrack for more than 30 years,” was at the show.Trudeau told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp at the event he became a fan of the band in university and called it “an inevitable and essential part of what we are and who we are as a country.”Downie, known for his frenetic stage presence and telling long stories in the middle of songs, has maintained his pace during the tour, clad in custom-made bright metallic suits.The tour sold out stadiums across the country in minutes, prompting controversy about ticket resellers. Tickets for Saturday’s show went for upwards of $1,000 on ticket reseller StubHub on Friday.Trudeau was offered tickets by the band and will pay for them, his spokesman said.Formed in the 1980s with roots in blues and rock, the Tragically Hip found radio popularity on both classic and alternative rock stations. A slew of singles became radio fixtures, while the band’s 14 albums nabbed numerous awards.The band’s well-known lyrics often make intrinsically Canadian references, such as to the 1972 hockey series between Canada and the Soviet Union.“There is a Canadianness that runs through them to the point where new citizens should be given a Tragically Hip CD after they take the oath,” said Alan Cross, a radio show host and music historian who called Downie “the rock and roll poet laureate of Canada.”"

Then President Abd-Rabbu Mansur Hadi moved to Aden, backed by military support from Saudi Arabia. What started as an insurgency quickly escalated into full conflict, with more than 2.5 million people displaced inside the country and no sign of an approaching peace.Yemeni Community was originally set up as a business enterprise for Yemeni immigrants coming to Somaliland. It has since pivoted to become a support network for the refugees, and Foazi says some of the support comes from his own pocket. “This came all of a sudden and we didn’t want to refuse help,” he said.Now Foazi lives in a rambling house with two bathrooms and a flat-screen TV in Hargeisa with 22 other family members. He managed to organize passage for his own family, as well as his brother’s and aunt’s families. His brother was employed as an engineer in Yemen.There are international and local security concerns that the influx from Yemen may be used as a cover for members of terror groups to enter the Horn of Africa, where Somali extremists al-Shabaab are already active.“We’re between Shabaab, ISIS and al-Qaida,” says Ali Yusef. “So we worry about who is coming, and if they are from a fundamentalist group.”So far, it appears that most of the refugees and returnees are traumatized civilians – many families with young children like Salim, 13, who saw his friend’s face blown off when he picked up a grenade while the two were playing. Salim’s mother, Daifa, holds back tears as she explains that her son has not been the same since the incident.

Some of those who were suspended decried the weight-loss edict as “humiliating” and “scandalous.” The Women’s Centre for Guidance and Legal Awareness, a women’s rights advocate, called the suspensions “a form of violence against women,” in a Facebook post translated by the BBC.Khadija Khatab, one of the women who was suspended, said she believes her looks represent the average woman in her country.“I believe I am an ordinary Egyptian woman who looks normal, and I don’t wear too much makeup,” Khatab said, according to The New York Times.Khatab said she believes the suspensions are more about her superiors’ fears about the news the women anchors presented than their weight.“It is just an attempt to get rid of the successful [presenters] and retain others who present programs that have no strong content,” Khatab told newspaper Al Watan, according to Gulf News.Ironically, Safaa Hegazy, director of the Egyptian Radio and Television Union, is a woman and a former news anchor herself.Some women who work in Egypt’s media industry said they support the weight-loss edict. Alaa el-Sadani, a commentator at the newspaper Al-Ahram, said she was “sickened by the disgusting and repulsive” appearance of the suspended anchors, The New York Times reported.And Fatma al-Sharawi, a journalist at Al-Ahram, said she thinks the policy should also be expanded to include local TV stations, according to the BBC.But eight anchors were getting widespread support on social media, especially outside of Egypt.Some Egyptian men also supported the suspended women. Sayyid Hegazy, a journalist and member of the Egyptian parliament who is not related to Safaa Hegazy, asked the Sada al-Balad news website, “Who is an ideal weight in Egypt?” Hegazy added that a presenter “might be a little overweight, but she is eloquent.”No plans have been announced to apply a weight standard to Egypt’s male broadcasters."

Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan made their first cash infusion into their for-profit charitable group, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI). On Wednesday and Thursday they sold 767,905 shares they had transferred to the organization, which was worth about $95 million, according to CNN Money. A spokesperson for CZI declined to specify to The Huffington Post what projects the recent transaction will fund. Zuckerberg and Chan announced the launch of CZI in December in a letter to their newborn daughter, Max. The couple pledged to give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares ― or around $45 billion ― to the cause. “For your generation to live in a better world, there is so much more our generation can do,” Zuckerberg wrote in the letter. “Today your mother and I are committing to spend our lives doing our small part to help solve these challenges.”The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s investments will focus on education, curing diseases, and community building, according to the group’s website. The initiative, formed as a limited liability company (LLC), is able to fund nonprofits, as well as make private investments and political donations.The group’s first major investment, made in June, was to fund start-up Andela, a group that trains and recruits software developers in Africa. “We live in a world where talent is evenly distributed, but opportunity is not,” Zuckerberg said in a statement in June. “Andela’s mission is to close that gap.” This influx of cash may only be a drop in the bucket for Zuckerberg. He can give away up to $1 billion per year for the next three years, according to the December announcement."

Pyongyang sees them as invasion preparation.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States and South Korea kicked off annual military exercises on Monday, prompting warnings of retaliation from the North, as already-heightened tension on the peninsula has been inflamed by the defection of a Pyongyang diplomat.North Korea has become further isolated after a January nuclear test, its fourth, and the launch of a long-range rocket in February brought tightened U.N. Security Council sanctions that Pyongyang defied with several ballistic missile launches.About 25,000 U.S. troops are joining in the Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise, which runs until Sept 2. The U.S.-led U.N. Command Military Armistice Commission said it notified the North Korean army the exercises were “non-provocative” in nature.The North calls the exercises preparations for invasion, and early on Monday threatened a pre-emptive nuclear strike. North Korea frequently makes such threats.“From this moment, the first-strike combined units of the Korean People’s Army keep themselves fully ready to mount a preemptive retaliatory strike at all enemy attack groups involved in Ulji Freedom Guardian,” a KPA spokesman said in a statement carried by the North’s state-run KCNA news agency.“The nuclear warmongers should bear in mind that if they show the slightest sign of aggression, it would turn the stronghold of provocation into a heap of ashes through a Korean-style preemptive nuclear strike.”Last week, South Korea announced that Thae Yong Ho, the North’s deputy ambassador in London, had defected and arrived in the South with his family, in an embarrassing blow to the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.High-level defections pointed to cracks in the Kim regime, South Korean President Park Geun-hye said on Monday.“Recently even North Korea’s elite group is collapsing, followed by key figures defecting to foreign countries, showing a sign of serious cracks, with chances of shaking the regime further,” she told a National Security Council meeting.Thae’s defection followed the flight to Seoul this year of 12 waitresses from a North Korean restaurant in China.On Monday, North Korea’s Red Cross sent a letter to its South Korean counterpart asking for the women to be sent back, saying they had been kidnapped by the South, according to KCNA. South Korea denies they were kidnapped.North and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty."

22,TECH,3 Enlightening Charts Explain How Men Took Over Tech,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-men-took-over-tech_us_57bb3ac4e4b03d513689e0e4,"Incredibly, there are fewer women in tech now than in 1990.",2016-08-22,"At this point, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is essentially the embodiment of the ideal tech worker",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bb43141600002800bfdac1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Men have always held the majority of tech jobs in the United States, but in 1990 it looked like women were making headway. Women held 31 percent of all tech jobs back then, a percentage that was steadily rising, according to a new report from the United States Census Bureau.Then the industry boomed. The number of jobs in information technology increased tenfold to 4.6 million between 1970 and 2014. Thanks to the internet, the number of different types of jobs exploded. Pay grew, too.And something funny happened. The percentage of women in tech declined. By 2014, just a quarter of these workers were women. That’s despite the fact that increasing numbers of women were joining the U.S. workforce.What’s up? A lot has been written already about a long-standing bias against women in tech that starts when girls are young and never really stops.But, to paraphrase the Republican candidate for president: Something else is going on. When a career becomes more prestigious, women don’t fare very well.Claire Cain Miller wrote about this in The New York Times earlier this year. But she focused on the opposite end: When women enter male-dominated fields, she reported, pay in that field declines. When more women started working in recreation (parks or camps) between 1950 and 2000, hourly wages fell 57 percent, according to a study she cites in the article. When a job becomes dominated by women, “It just doesn’t look like it’s as important to the bottom line or requires as much skill, ” Paula England, a sociology professor at New York University, told the Times. “Gender bias sneaks into those decisions.”The reverse also holds, as the story noted at the time. When men enter female-dominated fields, pay in that field rises. In the case of IT workers, women never were a majority, yet as the number of jobs grew and the prestige of the industry increased, more men came on board and essentially took over. The percentage of women in IT fell.So, to sum up: When women enter a field, its perceived value suffers a decline; when men enter a field, it grows in prestige. Gradually, the image of the ideal tech worker has become that of a white guy in a hoodie working nonstop at a computer. Women have become increasingly alienated from that scenario.H/T Fast Company"

The emergence of the photographs has raised questions about her biography and about her immigration status when she began working in the U.S.Donald Trump, who has railed against undocumented immigrants throughout his campaign, said on Aug. 9 that his wife would hold a news conference “over the next couple of weeks” to address her compliance with immigration laws. No news conference has been scheduled. The Daily Mail report also included recent claims in Slovenian magazine Suzy that Paolo Zampolli, who ran the modeling agency that employed Melania Trump early in her career, also ran a high-end escort service. Zampolli denied the allegations as “f****** rubbish” to the Daily Mail. (Zampolli is known for playing a role in Melania Trump’s earlier career, telling this reporter that he brought her to the U.S. as a young model in 1996.) Melania Trump, a Slovenia native, married Donald Trump in 2005. She isn’t nearly as prolific on Twitter as her husband, but tweeted apologies Monday by other sites that aired the rumors. A Daily Mail spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Harder has been in the headlines lately for another high-profile legal fight with a media company. He represented wrestler Terry Bollea (aka Hulk Hogan) in his $140 million invasion-of-privacy case against Gawker Media, a lawsuit funded by Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel that effectively killed the site Gawker.com on Monday.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

That’s a disastrous result for the $100 million production, putting “Ben-Hur” in the ranks of the summer’s biggest flops.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount co-produced the remake of Lew Wallace’s novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ; the book was the basis for the 1959 blockbuster that followed Charlton Heston into the arena. Here Jack Huston took the reins as a Jewish prince who must exact his revenge after his adopted brother (Toby Kebbell) betrays him.“This is the bomb of the summer,” said Jeff Bock, a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations. “They went big and they went home.”Although MGM put up roughly 80% of the budget for the film, its failure will be felt at Paramount. The studio has had a bad streak at the box office of late, fielding duds such as “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows” and “Zoolander 2.” That’s not the only source of strife. Its parent company, Viacom, has been engulfed in an epic corporate struggle pitting CEO Philippe Dauman over the Redstone family, the media conglomerate’s controlling stakeholders. That issue, at least, is moving towards a resolution, as Viacom announced this weekend that Dauman was stepping down from atop the company and will be replaced on an interim basis by COO Thomas Dooley.“Ben-Hur’s” backers aggressively courted the Christian community, doing outreach to pastors and holding taste-maker screenings for religious leaders. The studios also hoped that producers Mark Burnett and Roma Downey, who earned devout points with “Son of God” and the mini-series “The Bible,” would help them turn out values audiences. Instead, “Ben-Hur” trailed the $47 million debut of “Noah” and the $24 million launch of “Exodus: Gods and Kings,” two recent Biblical epics that lacked a heavenly touch.“Ben-Hur” drew a crowd that was 51% female and 94% over the age of 25. It also did well in the South and Southwest, areas that are more religious, but did not do as well in more secular regions of the country such as the Northeast and the West Coast.The film, it seems, could not expand beyond its core Christian audience. Paramount Vice-Chairman Rob Moore noted that “Ben-Hur” is the latest in a string of remakes and sequels such as “Independence Day: Resurgence” and “Ghostbusters” to have failed to draw crowds.“It goes to a general trend,” he said. “Audiences are saying, ‘remakes or sequels have got to be great or original if you want us to show up.’”The film could get a lift from overseas’ crowds. “Ben-Hur” picked up $10.7 million in roughly a third of the global markets. Sources believe it could ultimately gross $100 million in foreign territories, which wouldn’t be enough to make its investors whole, but should stop some of the bleeding.With “Ben-Hur” faltering, “Suicide Squad” managed to snag first place for the third consecutive weekend. The story of a band of super villains netted $20.7 million, pushing the Warner Bros. release’s domestic total to $262.3 million. Not adjusted for inflation, the film is the second-highest grossing stateside release of Will Smith’s career, behind “Independence Day’s” $306.2 million haul.“We’re in great shape,” said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros. distribution executive vice president. “We’re well on our way to $300 million domestically.”The weekend also marked the launch of “War Dogs,” an off-beat comedy about weapons dealers, picked up a modest $14.3 million for a fourth-place finish. Warner Bros. backed the project, partly as a show of appreciation for all the money director Todd Phillips minted from “The Hangover” trilogy. It cost north of $45 million to produce, and teams Jonah Hill with Miles Teller. The duo was was tapped to star in roles originally intended for Shia LaBeouf and Jesse Eisenberg. Ticket buyers were 56% male and 51% under the age of 35.“We’re proud of Todd Phillips,” said Goldstein. “He made a fun, smart movie that will leg out over the next few weeks.”With “Ben-Hur” making a bid for religious crowds and “War Dogs” trying to grab adults, Focus Features went after family audiences. The indie label debuted “Kubo and the Two Strings,” an animated story about a boy and a monkey who try to find a magical suit of armor in Ancient Japan. It’s the latest offering from Laika, the makers of “ParaNorman” and “The Boxtrolls.” The film cost between $55 million to $60 million, and brought in $12.6 million in its first weekend for a fourth place finish. That’s on the lighter end of openings for the studio, but the film could be helped by its strong reviews.“[Laika CEO] Travis Knight and his team crafted an extraordinary film and it’s rightly deserving of the tremendous reviews,” said Jim Orr, distribution chief at Focus Features.In its second weekend, Sony’s “Sausage Party” held strong, taking in $15.3 million, a drop of 55% from its debut. That was good enough for runner-up status on the box office charts and pushes the foul-mouthed animated comedy’s domestic haul to $65.3 million.Disney’s “Pete’s Dragon” is currently neck-in-neck with “Ben-Hur” for fifth place. The remake of the 1977 children’s film earned $11.3 million, bringing its stateside total to $42.9 million after two weeks of release.The continued success of “Suicide Squad” and “Sausage Party” lifted overall receipts nearly 25% from the same weekend last year ― a period that saw the release of “Sinister 2” and “Hitman: Agent 47.” Critics have slammed this year’s crop of blockbusters as dull and unimaginative, but ticket sales are closing in on last summer’s results and August receipts should set a record.“This has been a monumental August,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with ComScore. “Normally, summers end with whimper and not a bang.”"

The mother called 911 in a frenzy, searching for her child.“I’m in the river. My boat crashed and I have a baby still in the water. Please God, send someone now,” Tammy Bossard begged a dispatcher in a recording obtained by local station 12 News.Four responding officers jumped into the water and searched for the child, police said. Bossard later told reporters that they could hear her daughter crying, but they couldn’t tell where the sound was coming from. Officers Matt Rush and Police Cpl. Alan Worthy finally found her, in remarkably good condition, after nearly an hour. Police said she had stayed afloat under the overturned boat in a small air pocket. They noted that if she hadn’t been wearing a life jacket she likely would have drowned.Worthy said handing the child over to her mother was unforgettable.“I’ll probably never forget that image of her holding her child out there,” he told reporters at a press conference. “It was a pretty cool experience.”Bossard had her own words for her family’s heroes.“Thank you for saving my baby,” she told WESH-TV. “And saving our world. I can’t imagine. I just can’t imagine.”The Brevard County Sheriff’s Office, Cocoa Fire Rescue, U.S. Coast Guard and The Florida Wildlife Commission assisted with the rescue, Cocoa police said.The wildlife commission is investigating the crash, police said."
