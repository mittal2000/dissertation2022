0,HEALTHY LIVING,New York To Allow Late-Term Abortions For Health At-Risk Women,"Laila Kearney, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-to-allow-late-term-abortions-for-health-at-risk-women_us_57d2cfb9e4b03d2d459a02b5,This marks an end to decades of confusion for patients and providers.,2016-09-09,"A combination photo shows an anti-abortion protest march (L) and a pro-abortion rights protester holds a sign as he confronts an anti-abortion demonstration in Queens, New York, in 2012.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d2d0481600009e26c01bb6.jpeg?cache=sj30OC4uzf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New York will allow late-term abortions for women whose pregnancies endanger their health, a move that brings the state into federal compliance and ends decades of confusion faced by patients and providers of the procedure, state officials said.State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman issued an opinion publicly on Thursday to clarify that New Yorkers have all the protections afforded to women in the United States under the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade and are not beholden to the state’s more-restrictive abortion law.“Today’s opinion eliminates any ambiguity about the consistency of our state’s law with these federal constitutional rights and, as a result, removes an obstacle some New York women may encounter when trying to make their own reproductive health choices,” Schneiderman said in a statement.The state will officially allow late-term abortions if the pregnant woman’s health is at risk or if the fetus is “nonviable,” according to the opinion.Existing New York law says abortion is a crime unless performed “under a reasonable belief that such is necessary to preserve (the pregnant woman’s) life,” or within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy.The new opinion also assures reproductive health care providers operating in New York, such as Planned Parenthood, that “they may provide constitutionally protected reproductive health care services to women without fear of being complicit in a criminal act.”The opinion does not change the state’s penal code. It clarifies the state’s interpretation of federal law and that the law overrides state rule.New York, which was of the first states to legalize access to abortions, last modified its laws on the procedure in 1970, about three years before the Roe v. Wade decision.Civil rights and reproductive health care advocates applauded Schneiderman’s move.“New York’s abortion law, once ahead of its time, for too long has been woefully out of date, causing confusion for providers and leaving women without the full extent of their constitutionally-protected right to access abortion,” said Andrea Miller, President of the National Institute for Reproductive Health.“Today’s opinion by the attorney general is critical confirmation that women have a right to adequate medical care and reproductive choice in New York state,” said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.The organization said it plans to release a report next year that includes a collection of stories by women who were affected by New York’s unconstitutional abortion restriction."
1,POLITICS,Donald Trump Could Get Booted Off The Ballot In Minnesota,Ed Mazza,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-minnesota-ballot_us_57d2301de4b00642712ce14f,"""It is likely none of the Republican electors were legally elected.""",2016-09-09,Minnesota Democrats are trying to have Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump tossed off the ballot in their state.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump could be missing from the ballot in Minnesota on Election Day if Democrats get their way. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court to have the Republican presidential candidate’s name, along with the name of GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, removed from the ballot over a procedural flaw.The dispute stemmed from provisions requiring that each party nominate 10 electors and 10 alternates at their state conventions who would represent Minnesota in the Electoral College vote held after the presidential election. The GOP failed to select the alternate electors and almost didn’t make the ballot at all. The state party ultimately held a meeting to select the alternates, as the Washington Post reported last month. The Republican Party said Minnesota’s secretary of state accepted the alternates as meeting the legal requirements. Now, the DFL claims that since the GOP alternates weren’t selected at a state convention, as required by law, they shouldn’t count.“The Executive Committee is obviously not a ‘delegate convention,’ ” the petition stated. As a result, the DFL wants Trump booted from the ballot. “It is incumbent upon political parties to follow the rules binding our elections and in this instance it does not appear that the Minnesota Republican Party did so,” DFL Chair Ken Martin said in a news release. The state Supreme Court has a track record of handling election issues quickly, Pioneer Press reported. The DFL’s lawsuit was filed on Thursday.Although the state GOP has not responded to requests for comment on the issue, at least one GOP official admitted there might be a problem. Based on the wording of the law, “it is likely none of the Republican electors were legally elected,” James Carson, party chair for the fourth congressional district, told MinnPost.Minnesota hasn’t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since Richard M. Nixon in 1972, and was famously the only state to vote for Walter Mondale over Ronald Reagan in 1984."
2,WOMEN,Hillary Clinton Exposed The Emotional Tightrope Women Constantly Walk,Emma Gray,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-exposed-the-emotional-tightrope-women-are-constantly-walking_us_57d1a3efe4b03d2d45992613,Here’s why her Humans Of New York interview resonated so deeply.,2016-09-09,"Hillary Clinton speaks during the 136th annual session of the National Baptist Convention on September 8, 2016 in Kansas City, Missouri.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d21a751700002e34c78a05.jpeg?ops=crop_433_95_2388_1763%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Welcome to womanhood: If you emote too much, you’re a weeping crazy lady. If you emote too little, you’re an ice cold b*tch. No one seems to understand this feminine quandary more than potential POTUS Hillary Clinton. And on Thursday, she distilled the pressure women feel to constantly modulate their emotional states down to two anecdotes, recorded by Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton.Clinton describes taking her law school admissions test at Harvard, in a group of nearly all men, many of whom viewed the few women in the room as an affront. She uses this experience as an entry point into the way women learn from a young age to adapt their emotional states to make those around them feel comfortable, and just how difficult it can be to toe the line between “emotional” and “closed off”:I know that I can be perceived as aloof or cold or unemotional. But I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions. And that’s a hard path to walk. Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time you don’t want to seem ‘walled off.’ And sometimes I think I come across more in the ‘walled off’ arena. In a second piece of the same interview, posted on Facebook just hours later, Clinton expanded on this idea.“I’ve learned that I can’t be quite so passionate in my presentation,” she told Stanton. “I love to wave my arms, but apparently that’s a little bit scary to people. And I can’t yell too much. It comes across as ‘too loud’ or ‘too shrill’ or ‘too this’ or ‘too that.’”Clinton has been consistently criticized over the years for being “angry,” “shrill,” “aloof,” “icy” and “ruthless.” She has spent decades hearing that she must adjust her tone of voice, her hair, her smile, her clothing and her level of emotiveness in order to appeal acceptable to the American public. Part of this is, of course, just par for the course when you live your life in the public eye. And it’s not just gender that plays a role in the way people police and react to a public figure’s emotional openness or lack thereof.But even given all of this, much of the criticism levied at Clinton, and at the very least, the way it is delivered, is unquestionably gendered. Just look at the “Trump That B*tch” and “Hillary Sucks, But Not Like Monica” T-shirts that became so popular during the RNC. (The mental gymnastics those who hate her seem to go through to deny that gender plays a role in people’s perceptions of Clinton only serves to reinforce the point.)Ultimately, when it comes to presentation ― emotional and physical ― there is a clear double standard. A male leader who raises his voice and speaks with his hands and shakes his head during a speech is passionate. A woman who does the same is angry and unhinged. The standard bearers for what “presidential” looks and sounds and acts like are all male. So anything Clinton does, even if she is emulating every successful presidential candidate before her, will play differently with the American people. The reason this particular interview with Clinton rings so true to so many women is that even women who never go into political or public life of any kind learn to do a carefully choreographed emotional dance. (This is likely especially true for women who came of age when Clinton did. We may still have a long way to go when it comes to gender parity, but things have certainly changed since Clinton took her Harvard Law admissions exam.)Women know that to receive respect in a professional setting means being articulate and assertive, but not aggressive or angry or b*tchy; warm and inviting, but not fake or emotional; passionate, but not threatening. Essentially you have to demand a seat at the table, while making those around you feel like they pulled that very seat up to the table for you.This outward emotional modulation matters because it’s something all women must learn to navigate, and then keep up forever. And it feels damn satisfying to hear a presidential candidate articulate what that feels like. "
3,POLITICS,Native American Tribe Loses Bid To Stop North Dakota Oil Pipeline,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/native-american-tribe-north-dakota-oil-pipeline_us_57d2ddc7e4b06a74c9f4511f,The Standing Rock Sioux claim the pipeline would violate culturally significant land and pollute drinking water.,2016-09-09,"Tepees stand in the Seven Council camp, one of three encampments that have grown on the banks of the Cannon Ball River over the last month with the purpose of stopping construction of the Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, on Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d2e1951800001034bd0634.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal judge denied an injunction Friday that would have frozen construction on a North Dakota oil pipeline opposed by a Native American tribe. But despite the setback, the Standing Rock Sioux scored a partial victory as three federal departments jointly announced Friday that work would not be authorized on the sensitive land while they reconsider the tribe’s concerns.The Standing Rock Sioux, whose reservation sits near the Dakota Access pipeline’s route, brought a lawsuit contending the pipeline will disturb places of cultural importance and possibly contaminate potable water from the Missouri River. They claim the permits granted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in July violate “multiple federal statutes,” including the National Historic Preservation Act.The order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington was a setback for the tribe, which wanted construction stopped while their lawsuit against the Army played out in court. “Aware of the indignities visited upon the Tribe over the last centuries, the Court scrutinizes the permitting process here with particular care,” Boasberg wrote. “Having done so, the Court must nonetheless conclude that the Tribe has not demonstrated that an injunction is warranted here.”But the court decision was almost counterbalanced by the surprise announcement from the Department of Justice, the Army and the Department of the Interior. The agencies said “construction of the pipeline on Army Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe will not go forward at this time.” They requested that Energy Transfer Partners, the pipeline builder, delay all work within 20 miles of the area during this review.“This case has highlighted the need for a serious discussion on whether there should be nationwide reform with respect to considering tribes’ views on these types of infrastructure projects,” the joint statement said.“Our voices have been heard,” Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault II in a statement. “The Obama administration has asked tribes to the table to make sure that we have meaningful consultation on infrastructure projects. Native peoples have suffered generations of broken promises and today the federal government said that national reform is needed to better ensure that tribes have a voice on infrastructure projects like this pipeline.”The tribe also announced that it will appeal the judge’s ruling.Energy Transfer Partners did not respond to HuffPost’s inquiries about today’s decisions.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) applauded the Army’s decision.“The Justice Department, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Department of the Interior are right,” Sanders said in a statement. “It’s time to listen to our Native American brothers and sisters. We must stop the Dakota Access pipeline, once and for all.”If it’s completed, the pipeline will carry 570,000 barrels of crude per day from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota through South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Energy Transfer Partners, the company building it, say that the pipeline is more environmentally friendly than transporting the oil via trucks or trains. Demonstrations against the project have grown in recent weeks as supporters, including those from other tribes, have joined the ranks of the Standing Rock Sioux’s encampment near the work site. In recent weeks, there’s been conflict among the pipeline opponents, the company’s workers and local law enforcement. Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein was charged this week with criminal trespass and criminal mischief after allegedly spray-painting a bulldozer with the words, “I approve this message.” Protesters contesting the bulldozing of a burial site claimed they were attacked by guard dogs and doused with pepper spray Saturday, Democracy Now reported. Since August, during other altercations dozens of other people have been arrested, including the tribe’s chairman, on charges like disorderly conduct and trespassing. Cristian Farias contributed reporting.This was a developing story and has been updated throughout."

He collapsed on the sidewalk after a volley of bullets, as several witnesses reacted with shock or anger.The 35-year-old undocumented immigrant, who arrived in Washington state’s apple-growing belt seeking opportunity about a decade ago, battled drug use and homelessness in the months leading up to the shooting.(Reporting by Eric M.

This week, The Huffington Post added new reporting to an old story ― namely, the curious way that Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi halted an effort to investigate the claims of those who believed they’d been defrauded by Trump University after that “university’s” namesake sent a little bit of payola her way. It’s a hard, harsh read ― and deservedly so.It also breaks into the news cycle during a week when another war was newly enjoined over how the media has treated both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Is Clinton getting “Gored”? Or is there an “unrelenting” effort underway to “delegitimize all negative reporting” about the former secretary of state?

6,GREEN,U.S. Takes Strong Stand Against Rhino Poaching With $1 Million Bonfire,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rhino-horn-burn-us_us_57d2376ce4b06a74c9f4097b,This is the first time the United States has ever burned rhino horn.,2016-09-09,"In a dramatic statement against the trade in endangered species parts, Kenya set fire to 105 tons of elephant ivory and more than 1 ton of rhino horn in April. It was believed to be the largest stockpile ever destroyed.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a pit at the San Diego Zoo’s Safari Park, $1 million worth of confiscated rhino horn was set alight on Thursday.Orange flames consumed the whole carved horns and horn products falsely touted as having medicinal qualities. Reporters, conservationists and members of the public watched as the fire raged. The bonfire, the first of its kind in the United States, was spearheaded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). It was a symbolic moment, the embodiment of America’s commitment to end rhino poaching.“The poaching of rhinos in Africa is an international tragedy that is pushing these magnificent creatures to the brink of extinction,” USFWS director Dan Ashe said at the event, which was held ahead of World Rhino Day on September 22. “The transience of the smoke we see today from the burning rhino horn reminds us of the fragility of the planet’s most imperiled species.“Their survival hangs in the balance and will continue to do so as long as people are buying and selling illegal wildlife products,” Ashe continued. “Only a rhino needs a rhino horn, and it’s time we all understood that.” According to the San Diego Zoo, a rhino is poached every 8 hours in Africa. At this rate, the animals could become extinct in the wild within 15 years.Some species of rhino are already on the brink of disappearing forever. For the northern white rhino, just three are left on Earth. Poaching is the number one threat facing wild rhino populations. Rhino horn is extremely valuable, with a retail price of up to $100,000 per kilogram. It’s more valuable by weight than gold, diamonds or cocaine.Like ivory, rhino horn is often used for decorative purposes, but in some parts of East Asia, where demand for horn continues to grow, it’s valued as a medicine. In traditional Chinese medicine, rhino horn has been used as a cure for cancer and as an aphrodisiac.This is despite the fact that rhino horn is made almost entirely of keratin, the same material as human fingernails. Scientists have found no evidence that rhino horn has any effective medicinal properties.To quell the illegal rhino horn trade, conservationists have long urged governments to burn their stockpiles of horn products.“With the increasing value of rhino horn, stockpiles present a high-value target for theft,” Susie Ellis, executive director of the International Rhino Foundation, said in a press release. “In countries with limited resources to protect stockpiles, or with concerns about corruption, destroying horns can eliminate the risk of confiscated horn from entering the black market.”Ellis said she hopes that if countries like the U.S. burn stockpiles of ivory, it will help to end the scourge of wildlife trafficking and poaching. “This rhino horn burn sends the message to criminal networks and to rhino horn buyers that the United States will not tolerate illegal trade in rhino horn,” said Ellis. “The high demand for this commodity results in dire consequences for rhino species. Today’s burn makes clear that confiscated horns should not be stockpiled, let alone traded.” "

The issue has gained more attention because of high-profile breaches in recent years of government and private sector computers.U.S. intelligence officials suspect Russia was responsible for breaches of Democratic political organizations and state election systems to exert influence on the Nov. 8 presidential election. Russia has dismissed the allegations as absurd.Obama announced the new position in February alongside a budget proposal to Congress asking for $19 billion for cyber security across the U.S. government. The job is a political appointment, meaning Obama’s successor can choose to replace Touhill after being sworn in next January.Touhill is currently a deputy assistant secretary for cyber security and communications at the Department of Homeland Security.He will begin his new role later this month, a source familiar with the matter said. Touhill’s responsibilities will include creating and implementing policy for best security practices across federal agencies and conducting periodic audits to test for weaknesses, according to the announcement.Grant Schneider, who is the director of cyber security policy at the White House’s National Security Council, will be acting deputy to Touhill, according to the announcement."

I’m against social injustice and I feel like this was the right thing to do.”Marshall, who is black, is the third NFL player to not stand during the national anthem since Kaepernick began his sideline protest against racial injustice and police brutality.Kaepernick’s teammate Eric Reid joined in the protest during the 49ers’ pre-season finale last week while Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane sat on the bench last week against the Oakland Raiders.The NFL’s opening week resumes Sunday with 13 games and some players, including Seattle receiver Doug Baldwin and defensive end Cliff Avril have said they are considering not standing during the national anthem before their game against Miami.Many Americans saw Kaepernick’s gesture as a sign of disrespect to the flag and criticism was widespread, but he has also been supported by several fellow athletes, including Megan Rapinoe, a white soccer player who knelt before her game on Sunday.“While we encourage members of our organization to stand during the national anthem, we understand and respect it being a personal decision,” the Broncos said in a statement.Marshall, who was Denver’s second-leading tackler during their run to a Super Bowl title last season and a teammate of Kaepernick at the University of Nevada, said last week that he supported Kaepernick’s actions.“Brandon is a great kid. He is a leader of this team,” Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak said after the game. “I believe in our guys and I believe in them wholeheartedly. We move forward.”The use of force by police against African-Americans in cities such as Baltimore, New York, and Ferguson, Missouri, has sparked periodic and sometimes destructive protests in the past two years and prompted the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.Kaepernick led San Francisco to a Super Bowl berth in 2013 but has since been demoted to backup. He played in nine games last season and had more turnovers than touchdowns.But since he began his protests during the preseason Kaepernick’s jersey has become the top-selling jersey on the National Football League’s official online store.(Reporting by Brendan O’Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)"

He was arrested on a charge of filing a false police report.Winston-Salem police also said Friday it had found no evidence to substantiate a report earlier this week of a clown attempting to lure children into a wooded area by offering them treats.Reports of clown sightings in the state and neighboring South Carolina since late August have residents on edge and prompted more police patrols. In most cases, investigators have found no one matching the varying descriptions of the clowns.Creepy clowns are a fixture of pop culture and entertainment in the United States. Best-selling U.S. horror author Stephen King weighed in on the recent reports, noting the fear of clowns touches a nerve with both children and adults.But reported sightings of scary-looking clowns also conjure up real-life horror stories like those about John Wayne Gacy Jr., the serial killer and rapist who dressed as a clown and murdered more than 30 teenage boys and young men in Cook County, Illinois, in the 1970s.In Greenville, South Carolina, where there have been several reported sightings, police are treating the cases as suspicious activity while trying to determine if they are legitimate or hoaxes.“We’re still investigating to see what the actual purpose is, whether it’s for ill intent or if it’s a prank,” said Officer Gilberto Franco, a Greenville police spokesman.A film distributor debunked speculation that the sightings were connected to the release of director Rob Zombie’s new independent horror movie “31,” which features a gang of sadistic clowns. Saban Films said it was “not associated in any way with the creepy clowns and costumed characters found roaming the South.”"

Carlson’s lawsuit reportedly encouraged more than 20 other women to come forward, including primetime star Megyn Kelly. Ailes resigned within weeks. In his Facebook post, Rivera goes into detail about his decades-long professional and personal history with Ailes to explain his initial shock over the allegations, saying “he had my back through thick and thin,” especially when Rivera was covering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.“Now I am filled with regret for stubbornly discounting their various allegations,” Rivera added, referring to the women who have come forward. “Like victims of sexual assault, those alleging harassment deserve the presumption of credibility.”Rivera even apologized to New York magazine writer Gabriel Sherman, who’s broken most of the news around the story. Sherman thanked Rivera for the apology on Twitter Thursday night.Greta Van Susteren, another Fox veteran who announced this week that she is leaving the network, shared Rivera’s post on her own Facebook page on Friday.Meanwhile, 21st Century Fox settled the lawsuit with Carlson this week.Read Rivera’s full Facebook post here."

Whether or not individual officers will opt against working the games remains to be seen, but the letter appears to answer the question of whether there will be a top-down call for a boycott. Roughly 70 officers voluntarily work each 49ers game, according to the Associated Press.The news came the same day as the 49ers announced owner Jed York would donate $1 million to help police-community relations and inner-city children."

Kerry, wary of getting the guarantees to make the deal work, had postponed his departure for Geneva for a day.“The Obama administration, the United States, is going the extra mile here because we believe that Russia, and my colleague (Lavrov), have the ability to press the Assad regime to stop this conflict and to come to the table and make peace,” he said.Kerry said the “bedrock” of the deal was an agreement that the Syrian government would not fly combat missions in an agreed area, on the pretext of hunting fighters from the banned Nusra Front, an al Qaeda affiliate in Syria.“That should put an end to the barrel bombs, and an end to the indiscriminate bombing, and it has the potential to change the nature of the conflict.”After a sustained period of reduced violence, Russia and the United States would work together to develop military strikes against Nusra and Islamic State, Kerry said.“Going after Nusra is not a concession to anyone. It is profoundly in the interests of the United States to target al Qaeda, to target al Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria which is Nusra.“We must go after these terrorists. Not indiscriminately, but in a strategic, precise and judicious manner so they cannot continue to use the regime’s indiscriminate bombing to rally people to their hateful crimes.”All sides in the conflict would need to adhere to the nationwide truce, Kerry said.“This requires halting all attacks, including aerial bombardments, and any attempts to gain additional territory at the expense of the parties to the cessation. It requires unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access to all of the besieged and hard-to-reach areas including Aleppo.”Both warring sides would pull back from the strategic Castello Road in Aleppo to create a demilitarized zone, while opposition and government groups would both have to provide safe and unhindered access via Ramouseh in the south of the city.If the truce holds from Monday, Russia and the United States will begin seven days of preparatory work to set up a “joint implementation center”, including some information sharing to delineate territory controlled by Nusra and opposition groups.The United States and Russia have backed opposite sides in Syria’s civil war, which has shown little sign of ending after more than five years of violence in which half the pre-war population has been uprooted.Moscow supports President Bashar al-Assad and Washington supports the opposition, saying Assad must go.Kerry’s proposal for military cooperation with Russia over Syria has faced resistance from U.S. defense and intelligence officials, who argue that Moscow cannot be trusted.The United Nations said on Friday the Syrian government had effectively stopped aid convoys this month and the besieged city of Aleppo was close to running out of fuel, making the talks even more urgent.(Editing by Larry King and Tom Brown)"

But Gracie is an exception to that rule: She’s been specially trained to keep animals away.This 2-year-old “bark ranger” is the latest ― and without question, the cutest ― tool in Glacier National Park’s fight to limit dangerous human-wildlife interactions, which have become a growing problem in many of America’s national parks.“She’s there to help keep the wildlife wild,” Timothy Rains, a spokesman for the Montana park, told The Huffington Post. “There’s just something about the dog that makes it easy.”Perhaps it’s that face ― one humans adore and wild animals confuse for that of a predator.Glacier first introduced its wildlife service dog to the world in May, when she was being trained as part of a new pilot project funded by the Glacier National Park Conservancy. Since first reporting for duty in mid-July, Gracie has been hard at work herding sheep and goats away from Logan Pass and other high-traffic areas in an effort to keep safe both the animals and the visitors who come to see them.Until Gracie came along, park rangers resorted mainly to waving their arms, shouting and sounding sirens to chase animals out of parking lots. Those solutions, however, were often short-lived, as the critters tended to return quickly.With Gracie, Rains said, the park is capitalizing on natural predator-prey instincts. “[The animals] don’t think she’s a dog, they think she’s a wolf,” he said. Rains said Gracie works roughly two shifts per week, give or take, so that the wildlife does not get used to having her around. The whole point is for the sheep and goats to feel threatened.In addition to managing wildlife, Gracie also manages visitors by drawing people in so that her handler, park ranger Mark Biel, can educate them about park safety information like the importance of viewing wildlife from a distance.“No one wants to talk to me, but if they see her they come up and pet her, then I’ve got you,” Biel told National Public Radio.As Rains put it, Gracie “helps soften the blow” for visitors that have to be told they are breaking park safety rules.So far, the young pup has proven herself an important member of the Glacier team. At Logan Pass, groups of animals are already keeping greater distances from the parking lot, and visitors are quick to ask questions about and take pictures with the photogenic, four-legged ranger, according to Rains.“It’s been successful this summer,” Rains said of the program, adding that the plan is to expand it next year. “We put a lot of faith in the dog and she stood up to the challenge.”For those interested in following this “bark ranger’s” journey, Glacier National Park has set Gracie up with her own Instagram account.

19,BUSINESS,Wells Fargo Just Made The Case For Elizabeth Warren’s Bank Agency,Emily Peck and Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wells-fargo-fraud_us_57d2d237e4b03d2d459a083c,"The bank was scamming customers for years, until the CFPB put an end to it.",2016-09-09,"Richard Cordray is the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which exposed Wells Fargo's massive scam on Thursday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d2d5601800006c32bd05f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wells Fargo just proved, again, that no scam is beneath America’s financial institutions. And no institution is above being watched by a federal agency.On Thursday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ― the watchdog group proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D. Mass.) in the aftermath of the financial crisis ― announced that Wells Fargo would pony up a total of $185 million for perpetrating a huge scam on its customers. Over at least the past five years, Wells Fargo employees created more than 1.5 million sham checking accounts and applied for 565,000 credit cards, using customer names and money. Customers were charged unnecessary fees, saw their credit scores fall or were simply confused when debit and credit cards they never asked for showed up in the mail.“Was the Great Financial Crisis so long ago that all chasteness and propriety are already out the window? This scam has been apparently going on for five years,” writes Josh Brown, a financial blogger. “These people are fearless.”The CFPB has come under intense criticism from Republicans, who say it’s a drag on business. Many ― including presidential hopeful Donald Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence ― have said they would like to see the agency abolished as part of their intended dismantling of the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation passed to prevent another economic meltdown.But every time the agency exposes wrongdoing in consumer banking ― as it did on Thursday ― the CFPB offers a strong counterpoint to those arguments. The job of the CFPB, now headed by Richard Cordray, isn’t to regulate the hot new derivative investment banks are peddling to hedge funds. It’s to protect ordinary people from the kind of everyday scams that financial institutions have shown again and again that they will commit if no one is watching. The agency oversees a myriad of businesses like consumer banking, debt collection and payday loans that hundreds of millions of Americans use every day.It’s had an impact. Last year, the CFPB fined Citibank for illegal credit card practices after the bank was found to be charging customers for benefits they didn’t receive. It’s uncovered student loan fraud and financial products that take advantage of the elderly, and is looking to crack down on the payday loan industry.Though it’s obviously a huge blow to the bank’s reputation, the Wells Fargo fraud wasn’t even that profitable ― scamming thousands and thousands of customers out of a total of $2.6 million in surprise fees over five years doesn’t provide much financial boost to a bank that made $86.1 billion in revenue and $22.9 billion in profit last year alone. The scam also wasn’t really that profitable to the rank-and-file employees who carried it out. Retail bank employees inhabit the lowest rung of the finance industry. They make an industry average of around $10 an hour, and turnover is incredibly high.The fine the CFPB levied in response to the fraud is the largest the agency has ever imposed. The remaining millions will go to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the city and county of Los Angeles, which helped to uncover the scam.The bank also must refund all fees to customers ― about $2.6 million ― including overdraft charges and penalties for falling below minimum balances on sham accounts.The bank wouldn’t say if any senior executives were leaving the organization in response to the fraud. But it did say that it had fired 5,300 workers over the past five years in connection with the scam ― out of a division of 100,000. That would seem to mean about 5 percent of the group was engaged in wrongdoing. In an email to HuffPost, the bank argued that only 1 percent of employees in the division were involved. It’s curious accounting, and seems to imply that each worker is new every year.“Our entire culture is centered on doing what is right for our customers. However, at Wells Fargo, when we make mistakes, we are open about it, we take responsibility, and we take action. Today’s agreements are consistent with these beliefs,” the bank said in a statement Thursday.After the nation’s biggest banks utterly burned down Americans’ trust and faith by wrecking the economy in 2008, you’d imagine that Wells Fargo and other large institutions would be working overtime to earn it back. Maybe they are, but the bank’s senior management also put perverse incentives in place that pushed employees to defraud customers.Wells Fargo tellers earn about 3 percent in incentive pay for sales and customer service, while personal bankers make about 15 percent to 20 percent of their total earnings from these payments, the Los Angeles Times reported in 2013. They have daily quotas to fill, and are threatened with being fired if they don’t meet them.The intense pressure to meet sales goals doesn’t just push traders and bankers who make millions of dollars a year to fudge the numbers or rip off clients, it also warps the judgment of even junior employees. This latest scandal is fraud at the lowest level ― perpetuated by poorly paid employees and felt by everyday consumers.The scandal is also a reminder that profitability or customer losses are incomplete gauges of the damage financial fraud wreaks. A bank is in the businesses of holding not just your money, but also your sensitive, personal information.Trust should be its most valuable currency.But when a bank doesn’t value trust, it’s important to have a consumer protection agency that does. It’s worth pointing out that after the LA Times called attention to Wells Fargo’s high-pressure tactics in 2013, nothing much happened. It took the CFPB finally coming in to fix the problem.Though the CFPB undoubtedly performed a public service in stopping this wrongdoing, its action will likely do little to slow down the growth of Wells Fargo. That’s just one more counterpoint to the Republican claim that the CFPB is detrimental to the growth and health of the financial industry.Ultimately, the bank won’t feel much pain from this latest development. The fine is peanuts to an institution that makes billions of dollars. As of this writing, Wells Fargo stock price has hardly changed from when the news of its wrongdoing broke."

Unfortunately, the researchers said they also uncovered a sobering reality. There are fewer than 8,700 reticulated giraffe in the wild and under 4,750 northern giraffe. “As distinct species, it makes them some of the most endangered large mammals in the world and require doubling of protection efforts to secure these populations,” said Dr. Julian Fennessy, co-director of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, in a news release.The International Union for Conservation of Nature does not consider giraffes an endangered species. According to the foundation, however, giraffe populations have declined by over 60 percent in the past three decades. There are now fewer than 100,000 giraffe in the wild. Researchers said they hope the new study will propel giraffe conservation efforts, and will also equip conservationists to better protect the four giraffe species.“This is an important finding that will enable conservation biologists to target their efforts and, perhaps, to come up with new conservation approaches in captivity or in the wild, based on the genetic similarities and differences between these groups,” one of the study’s authors, Matthew Cobb, told the BBC.The researchers’ findings were published this week in the journal Current Biology."

Unfortunately, the researchers said they also uncovered a sobering reality. There are fewer than 8,700 reticulated giraffe in the wild and under 4,750 northern giraffe. “As distinct species, it makes them some of the most endangered large mammals in the world and require doubling of protection efforts to secure these populations,” said Dr. Julian Fennessy, co-director of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, in a news release.The International Union for Conservation of Nature does not consider giraffes an endangered species. According to the foundation, however, giraffe populations have declined by over 60 percent in the past three decades. There are now fewer than 100,000 giraffe in the wild. Researchers said they hope the new study will propel giraffe conservation efforts, and will also equip conservationists to better protect the four giraffe species.“This is an important finding that will enable conservation biologists to target their efforts and, perhaps, to come up with new conservation approaches in captivity or in the wild, based on the genetic similarities and differences between these groups,” one of the study’s authors, Matthew Cobb, told the BBC.The researchers’ findings were published this week in the journal Current Biology."

That’s the sentiment Justice Sonia Sotomayor shared during a visit to the University of Wisconsin-Madison on Thursday to deliver the annual Robert W. Kastenmeier lecture, the Associated Press reports. Seven years after being sworn in as the court’s first Hispanic justice, Sotomayor said she still is in awe of her job but also recognizes it comes with a big responsibility. “I never forget that in every case, someone wins, and there’s an opposite, someone loses,” she told students. “And that burden feels very heavy to me. I have not anticipated how hard decision-making is on the court. Because of that big win and lose on the court... we are affecting lives across the country and sometimes across the world. I’m conscious that what I do will always affect someone.”Being on the high court may certainly come with its set of challenges but that hasn’t stopped Sotomayor from being recognized for her work. The Hispanic Heritage Foundation will present her with the Leadership Award at the 29th Annual Hispanic Heritage Awards on Sept. 22 in Washington, D.C. “The Justice truly embodies what it means to be an American,” Jose Antonio Tijerino, president and CEO of Hispanic Heritage Foundation, said in a July statement where he announced the award. “The Hispanic community has made significant contributions throughout history, and we are proud to recognize that impact in the present and the future, as well.”"
23,POLITICS,"The DEA Is Rushing To Criminalize Another Herb, And Congress Is Silent",Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-kratom-ban-dea_us_57d1ad7ce4b03d2d45993e0e,"If the war on drugs is a failure, why are lawmakers sitting idly as the DEA launches a ban on kratom?",2016-09-09,"Beginning in October, the herbal supplement kratom will be on the DEA's list of Schedule I controlled substances.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d1b07b1800006c32bd02c6.jpeg?cache=NSFt4wVIrZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nearly half a century into the war on drugs, Americans and their congressional representatives finally seem comfortable challenging the nation’s long-standing enforcement-first drug policy.Except for when it matters.With very little to show for the more than $1 trillion spent and millions of lives lost or permanently scarred in the fight for prohibition, lawmakers have begun to push broadly for reform, emphasizing treatment, destigmatization, decriminalization and even legalization over tactics like incarceration and other punitive responses.But Congress has been silent in the face of an abrupt move by the Drug Enforcement Administration last week to expand the drug war by banning and criminalizing the herbal supplement kratom.In a notice published in the Federal Register Aug. 31, the DEA announced that it is placing two active ingredients in the herb ― made from the leaves of Mitragyna speciosa, a Southeast Asian tree related to coffee ― into Schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act.Drugs in this category are considered to have no known medical benefit and a high potential for abuse. Substances classed as Schedule I include heroin, LSD and, most controversially, marijuana. The emergency scheduling move on kratom is set to go into effect as early as the end of September, at which point it will enact a two-year ban that the federal government can make permanent. The DEA’s attack on another naturally occurring substance attracted immediate pushback from kratom supporters and drug policy experts, who reject the agency’s claim that the herb is an “imminent hazard to public safety.” Kratom users say the DEA ignored anecdotal evidence and emerging science that suggests the drug could be a promising treatment for a variety of ailments, including chronic pain and opioid addiction.Kratom contains alkaloids that appear to activate opioid receptors in the brain and reduce pain. And although most opioids have sedative qualities, low to moderate doses of kratom actually serve as a mild stimulant. All of this has made it a popular traditional medicine for millennia in Asia and more recently in the West.The sudden move to ban kratom makes a mockery of the federal government’s claims to be concerned about the suffering unleashed by the opioid epidemic. The White House and members of Congress have been vocal about encouraging doctors to prescribe fewer opiates, but the DEA is banning an herbal alternative that can help do just that ― presumably much to the pleasure of pharmaceutical companies, which would be glad to see the demise of an affordable competitor.A number of drug policy reform advocates have called out the federal government for once again rushing toward prohibition, a strategy that has repeatedly proven more harmful than helpful. But congressional lawmakers have yet to say anything about this escalation of the drug war.Although the DEA has the authority to enact this “emergency” policy, Congress could use its upcoming spending bill to block it from doing so. But the political will would have to be there.The Huffington Post reached out to Congress’ most progressive voices on drug policy for comment on the kratom ban. Some declined to comment. Others didn’t respond at all. The group includes dozens of members, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), all of whom have been vocal supporters of reforming marijuana laws. Since relatively few Americans use kratom, it’s not clear if these lawmakers are entirely aware of what’s going on.“There’s not been substantial or overwhelming interest from our congressional affairs counterparts, but we are in the eve of pre-election campaigning and members of Congress just came back this week,” Russ Baer, a spokesman for the DEA, told HuffPost. “We suspect there will be an ongoing dialogue in terms of educating members of Congress regarding our intent to schedule kratom.”But with potentially just three weeks left until the scheduling change for kratom takes effect, the DEA’s actions have so far been subject to minimal oversight. The agency didn’t ask for public comment ahead of its announcement, and the founder of one of the nation’s largest kratom advocacy groups told HuffPost she didn’t hear the news until she read it online last week.A petition asking the White House not to schedule kratom reached 113,000 signatures on Saturday, crossing the 100,000 threshold that requires a response from the administration.One watchdog is now questioning how the ban materialized. In a letter published Thursday, the Center for Regulatory Effectiveness, a for-profit think tank that has been a persistent thorn in the side of government regulators, asked the DEA for a copy of the administrator’s correspondence with the Department of Health and Human Services. The DEA says it informed HHS of its plan to ban kratom in May, and that the assistant secretary of HHS didn’t object. The Center wants to make sure the process complied with the Data Quality Act, a controversial statute that requires federal regulatory actions to be based on “quality” data.The lack of scrutiny over this action is troubling, especially considering the widespread implications of a DEA offensive against thousands of Americans who are already using kratom for treatment, as well as manufacturers and distributors in the U.S. and abroad. Furthermore, critics are concerned that the agency used isolated reports to make a series of inaccurate and alarmist claims about kratom, while simultaneously ignoring emerging science that suggests the herb could have a variety of medical benefits.“Congress has oversight over the DEA and has the responsibility to question the agency and its actions,” said Grant Smith, deputy director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for progressive reform of drug laws.“In this case, we have a lot of anecdotal evidence that kratom has therapeutic potential, yet the DEA is intending to put this in Schedule I, which is designated for compounds that have no medical value,” Smith continued. “It also is a schedule that is reserved for drugs with a high potential for abuse, yet the research I’ve seen doesn’t corroborate that.”Indeed, while initial studies have found that kratom could have some addictive potential, they have pointed to possible medicinal applications as well. Most scientific literature has also noted that the plant has a low potential for abuse or acute harm, such as overdose.Walter Prozialeck, a professor of pharmacology at Midwestern University who wrote a comprehensive literature review on kratom for The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, previously told HuffPost that he found kratom doesn’t produce much of a psychoactive high when taken in low or moderate doses. This means, he said, it doesn’t appear to have a particularly high potential for recreational use.Other scientists are more optimistic about how kratom interacts with the human body. Andrew Kruegel, a researcher at Columbia University, has been examining the chemistry of the active alkaloids in kratom, and earlier this year published a study with some fascinating findings.Here’s how Eric Boodman explained Kruegel’s results in a recent article for the medical news site Stat:When an opioid binds to a receptor, it can trigger a few different responses in a cell. One is thought to be responsible for causing pain relief. Another is thought to be responsible for the negative side effects, such as respiratory depression, which is responsible for many opioid deaths.It’s with this in mind that Kruegel and a number of his colleagues in the medical field wrote a letter to government officials last week expressing “grave concern” over the DEA’s plan to ban the active substances in kratom. The doctors say these alkaloids could lead to the development of safer alternative pain medications that could help address a nationwide opioid epidemic largely fueled by narcotic painkillers. Furthermore, they claim to have seen little evidence to support the DEA’s dire warnings about kratom’s dangers.“Hundreds of years of human use worldwide further suggest, albeit in an anecdotal manner, that kratom is typically safe, with no substantiated fatal overdoses from kratom plant consumption alone (in contrast to >18,000 deaths per year from prescription opioids and >10,000 from heroin),” they write.This directly challenges the DEA’s description of kratom as an urgent public health threat, a conclusion that relies heavily on a recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The CDC study, published in July, found that 660 calls involving kratom were made to U.S. poison centers in the six years from January 2010 to December 2015. It also found evidence of 555 positive drug test results for kratom from December 2014 through March 2016.Although the DEA claims that a sharp upward trend over this period shows “growing abuse and popularity of these substances,” these incidents make up just a tiny portion of the more than 3 million annual calls to poison centers, and of the millions of drug tests the CDC surveyed over that period. For comparison, poison centers gets tens of thousands of calls each year regarding exposure to laundry detergent packets, glow sticks and other plant matter. In 2014, about 57 percent of all poison center cases involved pharmaceuticals. The CDC declined a request for further comment on this study.The DEA also claims there have been “numerous deaths associated with kratom,” but fails to provide an example in which the herb was found to be the only contributor. Such a case does not appear to exist. Most deaths associated with kratom have involved people who reportedly tested positive for numerous substances or were suffering from pre-existing medical conditions. Users report that consuming too much kratom will only lead to nausea and vomiting.Despite the relatively low risk profile, many advocates say they, like the DEA, are worried about emerging brands of “gas station” kratom ― often brightly marked products with stupid names that may be deceptively labeled or contain unlisted adulterants. Before the DEA announced the ban, kratom groups were regularly speaking out in support of regulatory efforts to rein in unscrupulous manufacturers and restrict use by young consumers.The federal government’s move will put an end to such efforts at nuanced regulation. In its notice, the DEA states that “kratom does not have an approved medical use in the United States and has not been studied as a treatment agent.” But that’s pretty much of true of all herbal supplements sold in the U.S. Obtaining official medical approval from the Food and Drug Administration is a lengthy and painstaking process than can cost pharmaceutical companies billions of dollars. And Big Pharma has little incentive to seek approval for plants like kratom, as corporations can’t exactly patent leaves and naturally occurring compounds that have been around for millions of years.None of this is to say that we don’t need further research to get a more complete understanding of the potential health benefits or consequences of taking kratom. In fact, on that there appears to be a consensus from people on all sides of the issue.“In the absence of rigorous, scientific, peer-reviewed clinical studies, DEA is obligated to protect the public and schedule this substance,” said Baer, the agency spokesman.Of course, as scientists like Kruegel have argued, placing kratom in Schedule I is likely to seriously kneecap that undertaking.There are also unanswered questions about how the drug enforcement apparatus will approach a newly criminalized drug. Federal penalties for possession, distribution or manufacture of a Schedule I controlled substance are likely to go into effect almost immediately following the change.This could have broader effects on the criminal justice system, as thousands of Americans will soon be forced to make painful and difficult choices. Many people who use kratom are suffering from chronic pain, and turned to the herb after experiencing negative side effects from prescription opioids, often including addiction. They’ll now have to decide if they want to continue using kratom and risk severe legal consequences. Some may turn back to the painkillers that had previously left them addicted or debilitated. Others may attempt to forgo treatment altogether.Whatever happens, says Grant Smith, Congress will need to play an active role in this decision. After all, Congress gave the DEA the power to make emergency scheduling decisions, and later enhanced that authority as part of legislation meant to address a spate of emerging synthetic drugs.Proponents of progressive criminal justice and drug policy reform now have more sway than ever. For their ranks in Congress to remain silent as the DEA moves unopposed to ramp up the drug war yet again would be a huge mistake, Smith said.“Here we are talking about sentencing reform on Capitol Hill with respect to these older drugs that have been scheduled for a long time, and here comes a drug that is perceived as new, even though it’s not, and we’re applying the same old failed approach of criminalization,” he said. “It’s an unfortunate paradigm. On one hand we’re recognizing that harsh long prison sentences have been counterproductive, but on the other hand you have efforts to continue in this same vein with respect to kratom and some of these other synthetic drugs as well.”This article has been updated with information about a petition asking the White House not to schedule the drug.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

26,QUEER VOICES,"Governor McCrory, My 'Boy In A Dress' Is Not A Predator","Martie Sirois, ContributorTGNC advocate, founder of S.E.A.R.CH., mom of 3, www.gendercre...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/governor-mccrory-my-boy-in-a-dress-is-not-a-predator_us_57d20dd7e4b0273330ac3b82,Governor Pat McCrory of N.C. is at it again. His camp released another TV ad yesterday (9/7/16) posing the rhetorical question,2016-09-09,"<p>My gender non-conforming son is growing his hair out long, so that he can put it into a braid.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d216011600007c1ec019f0.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Governor Pat McCrory of N.C. is at it again. His camp released another TV ad yesterday (9/7/16) posing the rhetorical question, “Are we really talking about this?” The question came on the coattails of his claim that while he was “busy raising average teacher pay, creating new jobs and cutting taxes, other folks were actually pushing to make our schools allow boys to use the girls’ locker rooms and showers.”Yes, Pat. I’m going to go ahead and answer your rhetorical question. We are still talking about this – a conversation that you began.McCrory actually has a captive, scrutinizing audience with me because I happen to both have experience with the public school system, where he falsely persuades North Carolinians to think he has been raising teacher pay averages (but what he doesn’t say is that his “teacher pay average” averages in all school staff, including administration), and also, I’m the parent of a little boy who wears dresses. So I’m listening, Pat. You’re talking directly to me. And yes, I will continue to “really talk about this” - the conversation that you started.While McCrory’s latest ads and interviews seem to be slyly excluding the phrasing about multiple occupancy public restrooms, referring instead mostly to locker rooms and shower facilities, “the bathroom bill” is still the underlying theme playing on the fears of the uninformed. Lest we forget, when they made HB2 into law a few months back, McCrory and his people dubbed it “The Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, officially called An Act to Provide for Single-sex Multiple Occupancy Bathroom and Changing Facilities in Schools and Public Agencies” aka, “The Bathroom Bill.”Just this summer, at a town hall meeting in Cary, NC on August 26, McCrory said, “I don’t think our principals and our superintendents should be subjected to allowing a boy who thinks he’s a girl, but is still a boy, to be able to enter a locker room shower or bathroom facility. It’s a respectful disagreement, but it’s not a disagreement that I should be disrespected for having.”I’ll just leave that one alone. Kick it around in your brain for a while and you’ll get a headache.On July 22, the NBA announced its decision to pull the 2017 All-Star game out of North Carolina in protest of HB2. To this, McCrory responded on a talk-radio show, “I strongly disagree with their decision. To put it bluntly, it’s total P.C.B.S. … it’s an insult to our city, and an insult to our state.” He further announced that he believes the NBA is practicing “selective outrage.”One could take this in many directions, but probably the worst part is where McCrory declares that transgender people wanting equal rights is analogous with being “politically correct.” He questions, “does the desire to be politically correct outweigh our children’s privacy and safety?” Well, Pat, it’s actually not political correctness to believe that LGBTQ+ youth shouldn’t be bullied at school. It’s not political correctness to believe that we should offer these kids protections that we would expect all of our kids to have. Besides, federal court has already ruled that HB2 violates federal law, and has since blocked UNC from enforcing provisions. Hell, even the Governor can’t enforce his law in his own mansion, as I know of at least one transgender female advocate who has recently used the Ladies Room there in plain sight of security guards with no issue.People are leaving the state in droves because of Governor McCrory. I’m choosing to stay put. I will not let this man chase me out of my beloved home state. I’m staying to see him led out of office and replaced by someone who can begin to repair and restore the state that I love so much. I’d also like to address McCrory directly. Lord knows I’ve already sent enough e-mails that go unanswered, so, what the heck? I’ll just focus my energy blogging about it instead. So, here goes:Pat McCrory, I am sickened by your continued use of phrases like “a boy who thinks he’s a girl, but is still a boy,” or this notion you keep implanting of boys in dresses, a notion that severely undermines transgender and gender non-conforming people. Pat, allow me to direct you to a little education. We’ll call it Transgender 101. Lesson one is simple: Transgender girls are girls. They are not “boys in dresses.” But to really understand transgender people, or Native American “two-spirit” people, or gender non-conforming people is much deeper than that. We’ll save that for another day. Right now, the issue I have with raising a young, impressionable, gender non-conforming boy, is why do you feel the need to use this notion of “boys in dresses” ad nauseam ?” Why not “girls in pants?” I’ll tell you why not. Because the assumption of blockheads like you, Pat, is that ALL boys are predators, and women are meek, lowly figures who need protection at all costs, especially in public restrooms and locker room facilities.My husband and I were blessed with one of each type of child: a cisgender (meaning biological sex assigned at birth and sex they identify with jives) 16-year-old male, a cisgender 14-year-old female, and a gender non-conforming 10-year-old boy who prefers all things sparkly, pink, frilly, and soft. He is on a journey right now. In fact, he has been all of his life. He is sorting through his gender identity and right now he identifies as neither male nor female, but some combination of both. It’s a notion I wouldn’t expect you to understand (I can hear you right now saying, “bless his heart, he’s so confused”) but actually, my husband and I see this as a gift, and so does he. There is no confusion. Regardless, because he’s a gender-bender, my son is actually one of those “boys in dresses” that you keep taunting, and I’d like you to know that he is the exact opposite of a predator. Anyone who knows my son will vouch for his peaceful, loving, accepting spirit, and avoidance of confrontation. In fact, with this climate you’ve recently created, he’s so scared for his own safety right now that he doesn’t even use either restroom in public. He looks for gender neutral, or family bathrooms so that he can avoid confrontation of any kind.I promise you, Pat, when my gender non-conforming child actually works up his nerve to wear one of his beloved dresses in public, HE is the one who has to fear for his safety. Because you, Governor McCrory, are only interested in protecting a minuscule fraction of society (women whom you perceive as needing some sort of predator protection in public accommodations), you don’t protect the greater good; you don’t seem to understand that a transgender man who opts not to have bottom surgery (that means having a penis built onto his body), but for all intents and purposes looks and dresses exclusively male on the outside, is now guaranteed to be in the women’s restroom, because he was born without a penis. A very masculine looking man going into the women’s room, because that’s what this law actually looks like. Let that sink in. I give a sarcastic slow clap in your general direction for managing to vote IN to law exactly what you were trying to vote OUT of law.McCrory, you have hand-fed the very ignorant monsters who perpetuate this perverted predator in the restroom myth. YOUR people are the dangerous people. Not this notion of boys in dresses. Boys in dresses are not yet the same thing as transgender girls, but they’re still in some stage of transformation. Boys who wear dresses in public (which is, yet again, different than “drag queens,” or “cross-dressers,” - refer back to Transgender 101, basic vocabulary) are some of the bravest, fiercest, most sincere souls walking this earth. Do you have ANY idea how much bravery it takes for a young boy to wear a dress in public? It takes balls of steel, and I’m not sure how much more “manly” it gets than that.Pat, YOUR people are the monsters, the predators. YOUR people are the ones to fear, the ones who would laugh at, question, or have a physical altercation with my young son, or me, or his dad, because he chooses to wear a dress. And this isn’t even happening in public bathrooms. The damage he endures happens out in public, in broad daylight.Pat, you have no idea what you’re doing. You are completely blind to the irony of the situation you have created, when just months ago, no one was the wiser, and transgender people peed beside cisgender people all along. Also, this scare tactic you’re using just doesn’t work. The psychological profile does not fit. First of all, the type of man who would be so sick as to sexually assault children is more often than not a person known to and trusted by the family. Not a stranger in the bathroom. These horrific incidents happen after months, years even, of a sexual predator who has groomed and earned the family’s trust and the child’s adoration. Someone like a scout leader, martial arts teacher, church leader, or even a beloved uncle. That’s who is committing these crimes. Not a stranger in the bathroom. Focus on that. Secondly, the psychological profile does not fit the type of cisgender, straight man you are talking about, the one you are assuming would “dress up like a transgender woman to enter the women’s room in order to sexually assault a woman.” The type of man who would sexually assault a woman in the first place is a man who, at his very core, has a deep-seated, intense hatred of women. He would never “stoop” to the level of dressing like a woman and going out in public as a woman, even if it was a means to achieve his sick purpose. This type of man hates women so much that he would never be caught dead posing as one. And to further prove that point, there are zero incidents that have ever occurred because a man decided to slap on a dress in order to sexually assault or even peep in women’s stalls. Finally, one last point. Despite your law, which is completely unenforceable to begin with, sexual assault, and “peeping” in bathrooms are totally separate issues, and are still a crime, regardless of who’s doing it.My husband and I cannot flush you and your legacy down the toilet fast enough.#WeAreNotThisOriginally published at www.gendercreativelife.com"

Your ‘type’ changes drastically as time goes by. Especially in your mid to late twenties. You start looking for deeper and more solid qualities like responsibility, honesty and integrity instead of someone you can just have fun with. You begin to appreciate a partner you can talk to about meaningful things, about your problems, about your family and about your work because as you grow up, the things that matter to you change drastically too.2. Finding the right career is more important than getting married. Finding the right career for you is the most rewarding gift you can give yourself. It will give you something to look forward to and will always motivate you to grow and learn new things. It will make you a better person and a happier person and you will not have to depend on love to make you happy.3. Modern dating sucks but it really teaches you a lot. Modern dating sucks but with every dating disaster that happens to you, you learn one more thing about yourself and about the person you are looking for. You also learn how to love yourself and you learn that sometimes you have to choose being alone instead of being with someone who is not treating you right or someone who doesn’t want to define the relationship.4. Invest in a few good friends. Your friends will be your support system forever. The better friends you have, the easier your life will be. Good friends will get you through almost anything in life. Pick them wisely and you will always find someone to lean on when life gets rough. They will be your main backbone.5. Don’t settle. Don’t date someone just because you’ve been single for so long or because all your friends are married. Don’t stay in a relationship that is not good for you because it’s comfortable and don’t hold on to someone who doesn’t love you the way you deserve to be loved.6. You have to know who you are before getting married. Getting married when you’re in an unsteady place in your life makes you count on the relationship as the main source of your happiness and makes you follow your partner’s footsteps without stopping to ask yourself if this is what you really want.7. Kids are not the answer. Having kids does not mean you secured a spot in marriage paradise, if anything, it’s the ultimate test to determine how strong the marriage is. People who have kids when they’re not ready are really just setting their marriage up for disaster.8. You will not ‘lose’ your married friends. I think this is the biggest misconception – that you will not be talking to your friends who got married. Once they get past the honeymoon phase, everything will be back to normal and they will still be a phone call away.9. You can make things happen alone. You can get your dream job or buy that house or travel to this country without anyone’s help or approval. When you are growing up without being committed to someone, you truly have the world in your hands and you can just do whatever you want and you can become whoeveryou want. Being independent is a wonderful thing that will make you rich in so many ways. In this day and age, being single is actually a privilege — depending on the way you look at it.10. Marriage is also not the answer. I mentioned earlier that kids are not the answer but marriage is not the answer either. If you didn’t learn to find your happiness alone, you won’t find it in your marriage, if you didn’t learn to love yourself when you’re single, you won’t love yourself when you’re married, if you didn’t find yourself before marriage, you won’t find yourself after marriage.People are told that marriage is what makes them complete but the truth is nothing can complete someone but themselves, their experiences, their passions, their hearts, their intelligence and their strength.Learn more about the author of this post Rania Naim by following her on Facebook here.Read more from Thought Catalog:The Search For Something More: A Guide For Those Trying To Heal Themselves10 Stunning Haruki Murakami Quotes That Will Make You Think And Feed Your Soul At The Same TimeHow To Ruin Your Life (Without Even Noticing That You Are)Follow us on Instagram: Thought Catalog"
