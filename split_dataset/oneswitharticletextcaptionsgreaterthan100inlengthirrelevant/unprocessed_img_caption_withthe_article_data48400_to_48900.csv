The largest single payment was $3.5 million.Manafort has denied allegations - first made in the New York Times on Monday - that he received cash payments worth more than $12 million over five years that were itemized on secret ledgers belonging to Yanukovich’s Party of Regions.Ukrainian anti-corruption investigators have corroborated the existence of what they called a “black ledger” of payments made by Yanukovich’s party but stressed that they could not establish whether Manafort himself received money.Leshchenko, a member of President Petro Poroshenko’s parliamentary faction, called on Ukrainian authorities to send a request for assistance to Washington to investigate Manafort.“Manafort didn’t work for free in Ukraine, he served the Party of Regions for over 10 years and it is clear that his work was paid,” Leshchenko told a news conference.“The money was transferred in cash and it is impossible to trace the transactions, but I have no doubt as to the authenticity of these documents,” he said.“If Mr Manafort denies any allegations, I think he has to be interrogated into this case and prove his position that he was not involved,” Leshchenko added.Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign has previously said the allegations were evidence of “more troubling connections between Donald Trump’s team and pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine.”Trump, a Republican, has spoken favorably in the past of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last month, he invited Russian hackers to find “missing” emails from Clinton’s time as secretary of state, when she used a private email server to conduct government business, although he later described that call as sarcasm.In response to the earlier report in the New York Times, Manafort denied any impropriety in a statement on Monday. “I have never received a single ‘off-the-books cash payment’ as falsely ‘reported’ by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia,” he said.Trump overhauled his top political team this week, demoting Manafort, who was brought on as campaign chief in June to professionalize its approach but struggled to get the wealthy businessman to rein in his freewheeling ways.(Writing by Matthias Williams; editing by Mark Heinrich)"

During a recent interview with Huffington Post writer Leigh Blickley, the actor gushed about his wife, while promoting his new film, “The Hollars,” which he directed and stars in. “That is legitimately my greatest achievement, and I’m OK saying that,” Krasinski said of being married to Emily Blunt.In fact, Krasinksi later admitted that he is so taken with Blunt that the first time he heard her sing during rehearsals for “Into the Woods,” he was overwhelmed with emotion. (Side note: If you haven’t heard Blunt’s rendition of “Moment in the Woods” from the movie musical, please reevaluate your priorities.) “I came to visit and they were doing the pre-records on ‘Into The Woods,’ and I remember [director] Rob Marshall turning to me and he said, ‘It’s so great,’ and I said, ‘Yeah, I’ve never seen her sing,’” he told Entertainment Tonight. “Rob Marshall did the slowest double take of all time and then queued a 125-piece orchestra and she started singing and I just wept. I told you that I am a crier, it doesn’t take much.” The couple recently welcomed their second child, Violet, in June and are already parents to 2-year-old Hazel, who was born in February 2014. According to Krasinski, becoming a father has permanently changed his outlook on life for the better, impacting not only his relationship with his own daughters, but also to the world. “All the clichés of parenting are true and you feel all sort of new things,” Krasinski told Entertainment Tonight at the premiere of “The Hollars.” “It was really this new existential magnet that you feel draw to your family ... and you understand your parents more, you understand your brothers’ relationships more, you understand even your family’s name. That you are from somewhere.”But it seems like the new father has found no greater joy than in watching his a love develop between the new siblings. “She’s amazing,” he added about his oldest daughter. “She really loves the baby and I think there is this idea of, ‘Oh my God, she is adorable.’ I mean when a 2-and-a-half-year-old hugs a newborn baby it’s one of the cutest things you will ever see.”Too cute. Can’t handle. Watch a trailer for “The Hollars” below: "

While playing stops in Charlotte and Raleigh, the band handed out hats that read “No hate in our state” with a symbol representing gender inclusivity for all. The Dixie Chicks spoke about the hats, which are a direct hit against North Carolina’s discriminatory “bathroom bill.” The anti-LGBT law, known as House Bill 2 or HB2, denies transgender people the ability to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity and enables discrimination against queer people living in the state. After North Carolina passed the “bathroom bill” in March, many entertainers ― like Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam, Maroon 5 and Nick Jonas and Demi Lovato — canceled their NC shows.“We have a favor to ask,” Natalie Maines told the Raleigh crowd, according to the News & Observer. “Since we didn’t cancel our show — you’re also the only state we bought gifts for — could you pull out the hats that we gave you? ’Cause we love to support positivity. Peace and love, peace and love.” Now can anyone snag us one of those hats?The Huffington Post receives a percentage from the purchase of tickets bought via a link on this page."
4,MEDIA,Trump's Campaign Is Looking More And More Like An Elaborate Media Launch,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-media-business_us_57b5b88ce4b034dc7325d29b,"If there's one thing we know about The Donald, it's that he loves being in the spotlight.",2016-08-18,Donald Trump has reportedly talked of building a media business after the presidential campaign is over.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Trump TV? Trump News? Trumpbook?The working assumption lately among media and politics watchers is that if Donald Trump loses in November, he’ll follow his true passion: media stardom. Vanity Fair’s Sarah Ellison reported in June that Trump was already discussing plans for a “mini-media conglomerate” that would presumably leverage the supporters he’s drawn to his presidential candidacy over the past year. On Wednesday, The New York Times added to the growing speculation about Trump’s post-election agenda. Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, publisher of the New York Observer, “have quietly explored becoming involved with a media holding, either by investing in one or by taking one over,” the Times reported. Trump has always been a creature of the media, an incessant self-promoter who’s seemed to relish both courting and criticizing the press. For decades, he was perhaps the most accessible celebrity in New York City. He still can’t stop himself as a presidential candidate, despite attacking the “dishonest” media constantly at rallies and on his Twitter feed. He routinely bashes The New York Times, yet talks to the paper regularly. He banned The Washington Post from his rallies over a perceived slight, but still gave its reporters 20 hours of interviews for an upcoming book. He’s scaled back his TV presence, but still makes time for Fox News. Throughout the campaign, Trump has bragged about his social media following, TV ratings and ubiquity on magazine covers, while complaining that the networks are getting rich off his candidacy. Trump’s media obsession was evident in a June interview with The Hollywood Reporter: He appeared stumped by a question about Brexit, just weeks before the vote, yet offered opinions on specific executives at CNN, NBC, CBS, Fox News, Viacom and 21st Century Fox. (Now, of course, Trump is declaring that he’ll one day be known as “Mr. Brexit.”)Trump’s inner circle is also filled with media figures. Kushner has been one of his closest advisers throughout the race, and he’s now reportedly getting debate prep from Roger Ailes, the disgraced former Fox News chairman and veteran Republican operative. On Wednesday, Trump hired Steven Bannon, a former banker and executive chairman of the unflinchingly pro-Trump outlet Breitbart News, to run his campaign. It should be surprising that a Republican nominee would hire a fiery right-wing media executive with no campaign experience to lead his team through the final three months of a presidential election. And yet, to Breitbart critics and Breitbart staff alike, it all makes a weird sort of sense.“I consider myself pretty perceptive, so I won’t say I was shocked,” Alex Marlow, editor-in-chief of Breitbart News, told The Huffington Post on Wednesday. “But it’s definitely one of these things where you can’t fully believe it until you see that headline.”“As someone who heard [Bannon] openly boast about his close proximity and relationship with the campaign ... it’s both surprising but, when you really think about it, not,” Kurt Bardella, a former Breitbart News spokesman-turned-critic, told HuffPost. The hiring of Bannon has only added to a growing sense that Trump’s endgame is more about drawing an audience to himself than bringing voters to the ballot box. The notion that a presidential candidate would be competing hardest in the waning months of an election for potential subscribers or viewers down the line is unprecedented in American politics. But Trump’s recent actions have suggested to a number of journalists and political operatives that his greatest ambition might not be the White House.After I tweeted the Times’ nugget about Trump and Kushner’s media aspirations, the overwhelming response boiled down to: “Of course.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

6,POLITICS,"For Conservative Press, The Post-Trump Reckoning Can't Come Soon Enough",Sam Stein and Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservative-press-trump_us_57b506f5e4b034dc7325a2d7,"""There are elements of the entertainment wing of the Republican Party that need to be dealt with.""",2016-08-18,"Now a Clinton supporter, Brock made his name in conservative press. He sees some similarities with what's happening today in the media.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During the 1990s, no one had a run quite like The American Spectator. The conservative magazine’s clout grew after a series of critical investigations into Bill and Hillary Clinton on topics like Troopergate and Paula Jones. Circulation jumped from roughly 150,000 in late 1993 to nearly 300,000 a few months later. Its high-profile reporter, David Brock, became a veritable star. In cahoots with wealthy Republicans, the editors conceived of a way to capitalize on the magazine’s success. They dubbed it the “Arkansas Project” ― named after the state which Clinton had governed. But as quickly as prosperity came, it began to dissipate. As documented in a lengthy piece for The Atlantic by Byron York, the magazine began dabbling in conspiracies. It was accused of paying off a key witness to the Whitewater investigation. Credibility began to vanish, circulation slipped and the magazine’s financial stability became less certain.Decades later, the Spectator remains alive. But its influence is felt more as a cautionary tale than a mover of news and opinion. On the day it was announced that the CEO of another envelope-pushing, conspiracy-peddling conservative outlet ― Breitbart News ― was heading over to run Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, the parallels were inescapable. “This isn’t the first time we’ve seen something happen when a conservative media outlet destroyed its credibility,” Mark Hemingway, a senior writer for The Weekly Standard, said of Breitbart. Even Brock, now a prominent Hillary Clinton supporter, couldn’t escape the similarities. Breitbart “is the tip of the spear for lunatic anti-Clinton pseudo-scandals and conspiracy theories, [and] has perfected the style of writing propaganda under the guise of ‘reporting’ like an electronic Arkansas Project,” he said. But whereas his old haunt respected some traditional boundaries, he couldn’t say the same of the current incarnation. “Imagine the Spectator taking over a GOP presidential campaign?!!?” he wrote.The success of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, accompanied by a civil war within conservative media over his candidacy, was bound to produce a post-election reckoning. Breitbart’s Steve Bannon’s ascension from anti-establishment bomb-thrower to head of the Republican presidential campaign ― essentially the establishment ― has only accelerated the process. “There are a lot of people who will forever be tarred by their support for Donald Trump, and certainly Breitbart News is going to be part of that campaign,” said Amanda Carpenter, a former top staffer to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and a CNN commentator. “In one way, I hope that these alt right websites all jump on board the Trump campaign so we can have a clear referendum on who has real credibility and who doesn’t.” Added Hemingway: “There are elements of the entertainment wing of the Republican Party that need to be dealt with. The Sean Hannitys of the world would not be missed if they had a less large platform than they do now.” Few could express sincere shock over the Bannon news. The site has long been a Trump cheerleader (though its founder felt a bit differently). And Trump has rewarded it in kind with leaks, interviews and a mimicking of its self-described “populist, nationalist” style. The concern, instead, lies in the legitimization that Breitbart and others like it receive by being granted the head seat at the proverbial table. “There are a lot more racist and ignorant people in America that are now on the Internet,” said Kurt Bardella, a Republican operative who served two years as a Breitbart spokesman before quitting over the site’s allegiance to Trump. “I’m not saying all people from a certain ideology are racist or ignorant. What I’m saying is that if you’re racist or ignorant you are probably a Breitbart reader.”The alt-right media movement, embraced on Breitbart, certainly has dabbled in conspiracy theories and racist tropes. And that hasn’t gone unnoticed by conservative writers who fret about a broader stigmatization of their craft. But what concerns them too is that the alt-right has created what is in essence an un-reality ― in which their candidate of choice is only hampered by squishy Republicans and not his own foibles. “Steve Bannon really, truly seems to believe this idea that we’re on this cusp of this transformative political awakening. There’s this nascent national populist movement out there that is going to supplant traditional limited government conservatism and be the next sort of great awakening, the next great political movement,” said National Review senior editor Jonah Goldberg.  “He believes it, or at least I take him at his word he believes that stuff,” he continued. “Trump certainly has a lot of followers who believe that stuff. I think it is all bullshit. Which is not to say some of the things that motivate Trump supporters are illegitimate or not worth paying attention to. But this idea that there is a majority party in this country that is going to be nationalist of the sort of Le Pen variety, I just think is nonsense.” But if traditional conservative media is hoping for a reckoning, there is concern that the conditions might not be ripe. Unlike when William F. Buckley wielded the National Review to purge the Republican Party of members of the John Birch Society half a century ago, there is no authority figure to bring about the cleansing this time around. If anything, TV and radio hosts with some of the largest audiences in the conservative media universe are largely Trump allies. And unlike when the Spectator saw its readership decline, the modern media landscape ― with its easy points of access and low bars for entry ― makes it harder today to punish perceived bad actors.“There is nobody who has either the statutory authority or the moral authority to police the right,” said Matt Lewis, who examined the conservative media echo chamber and where the Republican Party had strayed from the Reagan era in his recent book, Too Dumb To Fail. “And so that’s not going to happen overnight. It’s not going to be suddenly the adults show up and take over and take the bad actors and force them to sit in the corner. That person doesn’t exist, and if he did exist, nobody would listen.” The incentives “are all perverse,” Lewis added. There may be a place for the “last honest man on earth” to call out the alt-right, but that job is “not incredibly profitable.”Not everyone is pessimistic about what the future has in store for the conservative press. Even with the ascendance of Breitbart, there remain highly capable outlets and respected reporters within that universe. And if the campaign ends in a fashion that most expect ― with a loss of massive proportions for the Republican nominee ― the biggest Trump cheerleaders will be called to task. Some, like Hannity immediately after the 2012 election, may explain how their views evolved. But even then, those who want to purge the movement of the people they believe have coopted it will have a bit of ammunition. “I look forward to that fight after the election,” said Goldberg. “I think it’s going to take place in a thousand different places. It’s going to take places in magazines, and in talk radio, and on college campuses and all the rest. And that’s a fight. And if you’re conservative and you’re not willing to have that fight, you might as well hang up your cleats and go home. That’s sort of why we’re here.”"
7,WOMEN,"Comment Sections Are Cesspools Of Rape Culture, Research Finds",Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/comment-sections-rape-culture_us_57b606bfe4b00d9c3a1647c0,"In news articles about sexual assault, 1 in 4 comments blame the victim.",2016-08-18,"About 16 percent of online comments offered supportive statements to sexual assault survivors -- but about one-quarter of the comments blamed them for being attacked, according to a recent study.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b62777170000d002d1fb5a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One-fourth of all online comments at the end of news articles about sexual assault and rape include victim-blaming statements, new research out of the University of Southern California shows.The study examined 52 articles and found that only one did not contain comments offering support for the accused perpetrator, the study said. Victim-blaming statements appeared in 1,097 of the 4,239 comments ― or just over 25 percent of them. “I was surprised that so many people were so mean about these victims,” Kristen Zaleski, associate professor at USC’s School of Social Work, told The Huffington Post. “Even knowing what I know about rape culture, I didn’t expect so much hate and judgment and discriminatory attitudes and othering ― there was a lot of othering.” Branded as a “first-of-its-kind study,” the researchers examined comments posted to rape-related articles published in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times between December 2014 and March 2015. In total, they looked at 52 newspaper articles covering everything from Bill Cosby’s accusers coming forward to the fallout from Rolling Stone’s flawed article on campus rape. If the accused perpetrator was a celebrity or public figure, the individual was more likely to receive support ― or commenters were more likely to attack the alleged victims. About 16 percent of all comments included statements of support for survivors, while 6 percent offered support to the accused assailants and 23 percent included “trolling” statements about law and society, the study concluded. Victims received more support and sympathy when the alleged perpetrator was not an American citizen or the assault occurred abroad. But in those cases, the victim-blaming comments were replaced by racist remarks.The researchers found that one of the most common victim-blaming responses was when commenters gave instructions to rape survivors ― for example, telling them that they should have gone to the police immediately.That’s not an uncommon reaction: This week, comedian Kurt Metzger went on an extended social media tirade about rape allegations against a fellow comedian, Aaron Glaser. Many of Metzger’s comments criticized victims of sexual assault for not immediately reporting their attacks to cops.Comments like this send an implicit message to rape victims that “If this is true, report it,” Zaleski said. “It’s very directive and almost dismissive.”In articles about celebrities accused of rape, readers would suggest there was a conspiracy afoot. In an article about Bill Cosby, for example, a commenter said that “anyone who doesn’t recognize the political agenda behind these attacks on Cosby hasn’t been paying attention.”Other commenters suggested that the survivor’s story was too unbelievable to be real or that too much time had passed for it to be real. They also accused victims of playing the “rape card,” or suggested they made up the charges after getting too intoxicated.“There needs to be a law to protect men and teenage boys from charges made against them for rape or sexual misconduct by women and girls who are stupid enough to get drunk and allow this to happen then turn around and blame the male,” one commenter cited in the study said. The researchers also discovered a lot of disbelief that men could be assaulted. For example, one comment read: “Ask any guy, it is impossible for any man, especially a teenager, to be ‘raped’ by an NFL cheerleader!”Some of the comments that blamed the victim also fell under the “trolling” category. These were more likely to bring up ― and then dismiss ― the idea of “rape culture,” denying that sexism, bigotry and inequality create a toxic environment that encourages rape. Conversations about “rape culture” in comment sections often turned into debates about statistics. “The people who had opinions about who’s to blame, who were basically blaming the survivors or victims, they would use the words ‘rape culture,’” Zaleski said. “They would be somewhat up on the topic and [say] it was bullshit, and one of the ways they would do that is talk about false reporting.”Often, someone would defend the survivors in the comment sections by posting links to articles about how rare false accusations are, Zaleski explained. The victim-blaming commenters would question the source of the stats, and then there would be a data conversation, she said. The study, “Exploring rape culture in social media forums,” will be published in the October 2016 issue of Computers in Human Behavior.______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter who covers sexual violence and is based in New York.

8,POLITICS,The Mayor In This City Goes Door To Door To Increase Student Success,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steps-to-success-high-school_us_57b60e1ae4b00d9c3a165ba4,"""I try to think of it as, one heart, one mind at a time.""",2016-08-18,"Tucson Unified School District Superintendent Dr. H.T. Sánchez, right, talks to a teen about why he should re-enroll in school.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b60f5a170000d002d1faec.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sometimes getting a student back in school is as simple as a knock on the door.Since 2014, the Mayor of Tucson, Arizona, and other local community leaders and volunteers, have spent a few days each year going door-to-door urging high school dropouts to re-enroll. The small act has led to big results. The initiative, called Steps to Success, has encouraged at least 384 students to re-enroll in Tucson schools. Earlier this month,Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild and community leaders like University of Arizona basketball players, continued the tradition. The city of Phoenix, led by Mayor Greg Stanton, held its own version of the initiative.The idea came about several years ago in a conversation between Rothschild and the superintendent of Tucson Unified School District Dr. H.T. Sánchez. “We were sitting round talking about different ways we could work together,” Rothschild said. “I said, ‘You know I would just like to do something we can go out and do and it works.’” Sánchez had done something similar at a district in Texas where he previously worked, where “people got together and walked around the neighborhoods and brought kids back to school,” Rothschild said. From there, the mayor enlisted the help of community leaders like local news anchors, the police chief and the fire chief to go door-to-door and talk with students about the importance of a high school degree. Sometimes, a little urging was all the student needed to finish school, Rothschild said. “A lot of times they cant identify a good reason [why they’re not in school],” he said. “They may have gotten a job in a fast food restaurant, or a boyfriend they wanted to spend time with, or a girlfriend. ... The idea of the program is to deliver a message of community support. There are people in the community who want you to succeed and extra academic assistance is there for you.” Anthony Valenzuela, 19, is one of the students whose life was impacted by Steps to Success. Valenzuela had finished the 12th grade in Tucson, but was just a few credits short of getting his high school degree. After community leaders came to his house in July 2015, he re-enrolled and graduated in December. He is now a student at a vocational training program for collision repair. Valenzuela’s family doesn’t have a long history of academic success. Neither his biological brother or foster mother graduated high school. So when anchors from a local news channel showed up his door last summer, he recalls that “it changed my life.” Rothschild and a group of partnering organizations and state leaders hope to further expand the initiative across the state and country.“It’s not a difficult program.

The small act has led to big results. The initiative, called Steps to Success, has encouraged at least 384 students to re-enroll in Tucson schools. Earlier this month,Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild and community leaders like University of Arizona basketball players, continued the tradition. The city of Phoenix, led by Mayor Greg Stanton, held its own version of the initiative.The idea came about several years ago in a conversation between Rothschild and the superintendent of Tucson Unified School District Dr. H.T. Sánchez. “We were sitting round talking about different ways we could work together,” Rothschild said. “I said, ‘You know I would just like to do something we can go out and do and it works.’” Sánchez had done something similar at a district in Texas where he previously worked, where “people got together and walked around the neighborhoods and brought kids back to school,” Rothschild said. From there, the mayor enlisted the help of community leaders like local news anchors, the police chief and the fire chief to go door-to-door and talk with students about the importance of a high school degree. Sometimes, a little urging was all the student needed to finish school, Rothschild said. “A lot of times they cant identify a good reason [why they’re not in school],” he said. “They may have gotten a job in a fast food restaurant, or a boyfriend they wanted to spend time with, or a girlfriend. ... The idea of the program is to deliver a message of community support. There are people in the community who want you to succeed and extra academic assistance is there for you.” Anthony Valenzuela, 19, is one of the students whose life was impacted by Steps to Success. Valenzuela had finished the 12th grade in Tucson, but was just a few credits short of getting his high school degree. After community leaders came to his house in July 2015, he re-enrolled and graduated in December. He is now a student at a vocational training program for collision repair. Valenzuela’s family doesn’t have a long history of academic success. Neither his biological brother or foster mother graduated high school. So when anchors from a local news channel showed up his door last summer, he recalls that “it changed my life.” Rothschild and a group of partnering organizations and state leaders hope to further expand the initiative across the state and country.“It’s not a difficult program. It requires a school district willing to put in a little time and some organization but we’ve got the blueprint. I try to think of it as, one heart, one mind at a time,” Rothschild said. “If I can bring one kid back to high school and get them to graduate ... That’s a huge contribution.”"

But Brazilian sources told ABC News on Thursday that the swimmers had lied, claiming surveillance video showed one of them fighting with a gas station security guard and causing damage to a restroom on the night of the alleged incident. The athletes damaged the bathroom door and the police were called to the gas station, located in Barra da Tijuca. The gas station owner told the O Globo newspaper that the swimmers had urinated on a side wall at his premises and that they even had an image of the butt of one of the swimmers. He said that gas station staff had pointed out the bathroom, but the swimmers urinated on the wall anyway. The owner called the incident “pure vandalism.”NBC News reported that the security guard had pulled a gun on the swimmers, but a police official told the AP that the guard never drew a gun. Reuters reported on Thursday that the athletes paid for the damage in cash. Two of the swimmers involved in the incident, Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz, were removed from a U.S.-bound flight on Wednesday night and detained by Brazilian officials. They told officials the story had been fabricated, the AP reported.A judge issued an order Wednesday to seize the passports of Lochte and the fourth Swimmer, James Feigen, but Lochte was already back in the U.S. “The three U.S. Olympic swimmers (Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger and James Feigen) are cooperating with authorities and in the process of scheduling a time and place today to provide further statements to the Brazilian authorities,” Patrick Sandusky, a United States Olympic Committee spokesperson, said in a statement. “All are represented by counsel and being appropriately supported by the USOC and the U.S. Consulate in Rio.” Mario Andrada, a spokesman for Rio 2016, said the swimmers should be forgiven.“Let’s give these kids a break. Sometimes you take actions that you later regret. They are magnificent athletes,” Andrada said during a Thursday briefing. “Lochte is one of the best swimmers of all time. They had fun. They made a mistake. It’s part of life. Life goes on. Let’s go.”Lochte changed some elements of his story in an interview with NBC’s Matt Lauer on Wednesday. While he initially said that a gun had been pointed at his head, he told Lauer that the gun was just pointed in his direction. Lochte also told Lauer that the swimmers had stopped at a gas station to use the bathroom when the incident occurred, while he originally said the men dressed as police officers had pulled them over.Luciana Sarmento contributed reporting from São Paulo, Brazil."

Some members of the public watched, although more danced to a nearby sound system playing salsa music.Venezuela has also bought laser technology to mark ammunition, Reverol said, in an attempt to keep a registry of the bullets given out to the South American nation’s many state and municipal police forces.Experts say that much of the ammunition used in crimes in Venezuela is made at the country’s government munitions factory and sold on by corrupt police."

In recent weeks, rights groups and locals have accused Russian-backed pro-government forces of targeting hospitals, violating a ceasefire meant for humanitarian aid delivery, and attacking the city with chlorine gas.At least 25 medical centers in the opposition area of Aleppo have been destroyed in strikes this year alone, according to the United Nations’ Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic.“Access to medical care in these areas is largely non-existent,” the commission said.Some of the city’s few remaining doctors penned an urgent plea to U.S. President Barack Obama, urging the international community to take action before the remaining survivors are killed in strikes or starved to death.“We do not need tears or sympathy or even prayers,” they said. “We need your action.”Support the organization providing medical care to Omran:"
15,POLITICS,Progressives Gear Up To Kill TPP In Lame-Duck Congress,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tpp-congress-vote_us_57b63e67e4b0b51733a274e2,But will they get help from Hillary Clinton?,2016-08-18,President Barack Obama alongside Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman (R). Froman led White House negotiations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b641fa170000ae02c741cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As Hillary Clinton’s election victory appears increasingly likely, liberal groups already have their sights on the next battle: defeating the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.President Barack Obama issued an official notification last Friday that he plans to submit the Trans-Pacific Partnership for a vote in Congress.While congressional Republican leaders must still green-light the votes, the move has confirmed for many progressive activists that the White House plans to go all-in for the accord during the lame-duck session of Congress after the November election.If brought for a vote right now, the prospects of the TPP passing the House would still be bleak. The law allowing the agreement to get a so-called fast-track vote ― no amendments, filibusters or other procedural hurdles ― relied heavily on Republican votes, and enough Republicans have now signaled their opposition to the TPP to ensure its defeat.But relying on the whims of Republicans during a lame-duck session of Congress is not something the labor unions and progressive netroots organizations want to bank on. Instead, they are preparing to devote resources to the TPP’s downfall in the coming months.Even before Obama’s action on Friday, many progressives decided to seek Hillary Clinton’s help driving nails into the TPP’s coffin.Two online progressive activism outfits, Democracy for America and CREDO, along with economist Robert Reich, are collecting signatures for a petition asking Clinton to publicly condemn a vote on TPP in the lame-duck session of Congress after the general election.CREDO has funded a digital video ad calling on Clinton to do the same.“Despite the fact that DFA is strongly supporting Sec. Clinton against the billionaire bigot she is running against, we are urging her strongly to stick with her agenda and go even further,” said Neil Sroka, communications director of Democracy for America.“There is this tendency in politics to treat this as a team sport where my side is always right and the other side is always wrong,” Sroka added. “Working hard and holding leaders accountable means being able to walk and chew gum at the same time ― pushing hard for our nominee and holding candidates accountable on issues that matter to us.”Asked for comment, the Clinton campaign did not explicitly respond to the idea of publicly opposing a vote on the trade deal. Instead, a spokesman directed HuffPost to Clinton’s remarks during an economic speech last week, in which she expressed her opposition to TPP in the strongest terms to date.“I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,” Clinton said while speaking at an advanced manufacturing facility in a suburb of Detroit, Michigan. “I oppose it now. I’ll oppose it after the election. And I’ll oppose it as president.” While progressive groups applauded Clinton’s comments, they were less pleased with the appointment Tuesday of former Colorado Democratic Sen. and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar as the head of her transition team. Salazar, who has a history of strong ties to the oil and gas industries, is a staunch proponent of the TPP and has promoted it in several op-ed columns.Progressives certainly have reason to doubt the depth of Clinton’s opposition to the TPP. She came around to opposing the deal last October under pressure from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), but spoke glowingly about it as secretary of state.And many fear a repeat of Obama’s bait-and-switch on trade. As a presidential candidate, he ran as something of a trade skeptic, claiming he would re-negotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement ― only to govern as a proponent of massive new trade agreements once in office.In the wake of the Salazar appointment, these progressives believe calling on Obama and Democratic leadership not to hold a lame-duck vote on the trade deal is the perfect way for Clinton to restore liberal confidence in her on the issue of trade.“If she were to do that, it would put to rest once and for all any uncertainty about her position ― and more importantly ensure that this agreement that she says is bad for the country does not become law,” said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch.Shane Larson, the legislative director of the Communications Workers of America, a leading TPP opponent and one of the few labor unions that backed Sanders in the primary, said that in lieu of joining calls to get Clinton more involved in the fight against TPP, the union is “focused on our congressional efforts right now.”Nonetheless, he added, “We support what CREDO and DFA are doing.”An example of CWA’s congressional approach is its withholding of endorsements from Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) and Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) over their support for the TPP, Larson said.The 700,000-member union, which represents many employees of Verizon, The Huffington Post’s parent company, is also planning a day of national action against the TPP in September. From now until the election, it will educate its members about candidates’ positions on the TPP, and hold protests and rallies at congressional offices. After the election, it plans to step up its lobbying efforts against a lame-duck vote. Should a vote become inevitable, it will fight against the deal’s passage. Meanwhile, the Rock the TPP tour, a band of anti-TPP musical acts led by Tom Morello, will include a series of TPP-themed shows, teach-ins and other creative actions throughout August and September.For now though, progressives’ greatest hope may actually be the candidacy of Donald Trump, who has exposed the depth of grassroots Republican voters’ aversion to free-trade deals. While it is hard to quantify exactly how Trump has affected congressional support for the TPP, it is indisputable that Trump’s ardent opposition to free-trade agreements has created a more hostile climate for TPP and agreements like it. In addition, the depressing effect of Trump’s flagging candidacy on down-ballot candidates has made GOP lawmakers favorable to the trade pact on the policy merits, less willing to take political risks.In the past month alone, 12 Republican House members who voted to approve fast-track authority for trade agreements have announced their opposition to the TPP, including Rep. Charles Boustany (R-La.), a Senate candidate in Louisiana and the chairman of the Friends of the TPP congressional caucus. In the Senate, Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), ardent free-traders facing touch reelection battles, have announced their opposition to the deal.The GOP’s challenge “is holding together a base of voters who are religiously conservative, but working-class and don’t have a college degree, and have been slammed by these trade agreements, and their cosmopolitan, wealthy donor class,” Wallach said. “What Trump has done is basically ripped that wide open.”But Wallach said she does not underestimate the power of a lame-duck president on a mission to enact what he believes is an essential component of his legacy. Public Citizen and its partners are preparing for a contentious battle after the election is over.“When you have a president desperate to have this happen in his last days in office, all bets are off,” she said."
