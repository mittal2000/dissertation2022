Munger, Sally’s father; An outtake from the wedding portraits taken by Sally’s father with his beloved Great Dane Tara in the background; From <em>Hold Still: A Memoir with Photographs</em> by Sally Mann",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b1f0801800002800bcad0f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the prologue to Sally Mann’s Hold Still: A Memoir with Photographs, we find the author in the attic of her family home in rural Rockbridge County, Virginia about to cut the twine on the first of many dusty cartons of family memorabilia: “I secretly hoped I’d find a payload of southern gothic: deceit and scandal, alcoholism domestic abuse, car crashes, bogeymen, clandestine affairs, dearly loved and disputed family land, abandonments, blow jobs, suicides, hidden addictions, the tragically early death of a beautiful bride, racial complications, vast sums of money made and lost, the return of the prodigal son, and maybe even bloody murder. . . And I did: all of it and more.”What follows is Mann’s personal history from childhood through her life as a wife and mother of three, her development as an artist and emergence as a nationally recognized photographer; as well as histories of the extended family around her. The thread that runs deeply throughout Hold Still is Mann’s love of and reverence for place. The Blue Ridge Mountains, the Shenandoah Valley, the family farm and the river that runs through it, create the backdrop for her best-known photographs, those of her children.Mann finds herself longing for home when she is sent away to school in Vermont:“Through it all, trying to sort out a whole new life, I ached for home. I missed the embrace of the gentle, ancient Blue Ridge and the easy sufferance of the gracious Shenandoah Valley. I missed Virginia, where sentimentality was not a character flaw, where the elegiac, mournful mood of the magnolia twilight quickened my poetry with a passion that, even read in the hot light of the next day, was forgiven, where the kindness of strangers was expected and not just a literary trope, where memory and romance were the coin of the realm.”We follow Mann through college, marriage and the birth of her children. We experience the excitement of her first proof sheet, her teacher’s praise and the excited letter she writes to her parents about it. We see her emerge as a critically acclaimed artist.We experience her pain and frustration on being labeled controversial on the national stage because of the decidedly non-prurient nude photos of her children in her book Immediate Family. We learn for the first time of a stalker who was “in love” with the children because of the photos and the toll it took on the entire family.Mann analyzes a series of eight photographs showing the slow progression from idea to masterpiece: involving day after day of waiting for the perfect light, hauling a huge 8x10 camera and heavy tripod over slippery rocks into the river, her son Emmet patiently posing in the cold river, until finally, on the eighth day she gets the perfect shot. We follow her as she roughs it through the deep south in her “mobile studio,” a Suburban fitted with a make-shift darkroom, stopping overnight in campgrounds or relying on the kindness of strangers for shelter.The entire volume is richly illustrated with Mann’s photography, family photos, letters and documents. The result is a perfect hybrid of illuminating, page-turning prose with a wealth of visuals ― either of which could stand on its own.A must-read.Cross-posted from Jane Chafin: Art, Books, Culture"

Upon landing, I have received scores of mostly obscene and sick calls, voicemails and text messages,” Pelosi told her colleagues, urging them to keep their phones and incoming text messages away from their family members and children.“This is a sad course of events, not only for us, but more importantly for our country,” said Pelosi, who earlier in the week blamed Russia for the cyber attack and called it an “electronic Watergate” akin to the 1972 burglary at Democratic Party headquarters that ultimately brought down Republican President Richard Nixon.John Ramsey, the House’s chief information security officer, sent a memo to lawmakers and aides whose information had been made public urging them to change passwords for all their accounts and to consider changing their non-House email addresses.He said the hacker had uploaded a spreadsheet with a mix of House and personal email addresses and cellphone numbers for “nearly every” House Democrat and “an assorted number of Republicans,” and similar information for hundreds of staffers.“Along with the Excel file, ‘Guccifer 2.0’ uploaded documents that included the account names and passwords for an assortment of subscription services used by the DCCC. Initial analysis identifies some members’ home addresses, along with their spouse’s name, marital status, and religion,” the memo said.U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that Guccifer 2.0 is an individual or group operating with or for the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency. Russia has denied involvement in the breach.The potential Russian involvement in the cyber attack has ignited a fierce campaign debate, with Democrats accusing the Russians of trying to aid Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.But U.S. officials suspect the operation and others directed at the DNC and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign were more likely an attempt to pursue email chains into classified networks or in search of national security policy information than to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. election.“The Russian assumption probably is that it doesn’t matter much who wins the election, because Wall Street and other powerful lobbies really run the country,” one of the officials said on Saturday, speaking like the others on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments.“The old Soviet belief hasn’t faded completely when it comes to foreign policy,” the official said.(Additional reporting by John Wolcott; Editing by Paul Simao)"

The credentials allow reporters access to press-only areas of his campaign events. He has already banned other outlets, including The Washington Post.On Saturday, the New York newspaper published an article detailing failed efforts to make Trump focus his campaign on the general election.“These are the most dishonest people,” Trump said. “Maybe we’ll start thinking about taking their press credentials away from them.”Trump visiting Connecticut, a heavily Democratic state, raised eyebrows among many Republicans.“It’s asinine that he would be in Connecticut holding a public rally less than 90 days before the election,” said Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak. “You don’t see Hillary publicly campaigning in Idaho and Mississippi. I have to think this proves the candidate is running the campaign, which explains why it’s such a disaster of biblical proportions.”At several points the crowd chanted “lock her up,” a frequent campaign rally chant in reference to Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.Trump told the crowd that normally he responds by saying he intends instead to defeat her in the Nov. 8 election, but this time added, “You know what? You have a point!”Trump also dropped his recent efforts to say he was not being serious when he said Obama was the “founder” of the Islamic State militant group .“It’s the opinion of myself and a lot of people that he was the founder,” Trump told the crowd.Democrats and Republicans alike have criticized Trump’s assertion as patently false.Trump took a detour from attacking Clinton’s economic record to discuss the 1998 scandal involving White House intern Monica Lewinsky and former President Bill Clinton, whom Republicans attempted to remove from office.“Remember when he said, he did not have sex with that woman, and a couple of weeks later, oh you got me,” Trump said, to cheers. He then made reference to a blue dress that became a symbol in the investigation. “I’m so glad they kept that dress, so glad they kept that dress, because it shows what the hell they are.”(Editing by Sandra Maler)"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by an astonishing 20 points in the Democratic primary.Based on the CBS/YouGov results, Clinton is winning the state by an even greater margin than President Barack Obama did in 2012 when he beat his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, by 6 points.HuffPost Pollster, which aggregates publicly available polls, shows Trump trailing Clinton 34 percent to 40 percent.New Hampshire holds only 4 electoral votes, but as polls show Trump behind in several critical battleground states, he increasingly can’t afford to lose the Granite State. Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight polls-only and polls-plus model projects that if Clinton wins New Hampshire, it could push her to victory, even if she loses in major swing states like Ohio and Florida. CBS/YouGov finds that Trump is losing badly among women in the state, and his chances for recovery in that demographic appear slim. Just 29 percent of New Hampshire women polled say they support Trump, while 51 percent support Clinton. In addition, 91 percent of the state’s female respondents say they are unlikely to change their minds.Trump holds just a 4-point edge over Clinton among male voters in New Hampshire.The GOP nominee is also having more trouble uniting his party than his rival. Seventy-eight percent of New Hampshire Republicans support Trump, but 93 percent of New Hampshire Democrats support Clinton.CBS/YouGov also shows Trump losing in Florida by 5 points to Clinton. He’s ahead in Georgia, but only by 4 points. Georgia usually votes Republican and has not previously been considered a battleground state. This year, it’s looking like it could be a toss-up and might expand Clinton’s path to victory. According to HuffPost Pollster, Trump is 3 points behind Clinton in Florida and just 1 point ahead of her in Georgia. Recent polls have also shown Trump struggling in crucial Rust Belt states, as well as other critical swing states. HuffPost Pollster currently shows him trailing Clinton by 8 points nationally.CBS/YouGov surveyed 990 likely voters in New Hampshire, 1,194 in Florida, and 998 in Georgia online on August 10-12.

Read more here.PREVIOUSLY: Olympic gold medalist Ryan Lochte had a gun cocked and placed to his forehead during a robbery involving three other U.S. swimmers in Rio de Janeiro, he told NBC’s Billy Bush.The 12-time Olympic medalist said he was in a taxi with fellow gold medalists Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger and Jimmy Feigen early Sunday when several armed men posing as police officers confronted them.“They pulled out their guns, they told the other swimmers to get down on the ground — they got down on the ground. I refused, I was like, ‘We didn’t do anything wrong, so I’m not getting down on the ground,’” the 32-year-old said.That’s apparently when things got hairy.“The guy pulled out his gun, he cocked it, put it to my forehead and he said, ‘Get down,’ and I put my hands up, I was like, ‘Whatever.’ He took our money, he took my wallet — he left my cell phone, he left my credentials,” Lochte said.In a statement, the U.S. Olympic committee said that “all four athletes are safe and cooperating with authorities.”Lochte later released a statement on Instagram and Twitter that thanked his “family, friends and fans for the overwhelming support and concern I have received today.” “While it is true that my teammates and I were the victims of a robbery early Sunday morning, what is most important is that we are safe and unharmed,” the post read in part.Lochte’s mother, Ileana Lochte, who is in Rio, first reported the incident to Fox Sports News Australia. She said her son was heading to meet Brazilian swimmer Thiago Pereira when they were held up after stopping for gas. “They just took their wallets and basically that was it,” she later told USA Today. “I think they’re all shaken up.”She also said her son called her after the incident and described the encounter as “terrifying.”Lochte, Bentz and Conger earned gold medals after the U.S. men’s team dominated in the 4x200 freestyle relay. Feigen earned gold in the men’s 4x100 freestyle relay.A spokesman for the International Olympic Committee previously denied that the incident took place when reporters asked about it. Requests for comment from USA Swimming and the IOC were not immediately returned.This story was updated with Ryan Lochte’s statement and additional information after his interview with Billy Bush.For more Olympics coverage:Michael Phelps Ends Olympic Career With One More Gold Medal"

The dramatic footage shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, shows several men on a boat coming upon the woman’s bobbing car as she screams from inside, local station WAFB reported Saturday. (It’s unclear when the original footage was shot.) “Oh my god, I’m drowning,” a small voice says from inside.The men feverishly try to break through the car’s sealed back roof, without immediate success.Finally, one of the men successfully pierces through the fabric roof and after a few breathtaking seconds ― just as the car vanishes beneath the murky water ― the woman emerges.It’s then that she panics, realizing that her dog is not with her.“Maybe she’s gone,” one man suggests.“She better not be,” the woman replies, offering to go down and search herself.Her unidentified hero then takes one more dive beneath the water. He surfaces to collective gasps, holding a little white dog in his arms.The man, woman and dog then make their way to the nearby boat.The harrowing water rescue is just one of thousands that have taken place across southern portions of the state, according to the Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office.At a press conference Saturday, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) declared a state of emergency and said three people had died in the flooding. In March, floods throughout Louisiana and Mississippi killed four people and damaged thousands of homes.“This is unprecedented,” Edwards said. “Please don’t rely on your experiences in the past.”Rain is expected to fall across the Lower Mississippi Valley into Monday morning, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Flood watches have been issued for parts of southeastern Texas through Sunday evening. Flash flood warnings are also extended into Sunday morning for western parts of Louisiana.The NOAA stressed that many people who fall victim to flood waters fail to realize the water’s strength.“A mere 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock over an adult. It takes just 12 inches of rushing water to carry away a small car, while 2 feet of rushing water can carry away most vehicles,” NOAA warns on its website. “It is NEVER safe to drive or walk into flood waters.”"

Mayor Marion Barry, has died of a drug overdose, NBC Washington reports. He was 36. NBC4’s Tom Sherwood, who has covered the Barry family extensively, confirmed the younger Barry’s death after speaking with Cora Masters Barry, the ex-mayor’s widow, on Sunday. In 2015, Barry tried his hand at politics and ran for his father’s city council seat after the former mayor’s death, but he was unsuccessful, finishing in sixth place. Barry, who had commonly gone by “Christopher,” put his name on the ballot as Marion C. Barry. That same year, Barry narrowly avoided jail time over a disruption at a Washington bank where he allegedly threatened a teller he thought had a grudge against his family and smashed a security camera with a trash can.Since the early 2000s, Barry had trouble with “minor but serious skirmishes,” including driving and drug offenses, Sherwood said in an interview Sunday.“Ever since his mother died in 2007, he lost one of the anchors of his life,” Sherwood said. Effi Barry died of leukemia that year.Barry’s father, who died in 2014, was a powerful and controversial figure in D.C. politics, dubbed “mayor for life” for his long grip on that office.After holding office for 12 years, the elder Barry was famously arrested in an FBI sting operation in 1990 for using crack cocaine ― only to bounce back four years later to secure his fourth term as mayor. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that Marion Barry was dubbed “mayor for life” prior to his fourth term in office."

Wallace asked Pence whether the “sarcasm” argument was getting old.“I don’t think it’s getting old at all, Chris,” Pence said. “Donald Trump made his way through a very competitive primary because he spoke not like your typical politician, but just plainly, like your everyday American. And speaking plainly is exactly what the American people will anticipate in the course of this election, but more importantly, they’re going to have a president who tells the American people exactly what’s on his mind. And the American people are going to hear him and hear him loudly.” Trump’s poll numbers have been tanking since he had one of the worst weeks a U.S. presidential candidate has ever experienced on the campaign trail. He booted a mother with a crying baby from a political rally, insulted Ghazala Khan, a Muslim American woman who lost her son in the Iraq War, and said that if his daughter Ivanka were sexually harassed at work, he would expect her to just “find a new career.”  Pence said he is still “very confident” that he and Trump can win. “Stay tuned,” Pence said. “It’s still early in this campaign.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Hiddleston answered the question by saying everything and nothing at the same time.“We all live in a world where every phone has a camera and there’s nothing new, really, about the spotlight on me; I think that’s what happens when you’re a public figure,” he said. “I’ve learned that there are many sides to a story, and that sometimes there are a lot of stories out there which are false, and the hardest thing is to try to not let those falsehoods affect your own life. That’s what I would say.”Does that mean there are more sides to the Hiddleswift story? Is this his way of telling us, again, that he and Tay are in it for real? Will we ever know? Probably not. "

WADA immediately locked Ms. Stepanova’s account to prevent further access and notified her of the situation,” WADA said.“A subsequent investigation by WADA allowed the Agency to determine that no other athlete accounts on ADAMS have been accessed.”All athletes have to enter their details into ADAMS and register a time and location each day when and where they can be reached by doping testers in case of an out-of-competition test.Stepanova, praised by the international athletics body (IAAF) for her courage in stepping forward and revealing details on widespread doping in Russia, is still an active athlete and had attempted to compete in Rio.The International Olympic Committee, however, refused to admit her as a neutral athlete, as proposed by the IAAF.WADA said the incident came just days after what it said was “an alleged hack” of their website with some users receiving e-mails that looked as if they came from WADA urging them to enter their credentials.“WADA quickly investigated and immediately sent an e-mail to all ADAMS users, including a warning banner on the ADAMS home page, alerting them to these e-mails, which WADA would never send, and asking them to advise ADAMS support immediately if they were to receive such an e-mail.”"

Five were stabbed or burnt. A sixth suffered smoke inhalation as he came to the aid of the others. The assailant, a Swiss citizen, was also injured.“According to current information, a 27-year-old Swiss man poured out a flammable liquid. He was also armed with at least one knife. The liquid caught fire,” the statement said.Authorities did not yet know the motive for the attacks but a crime of passion was one possibility, Bruno Metzger of the St Gallen cantonal police said in an interview with welt.de.“A terrorism background still seems very, very far-fetched,” Metzger said.The assailant was in police custody, he said, but none of those injured - including the assailant - was responsive, so they could not be questioned.The police said a criminal inquiry was under way.Both a woman and the attacker were in critical condition, according to Swiss broadcaster SRF, citing the St Gallen police. The cantonal police did not respond to a request for further information by email and could not be reached by phone.The attack occurred at 2:20 p.m. (1220 GMT) as the train neared the Salez station on a trip between Buchs and Sennwald in St. Gallen, a canton in the northeast of the Alpine republic, the police statement said.It was the first attack of its kind in Switzerland in recent memory. In December 2015, a 33-year-old Swiss man broke into his neighbors’ house in Rupperswil and killed four people before setting the house on fire, an incident that shocked the country.(Additional reporting by Michael Shields, editing by Larry King)"
