Hayfork, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c463991700000011c762dd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rural Trinity County is home to 13,500 people in Northern California and marijuana production is rampant there. Along with Humboldt and Mendocino counties, Trinity comprises California’s “Emerald Triangle,” a region known for its prolific marijuana farming. Hayfork is Trinity County’s second largest town, and an area of concentrated production.Trinity has been subject to a series of natural resource economic booms: In the eras before marijuana, both the gold and timber industries thrived in its rugged expanse of mountains. Hayfork in particular was singularly tied to those economies. When the timber business went bust in the early 1990s, Hayfork’s economy tanked. The town, once home to seven timber mills, lost its final mill in 1996, and overnight 160 jobs were lost. Since then, the economy has failed to stabilize.In the wake of the timber industry’s collapse, many long-time locals turned to marijuana to support themselves, while at the same time early participants in the trade began moving to Hayfork to establish outdoor farms. In Hayfork, a town with no stoplights, no major banks or stores, no resources for higher education, and located two hours from the nearest urban center, the average price per acre of vacant land has skyrocketed from $17,071 in 2005 to $33,350 in 2015. Current property listings for undeveloped 1.5 acre parcels range from $75,000 to $150,000, breaking down to a value of $50,000 to $100,000 per acre.The passage of Proposition 215 in 1996 introduced a legal gray area that allowed for the use and cultivation of medical marijuana under state law, but didn’t provide a regulatory framework for sales, production, distribution or even qualification for medicinal use. In this quasi-legal context, the risk of producing and selling was reduced, and many people began growing — some for medicinal uses and some to sell on the black market for income. Two decades later, California’s cannabis industry is estimated to be worth billions. In the Emerald Triangle, where the industry was already present, marijuana has become a prevalent economic force, with growers taking advantage of the opportune convergence of inexpensive land, good growing conditions and significantly reduced legal exposure.The local sheriff’s department estimates there are 2,000 individual, private marijuana “grows” in Hayfork, a town with a population of about 2,500. Cultivation is both obvious and prevalent: It doesn’t take much effort to spot the many marijuana gardens within its boundaries — they are plainly visible from most roads in town, cropping up in backyards and behind fences. A windshield survey recently counted 42 observable cannabis gardens along a 7.2-mile stretch of Highway 3, the main route through town.Local bulletin boards are plastered with requests for marijuana work, complete with phone numbers and promises of discretion and trustworthiness. Notices posted in the local laundromat tell customers they aren’t allowed to wash clothes dirtied with marijuana, and exasperated warnings in some bars state that patrons aren’t allowed to smoke weed on the premises, while acceptance is taken for granted in other establishments, whose patrons get high on decks and patios outside. Conversations about the industry — troubleshooting pests and molds, the realities of the marijuana market, run-ins with law enforcement– are commonly overheard and easily shared, even with strangers.By common consensus, the cannabis industry is Hayfork’s primary economic driver. In 2015 an informal survey of the town’s workforce counted just 424 jobs, leaving self-employment options or commutes to work outside town as the next alternatives. Extensive interviews with law enforcement agencies and multiple residents suggest that a majority of townspeople are involved in the industry, and many — perhaps most — are producing and selling illegally. In this rarefied context, participation in the black market is an integrated component of life and culture. In Hayfork, marijuana farming has become the new normal.The prevalence of Hayfork’s marijuana industry has been uniquely shaped by economic hardship. The polar ends of the trade — law enforcement and small-scale black market marijuana farmers – share a common relationship to marijuana that is defined by financial strife. On one side, a significant funding handicap has stymied law enforcement, allowing the marijuana industry to proliferate; on the other, poverty, economic struggle and a lack of alternatives have provided an incentive for many locals to dive into the black market.(Note: Some names and identifying characteristics have been changed for this article.)Mary is a mother in her 30s who is a part-time working professional and also grows and sells marijuana. Like many marijuana farmers, she straddles legal and illegal activity – producing marijuana under nebulous state law, and selling it on the black market. A Northern California native, she eventually purchased a home in Trinity County in 2009 and began farming shortly afterward.“I hadn’t planned on farming,” she says, “but when I assessed the reality of my situation, as a single person working part time, when I started really looking at my costs living here, it was clear that I would need something to supplement my income a little bit. In the first couple years [marijuana] basically just paid for property improvements. It paid for things that would pop up and take a couple of grand that I wouldn’t have in savings. It helped pay my mortgage.”Since then, Mary has maintained an outdoor cannabis garden that produces an annual crop harvested in the fall. She deliberately keeps her garden small, never cultivating more than 15 plants, a strategy she has adopted to minimize her risk in a morass of incomplete and evolving regulations. Mary’s earnings from her comparatively small garden have typically fallen between $5,000 and $10,000 a year. Now she has a partner, Sam, who works in construction and carpentry, and they have a 3-year-old daughter. Mary earns about $23,000 a year at her job and Sam does piecemeal work landscaping, logging and at construction gigs. They are continuing a small-scale farm to help them generate funds to develop a construction business for Sam, a move they hope will offer them long-term financial stability.The money from their garden will be used to purchase start-up equipment such as tools and reliable transportation. Without this income helping to build a local business, Sam would have to travel for work, which would make childcare difficult and also put a strain on the family.“I just need one more good year [of farming marijuana] and I won’t need to do that garden ever again,” Sam says. “But a new truck right now will be helpful.”Mary is just one of many everyday people who are dipping into California’s weed trade. Now a vast network, much of the industry is supported by those who have turned to marijuana farming to support themselves, supplement their income or alleviate financial struggles. Marijuana growers are retirees, college graduates, single parents, teachers and many others with legitimate jobs or a lack of better alternatives. The California Growers Association, a marijuana farmer advocacy group, calculates that there are at least 40,000 independent, private-land marijuana grows in California that provide an estimated 250,000 jobs. In many rural communities like Hayfork, where poverty and unemployment are high, marijuana has become a significant source of work.“For the last 40 years this product has been the backbone of rural California,” says Hezekiah Allen, CGA’s executive director. “This really is the product that keeps a lot of families fed, quite frankly. Rural California is not an affluent place.”In Hayfork, underdevelopment has simultaneously limited alternative employment options and tax-based sources of funding. Trinity County has a large amount of federal and state-owned land (about 75 percent) and a low population base, meaning that property and sales tax revenues are dismally low, and state funding allocations, typically based on population, are limited as well. The result is that county services and law enforcement are underfunded, and economic growth is stunted by isolation and limited development space. The few job options in Hayfork outside the marijuana industry generally don’t pay competitive wages. Currently about a quarter of the population lives in poverty.The funding realities of the Trinity County Sheriff’s Department are bleak. Its budget supports only eight deputies. “We don’t have enough staff to man the county 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which is the norm every place else,” says Sheriff Bruce Haney. “The last time we had 24/7 coverage was in 1994.”This means there are times when no active officers are on duty throughout the entire county. If there is an emergency call, an officer will be dispatched from his home, adding delay when response time can already be quite lengthy (commutes between communities can be as long as three hours). It also means that the department routinely enters into dangerous situations understaffed. “On a normal domestic violence call,” explains Deputy Omar Brown, “there would be five officers, but we will answer domestic violence calls with only one officer.”This lack of personnel also limits the department’s ability to gather evidence needed for prosecutions. “Legal surveillance, for example, requires 24-hour coverage, but we don’t have enough deputies to man a surveillance post for 24 hours,” Brown says. To offset these staffing gaps, the sheriff’s office requests support from other enforcement agencies, such as the Forest Service or California Highway Patrol to assist with raids or arrests — a system that is far from adequate or reliable, since these agencies generally can’t plan and schedule this kind of partnership effort in advance.Anticipated shifts in the status of marijuana as a drug are even impacting enforcement funding– Haney reports that additional funding for marijuana enforcement, such as grants, has become less available because of the uncertainty of regulation and of pot’s legal status.“Cannabis Eradication is a slowly diminishing source of funding,” says Haney, “and those grants come with strings. It ties our hands to a point. We need guys that can be out patrolling, not going to 10 meetings throughout the state, or tied to specific outcomes. They are not where our focus needs to be.”The department also struggles to offer competitive salaries, which makes recruitment and retention of personnel challenging. Starting wages for a sheriff’s deputy in Trinity County average $16 per hour, or about $30,000 per year, far lower than typical pay rates, which range between $58,000 and $96,000 annually.“It’s hard to get deputies to come work here,” says Brown. “And when they are here it’s hard to keep them.”The stark reality is that it’s impossible for eight deputies to take on thousands of marijuana grows. Already struggling with capacity, the department is also tasked with handling other criminal activity such as murder, theft and robbery. Marijuana is not always a priority, and the ongoing lack of marijuana enforcement has created a perception of relative lawlessness.As a result, marijuana cultivation has become a creeping issue for the sheriff’s department. Not only are more people farming, but their gardens are bigger. Many are attracted to the promise of profit, but the growing popularity of cannabis production has also created a supply glut that is driving down prices. While black market prices vary, local growers report significant drops in price. A pound that once netted $4,000 now sells for around $1,200 and sometimes as little as $800. This drop in profitability has caused many to increase their production to offset falling prices.“There are big grows and small grows, but the average is 150 to 200 plants,” says Deputy Brown. “If we had had [more resources] 10 years ago we would be looking at 36-plant grows.”Brown notes that even if funds were now more readily available, production is so rampant that effective management doesn’t seem like a viable outcome, a sentiment echoed by others in the department.“I think we [have] probably reached a point where it’s impossible to get it under control,” says Deputy Chris Compton. “Even with a staff of 20, it would take us years and years and years and years.”California is forging a regulatory path for its gray market marijuana industry, but there are still many undecided variables. In 2015 California passed legislation to regulate the medicinal marijuana industry but the permitting, licensing and fee systems won’t be finalized until 2018, and counties have the authority to develop their own cultivation ordinances as well. Additionally, the state passed a regulatory framework for medical marijuana in 2015, and Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA), a new initiative to regulate recreational marijuana, will be on this November’s ballot, potentially introducing yet another bureaucratic layer. These new regulations will shape the future of the industry, and in many ways will define who will be able to legally farm marijuana.While marijuana regulation will bring potential benefits, such as tax revenue, environmental protections and a regulated end product for the consumer, the accumulating costs of legitimacy could wall out the small-scale players, and the full economic impact of this remains unknown. The costs and particulars of California’s newly adopted medical marijuana regulatory system are still being decided, but expenses can be high—in Colorado fees vary widely depending on size and business set up, but can beupwards of $20,000, and in New York licensing fees add up to $210,000. Entry into the legitimate industry will include multiple fees payable to counties and states, as well as costs to product-testing facilities and distributors. Outdoor farmers, like Mary and Sam, will also have land and water regulations to contend with, such as the State Water Board’s cannabis compliance program,and county and agency regulations.As more states legalize and the industry continues to boom, there is increasing competition both within and between the legitimate and illegal markets. The numerous existing marijuana cultivators are left to test the viability of the emerging legitimate industry as entrepreneurs, weather the black market or do both.Jacob and Jen are a couple that have been growing marijuana to sustain themselves financially for almost 30 years, beginning when they lived in the Bay Area.“I was line cooking, and [Jen] was working retail,” Jacob says of their pasts. “We were both coming to the end of our ropes. I couldn’t keep line cooking — it was horrible for my health. We were both making 10 to 12 bucks an hour and paying $800 a month rent. So we started growing enough to sustain our household.”The pair maintained a small indoor marijuana grow in their Berkeley apartment in the 1980s and saved the profits until they could afford to purchase a plot of land in Trinity County, where they began growing on an outdoor farm.“It was really poor in the beginning,” Jacob says of the early days of farming. “We made about $15,000 to $20,000, gross. We went up from there. The first year we did good – we had 40 pounds and they probably went for $2,000 a pound. We paid off our land and our debts. But that’s still just an income for two people.”Jacob and Jen have continued farming to support themselves, but their operations have remained small; last year they produced 70 pounds that grossed $60,000. After decades of marijuana growing, they find themselves in a tenuous position, working to stay afloat in an uncertain and cutthroat market where a cannabis surplus has lowered prices.Like many who have relied on the black market industry for their primary source of income, Jacob and Jen have few alternatives that would provide for them. “I have literally no idea what else I would do [if I wasn’t farming],” Jacob says. “Aging out of the workforce is a problem. I probably couldn’t get hired at a restaurant now, and [even if I did] I wouldn’t like it.”Trinity County’s law enforcement and marijuana producers are living in a time of questions. The sheriff’s department remains limited in its capacity, and many small-scale farmers like Jacob and Jen, and Mary and Sam, face uncertainty about their livelihoods. The outcomes for both sides, tightly wed to economic viability, will manifest in the fallout of regulation – the emerging determiner that will decide what marijuana farming will look like for growers, enforcers and Hayfork alike."

The “Master of None” writer, actor and director spoke about the article, which quickly went viral, in a new interview with The Daily Beast. “You know, I put out that article and I thought like, ‘Maybe this will resonate with other brown people,’” Ansari said. “But it ended up being like the most-emailed, most-viewed article on the site for a couple of days. People come up to me of all different races, all different religions like, ‘That’s really cool that you wrote that. I really liked that article.’” “Today, with the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and others like him spewing hate speech, prejudice is reaching new levels,” the actor wrote. “It’s visceral, and scary, and it affects how people live, work and pray. It makes me afraid for my family. It also makes no sense.” As Ansari explains in his interview with The Daily Beast, Trump’s xenophobic comments are a result of the GOP candidate’s fear of anyone who doesn’t look exactly like his tiny handed, spray-tanned self. “Blaming them for something, misrepresenting them, making them some sort of strange character that they’re not, not giving them the depth that he would give other white people,” Ansari said, adding, “What gives me hope is that I think sometimes the people that are more negative, kind of troll-y type people, they’re very loud, but I think they’re a loud minority. It’s a strange juxtaposition, but I think there are still plenty of good people. I have hope.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

OK then. The award show was “a vast improvement over past VMAs, but still falls far short of what it could be as a celebration of music and talent, instead of a study in who can be most outrageous,” Melissa Henson, program director for the PTC, told Gossip Cop in a statement on Monday. Henson added that the show was at times confusing and particularly contradictory, especially when it came to presenters’ messages and certain performances.“On the one hand, you had these outstanding women athletes from the U.S. Women’s Gymnastics Team and they’re up there praising the female performers for being strong positive role models for women,” she said. “But when you watch the performances, there’s a lot of self-objectification, self-sexualization going on.” Henson acknowledged that two particular moments ― Britney’s “disheartening” crotch-grab and the naked shower scene in Kanye’s “Fade” video ― stood out from the show as inappropriate, despite MTV mainly playing it safe.

But other scientists are skeptical.Dr. Rebecca Ackermann, an archaeologist at the University of Cape Town in Africa, told The Washington Post that the study had failed to disprove alternative explanations for the breaks ― though she didn’t dismiss the research out of hand.“In my opinion this is a nice study that tells us something interesting about an individual who has played an important role — both scientifically and historically — in our understanding of human evolution,” she told the Post.But others were harsher in their appraisal of the new research.“There is a myriad of explanations for bone breakage,” Dr. Donald C. Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins and one of the scientists who discovered Lucy, told The Guardian. “The suggestion that she fell out of a tree is largely a “just-so story” that is neither verifiable nor falsifiable, and therefore unprovable.”Johanson said it was more likely that Lucy’s fractures occurred long after she died, telling The New York Times that “elephant bones and hippo ribs appear to have the same kind of breakage. It’s unlikely they fell out of a tree.”But the new research focused on “a small subset of fractures” that are consistent with “high-energy bone-to-bone impacts” and which differ from the sorts of breaks commonly seen in fossilized bones, Kappelman told The Huffington Post in an email. “These appear to have occurred perimortem (at or near the time of death).”In any case, the fresh look at Lucy’s old bones seem to have humanized her ― at least for Kappelman. As he told HuffPost in the email:“Our hypothesis suggests that the fractures in Lucy’s shoulder were produced when she stretched out her arms in a last desperate attempt to break her fall.

These kid’s lives can change forever,"" he said.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c477dd1600003503bff2e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dwight Howard has made a number of career highlights on the court but off the court the basketball superstar has been making a difference, too.Through the years, the Atlanta Hawks center’s D12 Foundation has made advancements in its efforts to empower the schoolgirls of Tanzania by providing the nation with educational resources. In July, the NBA star’s foundation hosted a back-to-school event where 463 girls, ages 12-18, were provided with locally-made school supplies, gym shirts and hygiene kits.After visiting on behalf of the NBA Cares Foundation, Howard says he was later inspired to return to the East African country in 2012 to personally fund the construction of dormitory housing for girls entering secondary school.“One of the things that I was told was that it’s very hard for women to go to school, and when they do there’s a danger of them being raped or kidnapped and all sorts of things happening with them getting to school,” he said during an interview with The Huffington Post. “That didn’t sit too well with me. And so I just want to do my part to help these women with the opportunity to go to school and learn.”More than 62 million girls worldwide lack education possibly due to various factors which might include, inadequate resources, school fees, high pregnancy rates and the risk of possibly falling victim to predators during their commutes, according to the United States Agency for International Development. Since 2003, nearly 50,000 pregnant girls in Tanzania have been denied education due to a law that permits schools to refuse to admit or readmit students with “undesirable physical health.”Given clarity of the vast challenges these young women face, Howard says his foundation met with Tanzanian government officials to discuss the school system’s biggest needs prior to allocating resources.“I want to show them that they mean something,” he said. “A lot of times I think these women get taken for granted and that’s why they drop out of school and they don’t get education. So my job is to try to help them understand that they’re an important part of our world.” In addition to providing education to the girls of Tanzania, Howard also wants his efforts to coincide with his foundation’s initiatives surrounding early childhood literacy and youth leadership development.He went on to describe his overall purpose for cultivating today’s youth as something that will transcend his NBA career.“This is something that I was put on this earth for, to give back. And I think the best thing you can do with your time is to give,” he said. “For me, just to see these kids grow and go in the right direction it fills my heart with joy.“A basketball career for me is great, but there’s a time where that basketball career will be over. These kid’s lives can change forever. And that’s something that will continue to go on even after I’m done playing basketball. So I’m doing anything I can for the community and anything I can for the world ― makes me feel a lot better.”For more info on Dwight Howard’s D12 Foundation click here."

The administration also is set to meet its goal of welcoming 85,000 refugees from around the world by the end of the fiscal year, National Security Advisor Susan Rice said in a statement. It’s the Syrian refugees who have been particularly controversial ever since Obama first announced plans last September to admit 10,000 of them in the 2016 fiscal year ― which ends Sept. 30 ― and especially after terrorist attacks in Paris last November. More than half of the nation’s governors said they didn’t want Syrian refugees in their states in the wake of those attacks, and Republicans in Congress repeatedly voted to make it more difficult for the government to approve them for resettlement. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump frequently talks about his opposition to Syrian refugees, insisting terrorists are among them. He first said he would ban all Muslims from immigrating to the U.S., refugee or otherwise, and later modified the ban to cover people from countries “compromised by terrorism” ― a broad designation that would include Syria. The administration pressed forward with Syrian refugee resettlement in spite of the opposition. All refugees go through extensive background checks, with additional vetting for those from Syria. Most refugees resettled in the U.S. are first referred by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. They are vetted by the departments of State and Homeland Security with assistance from the FBI and intelligence agencies, in a process that includes interviews with officers and review of social media accounts. About 60 percent of the 10,000 Syrian refugees admitted so far this fiscal year were under the age of 18, according to the State Department.As of the end of July, refugees from Burma and the Democratic Republic of the Congo made up the largest proportions of refugees resettled in the U.S. this fiscal year, followed by those from Syria.There are more than 4.8 million Syrian refugees worldwide.“On behalf of the president and his administration, I extend the warmest of welcomes to each and every one of our Syrian arrivals, as well as the many other refugees resettled this year from all over the world,” Rice said Monday. Alice Wells, the U.S. ambassador to Jordan, said on Sunday that the U.S. would hit the 10,000-person goal this week, The Associated Press reported. Two of the Syrian refugee families coming to the U.S. this week will live in San Diego through the International Rescue Committee, one of the agencies that handle resettlement. David Miliband, ‎the organization’s president and CEO, said in a statement that the White House should consider the 10,000 mark “a floor and not a ceiling.” “Resettling refugees is right, practical and smart,” he said. “The achievement of the 10,000 target proves what is possible, and there remains an urgent need to further strengthen U.S. leadership in resettling refugee families ― with appropriate vetting ― fleeing violence and war.”This article has been updated with additional details on the Syrian refugees admitted."

At least 290 people were killed, approximately 388 were treated for injuries, and more than 2,000 are now homeless. Pirozzi continues to monitor the death toll and to take questions from the press, trying his best to stay calm. About 200 people from Amatrice died, and the mayor told HuffPost Italy that his town’s future lies in reconstruction.“I want our city to be rebuilt here, with the same aesthetics, the same face,” Pirozzi said. “I want it to be exactly the same, just as Cola Filotesio designed it in the 1500s.”He spoke with HuffPost Italy about his plans for rebuilding the town, what’s been lost and what he has learned. L’Aquila ― where a major earthquake struck in 2009, killing more than 300 people ― is a perfect example for how people can spend months waiting for their houses to be rebuilt. L’Aquila is synonymous with broken promises, and it casts a shadow over everything that’s taking place and all the decisions being made right now. How will things be different in Amatrice?There were 60,000 people left homeless in Aquila. There was an endless field of people. An entire city. Here, on the other hand, we can take comfort in the fact that our tragedy is of a much smaller dimension. The homes that were destroyed are essentially just the 400 buildings in the town’s historical center. Amatrice is surrounded by 60 small villages, and had a total population of 2,633 people before the earthquake struck, plus the summer tourists. We have a steep death toll, given this small population, but these are numbers we can handle.Survivors must remain there, close to their villages. This risk is that the rather elderly population, where people are 49 years old on average, will slowly but surely move away. But even as things stand, with these small numbers, managing the rebuilding project will require set times and deadlines, don’t you think? The reconstruction calendar is undoubtedly the first thought on the minds of everyone who has lost their homes.Five months.Five months for what?Five months for the delivery of prefab wood houses that will be appropriate for the temperatures and conditions inherent to this elevated, mountainous environment.Five months means that the current homeless population will have to stay where they are at least until January, living in extremely rigid weather conditions. That’s not a very pleasant prospect.That’s right, and in fact I’ve requested sleeping bags. But I was told that this is the minimum timeframe required in order to get the job done. And how long will it take to rebuild the houses?I’m dreaming it will take a year, but if I’m being realistic, I’d be happy if they are rebuilt over two years.Are you ready to requisition vacation homes, given that Amatrice has a lot of those?Many of the people who have vacation homes here have already made them available. But I’ll need to ask for more, and I don’t have a problem doing so.Basically, if we were to sum things up: Despite all your energy, efforts and relative lack of sleep, the mayor of Amatrice has joined the swelling ranks of Italian mayors struggling to deal with a major disaster. How are you holding up?I haven’t lost any members of my immediate family, but I’ve lost every single citizen of this town who died. In the past few days, I haven’t been able to find the town baker, Gianni. He was my good friend, and the only person who was already up and working at that hour of the night.How is it possible you haven’t found him yet?It’s simple. We’re digging, but we haven’t found anything. We know he has to be there, but it’s as if he’s vanished.Was there anything you could have done differently? Could you have been more prepared?A few months back, we presented an official request to reinforce and strengthen our bridges. Amatrice is surrounded by a network of downstream waters, including three rivers and a lake, that essentially form a circle around the base of the mountain the town is built on. Those bridges are the very same ones that have now been shut down because they are in danger of collapse. So you must have been concerned even before the quake.Yes, but I never expected all this to happen. For me, the single biggest symbol of this disaster is Porta Carbonara, the 13th-century medieval gate that marked the entrance to Amatrice. It stood there for centuries: robust, strong, enormous. [It] survived despite all the damage and numerous earthquakes we’ve endured. And this time it was the first thing I saw during the night of the first quakes ― only this time it didn’t survive.It seems to me this this story has taught you the lesson that it’s not possible to make everything in this fragile Italy of ours safe and secure.In fact, it’s not possible. It’s impossible.A version of this piece originally appeared on HuffPost Italy. It has been translated into English and edited for clarity. "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Half the town no longer exists,” Amatrice Mayor Sergio Pirozzi said after a 6.2 magnitude earthquake and a series of aftershocks hit central Italy last week. At least 290 people were killed, approximately 388 were treated for injuries, and more than 2,000 are now homeless. Pirozzi continues to monitor the death toll and to take questions from the press, trying his best to stay calm. About 200 people from Amatrice died, and the mayor told HuffPost Italy that his town’s future lies in reconstruction.“I want our city to be rebuilt here, with the same aesthetics, the same face,” Pirozzi said. “I want it to be exactly the same, just as Cola Filotesio designed it in the 1500s.”He spoke with HuffPost Italy about his plans for rebuilding the town, what’s been lost and what he has learned. L’Aquila ― where a major earthquake struck in 2009, killing more than 300 people ― is a perfect example for how people can spend months waiting for their houses to be rebuilt. L’Aquila is synonymous with broken promises, and it casts a shadow over everything that’s taking place and all the decisions being made right now. How will things be different in Amatrice?There were 60,000 people left homeless in Aquila. There was an endless field of people. An entire city. Here, on the other hand, we can take comfort in the fact that our tragedy is of a much smaller dimension. The homes that were destroyed are essentially just the 400 buildings in the town’s historical center. Amatrice is surrounded by 60 small villages, and had a total population of 2,633 people before the earthquake struck, plus the summer tourists. We have a steep death toll, given this small population, but these are numbers we can handle.Survivors must remain there, close to their villages. This risk is that the rather elderly population, where people are 49 years old on average, will slowly but surely move away. But even as things stand, with these small numbers, managing the rebuilding project will require set times and deadlines, don’t you think?

Images of armed police apparently enforcing the ban on a woman on a beach in Nice have added to the controversy.The bans had been justified on public order grounds, and Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls appeared to defend the town officials who imposed them.After the court set the bans aside, however, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a law against the garments would be ruled unconstitutional.Asked about that risk, Sarkozy said: “Well, then we change the constitution. We’ve changed it thirty odd times, it’s not a problem.”Sarkozy is struggling to catch up in the polls with rival Alain Juppe, a mild-mannered, more centrist former prime minister before their Republicains party’s primary elections in late November.Cazeneuve, who was meeting with French Muslim leaders on Monday to ease religious tensions, said he would name veteran politician Jean-Pierre Chevenement to head an independent body charged with handling relations between the state and the religion’s representatives.

Reform advocates widely applauded the DOJ’s landmark decision, but immigrant rights groups questioned why the same logic shouldn’t apply to the civil immigrant detention system, which keeps tens of thousands of people locked up every night. The same two companies, the Corrections Corp of America and the GEO Group, handle the lion’s share of federal contracting for both privatized prisons and immigrant detention centers.Johnson appears to have noted the criticism. He asked the Homeland Security Advisory Council, which is chaired by Judge William Webster, to review its policies for using private contractors to run immigrant detention centers and submit a report by Nov. 30. “Specifically, I have asked that Judge Webster establish a Subcommittee of the Council to review our current policy and practices concerning the use of private immigration detention and evaluate whether this practice should be eliminated,” Johnson wrote in Monday’s statement.GEO Group, the country’s second-largest private prison contractor, said in a statement that it “welcomed” the review, adding that the detention centers under its management had met national standards in previous audits. “We are confident that this independent review will show that GEO has provided needed, cost-effective services that have resulted in significantly improved safety outcomes for the men and women in ICE’s care and custody,” GEO Group CEO George Zoley said in the statement.The company’s shareholders weren’t so sure.

Nearly two-thirds of immigrant detention beds are privatized, according to report last year by Austin-based advocacy group Grassroots Leadership. By comparison, 12 percent of Bureau of Prisons facilities are run as businesses. “Based on the stories that have come out of for-profit detention centers for years, including hunger strikes and protests by detained migrants, there is every reason to believe that ICE-contracted private prisons have many of the same problems that the DOJ uncovered this month,” Grassroots Leadership Director Bob Libal wrote in an email.

An MSF spokesperson said the hospital received at least 45 bodies and more than 60 wounded people.Islamist militants, including Islamic State, have exploited an 18-month-old civil war between the Houthi movement and Hadi’s supporters, attacking senior officials, religious figures, security forces and compounds of the Saudi-led Arab military coalition which supports Hadi.Last month, the governor of the southern Yemeni city of Aden survived a car bomb attack targeting his convoy, the latest attempt on the city’s top official.In May, a suicide bomber killed at least 40 army recruits and injured 60 others when he rammed a booby-trapped car at recruits lined up to enlist for military service at a compound in Aden.Hadi’s supporters, who accuse former President Ali Abdullah Saleh of using Islamist militants to target the internationally-recognized president, have launched a series of raids in recent weeks to try to stem the violence, seizing dozens of people suspected of involvement in attacks across the city.In eastern Yemen, forces loyal to Hadi, backed by troops from the United Arab Emirates, drove members of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula from the city of Mukalla in a military operation in May."

His business-friendly government vows to take unpopular austerity measures to plug a growing fiscal deficit that cost Brazil its investment-grade credit rating last year.Appealing to undecided senators, Rousseff, 68, pointed to a lifetime fighting for democracy, from her arrest and torture by a military dictatorship for belonging to a left-wing guerrilla group to election as Brazil’s first female president.ODDS AGAINST HERTwenty of her former Cabinet ministers were in the Senate gallery to support Rousseff, along with her political mentor and former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, founder of the Workers Party.With the odds stacked against her, Rousseff’s testimony appears to be aimed at making a point for the history books that her impeachment was a travesty, rather than a bid to sway the 81-seat Senate to block her ouster.Temer is confident he has the two-thirds of the chamber needed to remove Rousseff, and he has planned an address to the nation on Wednesday before heading to China to attend the summit of the G20 group of leading economies.“We need 54 votes and we expect to get at least 60,” Temer’s press spokesman, Marcio de Freitas, told Reuters.He said the more votes Temer received, the stronger would be his mandate to take the difficult measures needed to restore confidence in Brazil’s economy, which is caught in a two-year recession.Rousseff is accused of using money from state banks to bolster spending during an election year in 2014. She says the money had no impact on overall deficit levels and was paid back in full the following year.A survey published by O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper on Monday showed 53 senators would vote against Rousseff and only 19 would back her - nine short of the 28 she needs to avoid being ousted. Nine senators have not stated their position.But even senators not convinced the accounting charges brought against Rousseff warrant her removal will vote against her because they do not believe she has enough support to govern anymore and end Brazil’s political crisis.“I will vote against her even though I think it is a tragedy to get rid of an elected president, but another 2-1/2 years of a Dilma government would be worse,” centrist Senator Cristovam Buarque said in a phone interview."

Whatever his actual position, it’s been left to Trump’s surrogates to explain the candidate’s apparent softening on his signature issue.On Sunday, Martha Raddatz, co-host of ABC’s “This Week” asked New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) if Trump still planned on deporting everyone or what. Christie, who was the first of Trump’s vanquished primary foes to back him, said Trump would get bad apples out of the country first and then “deal with people in a humane way.”So, Raddatz asked, does that not mean getting all 11 million undocumented immigrants out of the country?Christie responded that there are going to be “some decisions [Trump]’s going to have to make as president regarding those folks,” referencing Trump’s good apples. Christie did not directly acknowledge that Trump might be abandoning one of his core policy positions. But he basically said that, if Trump did so, it would show he’s thoughtful and presidential.“Quite frankly, you know, I think this is the kind of thing people expect from a president of the United States,” Christie said. “That they all approach these things thoughtfully and smartly and I’m confident that that’s exactly what a President Trump will do.”“Would you acknowledge then that does sound like a softening from his original statements about getting everyone, 11 million undocumented workers, out of the country with a deportation force?” Raddatz asked.Christie said Trump has been “completely consistent” on building a border wall and not offering undocumented immigrants amnesty. But as for the deportation force, “I think what you expect of every candidate and ultimately of a president is to listen to the facts and to deal with things in a way that’s smart and direct,” Christie reiterated. “I’m confident that’s exactly what President Trump will do.”Since launching his White House bid, Trump hasn’t exactly cultivated a reputation for pensiveness. Quite the opposite: His image is all about gut instincts and firm beliefs. Now, if he pulls an about-face on deportations, Christie and other allies will have to make the argument that Trump is listening to all sides and re-evaluating himself.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

It was during those hours that the shooting occurred, police said.Darwin Sorrells was sentenced to six years in prison in 2013 on a gun charge but was “let out early,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter on Sunday.It was not clear whether the brothers had a lawyer.NATIONAL ATTENTIONIn a city with as many as 90 shootings a week, homicides in Chicago this year are on track to reach their highest since 1997, raising concern about a reversal in the declining rate of serious crime in the country’s largest cities in recent years.Aldridge’s death has drawn national attention because of the connection to Wade, a 12-time National Basketball Association All-Star who signed a two-year, $47.5 million deal this summer to play for his hometown team, the Chicago Bulls.“This tragedy isn’t just noteworthy because Ms Aldridge has a famous family member,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson told reporters on Sunday. “It’s noteworthy because these two offenders are the prime example of a challenge we have in Chicago of repeat offenders who ... clearly don’t face the consequences of their actions.”On Saturday Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said in a campaign speech that the shooting illustrated why black voters would rally behind him, calling it an example of violence that Democrats have failed to address.Earlier Trump was criticized for politicizing the killing, and for spelling the NBA player’s name wrong, when he sent a Twitter message that read:“Dwayne Wade’s cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!”Sen. Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president on the Democratic ticket with Hillary Clinton, suggested the remarks were inappropriate when asked about them.“We ought to be extending our sympathy to the family ― that’s the only reaction that is appropriate right now, and maybe a sadness about this gun violence issue, which we know is complicated,” Kaine said.Hours after his initial message, Trump followed up with a Tweet that offered condolences to Wade’s family.When asked about Trump’s remarks, Johnson said: “If you have a magic bullet to stop the violence, not only in Chicago but anywhere in the country, please share it with us.”(Reporting by Chris Prentice, Jonathan Allen and Frank McGurty in New York; Editing by Alan Crosby and Andrea Ricci)"

It has since come under fire for conceptual and structural flaws. By limiting its investigation of the Clinton Foundation to specific financial contributions that led to direct and specific benefits for donors, The Associated Press left itself vulnerable to criticism that no verifiable “quid pro quo” could be established from its findings. By trying to cram its findings into a small box, it distorted what it found, and missed the bigger picture. If the AP had conceived of the donations as just one of many exchanges of money, prestige and reciprocal back-patting that bind global elites, its case against the Clintons would be considerably stronger. So, with that vision in mind, we’ve done a write-through of the AP’s story ― a heavy edit that relies in many places on their words and reporting, but casts the article in a broader light. The parts in bold come directly from the AP. The rest are our additions. You’re welcome, AP.WASHINGTON ― At least 101* people who met or had phone conversations scheduled with Hillary Clinton while she led the State Department donated to her family charity or pledged commitments to its international programs, according to a review of State Department calendars released so far to The Associated Press. Combined, the 101 donors contributed as much as $326 million. At least 40 donated more than $100,000 each, and at least 20 gave more than $1 million.Among those granted time with Clinton included an internationally known economist who asked for her help as the Bangladesh government pressured him to resign from a nonprofit bank he ran; a Wall Street executive who sought Clinton’s help with a visa problem; and representatives of Gulf state governments working to undermine negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.Her calendars and emails released as recently as this week describe scores of contacts she and her top aides had with foundation donors.The AP’s findings represent the first systematic effort to calculate the scope of the intersecting interests of Clinton Foundation donors and people who met personally with Clinton or spoke to her by phone about their needs.Some of Clinton’s most influential visitors donated millions to the Clinton Foundation and to her and her husband’s political coffers. They are among scores of Clinton visitors and phone contacts in her official calendar turned over by the State Department to AP last year and in more-detailed planning schedules that so far have covered about half of her four-year tenure. The AP sought Clinton’s calendar and schedules three years ago, but delays led the AP to sue the State Department last year in federal court for those materials and other records.The case of Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering low-interest “microcredit” for poor business owners, may be among the most instructive. Although critics such as GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump charge that the frequency of the overlaps shows the intermingling of access and donations, fueling perceptions that giving the foundation money was a price of admission for face time with Clinton, the reality is that the overlap is a function of a worldwide capitalistic system in which oligarchs, corporate CEOs and celebrity heads of state mingle to form a global elite that dictates a global agenda. This can sometimes take the form of quid pro quos, but it is more often a subtle form of exchange, in which exclusion from or inclusion within an elite club depends as much on whom you know as the size of the check you can write.The Clintons did not create this system, but they have become central players within it. It is a cozy world inhabited by a select coterie of political, business and media elites, where tomorrow’s news is often the product of a not-so-serendipitous conversation between a TV pundit and a corporate CEO who were introduced by a foreign minister they both know. In addition to “talking shop” ― exchanging the tips of their respective trades ― they speak about solutions to social ills they rarely encounter directly, typically entertaining ideas within a narrow spectrum of proposals that do not threaten their world view.So many such encounters occur at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland ― more commonly known as “Davos” ― that the gathering has become a descriptor for a certain breed of cosmopolitan, international elite: the Davos set.Hillary and Bill Clinton are stars of the Davos set; so is Muhammad Yunus.[Yunus] met with Clinton three times and talked with her by phone during a period when Bangladeshi government authorities investigated his oversight of a nonprofit bank and ultimately pressured him to resign from the bank’s board. Throughout the process, he pleaded for help in messages routed to Clinton, and she ordered aides to find ways to assist him.“The use of the Clintons in this way, and their willingness to be used, is ‘crony capitalism’ in a very clear form,” said University of Texas economist James Galbraith. “It’s a matter of forming your views of merit on the basis of what wealthy people and their acolytes advise you, and on the basis of personal connections made over the years. Connections that are not made with people who are not wealthy.”American affiliates of [Yunus’] nonprofit Grameen Bank had been working with the Clinton Foundation’s Clinton Global Initiative programs as early as 2005, pledging millions of dollars in microloans for the poor. Grameen America, the bank’s nonprofit U.S. flagship, which Yunus chairs, has given between $100,000 and $250,000 to the foundation - a figure that bank spokeswoman Becky Asch said reflects the institution’s annual fees to attend CGI meetings. Another Grameen arm chaired by Yunus, Grameen Research, has donated between $25,000 and $50,000.But Clinton didn’t need checks from Yunus to know who he was. In fact, the Clintons have a longstanding friendship with Yunus and admiration for his microcredit work that predates any financial contribution he made to the Clinton Foundation. Then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton highlighted Yunus and Grameen Bank as a model for harnessing the “power of the government … to create market forces that work” in an interview with the Rolling Stone during his 1992 presidential run.Clinton had met Yunus several years prior in an encounter organized by a friend of Hillary’s, Clinton told Rolling Stone.Hillary Clinton first met Yunus in 1983, as first lady of Arkansas, she said in a January 2009 speech, at the start of her term as secretary of state. She had invited him to visit Arkansas so she could learn about ways microfinance ― a broader field of low-income banking of which microcredit is a part ― could relieve poverty in the state.As a U.S. senator from New York, Clinton, as well as then-Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and two other senators in 2007 sponsored a bill to award a congressional gold medal to Yunus. He got one but not until 2010, a year after Obama awarded him a Presidential Medal of Freedom.Yunus first met with Clinton in Washington in April 2009. That was followed six months later by an announcement by USAID, the State Department’s foreign aid arm, that it was partnering with the Grameen Foundation, a nonprofit charity run by Yunus, in a $162 million commitment to extend its microfinance concept abroad. USAID also began providing loans and grants to the Grameen Foundation, totaling $2.2 million over Clinton’s tenure.By September 2009, Yunus began complaining to Clinton’s top aides about what he perceived as poor treatment by Bangladesh’s government. His bank was accused of financial mismanagement of Norwegian government aid money ― a charge that Norway later dismissed as baseless. But Yunus told Melanne Verveer, a long-time Clinton aide who was an ambassador-at-large for global women’s issues, that Bangladesh officials refused to meet with him and asked the State Department for help in pressing his case.“Please see if the issues of Grameen Bank can be raised in a friendly way,” he asked Verveer. Yunus sent “regards to H” and cited an upcoming Clinton Global Initiative event he planned to attend. Clinton ordered an aide: “Give to EAP rep,” referring the problem to the agency’s top east Asia expert.Yunus continued writing to Verveer as pressure mounted on his bank. In December 2010, responding to a news report that Bangladesh’s prime minister was urging an investigation of Grameen Bank, Clinton told Verveer that she wanted to discuss the matter with her East Asia expert “ASAP.”Clinton called Yunus in March 2011 after the Bangladesh government opened an inquiry into his oversight of Grameen Bank. Yunus had told Verveer by email that “the situation does not allow me to leave the country.” By mid-May, the Bangladesh government had forced Yunus to step down from the bank’s board. Yunus sent Clinton a copy of his resignation letter. In a separate note to Verveer, Clinton wrote: “Sad indeed.”Clinton met with Yunus a second time in Washington in August 2011 and again in the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka in May 2012. Clinton’s arrival in Bangladesh came after Bangladesh authorities moved to seize control of Grameen Bank’s effort to find new leaders. Speaking to a town hall audience, Clinton warned the Bangladesh government that “we do not want to see any action taken that would in any way undermine or interfere in the operations of the Grameen Bank.”Grameen America’s Asch noted that all foundation donations were made by Grameen entities and not personally from Yunus.The trouble with Clinton’s actions is not that she intervened on behalf of Yunus, a friend who predated her term as secretary of state. In a sea of hundreds of millions of dollars in foundation contributions, the six-figure contributions from institutions Yunus ran likely did not stand out.It is that their longstanding friendship ― and shared membership in the Davos club ― blinded Clinton to the credibility of the malpractice claims against Yunus. Clinton simply asked her staff to intervene on his behalf without any apparent request to check into the allegations first.Despite Yunus’ protestations, the investigation into his business activity was not without merit.The Norwegian government objected to Yunus’ reallocation of $100 million meant for microloans in Bangladesh, after finding that Yunus had improperly moved it from his bank to a separate entity he owned. But Yunus only restored $30 million of the donation to the fund it had been earmarked for, according to the Danish-made documentary film “Caught in Micro Debt.”When Norway expressed its concerns over Yunus’ handling of the money, he appealed to the country’s aid ministry to ensure that their rebukes did not reach a wider audience.“If the people, within and outside government, who are not supportive of Grameen, get hold of this letter, we’ll face real problems in Bangladesh,” Yunus wrote in a letter to the director-general of the Norwegian aid ministry, which was revealed in the documentary.Beyond Yunus’ alleged financial misdeeds, there is ample scholarship casting doubt on the scale of the success of the very microcredit techniques that are the source of his prestige.As microlending operations have grown, they have become vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous individuals, who have turned many into for-profit, high-interest enterprises that trap poor borrowers in a never-ending cycle of debt. Yunus’ Grameen Bank itself appears to have avoided accusations of this kind. Yunus nonetheless felt obligated to condemn the trend in a 2011 op-ed in The New York Times.But even many experts who respect the achievements of microcredit and believe Grameen is a force for good overall argue that the strategy has failed to live up to its promise as a pathway out of poverty in developing countries. Microcredit “seems to have consistent benefits for keeping people out of extreme poverty,” but not allowing them to escape poverty entirely, said Kentaro Toyama of the University of Michigan, who has studied the practice.Why then does Yunus continue to enjoy such acclaim for his microfinance work? One answer may lie in Bill Clinton’s 1992 comments to Rolling Stone about finding antipoverty policies that work within the free market rather than trying to upend or counter it.The tiny loans have gotten traction with the Davos set, because the idea “appeals to all sides of the political fence,” said Dean Karlan, a global poverty reduction specialist at Yale who expressed a view similar to Toyama’s about the practice’s efficacy.“The left likes the attention to the poor, whereas the right like the individual responsibility aspect of a loan rather than a grant,” he said. “It is a good example of markets working to make the world a better place.” In this way, microcredit has the advantage of indulging the Davos set’s self-serving conviction that there is no global problem that free markets cannot solve if properly oriented. That exonerates these elites from confronting the fact that the same capitalist system that has enriched them may be responsible for some of the world’s worst human suffering ― and that resolving those ills would require them to make more profound sacrifices than a tax-deductible donation that conveniently provides access to the world’s most powerful couple. Toyama attributes the popularity of Yunus’ microcredit among the philanthropic crowd to something much simpler: low risk and guaranteed return in the form of interest payments and perceived poverty reduction on the ground.“You get your money back,” he said. “You really don’t have to do anything other than take a small hit on interest you might make on other means.”By contrast, deeper anti-poverty measures like funding high-quality education in the developing world ― which has the potential to lift people out of poverty rather than merely alleviate it, as microfinance does ― require lots of “money, effort and extremely good management and leadership,” according to Toyama.“All of those things are very hard and things wealthy people are reluctant to give to because it never pays itself back in the short term,” he said. In another case, Clinton was host at a September 2009 breakfast meeting at the New York Stock Exchange that listed Blackstone Group chairman Stephen Schwarzman as one of the attendees. Schwarzman’s firm is a major Clinton Foundation donor, but he personally donates heavily to GOP candidates and causes. One day after the breakfast, according to Clinton emails, the State Department was working on a visa issue at Schwarzman’s request. In December that same year, Schwarzman’s wife, Christine, sat at Clinton’s table during the Kennedy Center Honors. Clinton also introduced Schwarzman, then chairman of the Kennedy Center, before he spoke.The Schwarzman meetings are typical of how elites are able to get better access to government officials and service than those who are not honored guests at the Kennedy Center. The visa issue Schwarzman needed assistance with was quite likely legitimate. His ability to get the personal assistance of the secretary of state does not add up to a bribe exchanged for a visa. But it reflects a stratified society in which the rich and well-connected can easily call in government favors to resolve issues that might require painstaking navigation of bureaucracy for ordinary citizens. Blackstone donated between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Eight Blackstone executives also gave between $375,000 and $800,000 to the foundation. And Blackstone’s charitable arm has pledged millions of dollars in commitments to three Clinton Global aid projects ranging from the U.S. to the Mideast. Blackstone officials did not make Schwarzman available for comment.When Clinton appeared before the U.S. Senate in early 2009 for her confirmation hearing as secretary of state, then- Sen. Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, questioned her at length about the foundation and potential conflicts of interest. His concerns were focused on foreign government donations, mostly to CGI. Lugar wanted more transparency than was ultimately agreed upon between the foundation and Obama’s transition team.Now, Lugar hopes Hillary and Bill Clinton make a clean break from the foundation.“The Clintons, as they approach the presidency, if they are successful, will have to work with their attorneys to make certain that rules of the road are drawn up to give confidence to them and the American public that there will not be favoritism,” Lugar said. But even if the Clintons are no longer formally involved with the foundation or its finances, the friendships and status they cultivated as celebrated members of the global elite will persist. As a result, the favoritism Clinton showed as secretary of state will likely continue if and when she occupies the White House.*The AP excluded donations from foreign governments who ended up getting meetings, “because such meetings would presumably have been part of her diplomatic duties.” That makes no sense. Nearly all of the other meetings Clinton had ― with a nonprofit doing global AIDS work, for instance ― were also part of diplomatic duties, as was overseeing the visa process. The question is not whether the duties fall within or without the scope of a secretary of state, but whether she favored one such duty over another as a result of this web of relationships. So we fixed this for the AP by adding foreign governments back in. As a result, we have removed the proportion of visits by donors that the AP calculated."

Yunus sent “regards to H” and cited an upcoming Clinton Global Initiative event he planned to attend. Clinton ordered an aide: “Give to EAP rep,” referring the problem to the agency’s top east Asia expert.Yunus continued writing to Verveer as pressure mounted on his bank. In December 2010, responding to a news report that Bangladesh’s prime minister was urging an investigation of Grameen Bank, Clinton told Verveer that she wanted to discuss the matter with her East Asia expert “ASAP.”Clinton called Yunus in March 2011 after the Bangladesh government opened an inquiry into his oversight of Grameen Bank. Yunus had told Verveer by email that “the situation does not allow me to leave the country.” By mid-May, the Bangladesh government had forced Yunus to step down from the bank’s board. Yunus sent Clinton a copy of his resignation letter. In a separate note to Verveer, Clinton wrote: “Sad indeed.”Clinton met with Yunus a second time in Washington in August 2011 and again in the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka in May 2012. Clinton’s arrival in Bangladesh came after Bangladesh authorities moved to seize control of Grameen Bank’s effort to find new leaders. Speaking to a town hall audience, Clinton warned the Bangladesh government that “we do not want to see any action taken that would in any way undermine or interfere in the operations of the Grameen Bank.”Grameen America’s Asch noted that all foundation donations were made by Grameen entities and not personally from Yunus.The trouble with Clinton’s actions is not that she intervened on behalf of Yunus, a friend who predated her term as secretary of state. In a sea of hundreds of millions of dollars in foundation contributions, the six-figure contributions from institutions Yunus ran likely did not stand out.It is that their longstanding friendship ― and shared membership in the Davos club ― blinded Clinton to the credibility of the malpractice claims against Yunus. Clinton simply asked her staff to intervene on his behalf without any apparent request to check into the allegations first.Despite Yunus’ protestations, the investigation into his business activity was not without merit.The Norwegian government objected to Yunus’ reallocation of $100 million meant for microloans in Bangladesh, after finding that Yunus had improperly moved it from his bank to a separate entity he owned. But Yunus only restored $30 million of the donation to the fund it had been earmarked for, according to the Danish-made documentary film “Caught in Micro Debt.”When Norway expressed its concerns over Yunus’ handling of the money, he appealed to the country’s aid ministry to ensure that their rebukes did not reach a wider audience.“If the people, within and outside government, who are not supportive of Grameen, get hold of this letter, we’ll face real problems in Bangladesh,” Yunus wrote in a letter to the director-general of the Norwegian aid ministry, which was revealed in the documentary.Beyond Yunus’ alleged financial misdeeds, there is ample scholarship casting doubt on the scale of the success of the very microcredit techniques that are the source of his prestige.As microlending operations have grown, they have become vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous individuals, who have turned many into for-profit, high-interest enterprises that trap poor borrowers in a never-ending cycle of debt. Yunus’ Grameen Bank itself appears to have avoided accusations of this kind. Yunus nonetheless felt obligated to condemn the trend in a 2011 op-ed in The New York Times.But even many experts who respect the achievements of microcredit and believe Grameen is a force for good overall argue that the strategy has failed to live up to its promise as a pathway out of poverty in developing countries. Microcredit “seems to have consistent benefits for keeping people out of extreme poverty,” but not allowing them to escape poverty entirely, said Kentaro Toyama of the University of Michigan, who has studied the practice.Why then does Yunus continue to enjoy such acclaim for his microfinance work? One answer may lie in Bill Clinton’s 1992 comments to Rolling Stone about finding antipoverty policies that work within the free market rather than trying to upend or counter it.The tiny loans have gotten traction with the Davos set, because the idea “appeals to all sides of the political fence,” said Dean Karlan, a global poverty reduction specialist at Yale who expressed a view similar to Toyama’s about the practice’s efficacy.“The left likes the attention to the poor, whereas the right like the individual responsibility aspect of a loan rather than a grant,” he said. “It is a good example of markets working to make the world a better place.” In this way, microcredit has the advantage of indulging the Davos set’s self-serving conviction that there is no global problem that free markets cannot solve if properly oriented. That exonerates these elites from confronting the fact that the same capitalist system that has enriched them may be responsible for some of the world’s worst human suffering ― and that resolving those ills would require them to make more profound sacrifices than a tax-deductible donation that conveniently provides access to the world’s most powerful couple. Toyama attributes the popularity of Yunus’ microcredit among the philanthropic crowd to something much simpler: low risk and guaranteed return in the form of interest payments and perceived poverty reduction on the ground.“You get your money back,” he said. “You really don’t have to do anything other than take a small hit on interest you might make on other means.”By contrast, deeper anti-poverty measures like funding high-quality education in the developing world ― which has the potential to lift people out of poverty rather than merely alleviate it, as microfinance does ― require lots of “money, effort and extremely good management and leadership,” according to Toyama.“All of those things are very hard and things wealthy people are reluctant to give to because it never pays itself back in the short term,” he said. In another case, Clinton was host at a September 2009 breakfast meeting at the New York Stock Exchange that listed Blackstone Group chairman Stephen Schwarzman as one of the attendees. Schwarzman’s firm is a major Clinton Foundation donor, but he personally donates heavily to GOP candidates and causes. One day after the breakfast, according to Clinton emails, the State Department was working on a visa issue at Schwarzman’s request. In December that same year, Schwarzman’s wife, Christine, sat at Clinton’s table during the Kennedy Center Honors. Clinton also introduced Schwarzman, then chairman of the Kennedy Center, before he spoke.The Schwarzman meetings are typical of how elites are able to get better access to government officials and service than those who are not honored guests at the Kennedy Center. The visa issue Schwarzman needed assistance with was quite likely legitimate. His ability to get the personal assistance of the secretary of state does not add up to a bribe exchanged for a visa. But it reflects a stratified society in which the rich and well-connected can easily call in government favors to resolve issues that might require painstaking navigation of bureaucracy for ordinary citizens. Blackstone donated between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Eight Blackstone executives also gave between $375,000 and $800,000 to the foundation. And Blackstone’s charitable arm has pledged millions of dollars in commitments to three Clinton Global aid projects ranging from the U.S. to the Mideast. Blackstone officials did not make Schwarzman available for comment.When Clinton appeared before the U.S. Senate in early 2009 for her confirmation hearing as secretary of state, then- Sen. Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, questioned her at length about the foundation and potential conflicts of interest. His concerns were focused on foreign government donations, mostly to CGI. Lugar wanted more transparency than was ultimately agreed upon between the foundation and Obama’s transition team.Now, Lugar hopes Hillary and Bill Clinton make a clean break from the foundation.“The Clintons, as they approach the presidency, if they are successful, will have to work with their attorneys to make certain that rules of the road are drawn up to give confidence to them and the American public that there will not be favoritism,” Lugar said. But even if the Clintons are no longer formally involved with the foundation or its finances, the friendships and status they cultivated as celebrated members of the global elite will persist. As a result, the favoritism Clinton showed as secretary of state will likely continue if and when she occupies the White House.*The AP excluded donations from foreign governments who ended up getting meetings, “because such meetings would presumably have been part of her diplomatic duties.” That makes no sense. Nearly all of the other meetings Clinton had ― with a nonprofit doing global AIDS work, for instance ― were also part of diplomatic duties, as was overseeing the visa process. The question is not whether the duties fall within or without the scope of a secretary of state, but whether she favored one such duty over another as a result of this web of relationships. So we fixed this for the AP by adding foreign governments back in. As a result, we have removed the proportion of visits by donors that the AP calculated."
25,POLITICS,Here's How The AP Should Have Written Its Hillary Clinton Article,Ryan Grim and Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ap-hillary-clinton-article_us_57c1db75e4b0267344505818,Money is just one form of currency in the Clintons' elite circles.,2016-08-28,Private equity titan Stephen Schwarzman (center) is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation. He got help from the State Department with a visa matter during Clinton's tenure.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Tuesday, The Associated Press published a sweeping new investigation into the mingling of Clinton Foundation donors and official State Department business. It has since come under fire for conceptual and structural flaws. By limiting its investigation of the Clinton Foundation to specific financial contributions that led to direct and specific benefits for donors, The Associated Press left itself vulnerable to criticism that no verifiable “quid pro quo” could be established from its findings. By trying to cram its findings into a small box, it distorted what it found, and missed the bigger picture. If the AP had conceived of the donations as just one of many exchanges of money, prestige and reciprocal back-patting that bind global elites, its case against the Clintons would be considerably stronger. So, with that vision in mind, we’ve done a write-through of the AP’s story ― a heavy edit that relies in many places on their words and reporting, but casts the article in a broader light. The parts in bold come directly from the AP. The rest are our additions. You’re welcome, AP.WASHINGTON ― At least 101* people who met or had phone conversations scheduled with Hillary Clinton while she led the State Department donated to her family charity or pledged commitments to its international programs, according to a review of State Department calendars released so far to The Associated Press. Combined, the 101 donors contributed as much as $326 million. At least 40 donated more than $100,000 each, and at least 20 gave more than $1 million.Among those granted time with Clinton included an internationally known economist who asked for her help as the Bangladesh government pressured him to resign from a nonprofit bank he ran; a Wall Street executive who sought Clinton’s help with a visa problem; and representatives of Gulf state governments working to undermine negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.Her calendars and emails released as recently as this week describe scores of contacts she and her top aides had with foundation donors.The AP’s findings represent the first systematic effort to calculate the scope of the intersecting interests of Clinton Foundation donors and people who met personally with Clinton or spoke to her by phone about their needs.Some of Clinton’s most influential visitors donated millions to the Clinton Foundation and to her and her husband’s political coffers. They are among scores of Clinton visitors and phone contacts in her official calendar turned over by the State Department to AP last year and in more-detailed planning schedules that so far have covered about half of her four-year tenure. The AP sought Clinton’s calendar and schedules three years ago, but delays led the AP to sue the State Department last year in federal court for those materials and other records.The case of Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering low-interest “microcredit” for poor business owners, may be among the most instructive. Although critics such as GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump charge that the frequency of the overlaps shows the intermingling of access and donations, fueling perceptions that giving the foundation money was a price of admission for face time with Clinton, the reality is that the overlap is a function of a worldwide capitalistic system in which oligarchs, corporate CEOs and celebrity heads of state mingle to form a global elite that dictates a global agenda. This can sometimes take the form of quid pro quos, but it is more often a subtle form of exchange, in which exclusion from or inclusion within an elite club depends as much on whom you know as the size of the check you can write.The Clintons did not create this system, but they have become central players within it. It is a cozy world inhabited by a select coterie of political, business and media elites, where tomorrow’s news is often the product of a not-so-serendipitous conversation between a TV pundit and a corporate CEO who were introduced by a foreign minister they both know. In addition to “talking shop” ― exchanging the tips of their respective trades ― they speak about solutions to social ills they rarely encounter directly, typically entertaining ideas within a narrow spectrum of proposals that do not threaten their world view.So many such encounters occur at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland ― more commonly known as “Davos” ― that the gathering has become a descriptor for a certain breed of cosmopolitan, international elite: the Davos set.Hillary and Bill Clinton are stars of the Davos set; so is Muhammad Yunus.[Yunus] met with Clinton three times and talked with her by phone during a period when Bangladeshi government authorities investigated his oversight of a nonprofit bank and ultimately pressured him to resign from the bank’s board. Throughout the process, he pleaded for help in messages routed to Clinton, and she ordered aides to find ways to assist him.“The use of the Clintons in this way, and their willingness to be used, is ‘crony capitalism’ in a very clear form,” said University of Texas economist James Galbraith. “It’s a matter of forming your views of merit on the basis of what wealthy people and their acolytes advise you, and on the basis of personal connections made over the years. Connections that are not made with people who are not wealthy.”American affiliates of [Yunus’] nonprofit Grameen Bank had been working with the Clinton Foundation’s Clinton Global Initiative programs as early as 2005, pledging millions of dollars in microloans for the poor. Grameen America, the bank’s nonprofit U.S. flagship, which Yunus chairs, has given between $100,000 and $250,000 to the foundation - a figure that bank spokeswoman Becky Asch said reflects the institution’s annual fees to attend CGI meetings. Another Grameen arm chaired by Yunus, Grameen Research, has donated between $25,000 and $50,000.But Clinton didn’t need checks from Yunus to know who he was. In fact, the Clintons have a longstanding friendship with Yunus and admiration for his microcredit work that predates any financial contribution he made to the Clinton Foundation. Then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton highlighted Yunus and Grameen Bank as a model for harnessing the “power of the government … to create market forces that work” in an interview with the Rolling Stone during his 1992 presidential run.Clinton had met Yunus several years prior in an encounter organized by a friend of Hillary’s, Clinton told Rolling Stone.Hillary Clinton first met Yunus in 1983, as first lady of Arkansas, she said in a January 2009 speech, at the start of her term as secretary of state. She had invited him to visit Arkansas so she could learn about ways microfinance ― a broader field of low-income banking of which microcredit is a part ― could relieve poverty in the state.As a U.S. senator from New York, Clinton, as well as then-Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and two other senators in 2007 sponsored a bill to award a congressional gold medal to Yunus. He got one but not until 2010, a year after Obama awarded him a Presidential Medal of Freedom.Yunus first met with Clinton in Washington in April 2009. That was followed six months later by an announcement by USAID, the State Department’s foreign aid arm, that it was partnering with the Grameen Foundation, a nonprofit charity run by Yunus, in a $162 million commitment to extend its microfinance concept abroad. USAID also began providing loans and grants to the Grameen Foundation, totaling $2.2 million over Clinton’s tenure.By September 2009, Yunus began complaining to Clinton’s top aides about what he perceived as poor treatment by Bangladesh’s government. His bank was accused of financial mismanagement of Norwegian government aid money ― a charge that Norway later dismissed as baseless. But Yunus told Melanne Verveer, a long-time Clinton aide who was an ambassador-at-large for global women’s issues, that Bangladesh officials refused to meet with him and asked the State Department for help in pressing his case.“Please see if the issues of Grameen Bank can be raised in a friendly way,” he asked Verveer.

Their reign of terror will be over. In this task, we will always err on the side of protecting the American people – we will use immigration law to prevent crimes, and will not wait until some innocent American has been harmed or killed before taking action,” he said.He did not explain how his plan would affect many of the illegal community who have been in the United States for decades and obeyed U.S. laws.Trump said the death in Chicago of Wade cousin Nykea Aldridge, 32, a mother of four, was an example of turmoil in U.S. inner cities. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff to Democratic President Barack Obama, has struggled in particular to contain violence in his city.The incident permitted Trump to bring up again his desire to be a “law and order” president and underscore his drive to appeal to African-American voters who traditionally vote Democratic and overwhelmingly support Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.“It breaks all of our hearts to see it, it’s horrible,” Trump said. “And it’s only getting worse. This shouldn’t happen in our country. This shouldn’t happen in America. We send our thoughts and our prayers to the family, and we also promise to fight for a much, much better tomorrow.”Trump raised the subject after sending out tweets earlier in the day that prompted charges of insensitivity to the death and accusations he sought to exploit it for political purposes.The New York businessman was the headline speaker at “Joni Ernst’s Roast and Ride,” a charity event for military veterans run by U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican.Ernst and most other speakers offered praise for Trump, a rarity at a time when many Republican political leaders have distanced themselves from his candidacy due to his incendiary rhetoric. Trump is running neck and neck with Clinton in polls in the state with 72 days until the Nov. 8 election.(Editing by Matthew Lewis)Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Heavy fighting resumed on Sunday after a one-week lull.The Libyan brigades, mostly from the city of Misrata, say they are close to victory in Sirte, but they have struggled to defend themselves against suicide bombings, sniper fire and landmines. On Sunday several brigades stationed close to Sirte’s seafront advanced several hundred meters eastwards through Sirte’s neighborhood Number One, while other fighters overran Islamic State positions in street-to-street fighting to the south.Fighters used tanks, rocket-propelled grenades and anti-aircraft guns to try to blast through Islamic State sniper positions.The Misrata-led brigades said there had been five attempted car bombings on Sunday in a “desperate attempt to disrupt the advance”, though at least one of the bombs had been destroyed before it could reach its target.The front lines in Sirte were quieter earlier this week as government-led forces said they were giving time to the wives and children of Islamic State fighters to leave the battle zone.Almost all the city’s estimated 80,000 residents left after Islamic State took full control of the city last year, turning it into its regional stronghold and expanding its presence along about 250 km (155 miles) of coastline.The United States has carried out dozens of air strikes against Islamic State positions and vehicles in Sirte. This week the U.S. Africa Command said Marine AH-1W SuperCobra helicopters were being used in the operation, alongside jets and drones.Libyan commanders say some Islamic State militants probably escaped around the start of the campaign to recapture Sirte in May, and their forces have been trying to secure the desert to the south and west of Sirte.(Additional reporting by Ahmed Elumami; editing by Patrick Markey and Andrew Roche)"

It’s about the size of our own Milky Way galaxy but much, much fainter. It contains only about 1 billion stars, which is roughly 1 percent the number of stars in our galaxy. And 99.99 percent of the mass in what some are calling “the Milky Way’s dark twin” is in the form of dark matter, an invisible substance that is believed to make up 85 percent of everything in the universe. Dark matter can be “seen” in the way if affects the movement of stars within galaxies but it has never been directly observed ― at least, not with any certainty.The team of astronomers who discovered Dragonfly 44 with the help of Hawaii’s W. M. Keck Observatory were completely surprised to find the dark galaxy.“We knew about other galaxies that are almost entirely dark matter, but those are tiny dwarf galaxies that are about a million times less massive than Dragonfly 44,” Yale University astronomer Pieter van Dokkum, lead author of a paper about the discovery that was published last week in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, told The Huffington Post.“It is an exciting discovery,” said Jeremiah Ostriker, an astrophysicist at Columbia University. “It gives us a chance to study [dark matter] in detail ― close-up.”How do we know Dragonfly 44 is made of dark matter if we can’t see the stuff?The greater a galaxy’s overall mass, the faster its stars move relative to each other. And the stars in Dragonfly 44 “move at velocities that are far greater than expected for such a dim galaxy,” Roberto Abraham, a University of Toronto astronomer and a co-author of the paper, said in a news release. “It means that Dragonfly 44 has a huge amount of unseen mass.”In other words, oodles of dark matter.Theory holds that dark matter particles annihilate each other and emit gamma radiation whenever they collide, van Dokkum said. Scientists have been searching for this distinctive signal in dwarf dark galaxies, he added, but the signal would be much stronger in a big dark matter galaxy like Dragonfly 44.“The race is on to find massive dark galaxies are even closer to us than Dragonfly 44, so we can look for feeble signals that may reveal a dark matter particle,” he said in the news release.

Since then, the worst predictions have proven baseless and Brazil delivered one of the most exciting Games ever. Rio’s stunning landscape made the cycling, marathon, and beach volleyball competitions particularly exciting to watch. Now that the Olympics are over, what is next for Brazil?Before the Olympics, Brazil was in the midst of a political crisis that is now reaching its peak with the impeachment of seated President Dilma Rousseff. If Rousseff is found guilty of breaking budget laws she will be forced to step down from the Presidency. In this case, the current interim President Michel Temer will complete Rousseff’s term until 2018. Temer became acting president when Rousseff was suspended from her duties last May. The Brazilian senate began the trial against President Rousseff last Thursday, 08/25. On Monday, 08/29, Rousseff will appear before the senate to defend herself against the charges of fiscal irresponsibility in her executive duties as Brazil’s president. Rousseff is accused among other things of using money from state-controlled banks to fund her popular social programs among which the Bolsa Familia or Family Allowance, a program which has been widely praised as lifting millions out of abject poverty.Most political analysts in Brazil are reporting that President Rousseff will be impeached. What is at stake here is not just the presidency of Dilma Rousseff but the end of the Worker’s Party ― the Partido dos Trabalhadores or (PT)- dominance in Brazilian Politics since 2002. In 2014, 51.4% of the electorate reelected Rousseff to the presidency. Their vote will be swept away in a dubious impeachment process.President Rousseff has accused the opposition of using the impeachment proceedings to forge a political coup against her presidency. She is mostly correct since using money from state-controlled banks to bridge budget gaps are nothing new in Brazil. President Rousseff has not been found guilty of using state funds for personal gains as was President Collor who was impeached in 1992 when he used government checks to pay for personal expenses. Rather, Rousseff’s impeachment is the culmination of more than eight years of a surging right wing opposition to the PT. Many Brazilians have also lost faith in the Worker’s Party since it was found embroiled in a widespread corruption scheme that led to the indictment of many PT officials. The impeachment of President Rousseff is in that respect a thinly disguised attack against the PT by the opposition using the flimsiest of legal bases. Dilma Rousseff was a surrogate of ex-President Lula da Silva who was a founding member of the Worker’s Party (PT). In 2002, Lula was elected to the presidency with 61.3% of the vote. He formed a powerful coalition with other leftist parties and delivered on the most important promises of the PT. His government created a series of social programs, among them the Bolsa Familia, the Minha Casa, Minha Vida which is a public housing program, and established an ambitious affirmative action program to ensure that Brazilians of color gained access to the country’s public universities and in the job market. During Lula’s Presidency, Brazil was riding a wave of economic success that allowed the government to pay for these programs while paying off the country’s loan to the IMF and convincing FIFA and the OIC that the country was ready to host the 2014 and 2016 competitions. But in 2005, a journalistic investigation found that the Worker’s Party supported its program in the Brazilian parliament by paying deputies to switch parties and to strengthen the government. Though Lula was elected with 61% of the national vote, his Worker’s Party only won 17% of the vote in the parliament which put his governments in a weak position to the opposition which controlled 26% of the vote. Middle size parties had a number of seats that if joined with the Worker’s Party’s share could only strengthen Lula’s government. Brazilian laws allow politicians to switch parties and in 2003 a number of legislators from the middle size parties were observed switching to the PT. This was not illegal. But the fact that money from state companies was used to pay deputies to switch parties certainly demonstrated widespread corruption in the PT. At the time, President Lula was never directly linked to the corruption scheme but his then chief of staff, José Dirceu, was found to be the main coordinator of the mensalão – kickback - scheme and was sentenced to a seven year prison term. Dirceu was later found guilty in the Lava Jato ‘Carwash’ corruption scheme in 2015 and sentenced to 23 years in prison. The Mensalão rightly tarnished the PT and Rousseff when she was elected to the Presidency in 2011. Still, she was elected with 56% of the vote and continued Lula’s social programs with new vigor. However, Brazil’s economy was in recession which made it more difficult for Rousseff to deliver on her ambitious social programs. Her reelection in 2014 was a close vote with Rousseff reelected with 51.4% of the vote in a second round against candidate Aecio Neves. The call for Rousseff’s impeachment began as soon as she was reelected when Neves’ sympathizers took to the streets accusing the president of corruption. Neves’ supporters accused Rousseff of using her social programs such as the Bolsa Familia and the Minha Casa, Minha Vida to get votes from the poor. That these programs made the PT and Rousseff popular cannot be denied but they are not corruption in and of themselves. One cannot also deny that the PT has lost the popularity that it enjoyed ten years ago. What we are observing now in Brazil is a definite return of the right at the political helm and this does not bode well for Brazil’s poor and the country’s advances in the cause of racial equality and women’s right."

(AP Photo/U.S. Central Command)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, Abu Zubaydah, who has been imprisoned at Guantanamo for 14 years without being charged with a crime, appeared for the first time before the U.S. military Periodic Review Board, which determines whether Guantanamo detainees will continue to be held as “enemy combatants.”Zubaydah argued he should be released because he has “no desire or intent to harm the United States or any other country.” During his hearing, Zubaydah also said he had been tortured by the CIA, an allegation confirmed by the Senate Intelligence Committee’s torture report. The U.S. government maintains he is an enemy combatant.When Zubaydah was apprehended in Pakistan in 2002, the Bush administration characterized him as “chief of operations” for Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden’s “number three” man. This was untrue, according to John Kiriakou, who led the joint CIA-FBI team that caught Zubaydah. Kiriakou confirmed that Zubaydah did not help plan the September 11, 2001 attacks.Dan Coleman, a leading FBI expert on Al Qaeda, said Zubaydah “knew very little about real operations, or strategy.” Coleman’s observations were communicated to President George W. Bush. Nevertheless, the President scolded CIA Director George Tenet, saying, “I said [Zubaydah] was important, You’re not going to let me lose face on this, are you?”Zubaydah was tortured repeatedly at the “black sites,” where the CIA subjected him to waterboarding 83 times. On one occasion, Zubaydah had to be resuscitated. An observer at the scene was quoted in the Senate torture report as saying Zubaydah was “completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.”In 2005, after the Abu Ghraib torture photos came to light, the CIA destroyed several hundred hours of videotapes of the interrogations of Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. The tapes likely depicted waterboarding.Waterboarding is designed, according to Bush lawyer (now federal judge) Jay Bybee, to induce the perception of “suffocation and incipient panic,” i.e. the perception of drowning.The Bush administration claimed it only used waterboarding on three individuals (the third being alleged 9/11 organizer Khalid Sheikh Mohammed). But a footnote in Bush lawyer Stephen Bradbury’s memo says waterboarding was utilized “with far greater frequency than initially indicated” with “large volumes of water” rather than small quantities as required by the CIA’s rules.The CIA also withheld Zubaydah’s medication (as he recovered from severe injuries), slammed him into a wall, threatened him with impending death, shackled him in uncomfortable positions, and bombarded him with continuous deafening noise and harsh lights.In one of his memos, Bybee wrote that the CIA told him, “Zubaydah does not have any pre-existing mental conditions or problems that would make him likely to suffer prolonged mental harm from [the CIA’s] proposed interrogation methods.”Coffin-like BoxBybee granted the CIA’s request to confine Zubaydah in a cramped box with a harmless insect and tell him it will sting him but it won’t kill him. Even though the CIA knew that Zubaydah had an irrational fear of insects, Bybee decided there would be no threat of severe physical pain or suffering if it followed this procedure.“[Zubaydah] spent a total of 266 hours (11 days, 2 hours) in the large (coffin size) confinement box and 29 hours in a small confinement box, which had the width of 21 inches, a depth of 2.5 feet, and a height of 2.5 feet,” according to the Senate torture report.The torture of Zubaydah did not yield useful information. FBI agent Ali Soufan, who interrogated him, wrote in the New York Times that any useful information Zubaydah provided was given before the “enhanced interrogation techniques” — Bush-speak for torture — were used.In response to the torture, Zubaydah told his interrogators that Al Qaeda was planning terrorist attacks against the Brooklyn Bridge, Statute of Liberty, shopping malls, banks, water systems, supermarkets, nuclear plants and apartment buildings. He said Al Qaeda was close to building a crude nuclear bomb. None of this was ever corroborated.The Torture Statute punishes conduct, or conspiracy to engage in conduct, specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering. “Severe mental pain or suffering” means the prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from either the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering, or from the threat of imminent death.It is undisputed that waterboarding constitutes torture, which is considered a war crime under the U.S. War Crimes Act. Cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment is also outlawed by the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, a treaty the United States has ratified.Despite his constitutional duty to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” President Barack Obama refuses to bring the Bush officials who tortured Zubaydah and others to justice.Donald Trump has pledged to keep Guantanamo open and advocates a resumption of waterboarding. Indeed, he promised a Trump administration would “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.”Hillary Clinton opposes waterboarding. She said torture is an “open recruitment poster for more terrorists,” and “over the years, Guantanamo has inspired more terrorists than it has imprisoned.”Meanwhile, Zubaydah languishes at Guantanamo, with no hope of release.Joseph Margulies, one of Zubaydah’s lawyers, said his client is “the poster child for the torture program, and that’s why they never want him to be heard from again.”Marjorie Cohn is professor emerita at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, former president of the National Lawyers Guild, and deputy secretary general of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.
