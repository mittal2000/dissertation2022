0,POLITICS,North Carolina Agrees 'Bathroom Bill' Is Hurting The State's Reputation,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-bathroom-bill_us_57bde436e4b085c1ff26fa04,And it's dragging down the Republican governor's reelection chances.,2016-08-24,"Museum Manager Jeff Bell puts up a gender neutral bathroom sign in the 21C Museum Hotel public restrooms on May 10, 2016, in Durham, North Carolina.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57be13e11800002100bcce8a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While North Carolina residents are divided on their approval of the state’s controversial “bathroom bill,” the majority of them agree that HB2 has succeeded in one area: making the Tar Heel State look bad. A poll by the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute released Wednesday found that slightly more than a third (36 percent) of likely North Carolina voters polled in a multi-question survey supported HB2, while 55 percent disapproved of the law. Nine percent had no opinion.Yet regardless of their personal attitude on HB2, a whopping 70 percent of respondents said the law has had a “bad” or otherwise negative impact on North Carolina’s reputation nationally. Compared to a poll by Public Policy Polling in April, Wednesday’s poll from Monmouth shows sentiment toward HB2’s perceived impact has grown steadily more negative over the summer. Passed in March, the bill prevents local governments from protecting LGBT people by cutting off the ability to pass local anti-discrimination policies that go beyond the state standard.Most notably, the bill has a provision that prevents public places like schools from allowing transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponds to their identity.The bill drew swift backlash from the business and entertainment world, and even other states condemned it.Shortly after the legislation passed, more than 90 prominent business leaders from companies including Apple, Facebook, Airbnb, Yahoo, Twitter, Salesforce, Marriott, Pfizer and Levi Strauss signed a letter calling on Gov. Pat McCrory (R) to repeal the law entirely. Prominent public universities rebuked HB2; PayPal scrapped a plan to expand in Charlotte, which would have brought 400 new jobs; and the NBA pulled the All-Star game from the state. Cities like Washington, D.C., San Francisco, New York and Atlanta banned government-sponsored travel to the state. McCrory has staunchly defended HB2, but his support of the law could be hurting his reelection prospects. Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper, McCrory’s challenger, has been leading the incumbent by between 6 and 9 points in recent polls. Voters polled by Monmouth revealed they’re split on how good of a job they think the governor has done for state residents: Forty-five percent approved of the job McCrory has done, while 46 percent disapproved.“McCrory is trying to take control of the HB2 debate with a new TV ad,” Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement Wednesday. “As of right now, though, North Carolina voters feel it has hurt the state, which is helping Cooper’s bid to unseat the incumbent.”"

But in the hours that followed, questions began to mount about the presentation of the AP story.The AP got called out for a misleading (and widely shared) tweet accompanying the report that made it appear that half of all Clinton’s meetings ― not just those with private officials ― had taken place with foundation donors. Vox’s Matthew Yglesias challenged the broader thrust of the AP’s story even further, arguing that the AP framed its findings as more scandalous than they warranted. Though Yglesias acknowledged that potential links between Clinton’s State Department and the candidate deserved scrutiny, he argued that donors who apparently received preferential access actually deserved it and were pushing unobjectionable, noble causes.The Clinton campaign quickly circulated the Vox article, in addition to noting that some of the relationships that the AP highlighted ― including one with Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Prize-winning Bangladeshi economist ― existed before Clinton’s tenure at state.Their frustrations with the AP story didn’t end there, however.Aides to the Democratic nominee say that the AP has not given them the actual list of the 85 foundation donors who the outlet says got access to Clinton while she was at State, making it hard for them to rebut charges that she engaged in quid-pro-quos. But on Wednesday, they began filling in the holes.“We have applied the AP’s criteria on our own, cross-referencing publicly available donor info with publicly available schedules of her meetings,” the campaign’s press secretary, Brian Fallon, told The Huffington Post.Among the names of people they believe the AP is referencing are the late Nobel Prize winner and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, former NBA star Dikembe Mutombo and actor Ben Affleck. The latter two have parlayed their fame into global philanthropy campaigns and humanitarian efforts. The Associated Press declined on Wednesday to disclose the list of 85 people who it reportedly identified as having donated as much as $156 million to the foundation. “We are still reporting on them ― cross-referencing information and so on,” AP Director of Media Relations Paul Colford told HuffPost, adding that the news organization is “not done with the names yet.”That is well within their rights, considering how hard the outlet worked to get the data. Along with publicly available information, the news wire based Tuesday’s report on new details about Clinton’s State Department schedule that it obtained after suing the department last year. So far, the AP has received Clinton’s more detailed schedules for half of her four-year tenure.The AP broadly defended its work Wednesday in a statement published on its website. The news organization, Colford wrote, “has been transparent in how it has reported this story.”Colford added that the AP hopes to obtain the remaining two years of Clinton’s detailed schedules at the State Department before Election Day."

As the death toll climbed and the country reeled from the disaster, Pope Francis postponed a planned portion of his weekly general audience to lead thousands of pilgrims through a prayer in St. Peter’s Square.“I had prepared the catechesis for today, as for all Wednesdays during this year of mercy, focusing on the closeness of Jesus,” Francis said, according to Vatican Radio.“However on hearing of the news of the earthquake that has struck central Italy, and which has devastated entire areas and left many wounded, I cannot fail to express my heartfelt sorrow and spiritual closeness to all those present in the zones afflicted.”The pope then invited those gathered in the square to join him in praying “the sorrowful mysteries,” a portion of the Rosary prayer.“I ask you to join me in praying to the Lord Jesus, who is always moved by compassion before the reality of human suffering, that he may console the broken hearted, and through the intercession of the Virgin Mary, bring them peace,” the pontiff said.The earthquake struck roughly 85 miles east of Rome, causing severe damage in the Italian regions of Umbria, Lazio and Marche. The town of Amatrice in Lazio was virtually flattened by the disaster.Francis dispatched six of the Vatican’s firefighters to aid with rescue efforts and help civil protection workers search for survivors in the rubble.The pontiff went on to say in his address: “Hearing the mayor of Amatrice say that the town no longer exists, and learning that there are children among the dead, I am deeply saddened.”"

But maybe that’s just because art isn’t created with dogs in mind.Dominic Wilcox is changing that. The British designer’s canine-centric exhibition, commissioned by U.K. insurance company More Than, ran from Aug. 19–20 in London. The show was part of the company’s #PlayMore campaign, which encourages people to spend more time playing with their pets.The show included artwork painted in a canine-friendly color scheme, as well as large interactive pieces like a huge dog bowl filled with balls and an “open car window simulator” that involved a fan wafting around scents like meat and old shoes.Wilcox says the canines approved.“The dogs seemed to love their visit,” he told The Huffington Post in an email. “Tails were wagging like crazy at the giant dog food bowl filled with brown balls. They were jumping in and out of that one.”The dogs’ enthusiasm is a credit to the research that went into the show.“Even though the idea of the show is quite amusing on some level, I took the design of the artwork as seriously as any other work I do,” he said. “Through research I discovered that dogs can only see in yellows and blues mostly. By thinking about how the world looks to a dog it gave me the idea to commission some fellow artists to create wall-based work that dogs would appreciate. The colors needed to be within the dogs’ color spectrum and were shown at dog-eye level, low down.”He added that each work included a corresponding scent. A landscape featuring trees made of giant chicken drumsticks, for instance, smelled like chicken.Wilcox says people keep asking him when he’s going to repeat the show, but he’s “waiting for the right offer.” He also wants to expand the scope of the exhibit. And he’s not ruling out a show for cats, either.“Cats would be interesting,” he said. “I think some work could be shown high up so that they can jump up to see it, but that humans can’t get to. It’s all about the animals.”More photos from the show:"

For now.,2016-08-24,"Earlier this year, new Obama administration rules forced Pfizer to keep the ""little blue pill"" under the red, white and blue.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bdc0531600002900bfe206.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pfizer went on a shopping spree this week, spending nearly $15.6 billion on two acquisitions to boost its array of cancer drugs and antibiotics.The Viagra maker on Monday bought Medivation for $14 billion, adding the San Francisco-based firm’s lucrative prostate cancer drug Xtandi to its roster of oncology treatments. On Wednesday, the company announced the purchase of U.K. rival AstraZeneca’s antibiotics division for $1.575 billion plus royalties to bolster a part of Pfizer’s business that’s been hurt by expired patents.The deals mark a departure from Pfizer’s attempts in the last two years to merge with rivals in low-tax Britain or Ireland in hopes of dodging taxes in the United States. Instead of boosting its bottom line by skirting taxes, Pfizer is trying to do better at what it’s meant to do: make and sell pharmaceuticals. In 2014, Pfizer aggressively tried to buy AstraZeneca outright for $119 billion. Last year, Pfizer was at it again, bidding up to $160 billion to buy Botox-maker Allergan and move to Ireland, a favorite offshore destination for corporations to store their cash.Such schemes, called “corporate tax inversions,” essentially allow a company to absorb a smaller competitor in another country, then adopt the acquired firm’s citizenship in order to lower their taxes. On paper, the U.S. has a high corporate tax rate, but loopholes and generous tax breaks lower that number dramatically.The average effective tax rate for companies is 27.1 percent, compared with 27.7 percent for most other developed economies, according to estimates by the Congressional Research Service. For big companies, which can spend lots of money on lawyers and accountants to structure their businesses to be “tax-efficient,” the number is even lower. A survey of 288 corporations, including most Fortune 500 companies that turned a profit between 2008 and 2012, paid an average federal tax rate of just 19.4 percent during that period, according to Citizens for Tax Justice.In April, hastily passed rules by the U.S. Treasury Department ― seemingly tailored specifically to spoil Pfizer’s deal ― forced the company to ditch its plan to move abroad. But analysts at the time warned The Huffington Post that the new regulations didn’t go far enough to prevent Pfizer or others from trying to finagle similar deals in the future. For now, at least, the rules have made tax inversions less attractive. Pfizer, founded in Brooklyn 167 years ago by two cousins who invented the antibiotic oxytetracycline, can use its deep pockets to get better at producing better drugs for sick people, not bigger stock dividends for shareholders.

The swimmers initially said that they’d been pulled out of a cab and robbed at gunpoint, but security footage from the gas station disproved this claim.In a lengthy statement, Feigen admitted that he made a mistake by “omitting facts.”“I was trying to protect my teammates and for this I apologize,” he said. “I would like to apologize for the serious distractions from the Olympics, Rio de Janeiro and Team USA.” The real story appeared to be that a gas station worker, who had a gun, confronted the athletes after Lochte pulled a sign off the wall. Lochte also admitted that he “over-exaggerated” after he alleged that men who claimed to be police officers held a gun to his head.Feigen denied authorities’ claims that he and his fellow athletes broke down the gas station’s bathroom door ― an incident that was not seen in security footage. Police also said the swimmers damaged a mirror and a soap dispenser. Read his full statement here. The swimmers could face serious punishment over their behavior, including a suspension or ban from the sport. Lochte has already lost at least three sponsors over the controversy."
6,POLITICS,CIA Psychologists Sue CIA For Documents To Prove Torture Program Wasn't Their Idea,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cia-psychologists-sue-torture_us_57bcd359e4b03d51368b9167,The CIA suggested it could instead provide an anonymous witness to answer questions in writing.,2016-08-24,An alleged CIA black site in a Polish village. Two CIA-contracted psychologists accused of helping create the CIA's torture program are suing the agency for documents about the program's inception.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bce3801700001108c75086.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The two CIA-contracted psychologists accused of crafting the spy agency’s so-called “enhanced interrogation program” want the U.S. government to turn over documents they hope will show the torture program wasn’t their fault. The motion to compel the documents, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Monday, alleged that the CIA and Justice Department had been uncooperative in supplying James Elmer Mitchell and John “Bruce” Jessen with “documents critical to their defense.”Their request is related to a separate ongoing lawsuit in Spokane, Washington, where the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of three former CIA detainees, is suing Jessen and Mitchell for their alleged role in creating and implementing an interrogation program that used techniques now considered to be torture. The pair was hired by the CIA as contractors in 2002, as the agency was rounding up individuals suspected of having ties to al Qaeda and the Taliban and interrogating them in secret black sites around the world. Jessen and Mitchell’s company ultimately collected $81 million for their work. The two psychologists have argued that they should have immunity from prosecution over the enhanced interrogation program because it was authorized by the executive branch during a time of war.Mitchell and Jessen initially sought to have the lawsuit against them thrown out ― which is what has happened with past attempts to hold the CIA legally responsible for its torture program. But Senior Judge Justin L. Quackenbush of the Eastern District of Washington ruled in April that the case would continue and ordered both sides to begin discovery, the process of exchanging evidence before trial. That’s where Mitchell and Jessen ran into problems. According to the motion filed Monday, the subpoenas they submitted to the CIA and DOJ in June requested approximately 30 categories of documents. Back-and-forth correspondence between the government and lawyers for Mitchell and Jessen follows the same pattern, the motion alleged: “The Government claiming that it wants to provide Defendants with information, but is unsure how it can provide such information or when.” The government has said that the psychologists’ request is overly vague and burdensome, ostensibly because of classification issues in documents related to the CIA’s now-defunct torture program. In lieu of providing Mitchell and Jessen with the documents they have requested, the government has proposed “alternative and creative options,” the motion said. One option proposed by the CIA is to provide an anonymous witness who could answer questions in writing that could be used in court about the duo’s role in the torture program.Lawyers representing Mitchell and Jessen rejected that option, “in part, because of the uncertain evidentiary value of such an affidavit and deposition,” the motion said. The court in Spokane, where the torture victims are suing Mitchell and Jessen, has set a discovery deadline of Feb. 17, 2017, although a list of expert witnesses and trial witnesses is due at the end of the year. The case is scheduled to go to trial next June. "
7,THE WORLDPOST,This Man Is Paying The Fines For Women Ticketed Under France's Burkini Ban,Willa Frej,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-man-whos-paying-burkini-ban-fines-says-hes-just-defending-human-rights_us_57bdbbcee4b00c67eca0f81c,He says he's just defending human rights.,2016-08-24,Hind Ahmas (R) is pictured in 2011 wearing a niqab and displayed a 120 euro fine. Nekkaz (L) is holding a second woman's fine.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bddc881800002100bccd77.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A wealthy entrepreneur who has taken it upon himself to pay the fines of women ticketed under France’s new “burkini” ban says he’s merely trying to lawfully defend human rights.Rachid Nekkaz, born in France to Algerian parents, has already paid fines on behalf of five different women since the ban went into effect in 26 French beach towns last month, he told The Huffington Post by phone from his home in Algeria on Wednesday.The ban has sparked a vicious debate in a country particularly on edge since a terrorist attack in the seaside city of Nice on Bastille Day. Defenders of the ban claim it protects women who would otherwise be harassed for visibly being Muslim, while critics denounce it for taking away a woman’s right to choose how she dresses.Banning women from wearing burkinis in public “goes against democracy and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in every way,” Nekkaz said. “It’s deplorable.”Nekkaz views the duty of paying fines as a way of “neutralizing the law” while still respecting it.“I want to de-dramatize the situation,” he said. “There’s no choice but to pay these fines. But these women are suffering and France’s spirit of vivre ensemble [the concept of living together harmoniously] suffers too.”He said he even asked the mayors of all 26 towns that enacted the ban to send fines to him directly so he can pay them on behalf of all women. “I contacted every local police department and the national police, who is tracking the fines, but none wanted to meet,” he said.France’s government has defended the bans, claiming they were enacted in order to protect Muslim women. Prime Minister Manuel Valls went so far as to say burkinis contribute to the “enslavement of women.”But Nekkaz feels that the government is instead politicizing the issue and causing divisiveness in order to gain support in upcoming elections.“France is eight months away from presidential elections,” he said. “And both the right and the left have decided to make the question of Islam the central issue. They want to pit French people against one another.”Up until recently, he said, no one was discussing the burkini. Most people probably didn’t even know it existed.“It reveals that what interests people in France is this question of penalizing people who are covered up, but burkinis don’t even fully cover people’s faces,” he said.He fears that law enforcement specifically take issue with Islam. “French police have a problem with Muslim women and the Muslim community. I think their wish is to completely ban Islam,” he said.His views date back to when countries like France decided to ban women from wearing any kind of veil covering the face, including a burqa or a niqab, in public.In 2010, he put 1 million euros aside to pay any fines doled out to women wearing veils. He’s so far paid 1,165 fines in France, Switzerland and Belgium, he said, that amount to more than $200,000. Belgium has since stopped fining women.“I’m not a typical Muslim,” he noted. He is against the burqa and the niqab. “I am just defending human rights.”Nekkaz has requested that U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon intervene to “stop this legislative war against Muslim women in France,” he said. "
8,ARTS & CULTURE,How An Ordinary Ballpoint Pen Became Art's Most Democratic Medium,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ballpoint-pen-trent-morse-art-book_us_57bc4cf9e4b0b51733a5b161,Here's why you should consider picking up a pen and making some art.,2016-08-24,"<strong>Russell Crotty</strong>, ""Venus Above Smogline in the Azure Hills,"" 2006, Ballpoint pen and watercolor on paper",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bc497e180000ad02bcc7c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"When you hear the words “ballpoint pen,” you might think of office supplies before fine art tools. And yet, the common writing instrument has delivered unto the world an artistic genre all its own, defined by crisp lines, glistening ink, that piercing royal blue hue.Since its invention in the late 19th century, the ballpoint pen, in all its unpretentiousness, has been used to create some extraordinary artworks. Alberto Giacometti, Andy Warhol and Francis Bacon are among the big names to have explored its many powers. However, the most miraculous works to come out of the ballpoint tradition are by artists who may never have created any artwork at all had they not had access to these affordable, ubiquitous, humble writing instruments. A book titled Ballpoint Art by writer and art historian Trent Morse delves into the knotty, highly detailed world of pen art. “In a way, ballpoint ink diminishes the distance between artist and audience,” Ignacio Uriarte explains in the book, “because everybody has used it and knows how the artwork is done and how it feels to do it.”Throughout its pages, the book features the work of Iranian born artist Mehrdad Rashidi, who fled Iran at 20 years old for political reasons and settled in Germany. In 2006, at 43 years old, he began to draw, doodling on shopping receipts, old notebooks, and whatever scraps he could get his hands on with increasing compulsion. Another self-taught artist who uses ballpoint pens is Indonesian artist Noviadi Angkasapura, who, at the age of 24, encountered what he describes as a supernatural creature in a waking state. The spirit left behind a note reading “honesty” and “patience.” These two virtues have guided Angkasapura ever since, as he continues to create a drawing a day, each a dreamlike image invoking Javanese narrative scrolls and Indonesian sacred imagery. “Some people call me art brut, another outsider, and some say I am contemporary, it hardly matters to me,” the artist has said. “The important thing is my commitment to draw and deliver the message, to try and make this spiritual message more understandable.”Although it’s certainly cool to know that Warhol worked in ballpoints, the most remarkable part of the medium is its radical availability, which invites the most unlikely art makers to embark on lifelong creative journeys, artists like Rashidi or Angkasapura. Morse’s book dismantles the assumption that ballpoint pens are best used to draft grocery lists. Rather, he shows the vibrant potential of the unassuming medium, as writ across paper and furniture and walls and even the facade of an entire building. The best part about the ballpoint pen? You can buy a 60 pack on Amazon for no more than $3. That’s one less excuse for why you’re not engaging in some daily creative meditation. Trent Morse’s Ballpoint Art is available from Laurence King Publishing. "

During an interview with People magazine, Legend shared how his mother’s past drug abuse and prison stint ultimately tore a part his family. “As a teenager growing up in Ohio, I watched my mother deal with depression and drug abuse after my maternal grandmother – a person who filled our whole family with love – passed away,” he said. “My mother’s addiction didn’t just tear her life apart. It tore me and the rest of our family apart, too.” The 37-year-old went on to add that his mother “didn’t need punishment” in the form of being incarcerated, but instead, “she needed help” to address her depression and drug abuse. Legend suggests investing more resources into preventing American citizens from being incarcerated, instead of “investing our resources in locking people up.”Legend professed his optimism for a change to the inequalities of America’s justice system before during this year’s 47th Annual NAACP Image Awards.“Today, communities of color are still being crushed by a criminal justice system that over-polices us, over-arrests us, over-incarcerates us, and disproportionately takes the lives of our young people because of the simple fact that our skin conjures the image of threat and violence,” he said during his acceptance speech for the President’s Award.“Despite the daunting problems we face I am hopeful that our generation will demand and achieve radical change in our lifetime.”Read more of John Legend’s People interview here, and watch clip from the “My Potential” initiative below."
