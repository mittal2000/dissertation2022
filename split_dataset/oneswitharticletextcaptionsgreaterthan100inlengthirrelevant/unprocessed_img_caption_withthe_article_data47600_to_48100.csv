When I was approximately 23, a simple utterance reminded me of this. The ire coldness of the air",2016-08-28,"A self-portrait of Vincent van Gogh, the famous painter who possibly suffered from vertigo, nausea, and tinnitus. This topic remains debated.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c32c041800002800bcd9ee.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Acts of speech hold power. When I was approximately 23, a simple utterance reminded me of this. The ire coldness of the air that carried it pierced me. And while the breath that carried it has long since dissipated, it emerged from me without its words.“Get used to it.”Funny, even anti-climactic, these words: this is because they are so simple, common, and unimaginative. Certainly, they can be insensitive. However, I never imagined what gravity they could wield. I never guessed that they could be so deleterious. At any rate, these were the words that an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist dryly imparted to me near the end of my consultation.Not long before this, I had begun to suffer from a cacophony of noises and ringing in my ears, and all over and within the inside of my head, without any clear precipitating event. Sometimes there were three, four, or five different tones, rumbles, or roars. My hearing had been faltering, which I had only discovered after attempting to enlist in the military, an action that resulted in me being rejected for my apparent deficits. Soon, I experienced dizziness and felt grossly overwhelmed, like I was alien in my own world. Phantom noises interrupted my sleep and triggered seizure-like bursts of adrenaline at random. Slowly but surely, my focus was slipping. Conversations became hard, tiresome. Words started to arrive to me as stones, devoid of meaning, heavy with force.I told the doctor all of this. He conducted tests. Outwardly I was mostly still and tense. Mildly sweaty, I continued to attempt stoicism, not wanting to show weakness. Emotion crept through wobbles and cracks in my voice as I answered his questions. He seemed to register this, and rather intellectually, but he remained indifferent.You are going to die from this. That was my thought in that moment. You have cancer, or a tumor, or something terrible. It’s obviously killing you.“You have sensorineural hearing loss. The ringing is called tinnitus,” he said, rather pragmatically, at the conclusion of his short investigation.“From what? Should I get an MRI or something?“No, that’s not necessary.”“What’s causing it?”He shrugged. “There is no way to know.”“What can I do?”And then those words arrived. “Get used to it.”Following this exchange, he offered me a prescription for an antidepressant with all the bearing of a lord offering a beggar some change. I refused it. Something was physically wrong with me, I remember thinking. I didn’t want a prescription. I wanted an answer, a cure. After explaining that I didn’t feel comfortable with an anti-depressant without knowing what was wrong with me, he simply shrugged. “See your primary care doctor if you change your mind. I don’t usually give these prescriptions anyway.” And with that, he promptly concluded the appointment.The physical sensation in that moment is indelibly impressed in my memory. I cannot explain it, but it was akin to nausea and vertiginous emptiness. I was moving downward while my body stayed still and my auditory sensations engaged in a riot.How could anyone live like this? I was slipping. No one can. I can’t do this.To be fair, I don’t necessarily blame the doctor for his manner. I was his last patient of the day. He didn’t know me. Fatigue greeted me from the puffiness of his face, from the caving of his shoulders. As someone who later joined a helping profession, I know that we all have these bad days. Still, the affects of his callousness and silence on my condition were palpable. He offered neither an explanation of my symptoms nor words of encouragement, no hope nor referral. He did not even offer me a follow up.Well, that’s it.Time passed. Thanksgiving came. Hunched inward, I ate quietly, mechanically, somehow not used to my hands amidst other people. My family was conversing and laughing. Meanwhile, I was pretending to be the young man they once knew. In that moment, I remember estimating that I would definitely not live to see 30 years of age. Suicidal ideation occurred daily; however, I did not think that I would be dead so soon because I had any intention of killing myself. Instead, I figured that the sheer amount of stress that I experienced on an almost moment-to-moment basis would accomplish this thoroughly, either by heart attack or stroke.And quite honestly, I did not mind the thought. There is no space here to properly explain my judgment, but I’ll try. Sensory deprivation and its consequences depress the mood and complicate every life challenge and developmental hurdle. Soon I was left without a relationship, without friends, and without hope. Bit by bit, I experienced my personality being deleted. I was not stimulated; I was still. Ruminated and ill. Who could live in those conditions?Well, I did, and against my will. I kept on breathing to my own chagrin.The journey was difficult. I had to fill the time. I had to distract my mind from the cacophony. So I wrote. Books, short stories, essays ― most of it terrible, obtuse, and didactic, and I knew this, but I wrote anyway. Loads of it was doggerel, but it served as life support for my imagination. Strangely, I became more spiritual and religious where I had previously been so staunchly unbelieving. I did not attend church. The thought of that overwhelmed me. Instead, I read a bit of Dostoevsky when I could focus, which made me love writing all the more. The man has been dead for over a century and his words helped save my life.I had to get up in the morning although my spirit felt dull and my heart and mind felt dire. When I wanted to numb and wither, I walked, or ran, or boxed. When my mind began to slip and there was no escape, for elusion is impossible when your enemy is your own anatomy, in place of meaningless suffering, of odious stillness, again I wrote stories and fairytales.I am thankful for my family and my few friends of this time period. I do not mean to convey that I did all of this on my own. They supported me in ways I cannot even cognize. They housed me, fed me, provided me with the invisible manifold of social support so crucial to anyone facing life challenges. They pushed me; they forced me to socialize. Never did they shame me, but they made me so angry, so irritable. And I love them for it.Soon enough, I enrolled in school. New friends arrived in bundles. Slowly, things improved, but not in any linear fashion. I would go to class, do my work, and socialize but I became known for ceaseless, misplaced smiles and endless head bobbles. Every moment of every conversation required conscious effort, inference, and risk. People always had to repeat themselves or I would make a mistake and slow down the flow of dialogue. Despite their best efforts, I would always notice their agitation, their tiredness of me. I was lost, alienated. My speech became pressured, insecure, rambling. Still, my head rang and I often staggered. Reclusion thus became more comfortable. I lived for years like this, without hearing aids.Why did I live without hearing aids for so long? Good question! Hearing aids are considered cosmetic in the United States and are not covered by most insurances. Decent ones cost in the thousands of dollars. This is unconscionable. Not only do they improve the quality of life, they are medically necessary. The more time you spend without hearing aids, the more your brain forgets how to process sound ― words ― social cues. Disability can soon pursue, precluding your ability to work and afford them, which, again, only hastens the decompensation.Finally, I obtained them, but only after I managed to rebuild my life to some major extent, with my family’s help and my own perseverance, and procure a job that allowed me to finance their purchase.Surprisingly enough, during this time, I also had to quest after my diagnosis and recovery plan. None of the litany of medical professionals I ever consulted with ever helped me find an answer until the last. In fact, only two years ago was I finally diagnosed with “cookie bite hearing loss,” a rare auditory condition that affects the processing of mid-frequency sounds, and educated on exercises to help preserve my balance. I’m supremely and inexpressibly thankful for this last doctor who cared enough to do a full workup and name my condition. A good mystery might be entertaining when it is found in a novel, but I can assure you, it is hardly fun when it is found in your health.Now, for the positives. Obviously, I have not died. Although, if I have, at least this would be rather exciting for paranormal enthusiasts. After all, that would mean that I was a revenant and solid proof of the existence of an afterlife. Perhaps this could also land me a role in a future Ghostbuster’s movie. Call me, Leslie Jones.Anyhow, all humor aside, I am 33 now. I smile a lot. I am neither ruined nor deleted and while I am indeed a different person, I am also a better one, emboldened in new ways and capable of loud and annoyingly boisterous laughter.I am a clinical social worker, having obtained my Master of Social Work. I have started my own business and I am involved in a nonprofit that seeks to enhance the quality and accountability of mental healthcare through evidence-based practice and quantitative methods. Presently, I spend much of my time being of service to individuals who are struggling with life changing illnesses, obstacles, or situations, helping them to recover and/or grow.Importantly, as deprived as I was, I am conscientious that I was fortunate to have access to the resources that I did. Paying this forward is an ethical mandate and I have a debt to remunerate. Innumerable individuals suffer from even more complicated forms of deprivation on top of mine, be it for reasons related to poverty, to institutional racism, or to so many other factors.Such injustices can transform a Kafkaesque horror story into a Lovecraftian nightmare. This is also why slogans such as “Black Lives Matter” are so important. I can’t imagine what my life would have been like if I was born into different circumstances. Perhaps I would not be alive.To this day, life isn’t perfect. I continue to lose my hearing. There is a marked probability that I will be legally deaf within a decade and a half. My dizziness, my nausea, are common companions. More and more, I find myself lost and aloof in the same social situations that I once enjoyed. Strangely, while I have forgotten what the experience of silence is like, I have at least trained myself not to be swallowed by the wormhole in my head, which can so readily estrange me and sap my sense of wellness.The loss is unutterable. The feeling of a personal death is real. I thought I was dead—and in many ways, more spiritually speaking, I was in part. There are many things I am not sharing. I am irrevocably different.However as long as you do not give up you will adapt and grow. You will be given opportunities to experience life again in ways you never imagined.Many days will temporarily block out the sun. Nonetheless, if this experience has taught me one important lesson, it is that regardless of the pain, regardless of the hopelessness, it is invariably ephemeral—it does pass, it does fade, and days of happiness and accomplishment follow.I can honestly say that I think I am happier than I ever would have been otherwise. Irrevocable difference is not irrevocable or universal loss. Again, the loss is indeed there, but the gains can also be just. So please, don’t give up. Now, I want to breathe. There will be life again.Although this article is about hearing loss and its associated conditions, I hope that the message is also helpful for individuals who are suffering from other life changing illnesses or situations. Moreover, many soldiers experience hearing loss, tinnitus, and other similar and/or related symptoms as a consequence of their service, in addition to the burdens of injury, trauma, and post-traumatic stress. I can never speak for them, but I still hope that a facet of my experience is of use.The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) is an institute that advocates for individuals experiencing communication-related disabilities and supports professionals and research in these areas. ASHA also has a list of institutes and foundations that are dedicated to researching and combatting these conditions as well.

1,BLACK VOICES,"Emmett Till, 61 Years Later: Let's Stop Pretending We'll Never Forget","Karen E. Quinones Miller, ContributorJournalist, Best-Selling Author, Activist, An All-around Angry...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emmett-till-61-years-later-lets-keep-pretending_us_57c335cce4b00c54015e6022,"Emmett Till was killed before he could marry or have children, but writer Bernice McFadden ― author of 14 books including",2016-08-28,"Roy Bryant, one of two men charged with the kidnapping and lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till of Chicago, sits in court on the opening day of the trial.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c473cb1600003503bff2bb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Note: This post contains graphic images which may be upsetting for some readers.It was 61 years ago this past weekend ― on August 28, 1955 ― that two white men, carrying guns, pulled 14-year-old Emmett Till out of his grandparents’ home in Money, Mississippi.The teenager’s body was discovered in the Tallahatchie River three days later.It was revealed that he had been severely beaten, his eye had been gouged out, and he had been shot in the head; then a 70-pound cotton gin fan was attached to his neck by barb wire and his body was thrown in the river.The two men ― Roy Bryant and J. W. Milam ― who had pulled him out of the house were charged with kidnapping and murder. The defendants were allowed to sit with their families, even bouncing toddlers on their lap while testimony was being given.It took the all-white jury just one hour and seven minutes to find the men not guilty. One juror later said they would have come back with the verdict sooner if they had not stopped to get a pop; they wanted to stretch it out in order to make it look good.One year later, both men admitted their guilt in a Look Magazine interview. Milam told the writer, William Bradford Huie, that their intentions were just to scare Till. Push him around a little, pistol whip him, and then let him go. But, Milam, said, Till took the whipping but remained unrepentant ― even told his persecutors that he was unafraid of them, and that he was just as good as them.“Well, what else could we do? He was hopeless. I’m no bully; I never hurt a nigger in my life. I like niggers ― in their place ― I know how to work ‘em. But I just decided it was time a few people got put on notice. As long as I live and can do anything about it, niggers are gonna stay in their place.”So Roy Bryant and J. W. Milam happily committed kidnapping, torture, and murder and got away with it.Emmett Till, on the other hand, was murdered for the crime of... oh, that’s right, I didn’t say . . .His alleged crime, was whistling at a white woman ― Carolyn Bryant, the wife of Till’s murderer Roy Bryant.Emmett Till was killed before he could marry or have children, but writer Bernice McFadden ― author of 14 books including “Gathering of Waters,” a novel based on Till’s tragic demise ― maintains that he still has a long line of descendants. Not necessarily related to him by a shared bloodline, she explains, but descendants nonetheless. “His descendants are the hundreds of Black men and women who’ve had their lives taken by racist civilians and police officers in the sixty-one years since Emmett Till was murdered,” says McFadden, seen in the above video discussing “Gathering of Waters” ― which made The New York Times 100 Notable Books list ― at the Center for Fiction in New York.Oh, let me assure you there was an outcry from the African-American community about Emmett Till’s lynching, of course. We’re soooo good at public outcries.Don’t you think? But, hmm, I wonder why rapper Lil Wayne felt so comfortable using Emmett Till’s name in a most vulgar way in a guest verse on fellow rapper Future’s 2013 song, Karate Chop. In the verse, which was pulled from the song by Epic Records before it went on sale in retail stores, Lil Wayne raps about his sexual prowess, and him “beating that pussy up like Emmett Till.” Oh, of course he apologized ― a couple of weeks after there was a public outcry (there we go again!), but would he even have done it if we were really serious about we’ll never forget?OK, let me bring up some sore points.Remember 17-year-old Trayvon Martin? You should. He was killed in 2012, not some sixty years ago. He didn’t do anything as awful as whistling at a white woman. All he did was wear a hoodie in the rain while walking home after buying a package of Skittles.His killer was identified, and was acquitted.Yeah, public outcry. HUGE public outcry. And yet, just a year later there was Tamir Rice. Wow, he was even younger than Till ― only 12-years-old! Shot by a Cleveland police officer while holding a toy gun. Thankfully his murderer was put on trial, found guilty and locked up. Oh, wait a minute, he wasn’t. “The point of remembering is to remind ourselves we don’t live in a colorblind society,” Sharlia Lebreton Gulley, a friend of my daughter, told me in a recent conversation.To forget, continued Gulley ― a 27-year old postgraduate candidate at Florida International University ― is to run the risk “of drinking the kool-aid,” and pretending the murder of Tamir Rice had nothing to do with race. “We’d starting thinking we really do have equal opportunities, and that black lives actually matter.” I don’t know... but it seems that we really have that a great track record when it comes to remembering. The murders stay in the media, and in our minds for a few weeks, a few months ― and now, perhaps because of the Black Lives Matter movement, maybe even a few years. But only a few years ― if that much.When the Lil Wayne verse controversy occurred in 2013, I talked to about 20 people under the age of 30, but only seven of them knew who Emmett Till was, and, of those, only three thought it was a big deal that Lil Wayne associated his horrific death with sexual encounters. Ironic, because Mamie Till Bradley, the murdered teenager’s mother, insisted on having an open-casket funeral, so that people around the country could see what the murderers had done to their son. Photos of his body were printed in African-American newspapers around the country, as well as in Ebony and Jet Magazine. But you know how it is. After a while, we just forget.Like we forgot about Jesse Washington, a 17-year-old lynched in Waco, Texas in 1916 after being found guilty of murdering a white woman ― though some have questioned the authenticity of his confession. After the verdict was announced, a white mob of more than 500 men dragged him through the streets, and cut off his testicles before tying him to a tree. They then lowered him over a bonfire, and then raised him back up, only to lower him again.They did this for two hours, while a crowd of about 15,000 cheered... though not quite loud enough to drown out Washington’s screams.Lowering and raising him over the dancing flames. Lowering and raising him until his Black body was charcoal, and the screaming finally stopped. It took two hours for the screaming to stop.And there were photographs! Some even made into postcards and sold as souvenirs. An outraged W.E.B. Du Bois led the outcry (yes, even 100 years ago we were out crying. Oh! Uh, I mean, outcrying.), and ran the photographs in the Crisis Magazine, and like the Emmett Till lynching, the story and picture was picked up by newspapers around the country. But, yeah, the 100-year anniversary of Mr. Washington’s lynching was just a few months ago, but it barely received a mention in either mainstream or social media. Even though the photograph is one of the most well-known lynching photos in American history. Here it is. You’ve seen it before, haven’t you? I thought so. So, yeah, we remember the photograph, but not the person killed who we keep vowing we’ll never forget. I don’t know... is that our memories are really that bad? Oh, maybe, it takes more than a long memory to bring about change?"

I was the youngest speaker at that march, and that day I was filled with a sense of righteous indignation that nearly 100 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, black men and women still didn't have the right to vote.At that time, many of us were being jailed as we fought for our rights. I told the hundreds of thousands of people in Washington that day, ""We do not want to go to jail. But we will go to jail if this is the price we must pay for love, brotherhood, and true peace.""Fifty-three years later, the right to vote is still the most powerful nonviolent tool of transformation we have in our society. In 2016, we must use it to elect Hillary Clinton as our next president.In this election, we've seen old, rejected ideas of division and hatred rear their ugly heads. We've seen aspirational immigrants called criminals and rapists. We've heard hardworking young African-Americans smeared as violent. We've even seen insults hurled at the Gold Star parents of a young Muslim American who gave his life in service to our country.We can now clearly understand that there are forces in this country that want to take us back. We don't want to go back. We want to move this country forward.So we must vote in this election like we have never voted before.In 1965, when the March on Washington and even the Civil Rights Act still didn't bring the right to vote to all Americans, the Reverend Hosea Williams and I set out to lead a march from Selma to Montgomery on a day that would come to be known as ""Bloody Sunday.""At that time, African-Americans were made to take a so-called ""literacy test"" before we were permitted to register to vote. Some people were asked to count the number of bubbles on a bar of soap or the number of jelly beans in a jar. Black lawyers, doctors, and college professors were publicly humiliated and told they failed the test. That was 95 years after the 15th Amendment had been ratified, and not a single member of my family had ever successfully registered to vote. Only two percent of African-Americans in Selma were registered to vote.So we decided we had to march. But when we reached the top of the Edmund Pettus Bridge and saw the wall of state troopers and a posse of men deputized that morning to oppose us with horses, nightsticks, and bullwhips, I realized I might not leave that bridge alive.In the years since that march, I've been asked many times why I didn't turn back. Why, in the face of such violence, did I keep marching forward?The only answer I know is that in my mind, that day, we didn't have a choice. We'd been tracked down by what I call the spirit of history. We became like trees planted by rivers of water. Our roots were anchored. And so we marched.When a state trooper hit me in the head with a nightstick and fractured my skull, I thought I saw Death on that bridge. I still don't know how I made it back to the church where we'd started.

We march for a brave young Army captain named Humayun Khan whose parents would not keep their silence.I bled for Dr. King's dream. He gave his life for it. We're not going to let anyone rip away our progress.We knew on that bridge in Selma that we were staring down a pivotal moment in history. I believe the same is true in 2016.So in this moment, I ask you to march with me -- and I implore you to exercise the right to vote that I and others fought so hard for. I believe that Hillary will work to take our country to another place, a better place. That's why I choose to fight with her. But I learned in Selma that you can't win these fights alone. A few hundred people on a bridge can withstand a brutal beating, but 30,000 can march to Montgomery and make a nation hear us.In the face of oppression and injustice, of division and hate, we cannot be silent.

This palpably absurd argument was being stated as the sad truth across the Sunday shows this morning.,2016-08-28,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, U.S., August 25, 2016. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb583d9250000cf00394914.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jackson, Mississippi. The media have decided that the presidential campaign is a ""race to the bottom"" in which both campaigns are engaged in ""mudslinging"" and voters are, rightly, equally disgusted with the way the two major party candidates are behaving.This assessment is both mind-boggling and almost as outrageous as what Mr. Trump says and does on a daily basis. On ""MTP Daily"" on Friday, Chuck Todd talked about the ""race to the bottom"" and how horrible what the candidates are saying about each other and the mud they're slinging at each other are. Say what? Every example Mr. Todd gave came from Trump or another Republican. What has Hillary done that's mudslinging or a race to the bottom? Her speech on Thursday simply detailed, in a calm, rational, truthful way, what Trump is doing with the alt-right racists.Look at the images above of the two candidates giving their speeches this week. Do they both look like they're slinging mud?Yet the meme of both sides dragging the presidential campaign to new lows has taken hold across the media. This palpably absurd argument was being stated as the sad truth across the Sunday shows this weekend.Calling Mrs. Clinton a ""bigot,"" with zero evidence, as Mr. Trump did here in Jackson on Wednesday is mudslinging. Making up out of whole cloth and repeating over and over the charge that the Democratic nominee has some horrible illness is mudslinging. Saying that the Clintons have been using the Clinton Foundation--a charitable organization from which they make no money--to ""line their pockets"" and that ""the Clinton Foundation is the most corrupt enterprise in political history"" is mudslinging. So are numerous other outlandish charges Mr. Trump has hurled throughout the campaign.When Hillary Clinton said in Reno on Thursday that ""From the start, Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. He is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party. His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous,"" she was stating plain facts. She wasn't slinging mud; she was merely pointing to the mud (and more unpleasant substances) with which Trump has covered himself and his campaign from the start.The only mud that has been slung at Donald Trump was thrown by Donald Trump.Mrs. Clinton said nothing that went nearly as far as columnist Leonard Pitts, Jr. did when he described Mr. Trump this week as ""a racist clown who lies like bunnies copulate."" Yet even that isn't mudslinging; it's stating facts.The bottom is entirely being plumbed by Trump and company. It is high time for all of us to call loudly upon the media to stop pretending that there is ""immoral equivalence"" between the candidates and that this campaign's stench is coming from both sides.Analysts bending over backwards to appear ""fair and balanced"" when it is one side that is wholly unfair and unbalanced is journalistic malpractice and a great disservice to American democracy.Donald Trump has already won the race to the bottom. It was an easy victory for him, because his campaign is the only contestant in that race--a fact that the media owe it to the American people to recognize and talk about."

But on-the-ground canvassers are trying to swing voters in the other direction.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c08f4e170000aa0fc75bde.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WICKLIFFE, Ohio ― Joshua Lewis is knocking at a front door when the homeowner pulls into the driveway in a red Toyota pickup truck. Out steps Craig. Craig is fresh off from work, and he’s just the voter Lewis is looking for. Lewis has a question for Craig: If he had to vote in the presidential election tomorrow, whom would he choose ― Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?“I would vote for Trump,” says Craig.It’s not the answer Lewis was hoping to hear. But it’s the reason he’s been knocking on doors in the Cleveland suburbs for months on end, asking people to explain what matters most to them in 2016.“I was a Democrat all the way up to this election,” Craig explains. “We need a change.”“Smart change is better change,” Lewis counters. “A lot of what he’s saying is not only disturbing, but incorrect.”“Look, I don’t think he’s the perfect candidate,” Craig goes on. “But I don’t think she can be trusted. We need integrity.” Lewis and Craig find some common ground in their five-minute chat in the driveway ― both believe trade deals like NAFTA have been bad for American workers ― before Craig gives Lewis his email and phone number, so Lewis can follow up with him before the election. Craig is still leaning toward Trump. “There are some people who say they’ve been Democrats all their lives, but a lack of progress has driven them the other way,” Lewis says after his discussion with Craig. “We have to meet them on their level.”Lewis is a canvasser for Working America, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO union federation. The AFL-CIO created the group in 2003 to make inroads with non-union workers at a time when unions are shrinking. Working America has campaigned to pass Obamacare, raise the minimum wage and stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Right now, it’s all-in against Trump. The group says it has 150 paid, full-time canvassers hitting the pavement hard in a handful of swing states, and as election day nears, that staff will ramp up to 500. Working America’s sweet spot is the same as Trump’s ― working-class, mostly white, former industrial strongholds. Though the vast majority of its support used to come from the AFL-CIO, Working America now pulls much of its funding from foundations and liberal donors, as well as members’ voluntary dues.On a recent evening, Lewis was canvassing in Wickliffe, Ohio, the blue-collar Lake County town where he grew up outside Cleveland. Wickliffe, which went for Obama in 2012, is 93 percent white (Lewis is African-American), and has a median household income of $48,000, according to census data. It’s just the sort of Rust Belt area that pundits point to when they say Trump could potentially redraw the electoral map with his nationalist, anti-trade message, if he can get his campaign in order.“There are folks who like Trump because his promises are appealing to them,” says Lewis. “A lot of them are concerned with the lack of good-paying jobs, and they think someone from the outside can come in and make those changes. But Trump doesn’t have a plan.”The canvassing by Working America illustrates one of Clinton’s many advantages in the election. The former secretary of state has vastly outraised Trump throughout the campaign, and she is hammering her opponent with TV ads in battleground states like Ohio. But beyond her own campaign, groups like Working America are already running an ancillary ground game on Clinton’s behalf. A pillar of the Democratic base, the AFL-CIO and major national unions have uniformly endorsed Clinton ― despite Trump’s proclamations that he is the candidate for union members ― and will run get-out-the-vote operations as the election nears. Working America is particularly invested in the battleground state of Ohio, which Trump will likely need to win if he’s to prevail in November. As of the latest polling, Clinton probably holds a very slight lead in Ohio. Working America has 80 canvassers based in the state. Though it’s now ramping up, the Trump campaign had just 82 staffers nationwide in the month of July. (Clinton, by contrast, had 705.) Come October, Working America’s hopes to have 200 bodies in Ohio.The Ohio staff includes Lewis, whose knuckles are smudged with white paint from knocking on 70 doors a day. (His goal is 40 conversations per shift.) He quit his job as an account manager to join Working America last year. Raised by grandparents who were union members, he wanted to campaign for labor-friendly policies and candidates. Now he finds himself interrupting people’s dinners to hear how they feel about Trump. “The Cleveland area’s been hurt by the loss of manufacturing jobs,” he says. “A lot of people are hurting, and they’re looking for answers.”Voters like Craig are exactly who Lewis and his colleagues want to reach. Craig is not wearing a “Hillary for Prison” T-shirt. He does not appear to be a white nationalist. Hell, he typically votes Democratic. Craig is just another guy who thinks the cost of living is too high and wages are too low. And like a lot of voters, he says he has trust issues with the Democratic nominee. “We’re up against years and years of what people have been hearing on television,” Lewis says. As one would expect from the favorability polling, Lewis’ Wicliffe canvass turns up plenty of distaste for the Democratic nominee, some of it startling: “I don’t care for her.” “I don’t believe in her.” “I think she’s a liar.” “She’s a murderer.” Sometimes his goal is simply to warm someone to the idea of Clinton being president. “It’s tough to start out in a hole where you’re explaining that she wasn’t indicted,” he says.On his nightly canvass, Lewis is aiming for what he calls pivots. There are two kinds. The half-pivot is when you steer an undecided voter toward Clinton’s side of the line. The full pivot is when you take a Trump supporter and flip him or her to Clinton. Not surprisingly, full pivots are much more elusive. The day before he met Craig, Lewis says he pulled off a rare feat ― half-pivoting a libertarian.His proudest pivot came in Brunswick, Ohio, south of Cleveland. He was speaking to a single mother who said she had voted for Obama but now supported Trump. Her biggest concern was education. Lewis told her Trump has floated the idea of eliminating the Department of Education (true). By the time he stepped off the front stoop, the woman said she planned on voting for Clinton.Before he can sway someone, Lewis needs them to explain what’s important to them going into the election. “We’re holding up a mirror and letting them talk,” he says. “I just try to plant a seed. Give them a chance to verbalize their thoughts on the election and the working class. I want to have a polite talk with the facts, try to have people open up and have a conversation.”Working America was one of the first groups to document Trump’s potential appeal in the Rust Belt in a general election. Back in the winter ― when most pundits and odds-makers were still writing Trump off in the GOP primary ― canvassers like Lewis were talking with people in Pittsburgh and Cleveland on their front porches, hearing their thoughts and concerns. They called it the “front porch focus group.”They concluded that, out of the entire cluttered field of Republicans and Democrats, Trump was the single most popular candidate with the hundreds of people they spoke to. The group issued a splashy report essentially sounding the alarm: “Key white working-class voters have not made up their minds yet in the 2016 presidential race, but of those who have, Donald Trump is the strongest choice.” Once Working America endorsed Clinton, the group began actively campaigning against Trump.Near the end of his night canvassing in Wickliffe, Lewis knocks on the door of a 34-year-old mother who’s never voted before. She recently registered to vote, after growing concerned about a plan to consolidate local schools. Lewis asks her a simple question that she clearly doesn’t get asked often: What’s important to her and her family right now?“Better wages would be nice,” she says after a long pause. “Anything more than I’m making right now.”This will be the first time she ever casts a ballot for president. She was jazzed about it, until the candidates were decided. “Honestly, I don’t care for either one,” she says.Lewis leaves after a five-minute chat on her steps, the undecided voter still undecided. But all in all, Lewis considers the talk a success. “We’re letting people flesh out their own stories,” he says. “And it pumps me up when I’m at a door and someone’s willing to listen.”"

Sort of.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c0ae181700000011c75c7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal appeals court on Friday seemed to reach a limited compromise in the controversy over Wisconsin’s voter identification law, which has been in the crosshairs of multiple lawsuits and appeals for years.With one judge recused, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit consolidated the disputes and issued an order that kept the law on the books, but appeared to give voting rights advocates a small consolation prize ahead of the November election.The court explicitly rejected a softening device ― like one ordered by a federal judge this month in Texas ― that would allow voters lacking the required voter ID card to simply sign an affidavit attesting to their identity before they cast a ballot.Instead, the court accepted assurances from the state of Wisconsin that its Division of Motor Vehicles would “mail automatically a free photo ID to anyone who comes to DMV one time and initiates the free ID process.”“No one must present documents, that, for some, have proved challenging to acquire; no one must show a birth certificate, proof of citizenship, and the like,” the court noted, quoting the state from a prior legal filing.The 7th Circuit stressed that mere “initiation” of this process ― showing up at the DMV, regardless of what documentation the prospective voter has ― was enough for a voter to receive a voting credential at no cost.But this also presupposes that affected voters, especially those of lesser means or without transportation, actually can make it to a DMV location. Or that the state will actually keep voters informed that this mechanism even exists.Pointing to other rulings striking down similar voter ID laws in other states, the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought one of the lawsuits against Wisconsin, didn’t seem to trust the state to deliver.“Two trial courts have found that, over the last five years, Wisconsin has utterly failed to get IDs into the hands of voters who need them,” Sean Young, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s voting rights project, said in a statement. “There’s no reason to believe that the state’s latest eleventh-hour ‘emergency’ procedures will work any better than its past failed policies.”Young added that the ACLU would keep fighting the law in court, but didn’t say whether he would seek Supreme Court review.Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who specializes in election law, wrote in a blog post that, given time constraints ahead of the November election, it’s unlikely that the Supreme Court would intervene.“I think this is the end of the line for this election,” Hasen wrote."
7,POLITICS,Trump Goes Back To Original Immigration Position With Second 180 Flip,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-immigration-flip-iowa_us_57c21d25e4b085c1ff29b41f,"He now promises immediate action on deportation, with no mention of a path to legal status.",2016-08-27,"Trump said that if elected, he would ""begin swiftly removing"" the ""hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants"" who are in the country.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c21d8e170000a014c75ecf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DES MOINES, Iowa – Donald Trump’s experiment with “softening” his immigration policy came to a dramatic end Saturday in a fairgrounds livestock pavilion, with the Republican presidential nominee promising deportations within an hour of his inauguration.“We are going to rid of the criminals, and it’s going to happen within one hour after I take office,” he said. “We will move justly, but we will move fast. Believe me.”Trump has made the forcible deportation of the 11 million people in the country without documentation a cornerstone of his presidential campaign from its start last year. It made him a favorite among a segment of the Republican base, and helped him win the nomination over a dozen Republican senators and governors.Then, last week, Trump explained in an appearance on Fox News that “thousands and thousands” of people he had met with on the issue had urged him not to deport undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for years and have no criminal record, but rather stable jobs and families. That new tack brought an immediate backlash from some of his hardcore supporters – including author Ann Coulter – for breaking his promise, as well as “I told you so” claims from mainstream GOP critics who had long predicted his eventual flip.Trump backtracked on his new position later in the week – including in a CNN interview, where he claimed the modification was not a “softening” but actually “a hardening.” The Saturday remarks appear to complete the process, with Trump suggesting that undocumented immigrants commit a significant percentage of the country’s crimes and making zero mention of finding some way for those who have not committed any crimes to stay.He also asserted – without any supporting evidence – that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would, if she were to win, end “all routine immigration enforcement.”“In other words, totally open borders. Which will lead to a massive crime wave,” Trump said.“I think he was trying to make up for his missteps,” said Brian Zegers, a 48-year-old personnel consultant who attended the biker-themed event in a leather vest and bandana. Smiling, Zegers attributed Trump’s original reversal to the advice of consultants and said the reversal of the reversal was just what the boisterous crowd of Trump supporters wanted to hear.Other, more committed Trump fans said his shifts in position were of no concern to them. “The message will get tightened up before the election,” said Jim De Kruif, 57 an investment adviser who has always assumed that Trump will modify his policies heading into the general election. “That’s what politicians do.”Trump also continued his recent practice of pledging to work for African-Americans and Latinos in front of virtually all-white audiences. He spent about five minutes of his 50-minute speech promising lower taxes for family farms and offering a commitment to the corn-based ethanol mandate in gasoline for his Iowa audience, and then spent twice as long telling members of the two ethnic minorities that the Democratic Party had not helped them and that they should support Trump. “What do you have to lose?” he asked, repeating a new favorite line.Saturday’s event was organized by Iowa’s freshman Sen. Joni Ernst, the second of what she is hopes will become an annual ritual: a motorcycle rally raising money for a veterans’ charity, followed by a GOP pep rally.Trump, though, did not participate in the motorcycle ride from the local Harley Davidson dealership to the Iowa State Fairgrounds. Instead, as is his preference, he flew in specifically for the event aboard his personal airliner, delivering the final speech of the afternoon to the crowd of about 2,000.Ernst and other Iowa elected officials preceded Trump on stage. While urging voters to support Trump, the leaders spent little time praising their presidential nominee, and mainly pointed out the importance of keeping Supreme Court nominations out of Clinton’s hands.Even that approach, though, could not entirely insulate the hometown Republicans from the danger of such a volatile candidate at the top of their ticket. At a news conference to explain the benefits of the ride for a veteran’s charity, Ernst was confronted with a question about one of the latest controversies for Trump’s campaign: reports of CEO Steve Bannon’s domestic violence charge from his first marriage.Ernst pointed out that it was not her job to vet Trump’s staff. “I am not making the hiring decisions,” she said, but then quickly added: “Sexual assault and domestic violence is never OK – is never OK.”"

The sources also said the jets hit six Islamic State targets.Turkish military sources said one of its soldiers was killed and three others wounded when a tank was hit by a rocket that they said was fired from territory held by the Kurdish YPG. The sources said the army shelled the area in response.Syrian rebels opposed to Ankara’s incursion said Turkish forces had targeted forces allied to the YPG and no Kurdish forces were in the area.On the ground, Turkish-backed Syrian rebels fought forces aligned with the SDF near the frontier town of Jarablus. Forces opposed to Ankara said Turkish tanks were deployed, a charge denied by Turkey’s rebel allies.Turkey’s offensive into Syria began on Wednesday, supporting its rebel allies with Turkish special forces, tanks and warplanes. It seized control of Jarablus from Islamic State seeking to stop any Kurdish forces moving in first.Saturday’s use of warplanes against what Turkey said was a Kurdish YPG militia target highlights its determination to prevent any Kurdish territorial expansion in north Syria.Any action against Kurdish forces in Syria puts Turkey at odds with its NATO ally the United States, which backs the SDF and YPG, seeing them as the most reliable and effective ally in the fight against Islamic State in Syria.It adds complexity to the Syrian conflict that erupted five years ago with an uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and has since drawn in regional states and world powers.“DANGEROUS ESCALATION”The Jarablus Military Council, part of the SDF, had said earlier on Saturday that Turkish planes hit the village of al-Amarna south of Jarablus, causing civilian casualties. It called the action “a dangerous escalation”.The Kurdish-led administration that controls parts of northern Syria said Turkish tanks advanced on al-Amarna and clashed with forces of the Jarablus Military Council. But the Kurdish administration said no Kurdish forces were involved.However, the leader of one Turkey-backed rebel group gave a rival account. He told Reuters the rebels battled the Kurdish YPG around al-Amarna and denied any Turkish tanks took part.Turkish security forces simply said Turkish-backed forces had extended their control to five villages beyond Jarablus.A video released by Turkey’s military showed the Turkish Red Crescent distributing food and aid to people in Jarablus, with the help of Turkish troops. It also showed what appeared to be Turkish-backed rebels flicking v-for-victory signs in the town.The newly formed Jarablus Military Council has said it was made up of people from the area with the aim of capturing the town and the surrounding region from Islamic State militants. However, the Turkish-backed rebels seized Jarablus first.Several militias under the SDF banner pledged support to Jarablus Military Council after it reported the Turkish bombing.The Northern Sun Battalion, an SDF faction, said in a statement it was heading to “Jarablus fronts” to help the council against “threats made by factions belonging to Turkey”.Tension has mounted in Syria’s Aleppo region in the past year between the U.S-backed Kurdish YPG force and its allies on one hand and Turkish-backed rebel groups on the other. The two sides have clashed on several occasions.(Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay and Orhan Coskun in Ankara and Tom Perry in Beirut; Writing by Edmund Blair; Editing by Ros Russell)"

The United States has insisted that the Syrian air force, which has dropped barrel bombs and chlorine on residential areas, be grounded but Lavrov said on Friday that was not the goal.Assad’s future is not part of the current talks. Instead, discussions are focused on finding an effective and lasting solution to end the violence, which would open negotiations on a political transition in Syria.“If the remaining details can be completed, we believe we will be able to address the two primary challenges to the cessation of hostilities - the regime violations and the increasing influence of the al-Nusra Front,” Kerry said.Kerry believes the plan is the best chance to limit fighting that is driving thousands of Syrians into exile in Europe and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching tens of thousands more.The talks came as opposition groups effectively surrendered the Damascus suburb of Daraya to the government after a grueling four-year siege.Kerry said the Syrian regime had “forced the surrender” of Daraya in contravention of the February cessation of hostilities agreement, but Lavrov said the local accord was an “example” that should be “replicated”.The Russian foreign minister said another besieged area was “interested in such an operation with mediation of the Russian Federation.” He did not name the area.Residents and insurgents in Daraya began to leave the besieged area where civilians have been trapped since 2012 and the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross expressed concern for their safety.(Additional reporting by Lisa Barrington in Beirut and Firas Makdesi and Kinda Makieh in Damascus; Editing by Richard Balmforth and Tom Brown)"

Eisenhower 60 years ago, was heralded as a groundbreaking public works project that connected the country like never before. But those 47,000 miles of federally funded pavement also decimated urban centers.Photographer Michael DeFilippo has spent the last five months documenting freeways in his city of St. Louis. He completed the series this week, tied to the 60th anniversary, and ahead of his own 60th birthday Friday.He says about half of the city’s neighborhoods are bordered or intersected by an interstate. “I wanted to show the unintended consequences and impact of the highway on a very beautiful and vibrant city,” he told The Huffington Post in an email.DeFilippo, who mostly gets around by bike, got closer to the high-speed streets than most people do when they’re not driving. “I spent some time on the shoulders of busy roads, under highway overpasses, walking up and down access ramps at interchanges,” he said.The experience reminded him of a 2011 assignment photographing a tornado in Joplin, Missouri.“While standing on the edge of I-55 or I-44, looking down a barren ribbon of concrete with residential neighborhoods on both sides reminded me of Joplin after the tornado, except the cars on the Interstate were not stacked on top of each other,” he told HuffPost.DeFilippo’s photos aren’t filled with decay, nor do they seem particularly grim at first glance. Many feature historic buildings and city landmarks under bright blue skies. But the freeways are still always present, and there are moments of dark humor: In one photo, a trick of perspective makes it look like cars on a flatbed trailer are driving in midair through houses. In another, a truck whisks a mobile home down the freeway juxtaposed with an abandoned building in the background. As in many cities, residents left St. Louis in droves in the second half of last century, cutting the population in half since 1970.With no people besides the ones hidden in their cars, DeFilippo’s images are a reminder of how freeways helped empty out cities, displacing residents and allowing for suburban sprawl. (In past projects, he’s shown a more dynamic side of St. Louis.)Urban planners used to consider freeway construction as a tool to cure city ills and clear “slums” ― overwhelmingly black neighborhoods ― Alana Semuels writes in The Atlantic. Communities were razed to make way for new roadways in cities across the country, from Detroit to Syracuse. Highways, along with housing restrictions that kept black residents out of the suburbs, fueled segregation and poverty, according to Semuels.U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx announced an initiative earlier this year to push transit infrastructure that is more inclusive and not solely focused on cars. The shift is shaped by Foxx’s experience growing up. His grandparents’ house in Charlotte, North Carolina, was just a few blocks from two interstates walled off by fences, according to news site Governing. “My neighborhood had one way in and one way out, and that was a choice,” Foxx said in January.More and more, urban planners and local officials are promoting walking, biking and mass transit. Making cities safe and accessible for pedestrians benefits the environment, local economies and residents’ health. Some cities have put that vision to work by actually tearing up freeways. One of the earliest projects is in Portland, which closed Harbor Drive in the 1970s and replaced it with a waterfront park.  Others have “capped” them with pedestrian-friendly overpasses. One of these projects is in St. Louis, a park over I-44 that links the Gateway Arch with the rest of downtown. DeFilippo’s series ends with a photo of that connector. It’s “a start toward undoing some of the damage done to Saint Louis by this highway system,” he said.See more of DeFilippo’s photos below and in the full series on his site._____Kate Abbey-Lambertz covers sustainable cities, housing and inequality.

13,PARENTS,"In A World Of Bullies, Be A Real Man","J.W. Holland, ContributorPolitical Writer and Editor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-a-world-of-bullies-be-a-real-man_us_57c1fa54e4b06384eb3ffe0d,It’s been an interesting couple of weeks for me. Indeed it has been a time that I continue to be disappointed in my fellow,2016-08-27,"<strong>Are physically weaker males real men? According to David French's article, the answer is no.</strong>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c1fe311700000411c75ea5.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s been an interesting couple of weeks for me. Indeed it has been a time that I continue to be disappointed in my fellow men. Not the generic word man as in “mankind” but the very specific “male,” variety of our species. I keep asking myself the same question, “when will we grow up?”My oldest son has been dealing with a group of bullies at school for the better part of a year. They tease him with cursing and insults. Calling him a “fag” and telling him he isn’t good enough to go out for sports. They gang up on him in a group, like a pack of jackals circling a gazelle. This past week we made the decision to move him to another school that, from our research, seems to have a better handle on such issues.Oh, I have heard all the jargon about this type of situation. “Toughen ’em up!” or “Let him kick their asses!” All that sounds great until you realize that, number one that isn’t how the real world works. Number two he was outnumbered and could have ended up in an even worse situation. My son is a good looking intelligent kid. He is an accomplished swimmer and an extreme extrovert. Yet, he was targeted.◊♦◊Bullying isn’t about just going after weaker victims; it’s also going after those you view as a threat. It’s a defense mechanism of the insecure and unproperly trained. Unfortunately, it begins at home and is fueled by parents who are either themselves bullies, or unable to see any fault in their own offspring.I never really had a problem being bullied in school. Sure there was the occasional jerk you had to deal with but not to the extent I saw it happen to others, or to the degree that it happens today. I am well aware of those around me who had a much worse experience.We live to attack those who are different from us, be it based on skin color, sexuality, religion, atheism, weight, political views, or even socio-economic status. This country seems to thrive on it. Go to a political rally, especially this year, and listen. Not just to the speakers but also to what is being said in the crowds. We have no respect for each other, and we have no restraint in voicing those opinions.We’ve not grown at all as a country in this area. No matter what we say this problem is increasing. Social media is the new hunting ground for these predators. Every picture posted, every status update, every tweet and opinion in public view open you up to attack from the faceless trolls who never grew out of middle school.I have had an acquaintance who’s son committed suicide at 11 because of bullying. And seeing stories like this are becoming all too common. When a kid is left feeling that his only option is to “give up” and take their own life, it is an indictment on the entire civilization.Bullying isn’t just an issue that is relegated to the male of the species either. Girls are victims and participants as well. We however rarely tell our daughters they should “suck it up and deal with it!”◊♦◊ Then today as I am scrolling Facebook I see this article from David French, and I realized, we may never grow up.French goes on a long diatribe about how we are a culture that is no longer raising men basically because we don’t enroll them all in gym memberships. That because we don’t make them change oil or build porches, they aren’t able to develop masculinity. He states that we should “never ever underestimate the positive effect that raw physical strength can have on a young man’s development.”While all that sounds great, and it hits on the key points of a Trump testosterone driven movement. It’s bullshit!To simply focus in on this generation and claim that we are in some extreme moment of de-masculinity is to ignore human history. It’s also an argument that has been used in previous generations. It’s an argument that again, says women aren’t equal and can’t compete. It’s an argument against education, technology advancement, and innovation!Mainly it’s an argument used by bullies!Do we tell someone that doesn’t do manual labor for a living, say a writer for the National Review, that he is less of a man because of his chosen profession? We shouldn’t, but apparently that is what we are supposed to do. Do we tell a physically challenged male that he isn’t really a man? I mean after all his grip strength may not be on par with a coal miner from 1935!I would ask Mr. French to compare his requirements as a youth to that of his father’s. Then compare his father’s to his grandfather’s. They aren’t equal for a couple of reasons. Technology, and intelligence. Human’s are intelligent, we are constantly looking for better, and yes easier, ways of doing things. When is the last time you saw a farmer plowing a field behind a mule? When is the last time you heard of a logging company that only used axes and hand saws? They don’t because that would be inefficient and stupid! But according to French’s argument, using a chainsaw, or riding in an air conditioned tractor means you’ve been brainwashed by militant feminists, hellbent on putting you in a dress!◊♦◊French makes an argument against the instant oil change. While I do like to change my oil and my sons do help me occasionally, the argument has a problem. Who do you think is doing the oil changes at the local quick lube? It certainly, at least so far, isn’t done by robots. For the most part, it’s younger men, and yes some women, who are working entry level automotive jobs to learn a skill.The article also ignores another fact of generational difference. Humans get smarter with the passage of time. I suppose we should harken back to a day when we died of chickenpox, but we could bare knuckle fight a bear.What do bullies say? You’re not as strong, you’re fat, you’re slow, you can’t do what I can do! Those types of beliefs lead to things like 13-year-olds taking their his life because he didn’t think he could ever fit in. A belief he would never measure up to some trivial standard that “men” should reach.It’s not only an incorrect argument Mr. French; it’s dangerous.So while David French may not agree, I am raising men. Three of them. Men who will respect their fellow “man”. Who will judge people on the content of their character and not by how much they can bench. Men who will be secure in their masculinity enough to know that women in the workforce aren’t a threat if you’re willing to work and compete on an equal playing field. Men who can lay their heads down at night knowing that all they’ve received in life was earned, not because of their sex, but because of their drive.Then I will be able to sleep at night knowing, in some part, I contributed to the betterment of society. Not just from my own actions, but through the legacy of real men that will follow me.That, Mr. French, is what real strength is.―- This article originally appeared on The Good Men Project Photo:Flickr/Stuart Grout"
14,HEALTHY LIVING,In A Creative Rut? Try Taking A Nap.,"Brenda Barbosa, Contributor Writer, Media Consultant & Communication Strategist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-a-creative-rut-try-taking-a-nap_us_57bf7b4ee4b06384eb3ee085,"It’s 2 p.m. and I just woke up from a nap. No, it’s not the weekend. And no, I’m not on vacation. It’s just a normal workday",2016-08-27,"There’s a growing body of research that shows power naps are not just good for the body, they also boost creativity.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bfa6171700001a00c759a1.jpg?ops=crop_0_0_3305_1909%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s 2 p.m. and I just woke up from a nap.No, it’s not the weekend. And no, I’m not on vacation. It’s just a normal workday.A year ago, I would have been embarrassed to admit this. After all, I live and work in the United States where sleeping in the middle of the day is practically stigmatized. In my 20s, my friends and I proudly proclaimed (as we downed cases of energy drinks) “Who needs sleep? There’s plenty of time to sleep when we’re dead!”Today, I’m more embarrassed by that admission than I am of saying I regularly schedule power naps into my days because, the truth is, it was that kind of twisted thinking in my younger years that left me feeling perpetually irritable and exhausted — not exactly qualities that inspire creative thinking.As a writer and creative, I was sabotaging the very things that fuel my best creative work: a rested mind, a relaxed body and a refreshed spirit.I realized there was nothing noble about being sleep deprived, or denying I needed more shut eye. So I started getting to bed earlier.At first, the motivation to get more sleep was purely vain. I got tired of looking in the mirror and seeing a sallow complexion and dark circles around my eyes. After watching Arianna Huffington’s TedWomen talk, How to Succeed? Get More Sleep, I realized not only did I need more beauty sleep, I also needed more Creativity ZZZs if I wanted to get better at my writing craft.Creativity ZZZs, as I call it, are 10- to 20-minute power naps that I work into my schedule a few times a week, usually between noon and 3 p.m.In South America, where my family’s from, it’s not unusual for people to take a “siesta” in the afternoon. But in the U.S., naps have become the domain of the “lazy”, the “unproductive” folks who either don’t work or don’t want to work.But there’s a growing body of research that makes the case for getting more sleep. Sleep, it turns out, is not just good for your body. It also boosts your creativity.Here’s what I discovered when I started taking more cat naps:Ideas FlowedIt no longer felt like I was trying to pull thoughts out of cotton. At a certain point in the afternoon, usually around three o’clock, I hit a mental wall. In the past, I tried to climb over that wall with gallons of caffeine and sugar. But that did nothing to unlock ideas or creative musing that seemed trapped in dark, unreachable corners of my brain. The crash that inevitably ensued after my caffeine high only made me feel worse. But after a power nap, my mind is able to brainstorm and draw connections between seemingly disparate ideas because it’s clear and refreshed.Got More FocusedCreative work requires uninterrupted stretches of time where you are immersed in whatever activity you undertake. It’s what psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls Flow. Power naps help me get more focused, and more “in the flow.” I stop reading the same sentence in an email, a book, a blog post, an article, even my own writing, over and over again trying to understand what I was reading. After a nap, I feel reinvigorated and ready to focus on something intensely for a longer period of time.Became More EnergizedAs a kid, I spent my summers in Colombia, where my parents were born. On most days everyone took “siesta”, an afternoon nap usually taken after lunch. That makes sense, of course, since most people tend to feel sluggish between noon and 4 p.m., the time of day that coincides with the lowest point in our circadian cycles. My low point usually begins around 2 p.m. when my eyelids start to feel heavy and my brain starts to slow. A short nap can feel like a shot of espresso without the caffeine jitters.Became HappierThere’s no doubt sleep deprivation can leave you feeling cranky, irritable and moody. In fact, studies have shown that even partial sleep deprivation has a significant effect on mood.“People who have problems with sleep are at an increased risk for developing emotional disorders (such as) depression and anxiety,” says Harvard University professor Dr. Lawrence Epstein.Feeling tired and run down is not just bad for your mood, it’s bad for creative endeavors because stress and anxiety feed creative blocks. But when you’re feeling good and rested, ideas flow which leads to more good feelings.So if you if you want to be at your creative best, do yourself a favor:Go take a nap."
15,POLITICS,Paul Wolfowitz Is So Concerned With Trump He May Vote For Clinton,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-wolfowitz-donald-trump_us_57c1b121e4b04193420f69b9,The so-called architect of the Iraq War says Trump would undermine U.S. credibility in the world.,2016-08-27,"Paul Wolfowitz, frequently called the architect of the Iraq War, says he may vote for Hillary Clinton.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c1b354170000a014c75e24.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Paul Wolfowitz, who served as deputy secretary of defense under President George W. Bush and is often referred to as the architect of the Iraq War, says he may vote for Hillary Clinton.Wolfowitz told the German newspaper Der Spiegel he might vote for the Democratic nominee because of the threat Donald Trump poses to U.S. security.“The only way you can be comfortable about Trump’s foreign policy, is to think he doesn’t really mean anything he says. That’s a pretty uncomfortable place to be in,” he said. “Our security depends on having good relationships with our allies. Trump mainly shows contempt for them. And he seems to be unconcerned about the Russian aggression in Ukraine. By doing this he tells them that they can go ahead and do what they are doing. That is dangerous.”“I wish there were somebody I could be comfortable voting for. I might have to vote for Hillary Clinton, even though I have big reservations about her,” he added.Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have spoken warmly of each other in public. Last month, Trump urged Russia to hack Clinton’s email, and has suggested he would not automatically defend members of NATO ― something that could invite aggression from Russia.Paul Manafort, the former chair of Trump’s campaign, also resigned last week after the Associated Press reported on his work on behalf of pro-Russian forces in Ukraine.Wolfowitz is part of a number of Republicans who have refused to back Trump. It’s a list that includes former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft.In an interview with The Los Angeles Times last month, Wolfowitz said America’s credibility in the world would be undermined if Trump was elected.“It’s the fact that our friends aren’t going to trust us and our enemies aren’t going to fear us,” he said.Wolfowitz, who served as a foreign policy adviser on the presidential campaign of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, said in 2003 that the United States would be greeted as liberators in Iraq.Trump has attacked Clinton for voting to support the Iraq war in 2002 and claimed he was against it. Trump’s claim is false ― he did support the invasion.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
16,SPORTS,Why Colin Kaepernick Refused To Stand For The National Anthem Before A 49ers Preseason Game,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-black-lives-matter_us_57c1a1bde4b085c1ff299efd,"""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" the quarterback said.",2016-08-27,San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick (7) throws the ball against the New York Giants in the second quarter at MetLife Stadium.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c1a63e1600002900bfed9b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the playing of the national anthem before the team’s Friday night preseason game against the Green Bay Packers, and on Saturday, he explained why.“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick told NFL.com’s Steve Wyche. “To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”The protest makes Kaepernick the latest athlete to use his platform to call attention to problems facing African-Americans across the country, particularly the issue of police killings. Four NBA stars ― Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Chris Paul ― called attention to the issue in an on-stage speech at the ESPY Awards in July. Anthony has also marched in protests in Baltimore; and Wade and James, along with their then-Miami Heat teammates, donned hoodies to protest the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2013.Players from three WNBA teams wore shirts that bore the “Black Lives Matter” slogan during pre-game warmups in July. And during previous seasons, an assortment of NFL and NBA players have warmed up in T-shirts honoring African-Americans killed by police, and spoken out against police brutality after their games.Kaepernick did not tell the 49ers of his plans not to stand for the anthem. He also sat through the song during a previous preseason game.“This is not something that I am going to run by anybody,” Kaepernick told NFL.com. “I am not looking for approval. I have to stand up for people that are oppressed. ... If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right.”Kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the anthem is similar to a protest from former Denver Nuggets player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, whose choice to sit down through the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” before NBA games in 1996 blew up into a nationwide controversy. Abdul-Rauf, a converted Muslim, eventually served a one-game suspension before striking a compromise with the NBA that required him to stand but allowed him to bow his head in prayer during the anthem. The flag, Abdul-Rauf said then, was “a symbol of tyranny, of oppression.”The Nuggets traded Abdul-Rauf after the 1996 season, and his career never rebounded from the controversy. The 49ers said that they respected Kaepernick’s decision to exercise his rights of expression.“The National Anthem is and always will be a special part of the pre-game ceremony,” the team said in a statement, according to NFL.com. “It is an opportunity to honor our country and reflect on the great liberties we are afforded as its citizens. In respecting such American principles as freedom of religion and freedom of expression, we recognize the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem.”"
17,SCIENCE,6 Scientists Just Spent A Year On Simulated Mars. Here's What They Learned.,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/year-on-mars-hawaii-hiseas_us_57bf7086e4b04193420e7b6e,"The crew ""returns to Earth"" Sunday after 365 days in isolation.",2016-08-27,"The crew of HI-SEAS IV, from left to right: Cyprien Verseux, crew biologist; Christiane Heinicke, chief scientific officer and crew physicist; Carmel Johnston, crew commander; Tristan Bassingthwaighte, crew architect; Sheyna Gifford, chief medical and safety officer, crew journalist; Andrzej Stewart, chief engineering officer.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c1c9d91700000011c75e47.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"HONOLULU, Hawaii ― Sending humans to Mars presents enormous challenges, from the technological to the psychological.Perhaps no one understands the mental test better than the team of international scientists who just spent a year living inside an isolated, Mars-like habitat atop Hawaii’s Mauna Loa volcano.Sheyna Gifford, chief medical and safety officer of the fourth Hawaii Space Exploration and Analog and Simulation, or HI-SEAS, told The Huffington Post that the biggest challenges came from a “sense of helplessness.”When things went wrong on Earth, whether it was a terrorist attack, flooding in Louisiana or a family member’s death, “trying to find a way to help from here is very difficult,” Gifford said.On Sunday, the six-man crew will emerge from their dome free of spacesuits for the first time in 365 days, bringing to a close the longest space travel simulation ever conducted on U.S. soil.In the days leading up to what Gifford called their “return to Earth,” HuffPost spoke with the crew, who have given the last year of their lives to preparing humans for life on Mars. Communicating via email and voice recordings, which were delayed 20 minutes to simulate communication in deep space, the HI-SEAS crew shared everything from personal hardships and plans for the future to the realization that humans are capable of anything.Since entering the habitat on Aug. 28 of last year, HI-SEAS members have only been allowed to venture outside while dressed in full spacesuits.In the hustle and bustle of everyday life on Earth, a year can seem to fly by. But isolate yourself to a 1,000-square-foot dome on rocky terrain 8,200 feet above sea level ― or perhaps in the future, in a small habitat on Mars ― and one might expect time to drag on. Luckily, the NASA-funded mission kept the HI-SEAS crew busy with a rigorous daily schedule of scientific research, geological field work, equipment testing, cooking, exercise and much more.Crew Commander Carmel Johnston said so much happens on simulated Mars that at times “you are just trying to keep your head above water.”The idea that the team has been up there an entire year, Gifford added, is “almost absurd.”“It doesn’t feel like a year, I think that’s the strangest part. It feels like we’ve been here a few months,” she said, adding a person’s sense of time progresses completely differently.That’s not to say the last 12 months have been a breeze. Beyond obvious things, like missing fresh food and the wind on your face, time away from Earth presents enormous emotional challenges. And that’s one of the main goals of the simulated journey: to better understand the risks associated with space travel, including conflict, stress and depression.For example, Gifford’s grandmother died about a month ago. Although her death was expected, Gifford said not being there for her family was extremely difficult. “I said goodbye to my grandmother over a delayed video message,” she told HuffPost. “That’s not something any of us ever want to do. So simply not being on Earth, I think everyone would agree, is the most challenging part of space.”Johnston said she struggled with the “out of sight, out of mind” treatment she received from people who she expected would stay in touch. “We changed everything about our lives and limited ourselves to only communicating by email,” she said. “If anyone didn’t want to hop on that wagon, we just didn’t hear from them this year. It can be pretty disheartening to feel like you are missing out on everything happening at home.”Tristan Bassingthwaighte, the crew architect, told HuffPost he often felt “bored to death.” Other times he just wanted to be alone, to find a place to get away.“A person can be totally cool one minute and severely annoying the next,” he said in an email. “The little things people do that you’d never notice in real life can make you think about tripping them on the stairs here.”Ultimately, it’s how they dealt with such situations and interacted with one another that’s of interest to NASA, which hopes to send astronauts to Mars at some point in the 2030s. Using cameras, body movement trackers and electronic surveys, researchers gathered data on a wide range of cognitive, social and emotional factors that could affect team performance during an extended mission to Mars.Surprisingly, the crew said that at no point did they ever feel like giving up, leaving their false, faraway world to return to Earthling life. When they did get bored or had down time, they found ways to keep busy. An avid reader, Bassingthwaighte said books were his “little doors to worlds that aren’t this one.” He’s also been working on Doctor of Architecture degree and learned to cook with the limited resources he has available. He lost 20 pounds while in the habitat. Gifford, who also served as crew journalist, published numerous online articles, including several blogs for HuffPost.The big question moving forward is what researchers can learn from the mission. The crew itself has no doubts that their sacrifices will help humans reach Mars.“With all the good and the bad comes lessons that you can’t learn unless you are in isolation,” Johnston wrote. “Every success or failure is still data and an outcome that can be used to improve the lives of astronauts and Martians.”“We still need to make the ships and bases (Looking at you SpaceX, I’m available) and understanding this will help us make them right,” Bassingthwaighte wrote. “After that, a little time and effort and we’ll have people on Mars in no time.”Counting down to their so-called “re-entry,” the crew had their sights set on everyday things we Earthlings take for granted ― hugging loved ones, feasting on a burger, swimming in the ocean and running on grass. In addition to spending time with family and getting outside, Bassingthwaighte’s said he’s looking forward to living in a place with a window. “I mean holy crap! A whole window that belongs just to me?” he wrote. “I don’t even know what to do with that, we’ve all been sharing a window the size of a medium pizza for the last year.”In her time away, Gifford said she’s come to realize that the journey to Mars will likely prove more challenging in ways we don’t expect than in ways we do. The good news, she said, is “human beings are pretty much capable of anything.” There’s one other point that Bassingthwaighte said he wants to clear up once and for all: The HI-SEAS crew is not actually on Mars, and they are not being sent to Mars.“You’d be amazed at how many people don’t get that,” he wrote.
