Rebranding is a way of life in America, and it could work for the Movement as well. I've been attending the 2016 Lavender Law conference in DC this past week, following on the heels of the Democratic National Convention, last week, and have some thoughts.For over a decade now I've been speaking and teaching on the biological and medical fundamentals of gender identity, and was extremely pleased to read the brief of the United States v. State of North Carolina filed on May 9, 2016, in response to the odious North Carolina HB2. The attorneys at the Justice Department saw fit to educate the court, not known for its scientific expertise, in the fundamentals of human biology. While many LGB attorneys were dismayed by that action, I believe it was necessary, and long overdue.I say that because the opposition to trans persons, be it the Pope's appalling statement based on his shocking ignorance that somehow children are being taught they can choose their gender saying that trans people represent the ""annihilation of mankind"" and trans children are a form of ""ideological colonization,"" or the usual hate spewed by organizations like the American Family Association and Family Research Council, is always reduced to biology. Our adversaries always come back to sex, whatever euphemism they use -- ""biological male/female,"" chromosomes, genes, etc.And it does come back to ""sex"" in the legal arena, because it's the three words from the 1964 Civil Rights Act added to Title VII, ""because of sex,"" that are a commonsensical bridge to gender identity protections and trans liberation. I'm a physician and scientist, so I'm drawn to scientific metaphors, analogies and explanations. I recognize using them is just one way to fight the battle, and maybe not the best way in some circumstances, but since our adversaries are drawn to such language, we must respond in kind. And, as I've noted over the years, it has been the growing recognition in federal court since 2000 that ""sex"" does include gender identity (and, more recently, sexual orientation), that creates the opening to move us forward legally as well as culturally.Over the past few years we've been routinely using the phrases ""assigned male (female) at birth"" to explain that trans persons are born trans, that we don't simply choose it as the Pope foolishly imagines. That phrase doesn't role off the tongue, and the acronym, AMAB/AFAB, isn't well known. When the script for the recent trans rights ad that was produced for the political conventions was being written the term was considered and rejected because it's too arcane.What I've been teaching, however, is that the problems that most trans persons face result from one simple, cursory observation -- the sex identification announced by the pediatrician in the delivery room. That observation, no more than a best guess, is rapid and accurate 98-99 percent of the time, so it's been very useful. But trans persons, because of the circumstances of their birth, bear a burden for their entire lives because in their cases it is mistaken. If we had a birth sign that distinguished our gender identity, rather than our genital anatomy, there would be no problem. Alas, we do not.So what gender transition comes down to is not a choice, and not a whim, but a foundational biological awareness of trans humans that they have the right to correct that medical error and live their authentic lives. Correct the medical error -- doctors do make mistakes, and some are very costly mistakes for which their patients pay, on occasion, with their lives. We need to acknowledge this is one class of mistake which can easily be rectified. Trans women are women, and trans men are men, as Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta said to the nation on May 9th.That reframe -- Correct the medical error -- has a legal analogue. As I mentioned earlier, the courts have prohibited discrimination (in employment) on the basis of sex since 1964, with the progress accelerating since the landmark Supreme Court decision, Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, in 1989. Since the 1980s the courts have routinely carved out exceptions for gay and trans persons, with Ulane v. Eastern Airlines in 1984 being the most notable. Like Eastern Airlines, these exceptions should be completely dead and buried.The trans community has benefited from a change in judicial culture since 2004 with the Smith case, winning most of our federal court cases since then. The LGB community is a much later addition to such success, with the first victories occurring in 2011 in the federal sector Veretto and Castello cases, and most recently the EEOC's landmark Baldwin v. Foxx last year.Missing from our understanding and, hence, active arguing, for our civil rights, has been the fact that, like the medical underpinning of gender transition, our federal court actions are based, as explained by EEO Commissioner Chai Feldblum, on an attempt to correct an error from the past. Correct the legal error -- the Congress never carved out an exception to ""because of sex"" for sexual orientation or gender identity (except for Jesse Helms' hostile amendment to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 did not have carve-outs). Federal judges did, beginning in the 80's, based on ignorance, prejudice, ideology or politics. In 1964 Congress did not know any trans persons, and if they did know gay ones they would not discuss them in polite company. Maybe if they had been able to they would have carved out an exception, but they didn't. It was only the activist conservative judges of the late 20th century who changed the plain meaning of the Civil Rights Act. Hence, all that our advocates and plaintiffs have been doing in the past few decades is correct those errors committed by the Reagan-era activist judges, who knew nothing of basic biology and were motivated by sufficient prejudice that they couldn't see just how obvious it was that both gender identity and sexual orientation were manifestations of sex.We are at one of those forehead-slapping, face-palming moments, when the courts, building off the decade of trans victories is now ready, post-Obergefell, to do the same for the LGB community. Just read Judge Rovner's decision in the recent 7th Circuit Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College case, where she twists herself into a pretzel looking for some way to rule for Ms. Hively, before ultimately conceding defeat based on precedence, or stare decisis. She was begging for help from the Supreme Court, or an en banc sitting of the entire 7th Circuit (which Greg Nevins of Lambda Legal is requesting) to follow her logic to its inevitable conclusion -- that sexual orientation is a form of sex.This is one of those losses that is really a victory when you dig more deeply. The door was opened last year when, in oral argument during the Obergefell case, the Chief Justice himself recognized that same-sex discrimination was sex discrimination. In a response to Michigan attorney John Bursch, the Chief Justice said, I'm not sure it's necessary to get into sexual orientation to resolve the case. I mean, if Sue loves Joe and Tom loves Joe, Sue can marry him and Tom can't. And the difference is based upon their different sex. Why isn't that a straightforward question of sexual discrimination?Indeed, and the federal appeals court judges across the country have taken note of that, most importantly the 7th Circuit's David Hamilton, who has also made a similar comment. I hope for the same from his fellow judges, Wood, Posner and Estabrook. The neon sign is flashing, or, to use an archaism, the handwriting is on the wall, and it's in a large, bold font -- Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is, per se, sex discrimination."
5,POLITICS,Platform And Politics: The Change We Made,"James Zogby, ContributorPresident, Arab American Institute; author, 'Arab Voices'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/platform-and-politics-the_b_11355716.html,"I feel good about what we accomplished with this year's Democratic Party's platform.

The convention officially began on Monday and is expected to attract thousands of protesters, members of the media and Democratic delegates to the City of Brotherly Love. (Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb823d2240000310098ba35.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The quadrennial process of party platform writing is more of a political exercise than a policy deliberation. When party leaders sit down to debate what will or will not go into their platform, their eyes are less focused on what will constitute sound policy. Instead they consider the politics involved in the positions they want in the document: will they cause concern with important constituencies; will they result in negative press; and will they provoke donors? Given this, I feel good about what we accomplished with this year's Democratic Party's platform. I say this not only as a proud member of the five person team Bernie Sanders picked to serve on the Platform Drafting Committee, but also as the first Arab American to have served in that capacity.Much has been written about the planks we lost or how the platform didn't go far enough, but what shouldn't be dismissed is that the Democratic Party is now on record embracing some of our positions and adopting some of our goals. All this is a clear recognition of the power of the progressive movement that was galvanized by the Sanders campaign and the role that Arab Americans played in that effort. The document includes: a call to abolish the death penalty; the goal of establishing a $15 an hour minimum wage; an expansion of the Social Security program; a recognition of the need to provide for public option health insurance; a call to eliminate Super PACs and overturn Citizens United; and the need to put a price on carbon emissions to deal with climate change. Bernie Sanders has referred to the final product as ""the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party"" and has called for a sustained effort to insure that, after November, the goals recognized in the document become law.What didn't receive coverage, but should also be noted, are the many ""little victories"" we won during the platform deliberations. Sometimes they were simple, but important, word changes or additions we suggested that were ultimately endorsed by all sides.For example, we were able to add language condemning the rise of ""Islamophobia"". And we were able to insure the absence of any terms disparaging of Islam. We also included the protection of civil liberties as a priority concern and expanded on the definition of ""racial profiling"" to include ""religion, ethnicity, or national origin"" thereby making the called for ban on ""un-American and unproductive"" profiling, the most comprehensive ever.In the section on ""Fixing our Broken Immigration System"" we co-authored with the Clinton campaign language recognizing that ""immigration is not a problem to be solved, it is the defining aspect of the American character and our shared history"". We also called for reforming ""the current quota system [that] discriminates against certain immigrants"" and we rejected ""attempts to impose a religious test to bar immigrants or refugees from entering the United States."" The platform also proposes a way forward to defeat ISIS and al Qaeda and end the wars in Syria and Iraq without seeing American forces mired down in prolonged conflict in the Middle East. The document recognizes that there must be ""more inclusive governance in Iraq and Syria that respects the rights of all citizens"". And calls for ""providing more support and security assistance for Lebanon and Jordan, two countries that are hosting a disproportionate number of refugees; and recognizes the importance of ""maintaining our robust security cooperation with Gulf countries.""On the matter of refugees, the platform explicitly supports ""President Obama's call for an international summit to address this crisis so that every country assumes its responsibility to meet this humanitarian challenge"" and pledges to ""look for ways to help innocent people who are fleeing persecution."" There was, to be sure, great disappointment in our failure to change the language on Israel/Palestine. We wanted to have the platform clearly state that the occupation and settlements must end, that the suffering of Palestinians must be acknowledged, and that excessive language on BDS and Jerusalem should be removed. We argued that it was commendable to call for two states, but the refusal to note that the major impediments to the realization of that goal are the occupation and settlements calls into question the commitment to achieving a two state solution. We also argued that our reading of their proposed language on BDS denied Palestinians the right to peacefully protest occupation and the language on Jerusalem was contradictory since, on the one hand, the platform states that ""Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations"" and then says that ""it should remain the capital of Israel, an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths."" Since our Sanders' team was outnumbered, we did not win, but from our lengthy debate on these issues (a small victory, in itself), several observations can be made. The draft prepared by the Clinton team sought to preempt our concerns. This is the first platform in history to speak of the recognition of Palestinians as having rights not merely, as Peter Beinart has noted, ""as a matter of Israeli self-interest"". The platform calls for providing ""Palestinians with independence, sovereignty, and dignity"". And, in another place, says that ""Palestinians should be free to govern themselves in their own viable state, in peace and dignity"". On this subject, earlier platforms were confused, at best, insulting, at worst. Finally, on the issues of BDS and Jerusalem, the Clinton campaign sought to explain their language by noting that they ""were very careful not to say outright that we oppose BDS"", but rather to oppose it only it if it delegitimized Israel. And one Clinton supporter offered a caveat regarding Jerusalem noting that nothing in their formulation would preclude Jerusalem from also being the capital of a future Palestinian state.As a reflection of the state of play of American politics, we should see this platform not a defeat but an acknowledgment that there has been a change. Change we made possible. We were able to impact the debate. In some instances, we were able to win changes in the platform and, even when we were not, we were able to force debate on critical issues of concern. That is why I was proud to be a part to be a part of the Sanders campaign and why I endorse his call to continue our forward march. We must remain a part of the progressive coalition working with our allies to elect Hillary Clinton, defeat Donald Trump, continue to transform the Democratic Party, and keep progressive ideas in the mainstream, and not on the fringes of American politics. Within this coalition we can continue to fight for progress. Outside of it, we run the risk of marginalizing ourselves and our issues. Follow @jjz1600 for more. "

Has a lack of political diversity turned campuses into centers of liberal indoctrination?These are legitimate questions, but I think the answers are ""no,"" ""no,"" and ""no."" Censorship and indoctrination are indeed serious problems on campus, but I don't think the solution is to have fewer liberal professors or more conservatives. On the contrary, the problem is that professors are not liberal enough.Yes, you read that right: College professors should be more liberal, not less. But notice I didn't say there should be more liberals. One can be liberal in the sense relevant to liberal education without being comprehensively liberal in some political sense. Professors should be liberal in the academic sense, regardless of their political views.Colleges and universities have been devoted since the 19th century to liberal education, which assumes and promotes the intellectual autonomy of human minds, including respect for rational collaboration, disciplinary methodologies, and rigorous research. This entails taking the results of research seriously, even when these conflict with traditional beliefs, values, and practices.It is not surprising that liberal education, which is rooted in liberal principles of individual liberty and rational autonomy, disproportionately attracts and produces liberals. Liberals and conservatives differ in ways that make liberal education more attractive to liberals than to conservatives. And involvement in education, even if it doesn't turn people into liberals, often makes them more liberal in the academic sense.Over the past two centuries, for example, liberals have generally accepted scientific conclusions on matters such as the age of the earth, the evolution of species, the reality of global warming, and the role of human activity in climate change. Conservatives, in contrast, have a long history of resisting scientific consensus on conclusions threatening to religious tradition or corporate profits. What, then, is the problem? One concern is that lack of intellectual diversity will hinder research and education. But the sort of intellectual diversity relevant to academic work is diversity with respect to ongoing theoretical controversies, and there is no reason to think this is lacking. Biologists, for example, hold and teach a variety of views about the process of evolution; there is no need for concern about their political or religious beliefs.Even with respect to political diversity the professoriate includes liberals, socialists, Marxists, moderates, pragmatists, libertarians, and (yes) conservatives, with many faculty claiming more than one of these categories, adding categories of their own, or rejecting any system of political categories. Those concerned about diversity of political views on campus need not worry. There is plenty of it.Perhaps the problem is that the range of diversity on campus is skewed to the left compared to the range among the public at large. Conservatives are underrepresented and far-left viewpoints overrepresented. But there is no reason a political ideology should be represented in the professoriate in proportion to its current popularity. Universities should hire on the basis of academic merit alone and let the political chips fall where they may.Rather than focus on the political views of professors, we should keep our focus on campus censorship and indoctrination, which are antithetical to liberal education. Professors should teach what they are hired to teach and should recognize their students' rational autonomy by providing evidence and arguments, not just conclusions, and by encouraging students to think for themselves, seek new evidence, and reach their own conclusions.As for the particular concern about liberal indoctrination, there's nothing liberal about censorship or indoctrination. It may be possible to indoctrinate someone in particular liberal ideas and restrict exposure to alternative ideas but it is illiberal to do that. To reduce indoctrination we need more liberalism, not less.But that doesn't mean more liberals. Professors should be hired on the basis of their teaching and research without regard to their political views or activities. We needn't worry about the representation of various political ideologies in the professoriate. Our focus should be on reminding all professors, regardless of their political views, that liberal education requires them to respect the intellectual freedom of all their colleagues and all their students."

During their drive, they began to talk about the upcoming Olympics. That’s when Hill told Willock that his son, Darrell, was going to compete in shot put on the U.S. Olympic Track and Field team.According to Hill’s son, his father is proud of his accomplishment.“He pretty much tells everyone who gets into his car that his son is going to the Olympics,” Darrell Hill told The Delaware County Daily Times.When Willock asked if Hill was going to Brazil to watch his son compete, Hill told her he couldn’t afford it.“It was devastating to hear that,” Willock told People. “Here’s this wonderful man who has a close relationship with his son and I know any parent would want to see their son or daughter compete at the Olympics, but it was very understandable how that could be out of reach.” That’s when Willock, who works for a global concierge service with contacts in Brazil, decided to help.“She tried to see if her company could buy him a plane ticket, but it didn’t work out that way,” Darrell Hill told the Daily Times. “The logistics of it, she was not able to do it in the time it needed to be done so she approached me about starting a GoFundMe account.”On July 28, Willock started the campaign. She asked for $7,500 to pay for a plane ticket, hotel, meals, passport and other travel expenses. Two days later they had reached their goal.Robert Mongeluzzi, a Philadelphia attorney, donated $1,545.“I’ve been an athlete my whole life, and you know, I guess it just touched me,” Mongeluzzi told NBC10.Hill said he came out of church on Sunday to a phone call from NBC10 letting him know the GoFundMe campaign had reached its goal.“It’s a great thing for people to come together like that, and it’s a great opportunity,” Hill told the outlet.Willock told NBC10 her company would arrange ground transportation from Pennsylvania to the hotel in Rio. The outlet also reported that Uber chipped in, giving Hill $1,000 in Uber credits so he can easily get around Rio. The company also gave him a $250 gift certificate to one of the city’s top restaurants.Now all Hill has to do is get his passport and book a ticket in order to see his son compete on August 18.“I haven’t seen my son in a couple months because he’s been training,” Hill told People. “I cant wait to see him and encourage him in person and let him know I’m 100 percent in his corner.” Note: The Huffington Post’s editor-in-chief Arianna Huffington is a member of Uber’s board of directors, and has recused herself from any involvement in the site’s coverage of the company."

Clinton had not held a press conference since Dec. 4, 2015, in Fort Dodge, Iowa ― or 244 days ago ― and reporters have frequently highlighted this drought on Twitter.So when NABJ President Sarah Glover introduced Clinton on Friday as speaking before the “largest press conference with any presidential candidate before a room filled with journalists of color,” several Clinton reporters took issue with that designation. The Clinton campaign’s press secretary, Brian Fallon, suggested in response to CNN’s Dan Merica that Clinton was, indeed, participating in a press conference. When asked by The Huffington Post if the campaign considered the event to be a press conference, Fallon emailed, “The president of the organization called it that, and I am not sure what else you could call it.”Following the event’s conclusion, NAHJ president Mekahlo Medina described it as a “press event” to HuffPost. The debate seems to be over whether an event with five pre-selected journalists amounts to a press conference, or if a press conference requires a more freewheeling exchange between the candidate and members of the campaign press corps. At Friday’s event, NBC’s Kristen Welker and Telemundo’s Lori Montenegro, representing NABJ and NAHJ, respectively, served as moderators and began by asking Clinton several questions. Next, three journalists in the audience ― The New York Times’ Yamiche Alcindor, The Washington Post’s Ed O’Keefe, and ESPN’s Kevin Merida ― asked additional questions. Medina said Welker and Montenegro were selected ahead of time to represent each organization, given their familiarity with Clinton’s campaign. The other journalists were part of a 10-person preliminary panel discussion at the joint conference. “What happened today is Hillary Clinton took questions from members of the media,” Medina said. “I don’t know if people want to call that a press conference or not, but that’s what happened.” Medina, an NBC anchor in Los Angeles, added that he’s “been a journalist for a long time” and “anytime there’s somebody who takes questions from the press at a large event, that constituted a press conference.”Still, some journalists weren’t convinced. Though Clinton has not held a press conference all year, she has participated in around a dozen “gaggles,” which are less formal sessions in which traveling reporters are able to ask some questions.Clinton has personally pushed back against criticism over her accessibility to the media by noting in June that she’d given 300 interviews in 2016. And as reporters questioned Clinton’s openness on Friday, traveling press secretary Nick Merrill tweeted that she’d taken 2,600 questions this year. Reporters are inevitably going to want more opportunities for access. Before asking his question Friday, O’Keefe encouraged Clinton to “do this more often with reporters across the country, especially those news organizations that travel the country with you everywhere you go.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a4e1c92a00000002fb5001.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Hillary Clinton may view Donald Trump as a racist misogynist, but she feels some sympathy for his supporters. Speaking at a conference of black and Hispanic journalists, the Democratic presidential nominee walked a fine line, casting many of Trump’s most controversial comments as racist and xenophobic, while declining to extend that characterization to his ardent supporters. “We have to recognize that, of course, some of the appeal [of Trump] is xenophobic, racist, misogynistic,” Clinton said, while cautioning the audience not to “lose sight of the pain that many Americans are feeling because the economy has left them behind.”Clinton recalled Trump’s harsh words against Mexican immigrants and his repeated attacks against Khizr and Ghazala Khan, Muslim parents who lost their Army captain son, Humayun, in the Iraq war. Despite the wide gulf that separates Clinton from Trump’s hardcore supporters, she explained his nationalist appeal as a reaction to the declining fortunes of much of the American middle class with the dwindling of manufacturing and the harsh recession of 2008. She said she’d met with a coal mining family in West Virginia, a state she expects to lose in November. But in listening to their concerns, Clinton said she became more sensitive to the wider discontent among Trump supporters with the shortage of stable jobs with decent pay.“We have to reject and stand up against the appeals to the kind of bigotry and the use of bluster and bullying we’ve seen come from the Trump campaign,” Clinton said. “But let’s not forget the pain … all Americans are feeling.” She added that she would continue to reach out to Americans “of all ethnicities,” a phrase usually invoked to refer to groups other than white males. Clinton made the comments at a joint annual conference of the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. Trump was invited to attend, but declined. The GOP presidential nominee has consistently alienated voters of color that the Republican Party sought to reach out to more consistently after Mitt Romney bombed among Hispanics in 2012, winning only 27 percent of the Latino vote. Instead, Trump’s support base is largely white and male, though a McClatchy-Marist poll released Friday showed that his support among that demographic had dropped from a 14-point lead over Clinton last month to just eight points after the conventions and his public feud with the Khan family.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

(See: “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” with Johnny Depp, “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” with Jim Carrey, “The Amazing Spider-Man” with Andrew Garfield.) For reasons that aren’t all rooted in sheer refusal to watch four women comedians fire proton beams at the supernatural just because they weren’t men like in the classic 1984 version, the “Ghostbusters” reboot has faced a lot of criticism. And evidently, director Paul Feig is done grappling with nostalgic moviegoing hordes.Asked whether he’d ever consider reimagining another classic film property, the director responded decisively.“No, no, no. No, I will not,” Feig told The Huffington Post, laughing. The creator of cult hit “Freaks and Geeks” and director of “Bridesmaids” will happily go back to original material, which he noted comprises the bulk of his work. “This one was just too tempting because I knew we could do something with it that was exciting,” he explained. A gender-bent sequel with cameos by all the original main cast members? Sure, that’s pretty exciting. Or blasphemous, depending on your view.Actors including Melissa McCarthy and at least one Sony executive have joined Feig to speak out against the sexist, misogynist bits of “Ghostbusters” criticism, appropriately labeling it, well, sexist and misogynist.But it wasn’t all hateful. The Huffington Post spoke to Feig about the reaction he’s seen from fans since the movie’s July 15 debut, and he explained how a lot of it has been positive ― especially from women and young girls.“It’s such a validation for the years of false controversy,” Feig said.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"George Zimmerman, who was acquitted of shooting unarmed teen Trayvon Martin to death in 2012, says he was punched in the face by a Florida restaurant customer who overheard him talking about the killing, according to police. Zimmerman told police in Sanford that the Sunday evening altercation began inside Gators Riverside Grille after he complimented another customer’s Confederate flag tattoos. A friend of the tattooed man recognized Zimmerman and asked if he was indeed the volunteer neighborhood watchman who fatally shot 17-year-old Martin in 2012.Zimmerman said he showed his identification to the group, which included the wife of one of them.At that point, “a large fat man approached,” according to Zimmerman’s statement to police. “You’re bragging about that?” asked the man, identified only as Eddie, according to Zimmerman.Zimmerman’s statement, which conflicts with what other witnesses told police, becomes confusing at this point. He said Eddie commanded him to leave the restaurant and called him “a n――- lover.” Zimmerman is infamous for killing Martin, who was African-American. “I am not looking for any trouble,” Zimmerman said he told the man.With that, he said, the man slugged him in the face. Restaurant staff intervened and Zimmerman called 911. “And he said he’s going to kill me,” Zimmerman told the dispatcher.Eddie fled on a blue Harley-Davidson motorcycle, the police report said.A Seminole County sheriff’s officer who questioned witnesses concluded that Eddie, a white man with a blonde beard, “is the primary aggressor in this case,” the police report said. Police said the man was being sought.Witnesses differed on details. The two men and woman who first spoke with Zimmerman reported seeing no punches thrown. They portrayed Zimmerman as cocky when he approached them.Joseph Whitmer gave police this account: ”Mr. Zimmerman walks up and says ‘I love your tattoos. My name is George Zimmerman, you know the guy who killed Trayvon Martin?’” Without prompting, Zimmerman took out his ID, according to Whitmer’s statement. David Worrell told police he asked Zimmerman to leave their table. But another of Worrell’s friends, who is unnamed, “began to exchange words” with Zimmerman, according to the statement. Worrell tried to pull his friend away, but Zimmerman “stuck something in his face” that Worrell knocked away, according to the statement.Worrell told police that he then left the restaurant with his friends. “The issue he had was when Mr. Zimmerman came to his table and proceeded to brag about how he was the one who killed Trayvon Martin,” the police report said. Restaurant owner Ed Winters told The Orlando Sentinel there were no punches, though he acknowedged Zimmerman and another man shoved each other. Gregory Home, Zimmerman’s companion at the restaurant, told a vastly different story. Five men approached their table, he told police, and “began yelling at Mr. Zimmerman and acting in a threatening manner towards him.” Horne said he stepped between Zimmerman and the man who punched him. Horne started recording the argument with his phone, but one of the men threw it. A piece of the phone broke, but Horne said he called 911.No one has been charged by police.Zimmerman, who claimed he shot Martin in self defense, has had repeated run-ins with the law since his acquittal.In November 2013, he was accused of pointing a gun at his girlfriend during an argument. In September 2014, police said he threatened to kill a man during a road rage incident in Lake Mary, Florida. The alleged victim declined to press charges."
12,POLITICS,AARP To Withdraw From Controversial Conservative Group Amid Rising Pressure,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aarp-to-withdraw-from-alec_us_57a4c72de4b03ba6801233e5,It only took a week.,2016-08-05,AARP activists attend a campaign event for then-presidential candidate Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) in March. AARP is trying to make Social Security a focus in the election.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a4c7c82a0000fa01fb4f82.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AARP announced on Thursday that it plans to let its membership in a controversial conservative group expire at the end of the year, a clear response to mounting pressure from its members and progressive organizations.AARP is one of many organizations that sponsor the American Legislative Exchange Council, a powerful corporate-backed lobbying group focused on influencing state-level legislation. The Center for Media and Democracy, a Wisconsin-based progressive research and advocacy outfit, exactly a week ago revealed the mammoth seniors group’s sponsorship of ALEC’s annual meeting last month in Indianapolis, Indiana.Almost immediately, a number of liberal groups and labor unions, including Social Security Works, the American Federations of State, County and Municipal Employees, and ClimateTruth.org, launched a public campaign to get AARP to cut its ties to ALEC. They argued that AARP’s involvement with ALEC contradicted its mission to represent older Americans, since ALEC has taken many positions that are harmful to seniors.ALEC has supported privatizing Social Security in the past, opposes the expansion of Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act and has helped pass voter identification laws that often disenfranchise senior citizens, the groups noted.The progressive organizations, many of which are longstanding critics of ALEC, sent AARP a strongly-worded letter urging it to withdraw from the group and began an online petition campaign to pressure AARP to do so. Social Security Works told activists in an email blast that the petition had received over 53,000 signatures within 24 hours.On Thursday afternoon, AARP decided it would not renew its membership in ALEC, Politico Playbook reported.“After hearing from many of you, we’ve decided not to renew our membership to ALEC,” AARP wrote in a message posted on its Facebook page early Friday morning. “We would never work against the interests of older Americans and our engagement with ALEC was NOT an endorsement of the organization’s policies, but an opportunity to engage with state legislators and advance our members’ priorities.”AARP, unlike ALEC, opposes Social Security privatization and was a key backer of the Affordable Care Act health care reform law.“We will not renew our membership to ALEC. AARP will continue to explore avenues that will enhance our interaction with organizations and elected officials that represent different perspectives in order to further the issues important to Americans 50+ and their families,” AARP said in a statement. ALEC did not immediately respond to The Huffington Post’s request for comment.AARP had been sending staff to ALEC’s annual meeting since 2014 and paid a membership fee starting this year, according to sources familiar with the matter. AARP claimed it hoped its membership would grant it access to state lawmakers. Although AARP’s financial support for ALEC was likely insignificant, progressive groups worried that AARP’s imprimatur lent considerable credibility to a group that would otherwise have a deeply contentious reputation.The organizations also found it inconceivable that AARP somehow needed ALEC to gain access to lawmakers. AARP is widely viewed as one of the most powerful public interest groups in the country, with over 37 million members over the age of 50. While ALEC is technically an educational nonprofit, it functions as a powerful public policy lobbying group that drafts numerous pieces of model legislation for state lawmakers. In addition to membership dues, corporations often pay ALEC to write and advance specific kinds of laws that benefit their bottom line.ALEC’s influence is sometimes comically apparent in conservative state-level legislation. A Florida lawmaker forgot to remove ALEC’s mission statement from a November 2011 resolution calling on the federal government to reduce corporate taxes. Stand Up to ALEC, a coalition of labor unions, environmental groups and other progressive organizations, have successfully urged many major corporations to leave ALEC in response to the controversial policies the group supports.In recent years, 19 nonprofits and 108 corporations, including Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and Coca-Cola, have withdrawn from ALEC, according to the Center for Media and Democracy.The corporate exodus from the organization picked up in earnest after the killing of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. ALEC was promoting so-called stand your ground legislation, similar to the law in Florida that allowed George Zimmerman, a civilian, to legally kill Martin because he allegedly felt threatened.ALEC has also come under fire for providing a forum for climate change deniers. It is an active opponent of the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, the initiative aimed at reducing power plants’ greenhouse gas emissions.Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt cited ALEC’s work against climate change action when announcing the decision to leave ALEC in September 2014. In ripping remarks, Schmidt claimed that when it came to climate change, ALEC was “literally just lying.” Social Security Works, an organization that is fighting to expand Social Security, celebrated AARP’s decision to allow its membership in ALEC to expire. “After a huge uproar from its members, we are very pleased that AARP is doing the right thing and cutting all ties with the anti-senior ALEC,” said Linda Benesch, Social Security Works’ communications director.Although AARP’s decision to withdraw from ALEC has quieted its critics for now, it is likely to raise questions about the organization’s policy agenda. AARP’s involvement in ALEC is the second major instance this year in which it provoked the ire of progressive groups. AARP’s “Take A Stand” initiative, launched in November, mobilizes its members to ask presidential candidates to elaborate on how they plan to reform Social Security to close its long-term funding shortfall.The campaign does not distinguish, however, between plans that boost Social Security’s finances by cutting benefits and those that do not. Maya Rockeymoore, president of Global Policy Solutions, a progressive think tank, was one of the prominent liberal policy experts who publicly criticized AARP for its neutrality in February.“There is no question where AARP should stand: on the side of older adults trying to make ends meet. And their policy prescriptions should reflect that,” Rockeymoore said at the time.This story has been updated with a statement from AARP."
13,POLITICS,Communities Abused By Police Demand That DOJ Literally Hear Their Voices,Liz Adetiba,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doj-police-investigations-public-forums_us_57a2560ee4b0e1aac9149e69,"""Our cries have fallen on deaf ears for decades.”",2016-08-05,"Under President Obama, the Justice Department has opened investigations into 23 law enforcement agencies, including those in Baltimore, Chicago, Baton Rouge and Ferguson.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a36edb2a0000fa01fb4b8e.jpeg?cache=vp4VSCeYLB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — When the U.S. Department of Justice investigates a local police department accused of unconstitutional abuses, one of the most important aspects of its work is to simply listen.The residents of these cities are often frustrated with a law enforcement system that has ignored their complaints. Public forums with the DOJ investigators give them the chance, finally, to share their painful and sometime brutal stories ― and to know that the world has heard them.“You’ve got to understand that there is no accountability. Where are people supposed to go? Who are folks supposed to tell their stories to?” said Pamela Cytrynbaum, executive director of the Chicago Innocence Center.The Chicago Police Department along with those in Baltimore and a half-dozen other cities are currently undergoing “pattern or practice” investigations by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Under President Barack Obama, DOJ has made it a priority to look into police forces accused of widespread misconduct and unconstitutional behavior, including excessive use of force and illegal searches. That’s in sharp contrast to the Bush administration, during which such probes slowed to a halt. “Every American expects and deserves the protection of law enforcement that is effective, that is responsive, that is respectful and most importantly constitutional,” Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in announcing the Chicago investigation eight months ago.For citizens harmed by law enforcement, internal police department reviews and citizen oversight boards seem to offer little to no recourse ― at least in the cities being investigated. Last year, the Invisible Institute, a civic journalism organization, released over 28,000 citizen complaints of misconduct by Chicago police, covering both verbal and physical abuse, that were filed between 2011 and 2015. Sixty-one percent of those complaints were filed by black Americans, but less than 2 percent of those were sustained.In Baltimore, police union contracts allow “peer” officers to serve on the hearing board for citizen complaints. The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland argues that practice impedes accountability since officers have an interest in protecting their colleagues from discipline.Three summers ago, Tawanda Jones received a call that turned her world on its head: Her 44-year-old brother, Tyrone West, was dead after an altercation with Baltimore police. Though the official autopsy report states that West died because of a pre-existing cardiac condition, Jones believes that her brother died as a result of police abuse, and a second autopsy from an independent medical examiner found his cause of death to be positional asphyxia. Seeking justice, Jones turned to community activism and led demonstrations in her brother’s name. But, as is often the case with police-involved deaths, no charges were brought against the officers involved. “If it wasn’t for me and my family pushing so hard, no one would even know about Tyrone West,” Jones told The Huffington Post.Unlike more recent incidents of police brutality, West’s death was not captured on video. Jones believes the lack of footage has made justice much more difficult to attain.But with the Justice Department in town, the opportunity to tell her brother’s story to the federal lawyers has been cathartic.“We’ve been crying our tears, and our cries have fallen on deaf ears for decades,” Jones said, referring to the long history of police violence against the black community in Baltimore. “So when you see people of any kind, whether it be the DOJ or the U.N., and we hear that they’re going to be here at this specific spot on this specific day, we feel obligated to talk to them.”The probe of the Baltimore Police Department, a relatively large force of over 3,000 officers, has lasted more than a year ― twice as long as the Ferguson, Missouri, investigation, which focused on a tiny police department with less than 100 employees. Jones has attended many of the DOJ’s public forums in Baltimore and said she has found their team to be very responsive, even accepting her invitations to attend community meetings.“It meant a lot for me to see the guy from the DOJ when he came and sat down with me, took down my information and attended several forums. And then when we were hosting our community meeting, the police commissioner didn’t show up but the Department of Justice guy did,” she said.That sentiment is echoed by Ken Jiretsu, a board member of Baltimore’s Transgender Alliance. The group invited DOJ to their community meetings in an effort to make sure investigators heard the voices of trans people. At one such gathering, Jiretsu, a transgender man, shared his own difficult experience dealing with Baltimore police.“I called to ask for officers to escort [my son] to the hospital. When they arrived, one of the officers that was with them had misgendered me, so I had to correct her. She had said, ‘Miss,’ and I told her, ‘It’s sir,’ and she was like, ‘Oh, OK, how was I supposed to know?’ Then she said, ‘So, man, sir, whatever you want to be called,’” Jiretsu said.“Her colleagues that were with her were also laughing,” said Jiretsu, “and it ended up becoming a triggering situation for me.” The fact that his children were witnesses to the encounter in his own home made it even more upsetting.After hearing his story, Jiretsu said, the DOJ took his information and promised to follow up.“I think a lot of them are sincere,” he said. “They were sincere in listening to what we had to say. The two that I personally spoke to seemed very interested in what we had to say.”The DOJ’s efforts to engage with local communities during these investigations aren’t really geared, however, toward capturing and resolving individual complaints against officers. The Civil Rights Division’s efforts concentrate more on broad reforms and remedies ― which means the federal team isn’t there to hear everyone’s tale. For some residents, that has been the most frustrating aspect of these investigations. Turnout for the public forums in Baltimore has been rather high. One event had to be moved from a location that could hold only 80 people to one that could accommodate over 300. The DOJ teams try to hold forums “throughout the investigation and target different parts of the community so we can hear not only from the greatest volume, but a wide variety of folks so we can get a better sense of the breadth,” a Justice Department spokesperson told The Huffington Post. Three to four events are typically held near the start, which gives the team an opportunity to explain to the community how the investigation will be conducted while also soliciting citizen testimony.In Chicago, the DOJ has hosted four public forums so far, all on weeknights ― a schedule that some have criticized for shutting out people who don’t work 9 to 5. After hearing from friends that the first forum had a turnout of fewer than 40 people, Frances McDonald, a student at the University of Chicago, said she felt compelled to show up at the next one. “Some people were screaming and yelling. Some people went past their allotted time to speak because they were so angry, and there were some people in the crowd crying,” McDonald said. “Some parents of children with mental disabilities spoke of their children’s experiences with the police.”McDonald wasn’t there to tell yet another story, but to witness what members of her community had to say. And she came away convinced of at least one thing.“I definitely think there should be a few more forums. I’d say at least 10 more,” said McDonald.The Chicago police force is the largest department the DOJ is investigating. The probe was prompted by the October 2014 death of Laquan McDonald and the subsequent coverup. A video of the shooting was finally released more than a year later, and those images spurred protests around the city. But Chicago’s history of police abuse extends further back. From the secretive interrogation facility at Homan Square to the tortured confessions elicited by former police commander Jon Burge, the city’s black and Latino residents have complained of police violence for over 40 years.“Given what communities have suffered under in this town for so long, it is appalling to me that there are not more opportunities for the public to tell their stories,” Cytrynbaum of the Chicago Innocence Center said. “Even if they need to rent out a stadium, they need to hear this. It needs to be on the record.”The Justice Department spokesperson told HuffPost that they plan to host more forums in Chicago, including one or two on the weekends.“We had already planned to do more. We were just hammering out details,” the spokesperson said.This doesn’t necessarily mean that the DOJ is aiming for a very high turnout. “If 10,000 people show up, it won’t really be an effective way to engage with folks,” the spokesperson pointed out. “It won’t be a fruitful or engaging conversation, and we won’t be able to hear from the vast majority of people who come. So I think it’s a balance.”Still, Cytrynbaum insists that the DOJ needs to listen to as many tales as community members want to share.“I’m sorry if it’s tiring for people to listen to these stories. I’m sorry if you feel like if you’ve heard one account of a police officer holding a gun to a 3-year-old’s head, then you’ve heard them all,” she said. “We must have an accounting of what’s going on, and the only way to do that is to make sure all of these stories get told and get counted.”As for Jones, the impending end of the Baltimore investigation triggers new worries. She sees the DOJ team as the watchdog Baltimoreans have been pleading for.“These people that hold some type of power and can enlighten our situation need to be around constantly. Because at the end of the day, I feel like nobody oversees these police officers. They get to do whatever they want to do,” she said."
