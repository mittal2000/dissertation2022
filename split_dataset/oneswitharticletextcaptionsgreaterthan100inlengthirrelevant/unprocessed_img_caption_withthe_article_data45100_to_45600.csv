But the agency never asked for public comment or input from Congress.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e93da61b00003007ef236f.jpeg?cache=vbV4rr5Vp9&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A bipartisan group of House lawmakers are asking the Drug Enforcement Administration to reconsider its decision to place the herbal supplement kratom into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, a move that could take effect as early as the end of the week.In a letter on Monday, 51 representatives ― including 22 Republicans ― called on called on acting DEA Administrator Chuck Rosenberg to delay the impending ban in order to “engage consumers, researchers, and other stakeholders, in keeping with well-established protocol for such matters.”See the full letter and list of signatories below.“This significant regulatory action was done without any opportunity for public comment from researchers, consumers, and other stakeholders,” reads the letter, drafted by Reps. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) and Matt Salmon (R-Ariz). “This hasty decision could have serious effects on consumer access and choice of an internationally recognized herbal supplement.”Pocan’s office provided a copy of the letter to The Huffington Post. The lawmakers also sent a separate letter to Shaun Donovan, director of the Office of Management and Budget, asking him to halt the DEA’s scheduling process to give authorities more time to determine if kratom truly belongs in Schedule I, alongside heroin and LSD. Drugs in this category are considered to have no known medical benefit and a high potential for abuse.In a notice published in the Federal Register at the end of August, the DEA claimed that kratom, an herb made from the leaves of Mitragyna speciosa, a Southeast Asian tree related to coffee, poses an “imminent hazard to the public safety.” Kratom contains two alkaloids, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which appear to activate opioid receptors in the brain and reduce pain. Though most opioids have sedative qualities, kratom is a mild stimulant in low to moderate doses.As an herbal supplement, kratom remains largely unregulated at the federal level, though law enforcement agencies have recently begun seizing shipments of kratom products, citing health concerns. Over the past few years, state lawmakers have worked ― often with the cooperation of pro-kratom organizations ― to consider age restrictions and labeling requirements, among other regulatory measures. A federal ban would put an end to such nuanced efforts.Kratom groups estimate millions of Americans currently use kratom to treat a variety of ailments, including chronic pain anxiety, depression and opioid addiction. But because kratom hasn’t been subjected to large-scale clinical trials under federal guidelines, the DEA says the herb has “no currently accepted medical use” and is therefore moving to make criminals out of the people who currently use it. The agency also raises concerns about kratom’s potential for addiction and abuse.The DEA did not give an opportunity for public comment ahead of last month’s announcement, and kratom advocates and lawmakers say they weren’t aware of the agency’s intent until after it published the notice.Kratom users and scientists have since aggressively opposed the DEA’s move to wage war on another plant. Critics claim the agency dismissed promising anecdotal reports and emerging scientific evidence suggesting kratom may have medical benefits ― or at the very least, a low-risk profile and minimal potential for recreational abuse.Researchers at Columbia University recently published a study on the alkaloids in kratom and found that the herb activates opioid receptors in a way that doesn’t trigger respiratory depression, a potentially lethal side effect of most narcotic painkillers. The scientists concluded that kratom could help lead to the development of safer pain medications that could help address a nationwide opioid epidemic fueled by prescription painkillers. At least one pharmaceutical company is currently working to develop a medication that targets pain in much the same way as kratom.Kratom advocates and drug policy reformers have said the move to ban kratom makes a mockery of the federal government’s purported concern about the opioid epidemic. The White House and members of Congress have encouraged doctors to prescribe fewer narcotic painkillers, but the DEA has now moved to criminalize a natural herb that could help with that very effort ― presumably, much to the pleasure of pharmaceutical companies that would benefit from the demise of an affordable competitor.In their letter, lawmakers accuse the DEA of mounting a hypocritical campaign against kratom.“The DEA’s decision to place kratom as a Schedule I substance will put a halt on federally funded research and innovation surrounding the treatment of individuals suffering from opioid and other addictions — a significant public health threat,” they write.Opponents of the DEA’s decision are also questioning kratom’s supposed health risks. The DEA relied heavily on a single report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found that U.S. poison centers received 660 kratom-related calls between January 2010 and December 2015. It also found evidence of 555 positive drug test results for kratom from December 2014 through March 2016.The DEA claims that a sharp upward trend over this period shows “growing abuse and popularity of these substances,” but the incidents make up just a tiny portion of the more than 3 million annual calls to poison centers and the millions of drug tests the CDC surveyed over that period. For comparison, poison centers gets tens of thousands of calls each year regarding exposure to laundry detergent packets, glow sticks and other plant matter. In 2014, about 57 percent of all poison center cases involved pharmaceuticals.The DEA also claims there have been “numerous deaths associated with kratom,” but critics point out that the agency hasn’t been able to provide an example in which the herb was found to be the only contributor. Most deaths associated with kratom have involved people who reportedly tested positive for numerous substances or were suffering from pre-existing medical conditions. Users frequently report that consuming too much kratom will only lead to nausea and vomiting. Meanwhile, around 25,000 people died of prescription drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, the highest number ever recorded.The DEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter from Congress.Although lawmakers didn’t exactly rush to challenge the DEA’s decision, the letter shows that they are willing to take a vocal, proactive stand against bad policy, said Jag Davies, director of communications strategy at the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for progressive reform of drug laws.“It’s about time the DEA took heed of the remarkable, bipartisan support in Congress for drug policy reform,” said Davies in a statement. “There’s no good reason for people who use kratom to be treated as criminals, especially considering prohibition’s disproportionate impact on people of color and other marginalized communities.”The following lawmakers signed on to the letter:Mark Pocan - (D-Wis.)Matt Salmon - (R-Ariz.)John Conyers - (D-Mich.)Hank Johnson - (D-Ga.)Tim Ryan - (D-Ohio)Jared Polis - (D-Colo.)Adam Smith - (D-Wash.)Dana Rohrabacher - (R-Calif.)Joe Heck - (R-Nev.)John Yarmuth - (D-Ky.)Steve Cohen - (D-Tenn.)Dan Benishek - (R-Mich.)Mark Sanford - (R-S.C.)Mick Mulvaney - (R-S.C.)Keith Ellison - (D-Minn.)Steve Israel - (D-N.Y.)Ted Poe - (R-Texas)Gerald E.

2,THE WORLDPOST,No Convictions In Mexico's Missing 43 Students Case After Two Years,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ayotzinapa-43-students-mexico_us_57e981a7e4b0e80b1ba3a276,"Innocent people may have been jailed, and guilty ones may go free.",2016-09-26,"Sidronio Casarrubias Salgado, the alleged leader of the Guerreros Unidos drug cartel. A judge recently found that he had been tortured.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e985651700002a00ac7525.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two years after 43 students went missing in Mexico’s highest-profile human rights case, prosecutors have yet to convict a single suspect, according to Vidulfo Rosales, a lawyer who represents the students’ parents. In a series of separate incidents on Sept. 26, 2014, police officers and unidentified gunmen attacked a group of students from the Ayotzinapa teachers college in the southern Mexican city of Iguala. Three students and three bystanders died. Forty-three students were abducted and never again seen alive. The case became a rallying point for a national protest movement against corruption, violence and impunity. But two years after the crimes, the case has also come to symbolize the longstanding problems with Mexico’s opaque legal system and its over-reliance on forcing confessions rather than proving guilt. Meanwhile, the Enrique Peña Nieto administration still clings to a widely discredited version of events.New York resident Antonio Tizapa, whose son Jorge is among the missing, told The WorldPost he had little faith that Mexican courts would offer an accurate explanation of what happened on the night of Sept. 26, 2014. Tizapa plans to lead a group of relatives and activists, some of whom are hunger striking, on a march in front of Mexico’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations on Monday. “The government has tried to manipulate the investigation,” Tizapa said. “It’s an insult to the parents [of the students] and an insult to the people of Mexico.” Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office defended its handling of the case in a press statement a day ahead of the two-year anniversary, calling it the “most transcendent, exhaustive criminal investigation” in the country’s history.  Many disagree. Mexico transitioned to a U.S.-style trial system this summer, adopting oral arguments and presentation of evidence before a judge.But the missing students case occurred before the deadline and fell under the jurisdiction of the old system. That means judges are trying the case behind closed doors using written briefs. The process has been anything but speedy. “It would certainly be different if this case had been tried under the new system,” said Octavio Rodríguez, program coordinator for the Justice in Mexico project at the University of San Diego. “At least by now, we would have started to see some trials. It’s just the nature of the [new] system ― it’s more transparent, it’s more efficient, it demands the evidence to be presented within a certain time. It has stricter rules for the presumption of innocence.”Independent forensic experts, journalists and a panel of experts fielded by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights all contend that Mexican authorities have mishandled and misinterpreted evidence. Perhaps even more damning, independent reporting and the IACHR group indicate that dozens of alleged witnesses and four of the key suspects were tortured ― casting doubt on whether their testimony is accurate or admissible in court. “Evidence was tampered with, evidence got lost,” said Maureen Meyer, who directs the Mexico program at the Washington Office on Latin America. “They’re over-reliant on obtaining confessions through torture and that won’t stand up before a judge, or shouldn’t.” These flaws raise two equally disturbing possibilities. One the one hand, suspects responsible for the crimes committed on Sept. 26 might go free because Mexican authorities flouted procedure. Mexican authorities’ mishandling of evidence already appears to have weakened the government’s case. On the other hand, innocent people ensnared in the sprawling and, so far, largely inconclusive investigation might have spent years of their lives behind bars without cause. One of suspects in the case, alleged Guerreros Unidos drug gang leader Sidronio Casarrubias Salgado, won an appeal to have his charges reconsidered earlier this month after a judge found he’d confessed under torture. Casarrubias is still in prison, but a judge will now re-evaluate whether he should remain in pretrial detention even though his confession has been dismissed.Mexican authorities have arrested more than 100 people in connection with the missing students case, according to the Pro Human Rights Center. But many of them face charges unrelated to the crimes committed the night of Sept. 26, 2014.The alleged mastermind of the attacks, José Luis Abarca Velázquez, offers one example. Abarca was mayor of Iguala during the attacks, and former Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam publicly accused him of giving orders to attack the students. But after his arrest, Abarca was instead charged with one count of homicide for a killing that took place the year before, along with seven counts of enforced disappearance that are unconnected to the missing students case. Alejandro Hope, a former Mexican intelligence official, said he expected prosecutors to secure some convictions, even though the case has been marred by torture allegations and other mishandling of evidence. Even so, Hope said the government investigation would likely leave many questions unanswered. With the exception of one bone fragment, identified as the remains of student Alexander Mora Venancio, Mexican authorities have yet to find the missing students or offer a compelling motive for their disappearance. “This is no longer a case, this is a cause,” Hope told The WorldPost. “No matter what happens in the courts, it will not bring closure.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Mexico’s new trial system include juries in some instances. In fact, it will not."

India has the highest incidence of TB in the world, according to the World Health Organization's Global Tuberculosis Report 2013.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The latest global health crisis could claim more lives than cancer if pharmaceutical companies and other groups don’t band together to stop it, according to the World Health Organization.World leaders and health experts convened at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City last week to tackle antimicrobial resistance. In short: bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms are becoming immune to current medicines, which takes a huge toll on the world’s most vulnerable populations. This means we need new medications to tackle illnesses that were previously considered under control.Antibiotic resistance causes at least 700,000 deaths annually. That number is expected to skyrocket to 10 million a year by 2050, Keiji Fukuda, special representative for antimicrobial resistance at WHO, said at the Social Good Summit last week in New York City. “It’s an amazingly broad range of infections. It’s as relevant in Kansas, Asia and Africa,” Fukuda said. “It’s not a theoretical issue we’re waiting for.”An Issue That Affects Global Poor In Particular Advocates are particularly concerned about illnesses that predominantly affect poor and underserved groups. Because pharmaceutical companies are driven by sales potential, they’re not keen on investing in medications and vaccines for people who can’t afford to pay high prices, nonprofit medical group Doctors Without Borders noted in a May report.And even when effective medications and vaccines become available, they often come at a cost-prohibitive price point.Groups like Doctors Without Borders have long been pushing for new vaccines and medications for underserved patients that are also affordable. But the United Nations has now also joined the campaign.A New Call For Transparency And Lower PricesThe U.N.’s High Level Panel on Access To Medicines released a lengthy report calling for changes in funding models for drugs and vaccines.Among its recommendations, the U.N. called for more transparency regarding the costs associated with new drugs. It also wants the industry to separate research and development from a product’s ultimate price. “The core problem is that the current research and development system … is dictated by commercial interests so there are no new medicines for tuberculosis but there are medicines [from which drugs companies] can make a lot of money,” Mohga Kamal-Yanni, senior health policy adviser at Oxfam, told the Guardian.Kamal-Yanni was one of a number of experts who contributed evidence to the U.N. panel, which published the report. Tuberculosis is one of a handful of diseases that health experts are worried about.TB claimed 1.5 million lives in 2014, making it the biggest infectious disease killer in the world. That same year, there were about 480,000 new cases, which were resistant to the two most powerful anti-TB dugs, according to WHO. While TB occurs worldwide, Africa carries the “most severe” burden, which may be why there’s been such a lull in drug development. Until the end of 2012, no new tuberculosis drug had come to market in nearly 50 years.Some Companies Are ListeningSome drug companies were quick to dismiss the U.N. report. But others have shown a willingness to compromise. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), for example, announced on Monday that it would offer its pneumonia vaccine at an affordable price to humanitarian organizations serving children affected by humanitarian crises.Pneumonia kills about 1 million children worldwide annually, making it the leading cause of child mortality. GSK will offer the vaccine at about $3 per dose. Doctors Without Borders was previously purchasing the vaccine from Pfizer for $68 a dose. The decision came seven years after Doctors Without Borders launched its pneumonia campaign. The group had been urging both GSK and Pfizer, the only two manufacturers of the pneumonia vaccine, to lower the price.

7,IMPACT,Drug Companies Are Slowly Starting To Care More About Poor People,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pharmaceutical-companies-need-to-start-caring-about-illnesses-that-affect-poor-people_us_57dc1c00e4b0071a6e06f6f7,The industry often doesn't invest in medications and vaccines for people who can’t afford to pay high prices.,2016-09-26,"This illustration released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a group of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae bacteria. The image was based on scanning electron micrographic imagery. In 2016, for only the fourth time in its 70 year history, the United Nations is holding a special meeting devoted to a health issue: This time, on the rise of untreatable infections that is being propelled by the way we over-use and misuse drugs in both people and animals.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The latest global health crisis could claim more lives than cancer if pharmaceutical companies and other groups don’t band together to stop it, according to the World Health Organization.World leaders and health experts convened at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City last week to tackle antimicrobial resistance. In short: bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms are becoming immune to current medicines, which takes a huge toll on the world’s most vulnerable populations. This means we need new medications to tackle illnesses that were previously considered under control.Antibiotic resistance causes at least 700,000 deaths annually. That number is expected to skyrocket to 10 million a year by 2050, Keiji Fukuda, special representative for antimicrobial resistance at WHO, said at the Social Good Summit last week in New York City. “It’s an amazingly broad range of infections. It’s as relevant in Kansas, Asia and Africa,” Fukuda said. “It’s not a theoretical issue we’re waiting for.”An Issue That Affects Global Poor In Particular Advocates are particularly concerned about illnesses that predominantly affect poor and underserved groups. Because pharmaceutical companies are driven by sales potential, they’re not keen on investing in medications and vaccines for people who can’t afford to pay high prices, nonprofit medical group Doctors Without Borders noted in a May report.And even when effective medications and vaccines become available, they often come at a cost-prohibitive price point.Groups like Doctors Without Borders have long been pushing for new vaccines and medications for underserved patients that are also affordable. But the United Nations has now also joined the campaign.A New Call For Transparency And Lower PricesThe U.N.’s High Level Panel on Access To Medicines released a lengthy report calling for changes in funding models for drugs and vaccines.Among its recommendations, the U.N. called for more transparency regarding the costs associated with new drugs. It also wants the industry to separate research and development from a product’s ultimate price. “The core problem is that the current research and development system … is dictated by commercial interests so there are no new medicines for tuberculosis but there are medicines [from which drugs companies] can make a lot of money,” Mohga Kamal-Yanni, senior health policy adviser at Oxfam, told the Guardian.Kamal-Yanni was one of a number of experts who contributed evidence to the U.N. panel, which published the report. Tuberculosis is one of a handful of diseases that health experts are worried about.TB claimed 1.5 million lives in 2014, making it the biggest infectious disease killer in the world. That same year, there were about 480,000 new cases, which were resistant to the two most powerful anti-TB dugs, according to WHO. While TB occurs worldwide, Africa carries the “most severe” burden, which may be why there’s been such a lull in drug development. Until the end of 2012, no new tuberculosis drug had come to market in nearly 50 years.Some Companies Are ListeningSome drug companies were quick to dismiss the U.N. report. But others have shown a willingness to compromise. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), for example, announced on Monday that it would offer its pneumonia vaccine at an affordable price to humanitarian organizations serving children affected by humanitarian crises.Pneumonia kills about 1 million children worldwide annually, making it the leading cause of child mortality. GSK will offer the vaccine at about $3 per dose. Doctors Without Borders was previously purchasing the vaccine from Pfizer for $68 a dose. The decision came seven years after Doctors Without Borders launched its pneumonia campaign. The group had been urging both GSK and Pfizer, the only two manufacturers of the pneumonia vaccine, to lower the price. In April, the aid group delivered a petition with more than 400,000 signatures to both companies. Fukuda noted that outlining the need among vulnerable groups is key to persuading drug companies to take on these cases. “If companies see it’s considered a social good ― it’s a powerful motivator for them,” he said.

On Oct. 2, millions will head to the polls to vote Yes or No on the terms of the agreement.The referendum is an emotional one for Colombians, who have been deeply affected by the conflict’s violence, kidnappings and destabilization of society. The fighting killed over 200,000 people and displaced 6 million people since the FARC took up arms in 1964.The deal itself includes, among other things, the reintegration into society of an estimated 7,000 FARC fighters, wide-ranging reparations for victims of the conflict and the rebels renouncing violence ― as well as their ties to Colombia’s drug trade. Few countries have attempted such an expansive peace agreement, and there are serious questions over how it will be implemented if it passes. But if the country votes No, it may mean a renewal of the violence that has devastated the country for generations.The WorldPost spoke with Abbey Steele, an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam and author of a forthcoming book on Colombia’s civil war, to get an understanding of what the referendum means for the country’s future.How close is the referendum expected to be? The latest polls show that it is likely to pass. The last polls that I’ve seen show that the Yes vote is at 72 percent. It’s a big change from the beginning of August that showed about 50-50.Is there any insight into why that’s shifted?That [August] poll was before the final agreement was reached, so the fact that it was announced may have led to more optimism from the public. It could also be that the bilateral ceasefire is now in place.I think we’re likely to see an even bigger bump after the signing of the agreement on September 26, but there are campaigns underway from both the Yes and No sides to argue for their positions.One aspect of those campaigns is that President Juan Manuel Santos has an extremely poor approval rating. How closely are people associating his presidency with this deal? The No campaign is trying to associate the peace agreement with Santos and to tack it onto his lack of popularity. The Yes vote is explicitly saying this isn’t about any particular person or politician, this is about a chance for peace.My sense is that there are some committed supporters of past President [Álvaro] Uribe, who will continue to associate the plan with Santos and not vote for it no matter what. But they’re in the small minority.What are Colombians’ biggest criticisms of this agreement?The main criticisms coming from the No side are twofold. One is that there’s too much impunity for FARC leaders who have engaged in war crimes or crimes against humanity, and the second component is that the FARC will be able to participate in politics.It is true that there is an amnesty for the rank and file FARC, but it’s not for those who have confessed to or been found guilty of crimes against humanity and war crimes ― they will have to serve some kind of time in prison. The deal phrases it as forgoing their liberties, meaning they won’t be in an actual prison but they will have restricted freedoms. That’s one big criticism.The No campaign phrases it as impunity, and the Yes side’s reaction is that it’s not exactly impunity ― they are going to be held responsible even if you don’t agree with the severity of the punishment. These are transitional justice mechanisms rather than traditional justice mechanisms.In terms of political participation, the No side sort of gives the impression that the political party that the FARC forms will become very powerful in congress and have a lot of leverage over laws that will be passed at the national level. There doesn’t seem to be very much evidence of that as a plausible outcome. The FARC don’t have a lot of political support anymore, but maybe at an earlier period this would have been more of a concern.Part of the deal includes significant reparations for victims of the conflict. Because there are so many victims and so many people who have been displaced, how feasible is that aspect of the agreement? This is really difficult. On the one hand there’s already a law in place that was passed in 2011 that guarantees reparations and restitution for victims. Land restitution if they have been displaced and reparations if they have had family members killed or things like that. The Colombian government has been attempting to already initiate this process for victims of any armed group, including state forces. So, in a sense, they already have experience trying to do this, but that experience has been very slow and quite mixed.Land restitution is extremely difficult partially because it’s very hard to document people’s property before they were displaced. Often the displaced don’t have an official land title or some kind of record to show that they were the lawful owner. We also know that a strategy of some of the illegal armed groups was to have fraudulent titles made through corruption. The FARC are not the only armed group in the country, how might this deal affect other organizations that are not party to the agreement?It’s a good question, and it’s one that Colombia has faced in the past in demobilizing previous militant groups. In 1989, M-19 demobilized. In 1991, the EPL ― which was previously a fairly prominent insurgent group ― decided to demobilize with some smaller insurgent groups as well. What we know following those demobilizations is that at least some of their members joined other existing armed groups. Some of them remained demobilized; some of them rearmed and continued to fight. Some became members of drug trafficking organizations.It’s highly likely that at least some FARC members will join other existing armed groups to continue being combatants. It may improve the ranks, for instance, of the ELN ― which is trying to start talks with the government but it’s unlikely how those will proceed or succeed.The FARC has been linked to control of extensive coca-producing territory, what happens to that drug trade when they demobilize? Certainly as long as there is a demand abroad for cocaine, it will remain a lucrative industry. As long as it’s an illegal industry that’s prohibited by some of Colombia’s allies, Colombia’s hands will be tied in terms of its ability to regulate that economy. If the government can’t regulate it, other actors will and the primary way they regulate that market is through violence. We shouldn’t expect that this peace agreement with the FARC will mean an end to armed groups in the country, because the drug trade is a parallel ongoing situation.The FARC and the peace agreement has committed to eradicating coca in areas where it still has influence as part of its demobilization process, but it’s extremely easy to replant coca. In these areas that have been penetrated by settlers who grow coca, it’s very hard to come up with an alternative that will be anywhere near as lucrative. People will continue to grow it, and new actors will move in to regulate. What might happen if Colombia votes against the agreement? Is there a sense of an alternative or what it would look like beyond that vote?I think the war would start again. Whether that means an immediate escalation to prior levels of violence I certainly hope not, but it would not be good.The idea that they can renegotiate right away and get a better deal doesn’t seem very plausible. That’s sort of the argument of the No campaign ― that they won’t return to war but they’ll renegotiate and get a better deal. I don’t think that’s likely to happen. The FARC and the government have tried to come up with an agreement many times. There have been multiple attempts and they have never gotten this far before.They got this far now because the negotiators themselves were really skilled, and had a lot of knowledge of historical attempts to negotiate. They had a lot of knowledge about what worked in other countries and they were very strategic about how to structure the talks to get things done. They developed relationships with the FARC counterparts over four years. It took a long time at the table, and I think you really can’t discount the level of trust and commitment on both sides to stay at the table and hammer out these details. It’s not an easy thing to do and it shows in Colombian history.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

As Zimbabweans continue to take to the streets to call for reform, female demonstrators have been reporting abuse by police.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e6d3b21a00002d005b4699.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As Zimbabwe cracks down on antigovernment protests, female activists are being caught in clashes with police and sent to prisons with ‘inhumane’ living conditions.When Linda Masarira began the Occupy Africa Unity Square campaign, she probably had no idea she would spend her eight-year-old son’s birthday in one of Zimbabwe’s most notorious maximum security prisons.As a political activist, the widowed mother of five is no stranger to incarceration. Since she first became a public figure in 2015, while protesting a Supreme Court ruling that allows companies to fire employees without compensation, she has been detained several times. But her most recent stay in prison, during which her fellow activists threw a birthday party for her son, has been the longest to date.On July 6, Masarira, 35, was arrested along with 19 other activists for allegedly vandalizing a vendor’s stall during a protest. Since then, her co-accused have all been released on bail, while Masarira remains incarcerated in Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison in Harare. In early September, after a prison officer reportedly threw her lunch on the ground, she organized the female prisoners to protest against alleged abuse by prison staff. In response, she was transferred to solitary confinement, which is located in the men’s section of the prison.The treatment of incarcerated women has entered Zimbabwe’s public consciousness in recent months as pro-democracy protests sweep across the country, leading to bans and mass arrests. Social media campaigns such as #ThisFlag and Tajamuka (“We Have Rebelled”) have spilled onto the streets, as citizens express their anger at the government’s finance policy – including the nonpayment of civil service salaries and the introduction of bond notes – and call for electoral reforms before the 2018 vote. But as thousands continue to gather and march, the state is falling back on methods of repressive policing, allegations and threats, according to a report by the South Africa Institute for Security Studies.After President Robert Mugabe publicly warned demonstrators that “they are playing a dangerous game,” Harare’s chief of police Newbert Saunyama on September 16 issued a one-month ban on the “holding of public demonstrations,” defying a High Court judgment that had declared a previous two-week ban on protests as unconstitutional.The day following Saunyama’s announcement, nationwide protests organized by opposition parties under the National Electoral Reform Agenda umbrella went ahead, resulting in arrests across the country. According to the Tajamuka movement, clashes between protesters and police over the weekend ended in 87 arrests and 125 injuries and assaults nationwide. The movement’s spokesman Promise Mkwananzi says the police used live bullets, water cannons and torture when dealing with demonstrators, both male and female. “They [the police] have total disregard for the dignity of women, as some have been poked in their privates during these clashes,” he said.In response to abuses reported by female protesters, the rights group Justice for Women issued the government with an ultimatum on Tuesday. At a press conference in Harare, the group’s spokeswoman, Coezett Chirinda, accused police of perpetrating acts of “serious physical and psychological abuse” against female demonstrators.The organization went on to issue a statement condemning violence against female protesters. “These women were stripped naked whilst being assaulted and they have ghastly wounds on their bodies,” it said, stating that some women had been transported in a police truck “full of drunken antiriot police officers who took turns to assault them.”Chirinda told the press conference that if the government fails to charge all officers accused of mistreating female activists within a week, the organization’s members will hold a protest naked. In Zimbabwean Shona culture, a woman publicly strips to symbolize her humiliation. “They strip and beat us naked,” she told reporters. “If they want to see our bodies then we are going to march to their offices naked so that they really see us.”Any female protesters who end up in Chikurubi face a stay in a prison that has gained notoriety for widespread human rights violations. Inmates have previously complained of dire living conditions that include open sewage running through the cells and a lack of essentials such as food, toiletries and sanitary pads for women.The prison has also gained a reputation as the detention center of choice for officials looking to silence antigovernment activists. Masarira is not the first female activist to find herself remanded in the same part of the prison that houses men convicted of violent crimes. After they were accused of murdering a police inspector in 2011, Rebecca Mafikeni and Yvonne Musarurwa, both youth leaders for the opposition party The Movement for Democratic Change, were moved to solitary confinement. Two years later, Mafikeni died in custody due to complications from meningitis. The courts had denied numerous applications for private medical assistance on her behalf. Musarurwa was released on bail in 2014, before being found guilty of murder and returned to Chikurubi, among the general female population, to await sentencing. She maintains her innocence.Thelma Chikwanha, spokeswoman for the nonprofit Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, says the organization is currently representing three women in Harare who were arrested and assaulted during the protests over the weekend. “The clashes between police and protesters usually turn violent,” she says, adding that some of the women who were arrested were beaten with batons.For Masarira, her time in solitary confinement – which is staffed by female guards – has been a chance to reflect on the escalating tensions between activists and police. Jacob Mafume, spokesman for the opposition Zimbabwe People’s Party, says that when he visited Masarira on September 20, she told him she was better off in solitary. “She stated that if she went back to the [women’s] section, she would not be able to be silent about abuses and beatings that go on [there],” he says.This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

10,THE WORLDPOST,Women In Jordan More Vulnerable To Effects Of Extremism: Report,"Flora Bagenal, Women & Girls Hub",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jordanian-women-vulnerable-to-effects-of-extremism_us_57e6d52ee4b0e28b2b54526c,"As Jordan struggles with rising extremism, a new U.N. report suggests women are much more vulnerable than men to the effects",2016-09-26,"Speaking to researchers for a U.N.

Over 635,000 Syrian refugees have settled in Jordan since the conflict started, putting enormous strain on its resources and infrastructure.Jordan is also the third-largest contributor of fighters to ISIS, the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, after Tunisia and Saudi Arabia, and the country has seen a significant rise in support for the group back home. In early 2015, researchers estimated ISIS and other jihadi groups had about 9,000 to 10,000 Jordanian supporters.As in many other countries facing the threat of radicalization, Jordan’s government has announced plans to tackle violent ideology, putting in place increased security measures and launching a nationwide counter-extremism project that targets radical preachers and young men thought to be at risk of indoctrination.But research published by U.N. Women in July suggests women could be equally or even more affected by radicalization than men in Jordan, both as victims and perpetrators. The report, based on 47 interviews and focus-group discussions with a cross-section of Jordanian society, calls for more research into the role of women in radicalization. It says much more needs to be done to include them in counter-extremism work.“People of all different beliefs overwhelmingly said that while men get radicalized, women are more at risk of the effects of radicalization,” says Rachel Dore-Weeks, a peacebuilding expert for U.N. Women in Jordan who coordinated the research. The effects include a rise in violence at home, increased restrictions on women’s movements and a greater risk of being coerced into sharing or spreading radicalized views.Dore-Weeks says 87 percent of those surveyed said women are at risk of suffering the effects of radicalization, with 71 percent saying women face a bigger risk than men. Until now radicalization has been framed much more in terms of the security implications and the risk it poses to young men, rather than the wider effect it can have on communities in general.“People said when they had experienced living in communities where there was a rise in radicalization, either via people in Jordan or people going to fight in Syria and Iraq and coming home, they saw those communities getting much more conservative and much more insular,” says Dore-Weeks. “As a result, where women had been eking out freedoms and breaking gender norms little by little, they were really pushed back.”In cases where fighters have returned from the front line, respondents reported a rise in incidents of domestic abuse at home and said women could be banned from leaving the house, taking public transport or voicing opinions in public.It was also reported that when young men or women become radicalized, their mothers are often blamed by society and feel more responsible for their children’s behavior, putting them under more pressure from their communities.Several women interviewed for the report admitted they feared they could be unwittingly pushing their children to become radicalized. “I always encourage my son to pray, because I believe … religion makes you able to differentiate right from wrong,” one unnamed woman said. “However, even though I respect being religiously committed, lately my son has been taking things a bit too far.” The woman told researchers she saw changes in her son’s behavior, including a new, more extremist attitude toward his sisters, that made her think he might be joining ISIS.While researchers for the report were unable to speak to women who had been radicalized themselves, several respondents reported knowing women who had been radicalized or targeted by extremists. Often, they said, women were recruited because of their role as “influencers” in the home. While some reported women being targeted online, others said women could be targeted at female-only religious study groups.The reasons respondents gave for women potentially becoming radicalized were similar to those for men, including financial pressures, lack of prospects, and religious conviction. It was also said women could be persuaded to join ISIS or other radical groups as a way to escape domestic abuse or because of a divorce or other difficult situation at home.Nikita Malik, head of research at the U.K.-based counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, (which was not involved in the report) says counter-radicalization experts have in the past overlooked how important women are to groups like ISIS, reducing their role to that of wife or mother when, in fact, they are highly valuable to recruiters.“Islamic extremist groups like ISIS are effective because they are made up of a web of networks and women play a key role in that network,” she says, adding that women are needed to bring up children already indoctrinated into the group, to communicate messages within the community, and to uphold a sense of sisterhood, adding legitimacy to the idea of an Islamic caliphate.Malik says understanding this is key to involving women in de-radicalization work. “In Jordan, we need to see women deployed more as agents of change,” she says. “When a young person is at risk of being radicalized, they won’t turn to an M.P. or an academic – they will turn to a neighbor or a mother or a friend.“We have to train this level of potentially powerful women to enact de-radicalization.”Some of that work is already underway, triggered by the U.N. Women report, including a pilot project in universities to create safe spaces for young men and women to talk about radicalization and voice concerns about people they know.U.N. Women is also in talks with the Jordanian government about approaching female imams to work with the community on countering violent extremism.And Dore-Weeks says the organization hopes to carry out more detailed research on what drives both men and women into the arms of extremists.“It’s much more complex than saying it is angry young men who don’t have jobs,” she says. “For the most part it appears to be middle-class people who are being targeted or traveling to [Syria and Iraq] to fight. For them, it is about ideology, it is about fighting a sense of injustice.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

While some reported women being targeted online, others said women could be targeted at female-only religious study groups.The reasons respondents gave for women potentially becoming radicalized were similar to those for men, including financial pressures, lack of prospects, and religious conviction. It was also said women could be persuaded to join ISIS or other radical groups as a way to escape domestic abuse or because of a divorce or other difficult situation at home.Nikita Malik, head of research at the U.K.-based counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, (which was not involved in the report) says counter-radicalization experts have in the past overlooked how important women are to groups like ISIS, reducing their role to that of wife or mother when, in fact, they are highly valuable to recruiters.“Islamic extremist groups like ISIS are effective because they are made up of a web of networks and women play a key role in that network,” she says, adding that women are needed to bring up children already indoctrinated into the group, to communicate messages within the community, and to uphold a sense of sisterhood, adding legitimacy to the idea of an Islamic caliphate.Malik says understanding this is key to involving women in de-radicalization work. “In Jordan, we need to see women deployed more as agents of change,” she says. “When a young person is at risk of being radicalized, they won’t turn to an M.P. or an academic – they will turn to a neighbor or a mother or a friend.“We have to train this level of potentially powerful women to enact de-radicalization.”Some of that work is already underway, triggered by the U.N. Women report, including a pilot project in universities to create safe spaces for young men and women to talk about radicalization and voice concerns about people they know.U.N. Women is also in talks with the Jordanian government about approaching female imams to work with the community on countering violent extremism.And Dore-Weeks says the organization hopes to carry out more detailed research on what drives both men and women into the arms of extremists.“It’s much more complex than saying it is angry young men who don’t have jobs,” she says. “For the most part it appears to be middle-class people who are being targeted or traveling to [Syria and Iraq] to fight. For them, it is about ideology, it is about fighting a sense of injustice.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

Macy in the lead role as Frank Gallagher, returns with its seventh season on Sunday. And if the way Season 6 left off is any indication, fans can expect a bit of a bumpy ride in upcoming episodes. “At the end of last season, they tossed me off the bridge because they were pissed off about something,” Macy told The Huffington Post at Showtime’s Emmys Eve party this month. “Apparently, I floated all the way up to Lake Michigan when they pulled me up, and I was in a coma for a good long time. And I think they are going to start this season with an underwater ballet. I’m not kidding! I’ve seen a little bit of it and it’s pretty stunning. It’s funny and beautiful. It’s grotesque, that’s what it is … It’s beautiful and ugly at the same time.”  “Shameless,” which takes place in Chicago and co-stars Steve Howey, Emma Kenney and Emmy Rossum, premiered in 2011 and has been going strong ever since. Macy plays the troubled father of six children, and the series chronicles the highs and lows as he battles alcoholism, drug issues and the struggle of navigating life itself. When asked why the show has resonated so much, Macy said it’s partially because of great characters. “At the end of the day, it’s about family. They love each other. They’ll get each other’s backs. They’re striving to do better, to succeed,” he said. “It’s thrilling that they’re one paycheck away from being homeless. They’ve got a great sense of humor.” “I think Chicago is a big player [too],” Macy added, “and it’s genuinely conceived. It’s easy for the writers to go off in different directions.” “Shameless” airs Sunday nights at 9 p.m. ET on Showtime. "

After wrapping up “NBC Nightly News” on Tuesday night, Holt headed west to a rooftop lounge where colleagues were celebrating the 25th anniversary of “Dateline,” the weekly newsmagazine he also anchors. “I like the idea of being 25 again,” he joked with partygoers before jumping on bass for a few songs with his band, the 30 Rockers. The cocktail-sipping crowd, which included NBC News chief Andy Lack and network stars like Chuck Todd and Andrea Mitchell, requested, and received, an encore.The veteran journalist takes on a much tougher gig Monday night, when he moderates the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and the massive audience at home won’t be as forgiving. The highly anticipated faceoff is expected to rival some of the biggest moments in television history and presumably top the 67 million viewers who tuned in for the first 2012 debate between President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney. Television anchors seek out the biggest stage possible, and moderating a presidential debate brings prestige. But along with it comes intense pressure that’s only been heightened this election cycle by Trump’s persistent criticism of the “rigged” process and a debate over whether it’s the moderator’s role to fact-check the candidates’ misstatements or outright lies. The Clinton team understandably wants Holt to intervene, given the unprecedented frequency and brazenness of her rival’s falsehoods. Trump recently made 87 erroneous statements over a five-day stretch. “All that we’re asking is that if Donald Trump lies, that it’s pointed out,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said later on the same program that moderators shouldn’t be “virtual fact-checkers.”Into this highly charged atmosphere steps the 57-year-old newsman, a seemingly unflappable presence on the air for decades, who’ll face intense scrutiny. Holt may not be the most widely known TV news star, but he’s highly regarded inside NBC as a steady hand behind the anchor desk who can go for long stretches of time during major news events. It’s how he earned the nickname “Iron Pants.” After anchoring the local news in Chicago for 14 years, Holt went national with MSNBC in 2000 and became a go-to anchor during rolling news events such as the Florida recount and Iraq War. His portfolio continued to grow after shifting to the broadcast network in 2003, eventually becoming weekend anchor for “NBC Nightly News,” co-anchor for “Weekend Today” and “Dateline” anchor. In February 2015, Holt stepped behind the “NBC Nightly News” anchor desk as the network was embroiled in scandal over Brian Williams’ false claim about coming under fire in Iraq and other alleged exploits. NBC officially handed Holt the reins, a promotion which made him the first African-American journalist to solo anchor a broadcast network evening newscast. “We are not unaware that there are a lot of eyeballs on us right now, and there will be,” Holt said at the time. “We are going to try to deliver every day.”Holt will not only face a lot more eyeballs during the debate than he does on the “Nightly News,” which averages nearly 9 million viewers a night. He’ll also face Trump, a candidate who has waged an unprecedented attack on the press and has repeatedly suggested he won’t be treated fairly. Trump’s pre-emptive complaints have been seen as a classic attempt to “work the refs” ― to influence the moderators, consciously or subconsciously, to go easier on him for fear of being perceived as biased.While Trump described Holt as “a good guy” weeks before he was selected as moderator, the Republican presidential nominee has since been sowing doubts about the journalist’s ability to be fair ahead of Monday’s debate. “Look, it’s a phony system. Lester is a Democrat,” Trump said on Fox News, his preferred network. “I mean, they are all Democrats. Okay? It’s a very unfair system.” Holt is actually a registered Republican. Trump’s willingness to routinely make such false claims presents a challenge for Holt, who will surely be criticized if he allows outright lies to go unchallenged. Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, moderator for the third Clinton-Trump contest, sparked controversy earlier this month by saying he doesn’t view his role as a “truth squad” and expects the candidates to fact-check one another. Days later, during a widely panned performance moderating a presidential forum, NBC “Today” show host Matt Lauer failed to challenge Trump’s lie about immediately opposing the Iraq invasion. Holt hasn’t said where he stands on the fact-checking issue ― or anything about his debate plans. An NBC spokesman who accompanied Holt during Tuesday night’s event said the moderator wasn’t commenting in advance. NBC sources told CNN’s Brian Stelter that Holt won’t be a “potted plant” during the 90-minute debate, and can be expected to set the record straight if necessary. The network declined to make anyone available to comment on Holt’s preparations. But the topic has come up on air. Todd, who serves as NBC political director and host of “Meet the Press,” stressed last week on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that the focus should remain on the candidates, not the moderator, during a discussion about fact-checking. “Good grief, leave the man alone,” Todd said. “It’s about Trump and Clinton at the end of the day, not about any of the moderators,” he continued. “If the moderators are the story after the debate, that’s a disservice. That’s either the candidates or the campaigns wanting to deflect on bad performances or whatever. We can’t take our eyes off the two candidates.”“Of course, of course,” co-host Joe Scarborough responded. “I’m just saying, though, nobody’s really moderated a wrestling match.” CORRECTION: This story previously stated that Lester Holt was the first African-American to anchor a broadcast network evening newscast.

Most nations maintain embassies in Tel Aviv.Palestinians want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in a 1967 war, as capital of the state they aim to establish alongside Israel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.During the closed-door meeting, the campaign said that Trump agreed with Netanyahu that peace in the Middle East could only be achieved when “the Palestinians renounce hatred and violence and accept Israel as a Jewish State.”According to a readout of the meeting from the campaign, the two discussed “at length” Israel’s border fence, cited by Trump in reference to his own controversial immigration policies, which include building a wall on the U.S.- Mexico border and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country.Other regional issues, including the fight against Islamic State, U.S. military assistance to Israel ― “an excellent investment” ― and the Iran nuclear deal, which both parties have criticized, were also discussed.(Reporting by Alana Wise; Editing by Bill Trott and Sandra Maler)"

But Donald Trump has exploded conventional thinking from the beginning, and the debate at Hofstra University will be no different. This one will matter.As Trump would say, it’s “huge.” The 90-minute event, starting Monday at 9 p.m. Eastern time, will be a pivotal moment in the race, with a U.S. audience of perhaps 100 million. It also will be much more: a crucial test of whether America can remain, as Abraham Lincoln said, “the last best hope of earth.” That, in turn, makes it an important 90 minutes for the world.Americans like to believe ― and have reason to believe ― that they are a force for freedom and dignity. They think they invented modern concepts of human rights, self-determination and representative government in the 18th century; that they won the fight against totalitarianism in World War II and the Cold War in the 20th; that they and others have tried to spread a humane democratic capitalism in the 21st.So what is the world to make of a “last best hope of earth” that is now tempted ― seriously tempted ― to turn its destiny over to a vain, ethically challenged real estate developer and TV star?Here is a man who is proud of his ignorance, untethered to truth, bereft of government experience, cynical about the law, dismissive of longtime allies in NATO and East Asia, admiring of world dictators, prone to racist remarks, allied with ultra-conservative grassroots groups and as bellicose as a street boxer.Having defeated totalitarianism and communism, will the U.S. now validate a xenophobic, racist personality cult driven by fame and social media?Will there be an American “strongman?”It’s a global trend, after all, led by the likes of Vladimir Putin in Russia, Xi Jinping in China, Narendra Modi in India and a host of lesser dictatorial figures, among them Kim Jong Un in North Korea, Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines and Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. In what has become a close race with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, the same trait that made Trump attractive to agitated and suspicious Republicans is now holding him back: his reckless willingness to unleash the racial and ethnic fears that flow like a poisoned river through the American landscape.The debate is Trump’s last best chance to alter that image for the 8 to 10 percent of voters who call themselves undecided. It’s not impossible.Cunning and adaptable ― a master of using media to sell his “brand,” which is himself ― Trump is capable of acting “presidential.” Expectations for Trump are so low that if he remains calm and reasonable, and demonstrates even a morsel of knowledge about the issues, he’ll be judged the winner by those in the media who see the contest as a mere horserace. If Trump behaves disruptively on purpose, loses his cool, overdoes his attacks on Clinton (the first woman to head a major ticket), lies even more conspicuously than he has so far, or displays a particularly abject lack of knowledge ― his chances, one would think, will diminish.There are two more debates after Monday, but interest and audience ― and impact ― tend to fade after the first one. How did we get to this place, with a strongman having a chance to kick in the door?Americans voters are in a particularly gloomy mood, for one, saying by a 2-to-1 margin that the country is “on the wrong track.” And no wonder. For the past two years, in parallel with the presidential campaign, the American news media has been full of stories of mass death and social division: deadly attacks by ISIS-inspired terrorists, police shootings of unarmed African-Americans; Black Lives Matter demonstrations from coast to coast. Economic inequality has grown worse. Trump has stoked resentment about it ― while offering a tax proposal that would give even more tax breaks to the richest Americans. Voters don’t like their choices this election; indeed, Trump and Clinton are two of the least popular nominees to face each other in modern times. The corrosive political atmosphere favors anger over the appeal of experience ― in other words, it favors Trump over Clinton.Trump’s “America First” mantra is alluring in a country where the resentment of “others” and disdain for the world ― immigrants, economic competitors, “nation building” ― is rampant.The parties are also becoming ever more divided in demographic terms. Trump’s supporters are overwhelmingly male and white in a country where the electorate remains about 70 percent white. Clinton is drawing more than 95 percent support among blacks, more than 80 percent among Latinos and strong support from educated Americans.Analysts doubt whether Trump can muster the on-the-ground organization to turn out a massive enough “white vote” to win. Conversely, analysts wonder whether Clinton can generate enough excitement among younger voters.But it’s hard for the party that controls the White House for two terms to win a third election in a row. That’s happened only once since World War II, in 1988, when Vice President George H.W. Bush succeeded Ronald Reagan by defeating Democrat Mike Dukakis.The elder Bush announced this week that he is voting for Clinton. The former president’s finest moment was mustering an international coalition to kick former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait ― and then resisting the temptation to invade Iraq and remove him.Bush, in other words, had no interest in ousting a strongman by becoming one.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

On Wednesday, the actor shared another post on the social media site, telling followers that he had partnered with Madelon “Blue” McCullough from #Missing24, which seems to be a Twitter account supporting Washington’s cause. On the social media site, #Missing24 is described as “a grassroots movement for our people by our people.” “Our goal is to maintain the safety of our people, while significantly impacting America’s broken judicial system that is oppressing us by removing our labor, our bodies and our money from it ... for 24 hours,” he wrote. On Sunday, the actor posted a response to an interview request from Hazel Pfeifer of CNN, saying he would not speak to media “until the People of America give me a ‘reason’ to.” The Huffington Post also reached out to a representative for Washington, but received no comment. People on Twitter have been tweeting with the hashtags #StayAtHomeSeptember262016 and #Missing24 to show their support for Washington’s protest, but until Monday, it’s impossible to predict how many will participate."

25,POLITICS,"Obama's Marine Monuments Are Good, But Ignore Important Coastal Seas","Richard Steiner, ContributorProfessor, conservation biologist (www.oasis-earth.com)",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamas-marine-monuments-are-good-but-ignore-important_us_57e742b9e4b05d3737be5f5d,Mr. Obama must designate marine monuments in continental shelf waters.,2016-09-25,"U.S. President Barack Obama pays his respects at a memorial to the Battle of Midway monument during a visit to the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, Midway Atoll, U.S. September 1, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e9422d1700002a00ac72ea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While kudos are due President Obama for his recent Marine National Monument designations in the Pacific and off New England, it is significant that these actions mostly protect remote, deep-water areas where there is little human use, little threat, and little political opposition. Conspicuously absent from the monument designations (so far) are shallower waters over continental shelves, where the greatest biological productivity, human use, and ecosystem degradation occur.In the final months of his administration, Mr. Obama needs to correct this spectacular omission by designating additional monuments in ecologically sensitive continental shelf waters, including Alaska, and negotiate an agreement with other Arctic nations for a High Arctic Marine Sanctuary.The five existing Marine National Monuments (MNMs) in U.S. waters include the following:Papahanaumoukuakea MNM, in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, established in 2006 by Pres. G. W. Bush, expanded from 139,737 mi2 to 582,578 mi2 in Aug. 2016 by Pres. Obama, encompassing all waters surrounding the islands out to the 200-mile limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The monument expansion makes this one of the largest marine protected areas in the world, while only displacing an estimated 5 percent of commercial fishing (mostly pelagic long lining) in the broader region.Pacific Remote Islands MNM, established by Pres. Bush in Jan. 2009, and expanded (to 200 miles offshore) by Pres. Obama in 2014 from 86,888 mi2 to 370,000 mi2, including remote tropical islands and waters of Wake, Baker, Jarvis, Howland, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, and Palmyra Atoll.Marianas Trench MNM, established Jan. 2009, covers 96,714 mi2, including the islands, trench, and volcanic units in the Northern Mariana Islands. The monument includes the deepest point in the world ocean ― the Challenger Deep - at 36,070 feet deep.Rose Atoll MNM, established Jan. 2009, a pristine coral atoll and offshore waters covering 13,436 mi2 in American Samoa.Northeast Canyons and Seamounts MNM, established Sept. 2016, covering 4,913 mi2, including four seamounts and three deep-sea canyons, 130 miles off the coast of New England ― the first marine monument in the Atlantic.As our most restrictive marine protected area designation, Marine National Monuments generally prohibit commercial fishing, offshore drilling, deep-sea mining, and other harmful industrial activities.In contrast with marine monuments, National Marine Sanctuaries are generally closer to shore, but are less protective and accommodate multiple uses. The thirteen existing National Marine Sanctuaries ― seven along the Pacific coast, three in the Northeast and Great Lakes, and three in the Southeast ― cover a total area of approximately 170,000 mi2.Although there was much excitement in the marine conservation community in 2014 when, for the first time in decades, the federal government reopened the marine sanctuary nomination process, results to date have fallen far short of expectations. Of the six nominations so far, two (in freshwater) were approved ― Lake Michigan (WI), Mallows Bay in the Potomac River (MD); two are in consideration - Chumash Heritage (CA), and Lake Erie Quadrangle (PA); one ― Eubalaena Oculina (FL, northeast Atlantic coast) ― was withdrawn; and the largest sanctuary nomination to date ― the 554,000 mi2 of federal waters surrounding the Aleutian Islands off Alaska - was declined due to lack of local political support.Mr. Obama is to be commended for the marine monuments and sanctuaries he has designated and expanded, but it is troubling that he has failed to address the most urgent marine conservation challenge in the nation ― productive, heavily exploited and declining coastal ecosystems on continental shelves.One important ocean area Obama has all but ignored, and must protect before leaving office, is the extraordinary offshore region of Alaska.Alaska’s seas and coasts are globally unique for their diversity, expanse, abundance of fish and wildlife, as well as their historical, cultural and economic importance. Half of the nation’s entire shoreline and three-fourths of our total continental shelf are in Alaska. Alaska’s 200-mile EEZ is more than twice the size of the state’s land area, and this vast ocean system supports the most abundant populations of fish, shellfish, seabirds and marine mammals in the nation, and some of the largest in the world.But these extraordinary marine ecosystems are in decline, primarily due to overharvest, marine environmental changes, and climate change. Most of Alaska’s threatened and endangered species are marine animals, and many seabird and marine mammal populations are in serious decline - the result, many scientists suspect, of excessive commercial harvests of certain fish and marine mammal populations, in combination with changes in the ocean environment. Management by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the industry-led North Pacific Fishery Management Council has failed to slow or reverse Alaska’s marine ecological decline.Logically, Alaska should be at the top of the administration’s shortlist for marine monument designation. However, due to strong political opposition in Alaska to any federal protections, to date there is not one square mile of permanently protected offshore federal waters in Alaska. This is a national disgrace, and Obama knows it.Alaska’s offshore ecosystems clearly deserve permanent federal protections, yet so far, Mr. Obama has cowered from this challenge. Other than enacting a few limited withdrawals from offshore oil leasing in Alaska, which could be reversed by a future administration, the Obama administration has been virtually indistinguishable from the Bush administration in managing Alaska’s offshore waters.Both Obama and Bush have picked low-hanging fruit by protecting remote areas with little human use, threat or political opposition. This boosts the total square miles in protected status, is politically easy, and looks good on the conservation scoreboard, but this simplistic approach misses the more critical conservation challenges in productive, heavily exploited near shore waters on continental shelves. The nation deserves better.Had President Carter cowered in the face of local political opposition to his proposed federal land protections in Alaska decades ago, he wouldn’t have succeeded in enacting the most significant land conservation deal in U.S history ― the 1980 Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act (ANILCA), which established 157 million acres of new national parks, monuments, preserves, and refuges on Alaska lands.Similarly today, many industrial interests that have long-profited from Alaska’s offshore waters reflexively resist any proposals for permanent federal ocean protection. But these federal waters are co-owned and co-managed on behalf of all Americans, and their protection is clearly in the national interest. We now need Pres. Obama to be bold, and summon the same wisdom, courage, and transcendent national spirit as Pres. Carter did decades ago, and finish the ocean protection job he has started.In his final months in office, Mr. Obama must make the right, yet politically difficult, decision to designate marine monuments in continental shelf waters. This should include at least three marine monuments in Alaska ― the Aleutian Islands (as previously nominated for sanctuary designation), Bering Strait, and the Arctic Coast. In addition, he should work to secure an agreement with other Arctic nations to establish a High Arctic Marine Sanctuary in international waters surrounding the North Pole.Short of this, Mr. Obama’s ocean legacy grade will at best be an “I,” for “Incomplete.”"
26,POLITICS,"Trump Flies With Gold-Plated Bathroom Fixtures, And You’re Paying Millions For It",S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-luxury-jet_us_57e6bc0ee4b08d73b8319f15,Secret Service payments to fly on his luxury 757 made up nearly 80 percent of the flight costs this summer.,2016-09-25,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump insists on flying aboard his luxury jet, rather than a more practical airplane. The cost to taxpayers: millions of dollars.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – Taxpayers are now picking up most of Donald Trump’s air travel costs, unnecessarily spending millions of dollars because he insists on flying aboard his luxury 757 instead of a practical plane.And because the GOP presidential nominee owns both the company that owns the jetliner and the one that operates it, some percentage of that taxpayer money is likely winding up as profit in Trump’s personal bank account.The bombastic businessman has often bragged about the comforts of his ride, with its full bedroom, shower and 24-karat gold-plated bathroom fixtures. But because it seats so few passengers, Trump’s Secret Service agents appear to make up more than half of the plane’s flight manifests. And that means taxpayers are now legally required to pick up the majority of its staggering running costs.Over the first three months of this year, after Trump asked for and received Secret Service protection, the agency’s payments to his campaign accounted for 48 percent of the $1.7 million that it paid Tag Air Inc., the candidate’s company that operates the aging jet.Over June, July and August, as Trump became the GOP nominee and his security detail grew, the agency’s payments to the campaign made up 78 percent of the $1.3 million that it paid to Tag Air, according to The Huffington Post’s review of Federal Election Commission filings.Politico, which first reported these payments, put the total the Secret Service paid to the Trump campaign at $1.6 million. But a closer look at campaign finance filings shows that the U.S. Secret Service covered more than $2.3 million of the $3.8 million Trump’s campaign has paid Tag Air in 2016.That figure is on pace to top $3 million by Election Day on Nov. 8 – a total that would be nearly double what taxpayers spent to fly Secret Service agents around with 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney.The difference: Romney did what every other non-incumbent presidential candidate has done in recent history and chartered an airliner on which staff, Secret Service and the traveling press corps all flew together, thereby driving down the cost for everyone.“It’s eye-opening, I guess,” said Bob Biersack, who spent three decades at the FEC before joining the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. “Part of the Trump phenomenon.”Biersack said the payments do not appear to be illegal and that the former reality TV show host was not likely to care about appearances. He pointed to the many tax breaks Trump’s businesses have aggressively sought over the years. “This is not the first time he’s used government assets to his own advantage, right?” he added.Both the Secret Service and the FEC said election regulations do not allow any leeway for how the agency is to reimburse campaigns for travel. Trump’s campaign did not respond to queries from HuffPost about the matter.The $2.3 million the Secret Service spent to fly with Trump is only slightly less than the $2.6 million the agency has paid to the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ― even though she has had the agency’s protection for twice as long as her Republican opponent.Clinton, as the spouse of a former president, has had Secret Service protection since the start of her campaign in April 2015, whereas Trump asked for and received protection late last year. What’s more, some of the agency’s payments to the former secretary of state’s campaign cover travel with former President Bill Clinton when he has been on the campaign trail.The Democratic candidate chartered a 737 that carries Clinton, her traveling staff, Secret Service detail and the traveling press corps in the past month, which should hold down the agency’s travel costs with her for the final two months of the campaign.The last Republican candidate did the same thing in the final months of 2012. Romney’s chartered McDonnell-Douglas MD-83 was only seven feet shorter than Trump’s Boeing 757, but was configured essentially like a standard airliner and could carry some 150 passengers, even with a more spacious first-class section for Romney and his top staff.In contrast, Trump’s 757, which he purchased from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 2011, boasts a lounge with a 57-inch television and home theater sound, a master bedroom appointed with silk wall coverings and a guest room with a mohair couch that converts to a bed. It can, however, only seat 43 people and it appears not to carry even that many on the campaign trail, based on the number aboard recent flights.On a brief flight this month on which Trump invited a small group of reporters aboard, there were only about 20 passengers, not counting the crew. Nearly half appeared to be Secret Service agents.FEC rules require that Secret Service agents pay a “pro-rata share of the travel” to the campaign. So if agents on any given leg make up three quarters of the passengers, the U.S. Government is required to pay three quarters of the cost to fly Trump’s luxury liner.What that figure is precisely for a given amount of time is known by the Trump campaign, but cannot be determined through the few public documents on file that describe Tag Air.However, a 757-200 similar to Trump’s can be chartered for about $13,000 per hour. Based on fuel consumption rates for that plane, as much as $8,000 of that is burned each hour in the air, more if the trip is a series of short hops. Maintenance, food, landing fees and crew salaries add many hundreds of dollars more per hour.How much the plane generates in profit for Trump after subtracting these costs might be deduced from his tax returns, but he has refused to release those. Trump said he is under IRS audit and that his lawyers have told him it would be unwise to release the returns until this is finished.And as pricey as his plane is to fly, he makes his travel even more expensive by insisting on returning to New York City at the end of each day so he can sleep in his own bed in Trump Tower’s penthouse. Flying home, rather than overnighting in the next city on the campaign schedule, typically adds three to four hours of flying time per day, translating to $27,000 to $36,000 per day in higher flight costs.Those higher costs, though, are being borne in large measure by taxpayers, particularly since the expansion of Trump’s Secret Service detail upon his officially winning the nomination.Trump paid Tag Air $2.1 million to fly his plane around to campaign events in 2015. The money came from the checks he was writing to fund his campaign, as well as from the sale of “Make America Great Again” hats and other campaign souvenirs. Not a dime came from taxpayers.This year has been a completely different story, first with the availability of Secret Service payments to defray his travel costs, and then with a flood of donor money following his signing of a joint fundraising deal with the Republican National Committee in May.Trump’s use of Republican donors’ money at his own businesses since he signed that deal has been previously documented by news outlets including HuffPost. He sent his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach a check for $423,000 the very day the fundraising agreement was signed. In all, some $600,000 flowed from the Trump campaign to Trump properties that day.He also increased the rent that his campaign pays at Trump Tower by a factor of five after signing the RNC deal, from $35,458 in April to $169,758 by July. That higher rent translates to a per-square-foot cost several times higher than what the Clinton campaign pays for its headquarters in Brooklyn.This lavish spending, though, came at the expense of donors who willingly gave money to Trump. The Secret Service payments to fly on Trump’s glitzy but inefficient plane hit taxpayers, potentially creating problems for him if public anger translates into a drop in support, the Center for Responsive Politics’ Biersack said.“The issue is that he’s chosen that particular plane,” Biersack said, adding that FEC commissioners likely never contemplated that a candidate would choose such an extravagant mode of transportation. Nor did anyone guess that taxpayers could wind up on the hook if it did happen, Biersack added. “It was never anticipated that the proportion of campaign travelers would be so heavily tilted toward federal officials.”“This is a public perception thing,” he continued. “At some point, people will begin to say, ‘Wait a minute: this is ridiculous.’”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Media outlets like the Huffington Post publish blogs and articles about women’s daily experiences of body shaming and insecurities that result from societal pressures. Expectations of what women “should” look like are certainly changing. Whether they’re evolving is an entirely different matter, as this depends on subjective ideas of what “progressive” and “evolving” mean. Embracing curvier and more “festively plump” (my preferred word choice for “larger”) images of women can be empowering. It can be a point of strength to look at society and give it the proverbial middle finger, telling it that it does not get to dictate what women’s bodies should look like. The same applies for women who struggle with other beauty “ideals” that impinge on their disabilities, natural body types, and hair types, too. There’s a wide body of literature on how women of African descent interact with white-washed beauty ideals on skin tone and hair texture. These beauty ideals impact work environments where Black women are often told that their natural hair and hairstyles are “not professional” – that only sleek, straight hair is desirable to clients and patients, and attracts business. Lately, women have been confident enough to turn things around, post images of themselves in their “natural form” – whether it is larger, smaller, darker, lighter, coarser, or finer. We now face a virtual world that relies heavily on imagery. With Youtube, Snapchat, Instagram and other social media outlets, images dominate the discussion on body image, especially women’s body image. But does confidence with one’s body image necessarily mean putting it out there on the internet for people to see? Does “body-love”, a concept seemingly introduced recently, rely on presenting ourselves physically for others to accept? Do women’s images need to “go viral” in order to make a point about the way we understand and perceive beauty? …… Enter the hijab, niqab, burkinis, or what have you that many (albeit not all) Muslim women wear. From an Islamic perspective, as well as a Jewish-Orthodox, Sikh (etc) perspective, women prefer to practice “modesty”. Modesty can be defined in many ways, as it relies on an element of subjectivity. What defines modesty? This is a discussion taking place also on the same media outlets mentioned above. Muslim women present their ideas of what beauty and positive body image means. This is particularly revealing in light of the latest efforts to police and criminalize Muslim women’s bodies. In countries like France, Germany, Spain, and even Canada, Muslim women’s bodies have been politicized to fit an anti-Islam narrative. Post 9/11, and especially post Paris-attacks, Muslim women’s wardrobes have suddenly become everyone else’s business. They have become an object of fascination and obsession. France, which claims to be secular, is more obsessed than ever with religion – with women of a certain religion. Canada’s own former Prime Minister reduced his entire political campaign to whether a Muslim woman should be able to wear the niqab in a citizenship ceremony, despite the Supreme Court ruling to her favour, citing basic constitutional and charter rights. More recently, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, bases his new political campaign on a promise to ban the burkini nation-wide. It’s remarkable how women’s bodies – especially Muslim women’s bodies – have become such a point of obsession by men on the highest levels of government. But this should come as no surprise. As is common knowledge, and as history continues to remind us, men have always obsessed over women’s bodies. Women’s bodies give life and pleasure, and have often been regulated, policed, and criminalized. Several American states, as well as other countries, ban abortion and imprison women for performing it, even for miscarriage. Contraception is inaccessible to women. Rape laws protect rapists rather than survivors. If we were here to discuss all the ways in which women’s bodies have been the subject of obsession and policing, we’d be here forever. But let me return to an earlier point regarding the presentation of our bodies on social and other media to further our perspectives. For the first time, New York Fashion week presented a fashion line by a Muslim designer. Women in hijab strutted down the NY Fashion Week’s catwalk to many observers’ applause. Olympic and Paralympic Muslim athletes’ images have decorated the internet. Weeks later, a Muslim woman and decorated marathoner in hijab graced the cover of a US fitness magazine. At around the same time, a Muslim woman in hijab posed for a Playboy cover. To this latest development, there has been a strong reaction from the Muslim community – both positive and negative. The woman who posed for Playboy in her hijab claims to use this medium for self-expression and to challenge stereotypes of Muslim women. She claims to represent Muslim women by pushing the envelope and daring greatly to do so on Playboy Magazine, which she and a few others argue is changing its format. But here’s the thing: Playboy magazine, like many others, has been branded to capitalize on women’s objectification and subjugation. For decades, it has been proudly branded to capitalize on women’s hyper-sexualization. Even as it claims to be changing format, Playboy has openly admitted to doing so as a result of tough competition from porn-providers on the internet for free and cheap. The magazine’s recent efforts to supposedly reformat are not in response to a change of heart and perspective of women in general. If anything, it may even be seen as a response to a recent trend in the porn industry – a trend that fetishizes the hijab. As recent porn films show, women of colour in head scarves “serve” and pleasure White men. This image invokes a long and rich colonial history that hyper-sexualizes the “exotic other”. The “exotic other” has included Muslim, Black, Latina, and First Nations women. We deal with the remnants of this long history that hyper-sexualizes our bodies till this day. Over-looking that history by posing for Playboy magazine, considering recent trends in the porn industry, is a failure to examine social culture. Claiming that posing for such a magazine is an effort to “normalize” the hijab is naïve, at best. Moreover, it begs the question of not only what exactly are we trying to normalize, but what are those norms to which we’re adhering, and who gets to determine what these norms are? Unfortunately, in an effort to “normalize” the hijab, one may inadvertently normalize the “fetishization” of the hijab. Also, in an effort to “normalize” the hijab, Muslim Youtube “stars” and fashion bloggers conform to beauty ideals and norms imposed by the fashion and cosmetic industries. While the rest of society is giving these industries the proverbial middle finger as they take charge of their bodies, a minority of Muslim women who crave acceptance and validation from a hostile environment, that labels them as terrorists, are conforming to norms that contradict the concept of the hijab. Let’s be honest: a “sexy hijabi” is an oxymoron. The hijab is meant to privatize women’s bodies, achieve women’s self-determination, away from society’s reach.……As time progresses, feminism changes its tone. Many Muslims, including myself, argue that the hijab is feminist in essence. Strength lies in choice. By choosing the hijab, Muslim women are empowered. Some may argue that making the choice to pose for Playboy, or present oneself in any other capacity is feminist, as well. But here’s my question, and it comes from a place of genuine introspection: is it feminist to present ourselves in such capacities in a constant search for approval? Are we challenging societal norms and beauty ideals by seeking approval and validation? Shouldn’t we just continue to live our lives on our own terms, without demanding validation and approval from others? Is it too idealistic to propose that we do so? ...... When the burkini was recently banned in a handful of French cities, it was met with not only global outrage, but with a French court’s decision that it is unconstitutional. Nevertheless, Sarkozy still laid out his policy to ban the burkini if elected for president. A couple of French city mayors have chosen to challenge the court decision by enforcing the ban. In contrast, not only have Muslim women launched the debate on their right to dress as they please, but men and non-Muslims have joined in their self-defense (and otherwise). It is fascinating to see how a woman’s clothing choice can launch such great and global discourse. Watching from a distance, I took great interest and read essentially every article on the matter that I could find. I absorbed all the various opinions on the topic. As a woman, and particularly a Muslim woman, I ached to write and share my thoughts. But something held me back. I kept on asking myself, “what original ideas do I have that would contribute greatly to the discussion?” It’s not a new discussion, and most opinions on the matter have been regurgitated ad hominem. Then one day, I read an article where the non-Muslim, female author genuinely asked: “In those places where hijabs are banned, can women who have lost their hair, perhaps from cancer treatments, wear a headscarf?” I sat there, re-read the question, and sighed. I scratched my head, took a great, heavy pause, then asked, “YES, what about women who have lost their hair? Can’t they wear a headscarf if they want to?” I looked at the article page, then glanced over to a Gif image of a woman surrounded by two men, each either dressing her in a “burqa” or stripping her completely, except for her underwear. She glanced uncomfortably and in confusion at both men as they both took the liberty of deciding for her whether she should or should not be covered. This Muslim woman’s agency was completely stripped, and no one asked her what she wanted. I paused again and asked, “YES, what about women who don’t have hair?” I scratched my head again. ...... Only a few weeks prior, I had – after a long wait – decided to shave my head. After a thirteen-year battle with alopecia, I decided to take things into my own hands and shave my head. Alopecia is an auto-immune condition where the body’s immune system fights hair follicles, mistaking them for a virus or toxin in the body. This results in chronic hair loss – whether only on the scalp (alopecia areata) or all throughout the body (alopecia universalis, totalis). For thirteen years, I struggled with the idea of losing my hair, of not looking the way women are “meant to look” – with full, healthy hair. For thirteen years, I had compared myself to the women around me, including my own family, wondering why and how I got alopecia and lost my hair, when no one else I knew did. The older I turned, the more I questioned whether any man would want to spend the rest of his life with an alopecian woman. I never wanted to question my desirability, but interactions with people provoked me to do so.Over the past year, I ached to shave my head. I had read some testimonies online from alopecian women that shaving one’s head is empowering. By doing so, one would be taking things into her own hands, be in control, and embrace the condition that has no cure (but many excruciating treatments and others that give false hopes). I really wanted to shave my head, but my family did not support the choice. I kept on asking my siblings whether they would help me shave my head, but they couldn’t bring themselves to do so or to even accept the thought. I wanted to shave my head so badly, but wanted support and acceptance. But then, Ramadhan happened. It is a month of not only fasting, but worship, meditation, and introspection. After much meditation and praying, I finally decided to just go for it. Two days later, I shaved my head. I actually did. Here’s the remarkable realization I had: it was not scary or emotional as I had thought it would be. The head-shaving may or may have not been a culmination of all my emotional ups and downs with an unpredictable medical condition. Either way, it was done. Finally. My family had visceral reactions to my head shaving decision. They couldn’t look at the photos I shared with them of my bald head. They were not used to this new image of me, and could not embrace it so easily. Needless to say, it took them a long while to accept it. Months later, I feel that they still have a long way to go. My own family’s reactions prompted me to think about shame, discomfort, and how both relate to women’s bodies in particular. The more I spoke about alopecia with friends, the more I realized people are simply uncomfortable with the topic; with the idea of a woman losing hair. I kept on wondering why. WHY does some scalp on woman, but not on a man, make people uncomfortable? Bald men are deemed attractive and hot, but women aren’t? Why? As some friends have suggested, this simply has to do with long-standing norms and beauty ideals pertaining to the female body. This has to do with expectations, and apparently, losing one’s hair disappoints people’s expectations. Either way, I realize people need time to get used to the idea.Since shaving my head, I have attended a conference by the Canadian National Alopecia Areata Foundation, where I met a diverse group of people dealing with the same condition. They included men, women, children, teens, and adults. NBA star Charlie Villanueva gave an inspiring talk about his experience with alopecia. Children and teenagers’ faces were lit with joy. There stood a celebrity – a successful, talented athlete – with whom they could directly relate. To them, he is an inspiration. He embraced his condition and celebrated it. Now they could, too.After having many discussions with fellow alopecians at this conference, I realized shame was prevalent. As much as everyone wanted to accept, embrace, and celebrate alopecia, as well as their individuality, they feared what others would think and feel about their hair loss. Everyone feared judgment, and that was natural. There were creativity sessions, and vendors selling wigs, hats, scarves and various ways to cover bald heads. I couldn’t help but realize – we’re protecting societal norms and expectations, enabling them, and allowing them to be uncomfortable with our bald heads. Sometimes, this is conscious, and sometimes it is not. Some (all non-Muslim) asked me how great it must be to be wearing a hijab - to be protected from people’s judgmental eyes. Suddenly, my hijab held different meanings to me more than ever. After shaving my head, and after attending this conference, my inner dialogue began to really show change. I viewed myself as a strong, empowered woman with agency. I went against my family’s discomfort and advice, shaved my head, and now love my bald, badass self. …… Here’s the thing: to be badass is to be yourself. To be badass is to embrace tribulation as a blessing. To be badass is to embrace your faith in spite of a world growing increasingly hostile to your existence. To be badass is to cripple misogyny by practicing female and individual agency; not by seeking misogyny’s validation. To be badass is to engage in critical awareness discourse, not flaunt one’s body in a constant search for approval and validation. To mind one’s life, promote awareness in the face of ignorance, and love one’s body is badass. Since shaving my head, a small part of me has wished I could just unveil my head to show people that I am more badass than they ever thought I was. But in response, I find myself thinking, “No. I choose to privatize my body because I love it so much. That is what the hijab is to me – privatization of the body, disarming the public reach to it, and taking full control of it myself. My body is God’s gift to me. He gave me hair, and took it away. I believe in Him and in myself, just like He does. I don’t need validation from others if I can find it within.” My alopecia has strengthened my faith in God and in myself. For that, I find it to be a blessing, not a tribulation. Not anymore. I will not let society tell me that I am unattractive, un-feminine, or going through a “life test”. I am who I am, with and without my body. What I do with it, at the end of the day, is MY choice. I do not cover my head to ease people’s discomfort with my baldness; I cover my body to own it. So to my sisters – Muslim and non-Muslim alike, I say this: let’s just live our lives on our own terms, and not heed voices of misogyny. Let us not heed voices that second-guess our instincts. Let us not heed voices that try to politicize, regulate, criminalize, commodify, and objectify our bodies and souls. Let us not heed voices that try to use our bodies to further their dogmatic and consumerist ideals. In the end, the body is only temporary. Only you get to control your body while it lasts. Normalize nothing but love and compassion. Just be present.(September is Alopecia Awareness Month.
