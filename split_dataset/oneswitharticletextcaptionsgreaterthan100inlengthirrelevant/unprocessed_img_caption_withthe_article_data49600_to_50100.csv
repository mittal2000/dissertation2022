1,POLITICS,People Aren't Really Appreciating Just How Bad Trump's Campaign Has Been,Sam Stein and S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-campaign_us_57a4dd32e4b056bad2157ba0,"""He is a neutron bomb that has gone off in the Republican Party,"" said one top aide to Romney's 2012 campaign.",2016-08-05,Donald Trump has had a self-destructive streak that is comparable to Sharron Angle's 2010 Senatorial campaign. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sure, Donald Trump had a disastrous week on the campaign trail, but at least he may have made history: Longtime political veterans say they cannot recall a candidate who has similarly and needlessly damaged himself quite so badly. “I have been around politics for 40 years, as a journalist and a participant, and I have never seen anything like this last week,” said David Axelrod, President Barack Obama’s longtime aide and now a CNN commentator.It’s not just Democrats who are amazed by the collapse. Underscoring the extent to which Trump’s campaign has bewildered political professionals, Republicans are also shaking their heads at their candidate’s indifference to basic campaign norms ― a strategy that worked in the primaries, but is proving disastrous in the election’s closing months.“I don’t think we’ve ever seen anything quite like this,” said David Kochel, a former strategist for Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s presidential campaigns. “To have a candidate who reflexively takes the bait on any perceived slight, picks needless fights with his own party after the convention, constantly punches down and obsesses with his own cable news coverage is something we’ve never seen before.”Trump has always been an asymmetrical candidate, flouting conventional wisdom in favor of a political style befitting a free-wheeling TV showman. But his past week has been a show featuring mainly self-immolation. He suggested that a Gold Star mother was not allowed to speak because of her Muslim faith, refused to endorse the speaker of the House ― a member of his own party ― for re-election, placed the onus on resolving the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace on the recipient of the harassment, and concocted, apparently out of whole cloth, a video of money being airlifted to Iran. David Plouffe, Obama’s 2008 campaign manager, called these moments “being in the barrel”: a point in a campaign where a candidate simply cannot get beyond a cascade of bad press and controversy.But to apply that aphorism to Trump’s past week might not do the barrel justice, veterans of past campaigns argue. Stuart Stevens, a top aide to Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign and a frequent Trump critic, noted that other candidates have imploded before. No one, he argues, has done it quite as spectacularly and with such a large potential for damage as Trump. “Donald Trump is Todd Akin. He is Richard Mourdock and Sharron Angle,” he said, referring to three infamous Republican Senate candidates who committed fatal verbal miscues. “But that is really not fair to Akin, Mourdock and Angle. They weren’t nuts. They had political views and others that made them unelectable. With Donald Trump, it is instability. He is an absurd candidate for president. He is a neutron bomb that has gone off in the Republican Party that is destroying anyone near him.”Within some political quarters, there remains lingering faith that Trump still has the capacity to turn his free-fall around ― that his historically unparalleled bad week won’t leave enough lingering damage to cost him the election. But those voices are growing rarer. Trump’s poll numbers have tanked since the end of the Democratic convention, with traditionally Republican states like Georgia and Arizona looking more like pick-up opportunities for Hillary Clinton. Increasingly, there is chatter of discord within the ranks. One GOP operative close to Trump compared his campaign to that of Carl Paladino, the Buffalo businessman who won the 2010 Republican nomination for governor in New York thanks to his outsider, anti-establishment, “politically incorrect” appeal, but then got clobbered in the general election. Paladino is now Trump’s New York State chairman.“Same candidate model,” the operative said. “Will Trump meet his New York state director’s 2010 fate and be crushed at the polls because of all the stupid comments? Carl talked himself into total defeat.”Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University in Houston, said he cannot remember as big a collapse since then-Kansas Sen. Bob Dole’s post-convention decline in the 1996 campaign. Brinkley expects Trump’s polling numbers will recover to some extent. But he added that polling is not Trump’s biggest problem. “The big story in August is the defection of the Republican establishment from Trump. You are creating Hillary Clinton Republicans,” Brinkley said. “It’s going to be hard for Trump to win with that brain drain. ... It would have to be a complete collapse of the Hillary Clinton campaign for him to win.”Anita Dunn, a longtime Democratic operative, said there was “no parallel” for Trump’s candidacy in terms of his temperament, approach to politics and propensity for self-immolation. “Nothing in any of our lifetimes.” But she did suggest that the closest comparison to the free-fall being witnessed right now was 1972, when George McGovern chose Tom Eagleton as his running mate and then had to withdraw the pick after it was revealed that Eagleton had been previously hospitalized for severe depression. In that moment, McGovern’s candidacy seemed to fall apart under the assumption that he couldn’t get his own presidential ticket in order. But veterans of that campaign ― and others ― say it is not in the same vicinity as what’s happening in this cycle. “If there is [a parallel], it escapes me,” said former Sen. Gary Hart, who managed McGovern’s campaign. “In terms of consequences both incidents may turn out to be the same, that is a reason for undecideds to decide. Without revisiting all the details of the Eagleton experience, Senator McGovern selected a trusted Senate colleague who was invited to reveal any personal matter that might be used against him, and he had won two statewide races without his medical condition being revealed. Today, I suspect it would be treated by the press and public much differently. Donald Trump has persisted in exhibiting demeaning, belligerent, nasty behavior that is also causing undecided voters to decide.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Greece’s creditors, including the International Monetary Fund, have long posited that a crackdown on tax evasion could help alleviate the country’s debt crisis.The Syriza government is now delivering on the commitment it made at the beginning of 2015 to get tough on tax evasion and pursue wealthy citizens who keep their funds in Switzerland. Ramping up the number of investigators in recent months, the government has already assessed 810 million euros worth of fines, and hundreds more files have been forwarded to auditing authorities, the anti-corruption Secretary General said.Vassiliadis explained that while auditing agencies have faced “shortage of personnel,” the audits are now “proceeding at a very rapid pace.”“Particularly during periods of deep economic crisis, we cannot give up and back down from trying to collect undeclared money,” Vassiliadis said. “It is time for all those large debtors to pay their dues. So far, they believed that they had immunity and that their debts would be paid out of the Greek people’s blood. The Greek state has the will, knowledge and mechanisms to call all those to financial account who had a party while the society was disintegrating.”The finance ministry is finalizing a voluntary disclosure bill that would allow Greek citizens who have opened bank accounts overseas to declare untaxed assets and pay fines, thereby avoiding prosecution on criminal charges and money laundering.“The bill is its final stages,” Vassiliadis said. “And we believe it will open the way to collecting significant sums from those on the tax evasion lists.”Greece is also pursuing financial institutions that may have helped wealthy clients in the country evade taxes.The Borjan list, which Vassiliadis acquired in November 2015 via leaks from Swiss banking whistleblowers, shows that bankers affiliated with the Swiss banking giant UBS Group AG may have helped Greeks evade taxes. Greek investigators raided the home of a former UBS boss on July 4, confiscating hardware and documents, as part of the ongoing investigation. In the past few years, UBS has faced legal trouble in Europe and the U.S. Earlier this year, the Brussels prosecutor’s office launched a formal investigation into whether the bank was involved in tax evasion practices. UBS was also involved in a legal probe in France in 2014 related to its bankers aiding French citizens to evade taxes. “If it turns out that this happened in Greece as well, we will naturally seek compensation from the bank,” Vassiliadis said.In 2009, the Swiss bank admitted to encouraging U.S. citizens to evade taxes, and reached an agreement with U.S. prosecutors in which UBS paid $780 million. “Within the framework of developing international cooperation with the goal of eradicating tax evasion and corruption, Greek authorities are in direct contact with the relevant department of the FBI which conducted the investigation in the U.S., and the U.S. Department of Justice,” Vassiliadis said. A version of this piece appeared on HuffPost Greece. It has been translated into English and edited for a U.S. audience."
3,THE WORLDPOST,These Are The Heroes Looking Out For Brazil's Microcephaly Babies,Poppie Mphuthing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zika-virus-microcephaly-brazil_us_57a424eee4b056bad2151b2f,Health care workers and women's rights advocates are teaming up to help turn the tide on the Zika virus-related condition.,2016-08-05,"Adriana Da Silva, left, takes her son José Bernardo to the AACD clinic, where Dr. Ana Patrícia, right, treats his learning disabilities.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a42b832a00000002fb4dfe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"RECIFE, Brazil ― This poverty-stricken city in the country’s northeast is ground zero for the Zika virus, and many mothers here have given birth to babies with microcephaly. As poor and often single women face a disease that can cause severe disabilities in their children, medical professionals and women’s rights activists have rallied to provide them with support and information.At the AACD physiotherapy unit, Dr. Ana Patrícia treats up to 15 children with microcephaly on any given day. And all the treatment is free for patients.Patrícia says that the center has seen an uptick in patients with microcephaly since March. One of these patients is 13-month-old José Bernardo Da Silva. His mother, Adriana, travels six hours from her home in Custodia, which is in the countryside of Pernambuco state, one of the poorest in Brazil.She makes the journey every week to the clinic, where medical staff members assess José to see what long-term care he will need. During this appointment, Patrícia treats his inability to hold up his neck and his poor hand-eye coordination, which is a typical disability for babies born with microcephaly. The therapy she is administering will “help him improve his neck control so he can keep his head up better, interact, continue playing with his mom.”“We use toys to stimulate him because when he looks at toys, he gets a lot of stimulation and he’s interested in interacting with the toys and the environment,” she says.When Da Silva, 29, was pregnant with José, she says she contracted both Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, both of which can cause microcephaly in babies. Until doctors figure out what caused her son’s disabilities, it is difficult for them to figure out a long-term and effective treatment plan.Da Silva doesn’t know yet if José will ever be able to talk or walk.“For now … it’s not possible to know,” she says. “And we’re waiting for the test results. Doing tests, every week, doing tests.”Though José’s future is uncertain, Adriana is grateful that he is receiving quality treatment.In Recife, open sewage pipes, inadequate sanitation and limited garbage management means that mosquitoes, which carry the Zika virus, breed at a high rate. Pregnant women living here have little choice but to put their babies’ health at risk, and until recently, many weren’t even aware of the dangers.Nadine Gasman, UN Women’s representative to Brazil, says there were 7,500 suspected cases of microcephaly and about 3,400 under investigation in the country through May.“The millions of women that are pregnant are very anxious and in panic,” she says.Despite the challenges, Gasman says the state was quick to respond to the crisis, including offering specialized therapy treatment at the AACD clinic. “In other places, other times, it would have taken months for the government to say, ‘Yes, we have a problem.’ I think they were very quick to do that,” she says.She did, however, warn that with the recent changeover in Brazil’s national government, a “wave of conservative forces” have set back the agenda to improve women’s reproductive rights and access to information, especially in a country with “very low contraception coverage and a very high rate of sexual violence.”Gasman notes that interim President Michel Temer’s decision in May to strip the agency in charge of women’s rights of its ministerial status, as well as the ministries of race and disabilities, constituted a failure to acknowledge the human impact of the Zika epidemic.“The persons, which are mainly women, that were affected by this disease and this situation were invisible,” she says. “It’s like the whole country was fighting this mosquito and nobody really cared or took into account what women were going through.”In response, UN Women partnered with local feminist organizations and health care providers to form a situation group that meets every two months to find ways to address the Zika epidemic by developing maternal health support services.“[T]he situation group is becoming a place to share information, but also to ask questions and to advocate for women’s rights, all the rights, sexual reproductive rights with policymakers,” Gasman says.While the group continues engaging with policymakers and government representatives, it is also proactively reaching out to at-risk women through education drives and on-the-ground support services.A daily podcast called “Viva Maria,” which is distributed to 2,500 radio stations around Brazil and reaches up to 17 million listeners, disseminates information related to gender issues with a focus on reproductive rights.Podcast host Mara Régia says that since the Zika epidemic hit Brazil and the numbers of babies born with microcephaly increased, she has used her platform to speak to women who could be affected.One of her biggest concerns is that abortion is still illegal in Brazil, except when a pregnancy is the result of a rape or the mother’s life is in danger. Régia believes that Brazilian women should have a choice to end a pregnancy under any circumstance.“In Brazil, if there are indications that the child has microcephaly while still in gestation, abortion isn’t an option. This is something that needs to be looked at and addressed,” she says.While advocating for abortion rights, Régia also gives women practical advice on contraception and methods to prevent contracting the Zika virus.“There’s also a lot of disinformation and lack of information about the Zika epidemic,” she says. Pointing to the political conservatives in the country and the defunding of critical ministries and sectors, like science, Régia says, “We can expect that investment in the Zika virus is not going to improve.”Régia says her contribution is to communicate with women and fill in the information gap left by other media and the government. She says: “[Viva Maria is] a channel for expression where women have a voice.”"

But it lost to the main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) in the municipality of Nelson Mandela Bay, which includes the city of Port Elizabeth, and was trailing in Tshwane, home to the capital Pretoria.Since the end of apartheid, the ANC had enjoyed an iron electoral grip on these areas, as well as on the economic hub of Johannesburg - where it held just a narrow lead on Friday.Now, no party looks likely to win a majority in these three urban centers, ushering in a new era of coalition politics as South Africa shifts from what has effectively been a one-party system in the period immediately post-apartheid.This shift reshapes the political landscape in South Africa ahead of the 2019 national election, and may also embolden Zuma’s rivals within the ANC to challenge him.The DA has retained control of Cape Town, which it has held since 2006.The ANC chief whip, Jackson Mthembu, said the losses across the country were “a worrying trend” for the ruling party and would prompt soul-searching. “We need to have a serious introspection, and that is what we will do.”The election also represents a political renaissance for the DA, which last year elected its first black leader, Mmusi Maimane, as part of its efforts to shake off its image as a party that mainly serves white interests.“In the region named after Nelson Mandela, who promoted reconciliation, I think it is fitting that we have to cooperate with other political parties,” said Athol Trollip, the DA’s mayoral candidate in the bay area.Final results are due on Saturday.ZUMA SCANDALSThe ANC has lost its grip on the major cities where millions of black people are now looking beyond its liberation struggle credentials and focusing on weak growth prospects for an economy teetering on the edge of a recession.Voters, facing a lack of jobs and poor basic services, have been incensed by a string of corruption scandals that have engulfed Zuma.“In many respects the elections were exactly about national issues, national policy failures and poor national leadership as much as they were about local issues and local problems,” said Gary van Staden, political analyst with NKC African Economics.The radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party, which is led by Julius Malema, Zuma’s one-time protege, is participating in only its second election and was running a distant third in the votes counted.It has, however, won some support from voters frustrated about inequality in a country where black people make up about 80 percent of the 54 million population, yet most of the economy in terms of ownership of land and companies remains in the hands of white people, who account for about 8 percent of the population.Malema plans to redistribute among poor black people wealth still mostly in white hands.Voters are losing patience with Zuma, who rattled investors in December by changing finance ministers twice in a week, sending the rand currency plummeting.The president survived an impeachment vote in April after the Constitutional Court said he breached the law by ignoring an order to repay some of the $16 million in state funds spent on renovating his private home in Nkandla. Zuma has since said he will repay some of the money.The rand held its ground close to a nine-month high against the dollar early on Friday, partly boosted by the smooth running of the elections.“Foreign investors will probably welcome the fact that reduced support for the ruling ANC has helped the centrist DA rather than the leftist EFF,” said John Ashbourne, Africa analyst at Capital Economics, in a note."

Tens of civilians had been executed, and six burnt.“UNHCR has received reports that ISIL captured on 4 August up to 3,000 IDPs (internally displaced people) from villages in Hawiga District in Kirkuk Governorate trying to flee to Kirkuk city. Reportedly, 12 of the IDPs have been killed in captivity,” the UNHCR report said.The United States is leading a military coalition conducting air strikes against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, where the group seized broad swathes of territory in 2014. The fighting had displaced 3.4 million people in Iraq by July 2016.Islamic State’s grip on some towns has been broken, but it still controls its de facto capitals of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria.Last month the U.N. appealed for $284 million to prepare aid for an assault on Mosul, as well as up to $1.8 billion to deal with the aftermath.It has so far received nothing in response, according to the U.N. Financial Tracking Service.UNHCR has begun building a site northeast of Mosul for 6,000 people and is preparing another northwest of the city for 15,000, a fraction of those expected to need shelter.Tens of thousands who fled from the city of Falluja have still not returned since its recapture from Islamic State in June. Three volunteers helping to clear Falluja of rubble and explosives died while clearing a house on Aug 1, UNHCR said.“Although local authorities have suggested that returns to Falluja could begin in September, the Ministry of Migration and Displacement has stated that it may take another three months before conditions are conducive for large scale returns,” it said.But Iraqi authorities reported 300,000 displaced people had returned to Ramadi district, UNHCR said. Iraqi forces declared victory over the jihadist group in Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, in December, but later called a halt to returns after dozens of civilians were killed by mines."

Apparently they wanted to find out whether they were men or women.”Kayima Emilian, a police spokesman, said they had dispersed the gathering because the organizers had failed to notify them of the event.“A large group of people gathering? They need to tell Police. But also they were likely to engage in promoting gay sex which is illegal in Uganda.”Uganda triggered widespread western criticism after it enacted a harsh anti-gay law that handed out life sentences for some homosexual offences.A constitutional court later overturned the law because of legal technicalities.Despite threats by some lawmakers that the bill would be re-introduced in parliament, that has not happened and analysts say it would be unlikely to succeed in the face of strong pressure from Western donors.Police arrested at least 15 participants in Thursday’s incident and took them to a nearby policestation where they spent about two hours before they were all released without recording a statement or being charged with any offences.At the station, Byarugaba said security personnel taunted the homosexuals, took their pictures without their permission and tried to touch them to “ascertain especially for trans gender individuals whether they were women or men.””It was a very, very degrading process,” she said.Uganda Police have raided similar events before with officials accusing organizers of assembling illegally and promoting gay lifestyle in Uganda.Byarugaba said the club event, where a Mr. and Ms. Pride was to be selected was a precursor to a Gay Pride march planned for Saturday in Kampala."

He lauded Clinton in the opinion piece for being “prepared, detail-oriented, thoughtful, inquisitive and willing to change her mind if presented with a compelling argument” during their shared time in the Situation Room.Trump, on the other hand, exudes traits that “suggest he would be a poor, even dangerous, commander in chief,” Morell wrote.These traits include his obvious need for self-aggrandizement, his overreaction to perceived slights, his tendency to make decisions based on intuition, his refusal to change his views based on new information, his routine carelessness with the facts, his unwillingness to listen to others and his lack of respect for the rule of law.Putin preyed on Trump’s “vulnerabilities,” currying the businessman’s favor simply by complimenting him, Morell said. Trump’s adoration of Putin, a leader with a reckless and dangerous track record, makes him “an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation,” Morell added. He also hit Trump for his proposed ban on Muslims, saying it directly contradicts American values and undermines security.“My training as an intelligence officer taught me to call it as I see it. This is what I did for the C.I.A. This is what I am doing now,” Morell said in the op-ed. “Our nation will be much safer with Hillary Clinton as president.”Morell said that he isn’t a registered Democrat or Republican and that this is the first time he has come out in favor of a candidate.“Between now and [Election Day], I will do everything I can to ensure that she is elected as our 45th president,” he wrote.Read the op-ed here.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

About 8,000 Syrian refugees have been resettled in the U.S. since last October ― more than three-quarters of them women and children ― and the administration expects to admit at least 2,000 more by the end of September, when the 2016 fiscal year ends, officials announced on Friday. There has been significant pushback against admitting Syrian refugees, especially from Republican politicians who argue they’re unvetted and potentially terrorists. More than half of the nation’s governors tried last year to ban Syrian refugees from their states, although they were not able to do so, and Congress passed legislation to pressure government officials to turn Syrian and Iraqi refugees away.Trump has made calls to keep out Syrian refugees central to his presidential campaign, including in an extended rant during a Thursday rally in Maine. Last December he called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” prompting criticism from within his own party. More recently, in what he called an “expansion” of that plan, he said he would block people from countries “compromised by terrorism.” Syria fits that bill ― which is part of the reason so many people there have fled their homes or left the country entirely. There are more than 4.8 million Syrian refugees in total, meaning even the 10,000-person goal set by the president is only a tiny fraction of them. (The government has also contributed resources to help Syrian refugees overseas.) The Obama administration forged ahead despite the resistance. Of the 8,000 Syrian refugees admitted so far this fiscal year, nearly 4,600 were under the age of 18, Anne Richard, assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, said on a call with reporters. Overall, 78 percent were either women or children, she said. More than 99 percent of the Syrian refugees resettled in the U.S. this fiscal year were Muslims, who also make up the vast majority of the Syrian population. Not every Syrian screened has been admitted. Most refugees are referred from the United Nations Refugee Agency, which initially screens them. Syrian refugees then go through additional steps to the already extensive vetting process, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director León Rodriguez told reporters. It includes interviews with officers, review of social media accounts and review by the departments of State and Homeland Security, with help from the FBI and intelligence agencies.Hundreds of Syrians have been rejected during the process, and others have been put on hold because concerns about their credibility, Rodriguez said. He said he wanted to rebut the “widely held view” that Syrian refugees cannot be vetted. That claim is often attributed to FBI Director James Comey, although in the quote in question he never says vetting is impossible, but rather that it would be impossible to guarantee a risk-free screening process, despite recent improvements.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters earlier this week that his agency has increased resources to meet the goal of resettling more Syrian refugees. “The process is still a very thorough, time-consuming process for each refugee applicant ... and we have not shortcut the process,” he said at an event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor."

It has since sold out. The $11 pouch became the new “It” bag when Pathlight, a school in Singapore for children with autism, posted on Instagram about how one of its students designed the bag.The school told the BBC that it typically sells 200 pouches in four months, but after photos of Ho’s clutch were widely spread, it sold 200 within a day.Seetoh Sheng Jie, who is enrolled in Pathlight’s artist development program, is the 19-year-old student who designed the bag. According to The Art Faculty, the store managed by Pathlight, Seetoh knows the spelling of dinosaurs’ full paleontological names and doesn’t use reference books to create his accurate depictions of the prehistoric creatures.“We thought [Ho] would have carried a branded or designer bag to an event like this. But she chose to use this pouch.”His parents told The New Paper that their son has been obsessed with dinosaurs since he watched the Disney movie, Dinosaur and he’s “just happy” that someone likes something that he made.Seetoh also gets royalties from the sale of his pouch, according to The Art Faculty.“We thought [Ho] would have carried a branded or designer bag to an event like this. But she chose to use this pouch,” Wendy Chua, Seetoh’s mom told the outlet.Ho is an adviser to the Autism Resource Center in Singapore, which helped set up the Pathlight school, according to the BBC.Ho told The New Paper that she had taken three different pouches designed by Pathlight students with her on the trip to Washington D.C. because she could not decide which one she wanted to use.Linda Kho, Pathlight’s principal, told the BBC that she was unaware that Ho would be donning one of their bags in the capitol, but the school was honored and pleasantly surprised.“[Ho] is known to be very down to earth and practical,” Kho told the outlet. “And the fact that she carries a less than $20 Singapore dollars pouch to such a world stage event shows she is really confident and authentic.”"

That’s 20 times more than the lowest price that’s offered to poor countries, according to Doctors Without Borders.The cheapest price is about $3.10 per dose.That’s why for more than six years, Doctors Without Borders has been petitioning pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to make this vaccine more affordable to refugees. But both companies have refused, according to the aid group.Pneumonia is of particular concern since it killed 922,000 children last year, according to the World Health Organization. It accounted for 15 percent of all deaths of children under 5. And refugee camps are hotbeds for transmission of the disease since malnourishment and living in crowded areas are both risk factors.And while both companies told The Huffington Post that they sell the vaccine at a reduced price to struggling countries, aid groups, like Doctors Without Borders can’t get the vaccines at a reduced cost even though they work with vulnerable populations, the organization noted.In recent weeks, Doctors Without Borders vaccinated more than 5,000 refugee children in camps and settlements across Greece. The campaign is focusing on 10 diseases, including pneumonia.But both Pfizer and GSK say they’re doing their part to help people living in humanitarian emergencies.In a statement provided to The Huffington Post, Pfizer said it donated pneumonia vaccines to Doctors Without Borders and offered to provide additional doses if needed.GSK said the work Doctors Without Borders does is “incredible” and that the company has provided more than 100,000 doses of the vaccine to the aid group at a nominal cost to immunize children affected by the refugee crisis.But Doctors Without Borders says these donation systems aren’t “sustainable.” Such donations typically come with a large number of constraints, risks and uncertainties, the organization said in a statement, which can hinder the group from adequately responding to emergencies.Doctors Without Borders said it’s more efficient to negotiate directly with vendors for affordable medical products.Both Pfizer and GSK added that they provide the vaccine at a discounted price to the most economically disadvantaged countries. These vaccinations come to about $3 per dose.But Doctors Without Borders noted that that approach doesn’t help struggling refugees living in Greece and other well-off countries.To further encourage the pharmaceutical companies to reduce the price of pneumonia vaccines, Doctors Without Borders delivered a petition signed by more than 416,000 people. It’s calling on Pfizer and GSK to lower the cost of all three doses of the pneumonia vaccine to $5 per child“Governments and humanitarian organizations need tools to protect children living through one of the biggest crises of our times,” Apostolos Veizis, director of MSF’s medical operational support unit in Greece, said in a statement. “Pfizer and GSK must drop the price of the pneumonia vaccine.”"

During their drive, they began to talk about the upcoming Olympics. That’s when Hill told Willock that his son, Darrell, was going to compete in shot put on the U.S. Olympic Track and Field team.According to Hill’s son, his father is proud of his accomplishment.“He pretty much tells everyone who gets into his car that his son is going to the Olympics,” Darrell Hill told The Delaware County Daily Times.When Willock asked if Hill was going to Brazil to watch his son compete, Hill told her he couldn’t afford it.“It was devastating to hear that,” Willock told People. “Here’s this wonderful man who has a close relationship with his son and I know any parent would want to see their son or daughter compete at the Olympics, but it was very understandable how that could be out of reach.” That’s when Willock, who works for a global concierge service with contacts in Brazil, decided to help.“She tried to see if her company could buy him a plane ticket, but it didn’t work out that way,” Darrell Hill told the Daily Times. “The logistics of it, she was not able to do it in the time it needed to be done so she approached me about starting a GoFundMe account.”On July 28, Willock started the campaign. She asked for $7,500 to pay for a plane ticket, hotel, meals, passport and other travel expenses. Two days later they had reached their goal.Robert Mongeluzzi, a Philadelphia attorney, donated $1,545.“I’ve been an athlete my whole life, and you know, I guess it just touched me,” Mongeluzzi told NBC10.Hill said he came out of church on Sunday to a phone call from NBC10 letting him know the GoFundMe campaign had reached its goal.“It’s a great thing for people to come together like that, and it’s a great opportunity,” Hill told the outlet.Willock told NBC10 her company would arrange ground transportation from Pennsylvania to the hotel in Rio. The outlet also reported that Uber chipped in, giving Hill $1,000 in Uber credits so he can easily get around Rio. The company also gave him a $250 gift certificate to one of the city’s top restaurants.Now all Hill has to do is get his passport and book a ticket in order to see his son compete on August 18.“I haven’t seen my son in a couple months because he’s been training,” Hill told People. “I cant wait to see him and encourage him in person and let him know I’m 100 percent in his corner.” Note: The Huffington Post’s editor-in-chief Arianna Huffington is a member of Uber’s board of directors, and has recused herself from any involvement in the site’s coverage of the company."

The Competitive Enterprise Institute, whose website says it opposes U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, had also sought the documents.“This is far less a proper common interest agreement than a sweeping cloak of secrecy,” said Chris Horner, a lawyer who represents the Energy & Environment Legal Institute.The attorneys general, as previously reported, received guidance from well-known climate scientists and environmental lawyers before announcing the Exxon probe.Critics have called this a sign of meddling by special interests, though prosecutors’ offices have made clear climate change is a top concern of voters.New York state’s attorney’s general office said confidentiality agreements are used often.“Entering into a common interest agreement is routine practice during a multistate investigation. These agreements preserve the confidentiality of non-public information shared among state law enforcement officials,” the office told Reuters.Exxon, which has said that it has acknowledged the reality of climate change for years, has called subpoenas stemming from the inquiry unreasonable. It has also said it is being unfairly targeted by climate activists.The company, which supports a revenue-neutral carbon tax, declined to comment.A U.S. House of Representatives committee last month issued subpoenas to the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts over their investigations of whether Exxon misled investors on climate change risks. The two state officials said they would refuse to comply with the subpoenas, with one calling it “unconstitutional and unwarranted” interference.In a bid to try to force action on climate change, the state attorneys general said in March they would jointly investigate whether Exxon executives misled the public by contradicting research from company scientists that spelled out the threats of global warming.A pact was signed in May and included California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington state and the U.S. Virgin Islands.But only a couple formal inquiries have started. In June, the Virgin Islands withdrew its subpoena after Exxon called it overly burdensome and raised questions about jurisdiction."

His spokesman says the move is not legal. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a382082a0000fa01fb4bf4.jpeg?cache=auavuIct3m&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Missouri’s public criminal defense system is overburdened ― it’s ranked 49th in the nation, the state public defender’s office budget has been cut repeatedly and there aren’t enough attorneys to take on the swelling caseload.Left with few options to properly represent the state’s poor defendants, Michael Barrett, the director of the Missouri State Public Defender’s office, found a novel answer to at least one case ― assigning it to Gov. Jay Nixon (D), a practicing attorney in the state, who Barrett says is responsible for the woes that the office is currently burdened with. In his letter dated Aug. 2, Barrett cites a state law that he says allows him to assign cases out to any current member of the state bar. He’s never utilized the law before this moment, he says, because he believes that “it is wrong to reassign an obligation placed on the state ... to private attorneys who have in no way contributed to the current crisis.” That crisis, Barrett argues in his letter, rests on Nixon’s shoulders. Barrett lays out his case:Seven years ago, your office vetoed Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 37, which would have provided caseload relief to an overburdened public defender system. In denying that relief, you acknowledged that MSPD was operating “under significant stresses” and committed to working with the General Assembly to fix the problem, but never did.Scott Holste, Nixon’s spokesman, told The Huffington Post that Barrett’s move is not legal.“It is well-established that the public defender does not have the legal authority to appoint private counsel,” Holste said.Holste explained that Missouri state law allows only the circuit court to “appoint a private attorney to represent an indigent criminal defendant.” And while the sub-section of the statute that Barrett references does authorize the public defender to “’delegate’ representation by contracting with private counsel,” Holste argues that still “requires the consent of the private attorney.”He added that Nixon supports indigent criminal defendants having legal representation.“They’re grasping at straws,” Barrett told HuffPost on the phone Thursday about Holste’s response to his appointment of Nixon to a case. “That doesn’t invalidate this as a standalone statute that I have to use. They’ve got nothing.” Barrett’s office has struggled with overworked and low-paid attorneys for years and has butted heads with Nixon before. Just last month, Nixon slashed $115 million from the state budget, removing millions that lawmakers had intended to be used to hire additional public defenders to help reduce caseloads. In his letter, Barrett says his office is significantly overburdened already and that there has been a 12 percent increase in cases year over year prior.Later that month, Barrett sued Nixon over withholding $3.5 million approved by the state legislature for defending the indigent. The lawsuit argues that Nixon’s funding restriction is unconstitutional. In a press release, Barrett said this isn’t “fiscal discipline ... this is politics” and accused Nixon of trying to “weaken public defense to the point it can no longer perform its independent function within the criminal justice system.”He also said that Nixon is attempting to “transform our democracy into a monarchy [that] violates the separation of powers at the most rudimentary level.”This story has been updated to include comment from Barrett."

They have not yet been charged, according to the Times. Ford was described by family attorneys as mentally challenged.In a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Wednesday, the officers accused supervisors of denying their requests to return to the field based on their race and the race of Ezell Ford, the paper reported.Villegas is Latino and Wampler is said to be Caucasian in the suit, but department records have him listed him as Asian American, the Los Angeles Times reported.The lawsuit also says that the officers have been denied transfers, overtime and promotions because of their race, and that they have faced retaliation after they filed complaints over racial discrimination with state regulators in 2015, the paper said.A spokesman for the L.A. city attorney’s office told the Times they were reviewing the lawsuit but could not comment further.City officials were not immediately available for comment.Ford’s death came two days after police shot dead another unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, triggering protests, some violent, across the country over the excessive use of force by police.Since then the debate over policing and racism has intensified in the United States where a string of fatal shootings of black men and women by officers, as well as other racially motivated killings, have fueled anger and given rise to the Black Lives Matter protest movement.In July, high-profile police shootings of two black men in Minnesota and Louisiana were followed by an African-American former U.S. soldier killing five policemen in Dallas in retaliation.(Reporting by Brendan O’Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)"

Seems reasonable.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a286812a00002d004f83a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A Democratic congresswoman launched a petition Wednesday urging Republican Party officials to require Donald Trump to undergo a psychological exam to confirm he is “mentally fit” to be president. “Donald Trump is dangerous for our country,” reads the petition by Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.). “His impulsiveness and lack of control over his own emotions are of concern. It is our patriotic duty to raise the question of his mental stability to be the commander in chief and leader of the free world.”Bass, a former physician assistant and clinical instructor, says she knows it’s unethical for psychiatrists and psychologists to comment on a person’s mental state without personally examining them. That’s why she wants them to publicly pressure GOP officials to insist that Trump undergo an evaluation. Her petition is laced with the hashtag #DiagnoseTrump. In the meantime, the California Democrat has her own ideas about what may be behind the Republican presidential nominee’s erratic behavior.“Mr. Trump appears to exhibit all the symptoms of the mental disorder Narcissistic Personality Disorder,” she said. “It is entirely possible that some individuals with NPD can successfully function in many careers, but not the Presidency of the United States.”As spelled out in the petition, the DSM IV criteria for diagnosing NPD includes a grandiose sense of self-importance, being preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, requiring excessive admiration and lacking empathy.As of Monday night, Bass’ petition had 6,520 signatures.A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) chose his words carefully Thursday when releasing a statement questioning the president's loyalty to the United States.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a37a862a00002e004f863e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) thinks President Barack Obama either doesn’t know what he’s doing, or he knows “exactly what he is doing and is playing for some other team.”The comment, which suggests the president is working for Iran or other interests, is conveniently phrased in the sort of nebulous open question that’s meant to raise the topic of Obama potentially working for another country or terrorist organization while distancing Zeldin from actually saying that.“When deals like this are cut,” Zeldin said in a press release Wednesday, “one has to truly wonder whether the President has no idea what he is doing, or if he knows exactly what he is doing and is playing for some other team.”Zeldin is referencing the $400 million the United States paid Iran in January. The Wall Street Journal and Republicans in Congress pushed the story on Wednesday as a major revelation, but the administration countered that it had disclosed the $400 million payment in January and said it was part of a repayment over a failed arms deal from 1979.Still, that hasn’t stopped Republicans from using the payment to question whether this was part of the Iran nuclear deal or the release of four Americans, including the Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian, from Iran.For Zeldin, that meant boldly asserting that this was, indeed, ransom.“Paying a $400 million cash ransom to the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, shows that yet again the Obama administration will go to great lengths, at any and all costs, to appease Iran and show weakness to our enemies,” he said, before going on to question whether Obama was some sort of secret agent.The comments come as a majority of Republican voters seem to believe that Obama sympathizes with ISIS. A poll released at the beginning of July indicated that 55 percent of Republican voters agree with Donald Trump that President Obama sympathizes with ISIS. (Only 4 percent of Democratic voters believe that.)Zeldin has already shown a willingness to engage in some of the basest forms of politics during his first term in office. In June, while defending Trump’s remarks about Judge Gonzalo Curiel, Zeldin suggested that Obama and the Democratic party were the real racists, not Trump.“You can easily argue that the president of the United States is a racist with his policies and his rhetoric,” Zeldin said.Zeldin did not respond to a request for comment."

That may be no different, according to new ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey, who discussed the show’s storied problems with diversity with journalists on Thursday. “I would very much like to see some changes there, and I think one of the biggest changes that we need to do is we need to increase the pool of diverse candidates in the beginning,” she told reporters. “Part of what ends up happening as we go along is there just aren’t as many candidates.”Entertainment Weekly reports that Dungey, who replaced previous ABC chief Paul Lee in February, fielded questions about diversity controversies in “The Bachelor.” Lee, notably, had hinted strongly that the Season 12 Bachelorette would be “diverse,” but his departure and the casting of JoJo Fletcher as the series lead once again reframed the network’s commitment to diversity as lip service.In focusing on increasing the diversity in the contestants, Dungey also pointed out that the network’s bias may not be simply toward white leads, but toward fan favorites. The show leads have, in recent seasons, come from a pool of eligible men or women who advanced far in the competition on “The Bachelor” or “Bachelorette,” only to be heartbroken in front of Bachelor Nation.Dungey is not the first player at ABC to suggest that the franchise is hesitant to stray from this model to cast a lesser-known lead of color because, as she put it on Thursday, “it’s worked very well for us because the audience feels really engaged in helping to choose that candidate.”The new ABC chief also copped to watching Lifetime’s “UnREAL,” a dark, satirical drama set behind the scenes of a fictional reality show that bears a striking resemblance to “The Bachelor.” While the franchise’s affable host Chris Harrison has reacted with hostility to “UnREAL” and its unsettling portrayal of reality dating TV, it seems not everyone at ABC shares this antagonism. Did the casting of a black bachelor for the second season of “UnREAL” provoke any urgency among ABC executives? “I don’t think we’ve ever actually had a full sort of network conversation about ‘UnREAL,’” Dungey said. “I enjoy watching it as a viewer, however.”And there’s a lot of blue sky between “a full sort of network conversation” about “UnREAL” and a less quantifiable jolt among the ABC brass. Lifetime, it’s been said many times, beat “The Bachelor” to the punch by casting a black suitor before the much more established reality show did so. Maybe the sense of being leapfrogged for a historical moment will be the thunderbolt the network needs to make some progress.H/T EW.comFor more on “The Bachelor,” check out HuffPost’s recap podcast, “Here to Make Friends”:"

His latest, “Little Men,” follows 2014’s “Love Is Strange” and 2012’s “Keep the Lights On” in getting at the heart of relationships ― messy, joyous, confusing relationships that illustrate Sachs' characters as individuals. “Little Men” follows two sweet, artistic 13-year-old friends (played by gifted newcomers Theo Taplitz and Michael Barbieri) who protest their parents’ rent dispute in gentrified Brooklyn. But more than that, it’s about forging intimate connections while feeling like the world is working against you. In other words, life.“Little Men,” “Love Is Strange” and “Keep the Lights On” ― screenplays Sachs wrote with Mauricio Zacharias and directed himself ― form a de facto trilogy about New York relationships in various stages and depth. Their subtlety is masterful, and their specificity makes these stories universal. Co-starring Greg Kinnear, Jennifer Ehle, Paulina García and Alfred Molina, “Little Men” opens in New York this weekend and expands across the country throughout August and September. Like “Love Is Strange” in 2014, it is one of the year’s best movies. Ahead of the ""Little Men"" release, I sat down with Sachs in Manhattan to discuss the film, how movies get childhood wrong, the “romance” of friendship and his career outside the mainstream Hollywood structure. With “Keep the Lights On,” “Love Is Strange” and “Little Men,” you’ve become known as a quintessential New York filmmaker. Do you accept that label?Yeah, I’ve been here almost 30 years. I do because this is my home and I make movies about things that I know. What I really feel like I have is a lot of intimacy with New York, both personally within a family and within a community. And I have a sense of the texture of how people live here, which gives me a place to start.There are several threads in “Little Men,” and two that I think people will think about most heavily after seeing the movie: gentrification and the exploration of male friendship at a young age. I don’t think we often take childhood seriously, particularly in films that could be for both kids and adults. I think, to me, as a father and as someone who was a kid, it’s a very serious time. It’s also a beautifully innocent and joyous time, and I think what’s so moving to me about these kids and what I remember from my own childhood is the ability for kids to cross boundaries in away that adults seem to resist. Crossing class boundaries, race boundaries, sexuality. There’s something very beautiful about that that I’m familiar with specifically because I grew up in Memphis and I was involved in something called the Memphis Children’s Theater. I would think of it as the last integrated community I was a part of.What do you mean?I mean that we were kids and we were putting on plays, so where we were from didn’t matter as much as what we were doing together. So we were rich kids and poor kids and black kids and gay kids and kids from the suburbs and kids from the city. And the differences, I’m sure they were there, but they weren’t as noticeable. I think that gets lost. I think that’s part of the world of childhood in this film. There must be a better word than this, but it’s multicultural and it’s across economic lines. And adult life depends on that and actually says, “We are different, we have different opportunities. Our lives and our futures are going to be separated.”With the kids in “Little Men,” for example, do you think it’s also generational? We tend to assume that each generation becomes more progressive than the last. No, I think you have to learn difference. And it takes a while.But was that open-mindedness heightened for you because you grew up in an artistic environment?I do think there is a beauty in the theater.It’s almost a cliché to assume that artists are more worldly, but ...Well, I think that’s true, but I look at my kids in preschool ― they’re two 4-year-olds, and those kids don’t know the difference between their parents. There will be economic factors that define which preschool you go to. Economics are involved in every choice in their day, to some extent. When some people say my film is about gentrification, I would say my film is really about economic impact on everyday life. Because, yes, it is about gentrification, but gentrification is another word for the paucity of space and land within a city, which has been true for 100 years or 1,000 years.Is the origin of “Little Men” the story of two kids’ friendship?Yeah, I wanted to to make a movie about two kids and this friendship. Then we had to come up with a plot. We came upon two films by Yasujirō Ozu, who had been a big influence on Mauricio and I previously. One was called “I Was Born, But ... ,” which is a 1930s silent film, and the other is called “Good Morning,” which is a 1950s color film. Both are about kids who go on strike. So, OK, we’re going to make a film about two kids who go on strike, then the question is, what are they going to go on strike about? As Mauricio Zacharias and I were spending time together on 23rd Street at the Maison du Macaron, which is our café of choice, we were talking about his family and my family, which is what we do. We talk about life. And the one thing that kept coming up was that his family that lives in Rio owns a shop and there was a woman who was a tenant who wasn’t paying her rent, and they were in a long and protracted battle to kick her out.As I kept hearing those details, a) there’s another side to this story, and b) there’s a good plot that seems really resonant. And then you combine that — my husband is from Ecuador ― he and his single mother moved to America when he was 10 to Williamsburg, he’s an artist, he went to LaGuardia High School for the Performing Arts. You’re grabbing things that somehow all very naturally seem to fit together.I appreciate that you tend to imbue conflict in your scripts in a way that forces us to sympathize with every character. We root for the kids, but we understand the parents’ obligation to make sound business decisions.Someone saw the film and told me it reminded him of a line in Jean Renoir’s “Rules of the Game,” which is “Everyone has their reason.” I had not thought of that line, but to me it’s a very good guide to how to tell stories. Your job is to understand everyone’s perspective and to identify with each of them, which is what makes the film interesting, because it’s the lack of simplification and hopefully the depth of empathy that, as a filmmaker, I want to have with my characters, which makes them human.Choosing two young actors to reflect that isn’t an easy task as a filmmaker.It isn’t, and we wouldn’t have made it if we didn’t find great kids. But one of the things I realized early in the casting process is I didn’t need to find a needle in a haystack. I wasn’t looking for Judy Garland to star in “The Wizard of Oz.” I was finding kids who were interesting to me and who were unique in some way that I believed would be memorable. I took my cue for that from a film called “The World of Henry Orient,” which is a film about two girls in New York who are from different sides of the track who both fall in love with Peter Sellers, who plays a piano player. Those girls are so indelibly placed upon my memory. So once I met these kids, I thought, oh, I can build a film around those two boys. I didn’t have any question. I shifted and I changed the script to be comfortable and right for those two boys, which included, for example, recognizing that with Theo Taplitz, who plays Jake, I could not prescribe a sexuality to him. It would have felt exterior.Did you and Theo and talk about it?Yeah, we talked about it, but we didn’t talk about it with any more definition than I felt he was ready for, meaning I don’t think he’s at that point in his life. I will say that he does become a different kind of boy in the last scene of the movie. That is partially hair and makeup and costume, and it’s partially acting. Really, when he walked in to shoot the last scene in the movie at the Brooklyn Museum, I saw an extraordinary actor, because you believe it. It wasn’t a romantic friendship, but there’s a romance to friendship. That was a really important part of the film. For me, there was also something about these two kids and their different styles as children, but also as actors. I thought of Theo as a kind of Robert Bresson actor. I kind of used him like a model, placing him in shots and letting him be very still. And I thought of Michael Barbieri as a Scorsesean actor, and I wanted to make sure there was opportunity for him to go wild and improvise and be whatever version of himself seemed natural. Those differences are really striking in the movie.Are you a Kenneth Lonergan fan? I am. I thought “Margaret” was one of the greatest movies of the last 20 years.I think you and Kenneth are similar. Your scripts always contain blips of unspoken history. So much is left unsaid, but the worlds the characters inhabit in, say, “You Can Count On Me” and “Love Is Strange” have many volumes.I think it has a lot to do with craft and instinct, what is necessary and what isn’t. It’s about giving the audience enough to make connections. It’s about trusting your story and knowing that your audience will understand your characters by having them go through conflict. And for me it’s about building a very authentic world to surround my actors. Those kids in acting class are all in acting class, and those kids who play soccer are kids who play soccer together. And I think to build the world is part of my job. I have ways of doing that, and to not be resistant to what the world tells me ― not to say, “I have this idea.” Again, Renoir said, “When you’re shooting a movie, open the windows and let the world in,” which is a great idea. I’m not Buddhist, but you have to have a comfort with what’s happening and to not try to control too much. My problem with a lot of art cinema today is it seems to be about the filmmaker.Interesting. What do you mean?It’s risky to make broad generalizations, but I mean that there is this idea that the filmmaker announces his or her strength.I saw “The Neon Demon,” the new Nicolas Winding Refn movie, last night. So, yeah, I understand what you mean. For me, it was why films like “Werckmeister Harmonies” ― oh gosh, what’s his name? [Editor’s note: His name is Béla Tarr, a Hungarian director known for pessimistic films that employ unconventional narrative styles.] There are artists who make films about people, and there are artists who make art about art. And that art has a capital A in front of it. To me, there’s a loss in the lack of curiosity and connection to everyday life. Which doesn’t mean you have to use realism, and it isn’t strictly about ideas and metaphors, but also about how people live. You’ve been in the business for a couple of decades now. In thinking about independent cinema, has making movies gotten any easier?No, of course not. It’s a battle, which is, for me right now, at this stage, not as a torturous and impossible a battle as it’s felt in other times of my life because I’ve built a reputation and a sustainability. It means that it’s still hard; it’s just not as a hard as it used to be.Was following up “Love Is Strange,” your most commercial film so far, any easier?I sent the “Little Men” script to 27 different film companies. All of them said no. I’m always sitting around talking to younger filmmakers who are imagining there is a there there, and I will just say, after “Love is Strange,” 27 film companies said no. And I don’t judge them for that because I understand capitalism and I understand that people make decisions based on their hope to keep a roof over their head and a salary in their pocket. They would be wrong to do otherwise.That means when you’re brainstorming a movie, you have to be plugged into the viability of the economics as well.You do, but I don’t think you’re making an art form that is separate, in the same way that I don’t think any of life is separate from economics. What I tend to do is, I think if the story feels to me like it will be resonant for the years that it will take to make it, then it will be resonant for others. That said, you’re constantly coming up to economic decisions about what to put in the film. For example, if this film starred, instead of a 50-year-old Latin American actress, a 30-year-old white American actress, you might have a wider range of economic possibilities. So your decisions from the very beginning about what stories you tell are defined by economics, or your resistance to economics.Are you someone who has a drawer of scripts that have never been made?No.Do you end up making everything you write?I have one script that I didn’t make.What’s the story behind that?It was a script that I wrote with Oren Moverman called “The Goodbye People.” We finished the script in 2007, aiming for production in 2008. If you remember, that’s when the bottom fell out. And this was a film that had a cast that included Damien Lewis, Patricia Clarkson, Michael Shannon, Anton Yelchin, Melanie Griffith, Liv Tyler, and Kirsten Dunst. I couldn’t raise a dollar. It was then that I ended up making this film called “Last Address,” which is an eight-minute film that you can watch online about a group of New York artists who died of AIDS. I made it for $3,000, with total control of my medium as well as what the film would be. That kind of gave me the potential again. Having spent what ended up being three years trying to make “Goodbye People” and the industry not supporting that, I needed to go find something more personal. And I’ve sort of continued from “Last Address” to make these truly independent films. My relationship from the system to the industry only really gets activated at the point of sales and distribution. Will you ever return to that script?I’m working on another film right now, about Montgomery Clift, so a period film.That seems a bit broader than what you’ve done in the past.It’s for HBO, for the actor Matt Bomer. It’s a different can of worms. Mauricio and I originated the script, so that feels familiar. Whether my relationship to the “the man,” whether that works itself out will be the question.Does anybody ever pitch you scripts to direct?I’ve written everything that I’ve made, and I’m also working on a miniseries based on a book by Tim Murphy. He’s a cultural writer in New York and he wrote a book that’s coming out this summer called Christodora. It’s a kind of Bonfire of the Vanities in the age of AIDS, set in the East Village. Both of those projects I’m originating. I don’t think I’m an artist for hire because it’s not my plan and I don’t think I’d be very good at it, to be honest. I think I would have a hard time finding enough inspiration to be the best director that I need to be.Now that you’ve done a few New York-centric projects, do you long to escape the city?I’m working on a film about a family climbing a mountain, and that feels like a really great break. It feels very exciting because of a totally different visual element.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length. "

But he wants his third firm, SpaceX, to keep flying solo.“I don’t think there’s a strong rationale to combine SpaceX and Tesla, where there is for Tesla and SolarCity,” Musk said Wednesday during Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call with analysts. Tesla announced a bid to buy SolarCity, the rooftop solar company founded by Musk’s younger cousins, brothers Lyndon and Pete Rive. Musk, the largest shareholder in both Tesla and SolarCity, serves as the publicly traded energy firm’s chairman of the board. On Monday, SolarCity said it accepted a $2.6 billion offer.The combined company would pair SolarCity’s panels with Tesla’s nascent battery storage business, essentially creating a vertically integrated clean energy company that also sells electric cars. The deal now needs to be approved by shareholders and regulators, a process that could take months. Palo Alto-based Tesla, maker of the Model S sedan, needs improved mapping data to feed the self-driving software used in its cars as the company looks to roll out fully autonomous vehicles in the coming years.SpaceX, the privately held space travel startup pioneering reusable rockets, could provide data from satellites. Those satellites could also, ostensibly, beam internet to a network of cars down on Earth.“There’s a little cooperation that happens between the companies,” Musk said. “But not enough to justify merging them into one entity.”He declined to detail any progress made by Tesla’s mapping team to improve its so-called Autopilot technology.“What we’ve said thus far is we’d need to have much higher-definition maps than currently exist anywhere in the world in order to have full autonomy,” Musk said. “We’re in the processing of building those and, I think, making good progress.”Trouble with Tesla’s mapping data came to a head after the company reported a fatal crash in one of its cars using Autopilot on May 7. The driver had a history of speeding and may have been watching a Harry Potter DVD when his Model S sedan struck the side of a tractor-trailer rig. As scrutiny of the technology mounted, Musk vehemently defended the company, insisting semi-autonomous vehicles are still safer than human drivers alone.“Autonomy is going to come a hell of a lot faster than anyone thinks it will and what we have under development is going to blow people’s minds,” Musk said. “It blows my mind.”He blamed the press for coverage he described as blowing concerns over Autopilot out of proportion.“Unfortunately,” he said, “Tesla can’t sneeze without there being a national headline.”"
