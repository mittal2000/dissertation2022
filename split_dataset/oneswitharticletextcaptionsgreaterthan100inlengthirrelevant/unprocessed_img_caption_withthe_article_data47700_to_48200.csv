But, some travel in search of the best parties on the planet. It's one thing to experience those iconic black-out nights in college, but it's another to dance the night away under the glow of a full moon on a secluded island on the islands of Cambodia. Oh, the world is full of such exotic splendors and immersing yourself in culture will (in cliche travel-writing form) change your perspective blah blah and change your life blah blah and you'll be addicted blah. It would be wrong to leave out though, that part of immersing yourself in a different culture is experiencing how the locals let loose and live it up. Whether it's a New Year's celebration that is actually a giant water gun fight or a gathering to watch a wooden giant go up in wild flames in the Nevada desert; letting your inner beast out to play while traveling can be good for the soul and you'll leave with outrageous stories to tell the kids one day...or maybe it's a good idea to bury some of those stories deep, deep down within your loins where no one can uncover them. Move over Full Moon Party and Coachella. From fashion to vegetable flinging and music festivals to national holidays, take a sneak peek at how the world parties hard and perhaps you animals may find yourself at one for your next international escapade. Songkran FestivalTwo words: water gun. That is, you'll need one for this water fight held throughout all of Thailand from April 13-15. On a serious note, this is the Thai New Year celebration, where water is poured on the hands of elders as a symbol of respect and cleansing. It has over time though, become a wet n' wild party, with locals and tourists lining streets with buckets of ice water and super soakers. No one is immune to the cleansing, so leave your electronics and whiny ""Don't you dare wet me, I just caked on makeup"" attitude at the hotel. Where can you soak up the fun? Bangkok, Phuket and Chiang Mai boast some of the biggest parties.Mercedes-Benz Fashion WeekFor all of the fashionistas out there, dip your fingers into some of the poshest parties, runway shows and events during a fabulous week that celebrates style and culture worldwide. Don your trendiest threads and scamper on over to Berlin, Istanbul or Sydney to be engulfed by the boldest looks and freshest clothing lines to hit the industry. Even if fashion isn't your thing, it's a thrilling way to get a taste of the creative ingenuity that goes into the festivities and bump elbows with the beautiful people, with parties organized by the top dogs in the promotional business.King's Day (Formerly Queen's Day)Amsterdam is the city to be on April 27, when the Dutch honor King Willem-Alexander with a national celebration. The party is held nation-wide, but Amsterdam is the popular spot, where a street party of epic proportions takes place. There's plenty of live music all over the city and various art events to explore. The infamous canals are jam packed with boats and those boats are jam packed with peeps. Don't forget to wear orange- the national color of the Netherlands.La TomatinaIf you've ever dreamed of splattering people in the face with fruits without getting punched in the face in return or getting grounded by the parents, then this is the party for you. Travel to Buñol in eastern Spain, where 175 tonnes of ripe n' ready tomatoes are supplied for the world's largest food fight. For this festival, a gun fires and the tomato tossing begins. The sun shines, streets run red with vitamin C and the celebrations are non stop until the pistol fires once more to signal a close to the friendly gathering of tomato flinging. Burning Man Festival Burning Man, where strange and beautiful souls- the best kind of souls- gather in the heart of Nevada's Black Rock Desert to create a special community of around 30,000 people. Taking place in August or September, attendees must contribute something to the festival in accordance with the year's theme. Don't you dare try to use cash or card resources- the name of the game is to barter. Let your inhibitions explode out in the barren dust and sand and take in the magnificent artistic creations that seem to come to life when the moon and stars rule the heavens. The grand finale of the fest is a massive wooden figure that towers over the landscape, set ablaze for all to watch and reflect. Boryeong Mud FestivalIf it's not a water or tomato fight you're after, maybe you're one of those that just need to get down and dirty, like plastered from head to toe in mud dirty. In the small town of Boryeong in South Korea, there's a festival lasting around two weeks long to quench that mucky thirst. What began in 1999 as a way to promote the cosmetic benefits of the beach town's mineral packed glop, soon turned into one of the most popular annual parties, drawing international visitors in hordes. It's simple: show up, mud, get drunk, mud and mud it up some more until you and everyone around you is covered in, you guessed it, mud."

The 19th Amendment, which grants that right, was certified as law on Aug. 26, 1920.“Today, as we celebrate the anniversary of this hard-won achievement and pay tribute to the trailblazers and suffragists who moved us closer to a more just and prosperous future, we resolve to protect this constitutional right and pledge to continue fighting for equality for women and girls,” the president wrote.While Women’s Equality Day began as a celebration of women gaining an equal voice in the voting booth, the annual holiday has come to stand for women’s fight for equality on a range of issues. Obama recapped his administration’s contributions to that fight, from signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and pushing for lower health care premiums for women through the Affordable Care Act, to hosting forums for women in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields and putting on the first United State of Women Summit earlier this year. He called for action on issues that greatly affect women, such as domestic violence, campus sexual assault, abortion access and discrimination and violence against the transgender community.“On Women’s Equality Day, as we recognize the accomplishments that so many women fought so hard to achieve, we rededicate ourselves to tackling the challenges that remain and expanding opportunity for women and girls everywhere,” Obama wrote.Read the full proclamation here.

But the justices were evenly split in the case, leaving the original injunction in place. “I’m filing this lawsuit for myself and the thousands of others like me who have been wronged by this judge’s decision,” said Batalla Vidal in a statement accompanying the lawsuit’s announcement.A spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which was named as a defendant in the case, declined to comment on the case because it’s deemed pending litigation.Batalla Vidal’s legal effort aims to narrow the scope of the original order that left millions of undocumented immigrants like him in the lurch. When U.S. District Judge Andrew ruled in the Texas case, the federal government had no choice but to stop Obama’s immigration proposal dead in its tracks ― even in the 24 states that did not join Texas’ lawsuit over the policies, including New York, which favors deferred action.The National Immigration Law Center, Make the Road New York and the immigrant rights’ clinic at Yale Law School are supporting Batalla Vidal in the litigation.It is unclear to what extent, if at all, this lawsuit might be affected by a separate move the Obama administration made last month asking the Supreme Court to revisit the deadlocked immigration case.Stephen Legomsky, a law professor at Washington University specializing in immigration law, said in an email that the student’s chances are “hard to predict,” but that otherwise “the case law is clear” that court orders like the one Hanen issued shouldn’t be so broad that they go beyond what the plaintiff ― in this case Texas ― is suing about.“A court decision that finds the nationwide injunction improper could support future challenges to the other terms of the same injunction ― especially the part that enjoins all of [Obama’s executive actions],” said Legomsky, also former chief counsel at USCIS. “So there is a great deal at stake.”"

Some 23 percent would not pick either candidate and answered “refused,” “other” or “wouldn’t vote.”Clinton, a former secretary of state, has led real estate developer Trump in the poll since Democrats and Republicans ended their national conventions and formally nominated their presidential candidates in July. Her level of support has varied between 41 and 45 percent during that period, and her lead over Trump in the tracking poll peaked this month at 12 percentage points on Tuesday.During the past week, Clinton has been dogged by accusations by Trump, which she has denied, that donations to her family’s charitable foundation influenced her actions while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Questions have also surfaced again about her use of a private email server and address rather than a government one during her period at the State Department.Meanwhile, Trump and Clinton also sparred over who would be a better advocate for African Americans and other minorities, and Trump hinted he could soften his hard-line stance on immigration. [nL1N1B714Z]In a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that includes candidates from small, alternative parties, Clinton leads the field by a smaller margin. Some 39 percent of likely voters supported Clinton in the four-way poll, compared with 36 percent for Trump, 7 percent for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 3 percent for Green Party nominee Jill Stein.Both polls were conducted online in English in all 50 states. They included 1,154 likely voters and have a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.The results may differ from the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, which includes a separate weekly tracking poll that measures support for the major party candidates in every state and Washington D.C.The States of the Nation, released on Wednesday, estimated that if the election were held now Clinton would have a 95 percent chance of winning by a margin of about 108 votes in the Electoral College, the body that decides the election through a count of the candidates’ wins in each state.(Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Frances Kerry)Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
5,POLITICS,Most GOP Voters Didn't Really Want Trump's Mass Deportation Plan Anyway,Elise Foley and Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-republican-voters-deportation_us_57c05f51e4b04193420ed954,"Even among Republicans, there's significant support for a pathway to citizenship.",2016-08-26,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump said last year that he would create a ""deportation force"" for undocumented immigrants. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c067381800002100bcd57f.jpeg?cache=Cq7sPOFaAu&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump wouldn’t really be abandoning Republican voters by shifting away from mass deportation ― he would be joining them. The candidate began backing away this week from his past calls to round up and deport all of the undocumented population, instead indicating openness to some of them remaining in the U.S. It’s unclear whether that was an acknowledgement of reality ― deporting 11 million people was never a realistic goal ― or a step toward embracing legal status for undocumented immigrants, although he again ruled that out on Thursday.But the fact that he was willing to backpedal at all shows his campaign might be aware of another reality: that most voters aren’t as hardline on deportations as he was. Trump’s proposal to deport millions of people faced widespread opposition from Americans, 50 percent of whom said in June that the idea, along with his rhetoric against Mexican immigrants, bothered them “a lot.” Just one-third weren’t at all concerned.Trump’s backers are more prone than the rest of the nation to anti-immigration sentiment, but even they have never been an entirely solid bloc. According to a March poll, about three-quarters of all voters, including 47 percent of Trump’s primary supporters believed that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country legally. While the 42 percent of Trump’s supporters who supported a national law enforcement effort to deport all undocumented immigrants was far higher than the 19 percent of all voters who favored that proposal, it still represented less than half of the businessman’s core supporters.Currently, a 51 percent majority of Trump’s general election backers consider creating a pathway to citizenship at least as much as a priority as amping up border security and law enforcement, although if pressed to pick one approach, they overwhelmingly lean toward protecting the borders.It’s too soon to tell how Trump’s latest statements on immigration will affect his standing in the race. But the public’s views of the issues are, by some measures, as malleable and as contradictory as Trump’s have proved to be.  A summer Gallup survey found three-quarters of Republicans support allowing undocumented immigrants the chance to become U.S. citizens “if they meet certain requirements over a period of time” ― although the same survey also found 50 percent in support of deporting all such immigrants back to their home country.Trump has made contradicting statements on the matter, both publicly and privately. Latino supporters who met with him over the weekend told reporters that he indicated openness to legal status for undocumented immigrants, or even a solution that would involve them visiting the embassy or consulate of their country first rather than traveling back to their country. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) encouraged the GOP nominee to move away from that policy, according to Trump backer and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. It’s not clear that he is actually open to legal status for undocumented immigrants in the style immigration reform supporters want ― he and his campaign have said his positions haven’t changed.Instead, he and campaign aides say he would focus his efforts on building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, deporting criminals and enforcing laws to block undocumented people from employment ― more standard fare on immigration than the initial promise to deport all undocumented immigrants.“There’s no legalization. There’s no amnesty,” Trump told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday. “And if somebody wants to go the legalization route, what they’ll do is they’ll go, leave the country, hopefully come back in. And then we can talk.”But he tested the waters with his supporters earlier this week. He tried out a few hypotheticals with a crowd on Wednesday and found support for all of them, including one that painted a sympathetic picture of an undocumented immigrant. “You have somebody that has been in the country for 20 years. He has done a great job, has a job, everything else, OK?” Trump said. “Do we take him and the family — her or him or whatever — and send them out?” Some people in the crowd shouted, “No!”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
6,POLITICS,"If Anyone Can Save Us From A Trump Presidency, It's Women",Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-voters-trump_us_57c05369e4b085c1ff290056,A poignant reminder on the anniversary of the 19th Amendment.,2016-08-26,"A poster, published by the League of Women Voters, urging women to vote just after the 19th Amendment granted them the right.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c05a101800002100bcd544.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump likes to suggest that the Second Amendment is in peril. But it’s the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, that has him on the run.The amendment went into effect 96 years ago on Friday, which is commemorated as Women’s Equality Day. And in November, women will use their hard-fought right to likely keep one of the most sexist presidential candidates in modern history out of the Oval Office. Women have skewed Democratic for decades, but this year the numbers could be even more dramatic. Women voters are overwhelmingly supportive of Hillary Clinton; while their male counterparts still lean towards her opponent.Donald Trump is faring terribly in the polls with women: Sixty percent of female likely voters said they’d go for Clinton in a head-to-head matchup against the reality TV star, according to a Quinnipiac poll out Thursday. Meanwhile, 48 percent of men said they’d vote for Trump, versus 42 percent for Clinton. An Economist/YouGov poll has Clinton polling 10 points ahead of Trump among women when you throw third-party candidates into the mix. Men, meanwhile, were 4 points more likely to choose Trump than Clinton. And an NBC/SurveyMonkey poll found Clinton was up 21 points with female voters, but male voters preferred Trump by 6 percent.There’s been a lot of talk of how Trump’s popularity with white men is shaping the election, but less focus on women: not “soccer moms” or “security moms” or some other reductive description for female voters, who for some reason are treated as a special interest group in U.S. politics. They are not. Women makeup 52 percent of the voting-age population in the U.S. And women vote at higher rates than men. In 2014, 43 percent of women voted, compared with 41 percent of men, according to Census data. And many women may have extra incentive to turn out this year and vote for the country’s first woman president and against Trump, whose history of offensive remarks about women has dogged him throughout his campaign.Even though women are still woefully underrepresented in the Senate, the House and governor’s offices around the country, the power of the 19th Amendment ensures that we do have a voice in U.S. politics.Fittingly, one of Trump’s most vocal business supporters ― billionaire Peter Thiel ― has said before that women earning the vote was bad for Democracy. While that’s of course not true, we can say with certainty that the 19th Amendment hasn’t been good for Trump himself. This is a man who seems determined to treat women as less than full human beings. He has called women pigs; said pumping breast milk and women going to the bathroom are “disgusting”; expressed the idea that husbands shouldn’t let their wives work outside the home; and made it clear that the primary way he considers women is based on looks.He holds rallies where his opponent is called a “bitch” and worse ― and lately has portrayed Clinton as a hysterical, unstable woman. His campaign CEO has a dodgy history with a domestic violence charge. While Trump’s daughter Ivanka has attempted to portray her father as an advocate for women’s rights, and there is evidence that he promoted and encouraged the women who worked for him at his real-estate company, his policy platform offers little on women’s issues: nothing on paid leave, some vague talk about equal pay if it’s “deserved,” and a child care tax credit that would clearly benefit those in the upper-income brackets.Come November, women will have the final say on whether that disconnect is going to work.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
7,POLITICS,"Yes, Citizens United And Other Court Rulings Led To A Rise In Dark Money",Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dark-money-supreme-court_us_57c09b32e4b0267344500abb,"No, it wasn't like this before the court started deregulating campaign finance.",2016-08-26,"Political strategist Karl Rove co-founded the dark money group Crossroads GPS, the most prolific advertiser among independent groups in the 21st century.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c09b9e1600003503bfebb4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In case there was still any argument left on the matter, a new report from the Wesleyan Media Project and the Center for Responsive Politics shows how much spending by groups that don’t disclose their donors soared in response to Supreme Court decisions that deregulated campaign finance.Although there has been a lot of ink spilled (or keyboards mashed) showing how undisclosed or “dark” money surged following the court’s recent campaign finance decisions, this new report goes one step further by examining the actual number of advertisements these groups ran from 2000 through 2016. This unprecedented look at dark money shows definitively that there can be no other reason for the dark money surge than deregulatory court rulings.In the 2000 election, dark money nonprofits aired more than 34,000 advertisements, according to the report. This number dropped by half to slightly above 15,000 for both the 2004 and 2006 elections before skyrocketing to over 158,000 in 2008. By the next presidential election in 2012, dark money groups ran over 383,000 ads. You can see these surges in the chart below.What the report shows that is new is that the surge in dark money spending was not an illusion created by new disclosure rules enacted in 2002. That year, Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, more popularly known as McCain-Feingold after its bipartisan Senate co-sponsors, John McCain and Russ Feingold. It included requirements that independent groups, like nonprofits or 527s or even political party committees, disclose their election spending within certain windows before an election. This disclosure requirement even included spending that simply named candidates immediately before an election.Previous examinations of the surge in dark money looked at this disclosed spending. The new report’s look at actual advertisement airings adds a new wrinkle to this by providing a measure that goes back before the McCain-Feingold disclosure requirements were put in place.Or as Robert Maguire, political nonprofit investigator for the Center for Responsive Politics, says, “This shows more conclusively than any study done in the past that there really is a change in quantity that goes along with court decisions and the lack of oversight of these groups that has allowed nonprofit groups to be a much more tantalizing vehicle for people who want to hide their political spending.”The two surges, first in 2008 and second after 2010, came in response to two Supreme Court decisions and one rule-making by the Federal Election Commission that significantly loosened campaign finance rules. In the 2007 Wisconsin Right to Life case, the court ruled that certain nonprofit corporations could spend corporate money on electioneering so long as it stopped short of calling for the election or defeat of a candidate. This is what we’d call “issue ads.” The FEC followed up this ruling by gutting a new regulation imposed by the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law requiring all independent groups spending money on elections to disclose their donors.Then in 2010, the court ruled in the Citizens United v. FEC case that corporations and unions could legally spend unlimited sums of money on elections so long as it remained independent from candidate campaigns and political parties. Although the court’s ruling included a strong endorsement for donor disclosure, the ruling essentially lifted a major obstacle to dark money in elections by allowing nonprofits to use corporate donations to fund express electoral expenses.Why does this even matter? Well, those connected to dark money groups have repeatedly defended the practice by stating that they were simply trying to level the playing field. In particular, Karl Rove, who helped launch the dark money nonprofit Crossroads GPS, which came under fire from Democrats, argued in the Wall Street Journal that “liberal groups have operated for decades in the same way GPS does without Democrats complaining.”Although it is certainly true that both Democratic and Republican nonprofits did operate similarly by spending money on elections without disclosing their donors before Crossroads GPS formed, they did so at a wildly lower volume than Crossroads GPS and other groups did after the Supreme Court loosened the rules. That increased volume has been largely driven by groups that popped up after court rulings ― like Crossroads GPS.In fact, Crossroads GPS, founded in 2010, has aired more ads than any other independent group from 2000-2016. The conservative nonprofit aired more than 207,000 ads, according to the report. That is 50,000 more ads than the second most prolific ad buyer, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Once defended by Rove as a grassroots conservative nonprofit, Crossroads GPS has practically disappeared as a political force since it nearly lost its nonprofit status ― the very thing protecting it from disclosing its donors. The group’s tiny staff, however, has moved on to another nonprofit called One Nation. The new group has only run ads in the 2016 election, but it is already in the top 30 among all independent spenders.“The idea that Crossroads or any of these groups are active in the same way that a handful of groups were active in the past is absurd,” Maguire says.And now there’s a study to prove it."

The distressing image underscored the horror of the ongoing siege between government and rebel forces in Syria. Aleppo has been divided between the government-controlled western portion and the rebel-held eastern portion since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, putting civilians in the crossfire.

One by one the coffins are loaded into ambulances and taken to another collection center. Only then does a lone man decide to leave the pallet where he’s curled up and taken refuge to cry alone. “They just took my wife away,” he laments. The bodies that are carried out of the garage cross paths with other bodies that have just been pulled from the rubble of a three-story building by firefighters. “There are seven more here,” shouts a young man with the Red Cross. The mountain of rubble, where more than 30 men are searching tirelessly, is lit with powerful spotlights. Someone signals for the group’s attention. Others bring a stretcher and white bags.

12,POLITICS,Progressive Activists Take A Seat For The People At Federal Reserve Retreat,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-reserve-fed-up-jackson-hole_us_57bf7095e4b02673444f65b5,"This time, top officials gathered to listen to the reformers' ideas.",2016-08-26,"Fed Up activists, seen here in February 2016, have converged on the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole retreat this week.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bf71951800002100bcd38b.jpeg?cache=s7o6hn9E1M&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two years ago this week, the nonprofit Center for Popular Democracy and allied groups launched the Fed Up campaign, aimed at making the Federal Reserve more accountable to workers and communities of color. They converged then on the Jackson Lake Lodge in Wyoming, where Fed officials decamp every year to discuss policy and hobnob with the economic elite.How much political headway has the campaign made since then? This year, Fed Up activists were essentially put on the schedule for senior Federal Reserve officials, with a major meeting at the Jackson Hole summit.The group met Thursday, the first day of the summit, with eight of the 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks and two members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.Fed Up activists have met individually with the governors and regional bank presidents before; they spoke with some Fed officials less formally at the past two Jackson Hole gatherings. This is the first time, however, that their delegation of some 120 rank-and-file activists had met with so many of the central bank’s decision-makers in one place.“It is kind of like a mini-FOMC,” said Fed Up campaign manager Jordan Haedtler prior to the event, likening it to a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s policymaking body.The progressive campaign is calling for the central bank to wait for the economic recovery to reach more broadly across America before raising its benchmark interest rate again, a move that slows the pace of economic growth to head off price inflation.It has also criticized the Fed for the lack of racial, gender and professional background diversity among its senior officials, arguing that only a central bank that looks like America can craft policy in the best interests of all citizens.The Fed officials at the meeting were Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which hosts the annual symposium; New York Fed president William Dudley; Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan; Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari; Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester; Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren; San Francisco Fed president John Williams; Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker, and Fed governors Stanley Fischer and Lael Brainard.“They were really impressed with how well prepared we were,” said Haedtler after the meeting. “They were heartened by the discussion.”“We’ll see how things go in September,” he added, referring to the next opportunity for an interest rate hike.Bill Medley, a spokesman for the Kansas City Fed, also gave positive feedback about the meeting.“It was a productive dialogue, as it always is, and we look forward to continuing the conversation,” Medley said.Fed Up has had a banner year so far. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton embraced the broad contours of its platform in May after weeks of private discussion with group representatives. “Secretary Clinton believes that the Fed needs to be more representative of America as a whole as well as that commonsense reforms — like getting bankers off the boards of regional Federal Reserve banks — are long overdue,” a Clinton spokesman said at the time.But Clinton stopped short of signing on to a bolder reform proposal that Fed Up rolled out in April, which would turn the central bank system into an entirely public institution. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors is already a federal agency, whose top officials are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. But the 12 regional banks it supervises are owned by the private financial institutions they serve. (Fed Up released a more detailed version of its idea on Monday.)The private nature of these banks is a major reason why they are run overwhelmingly by white men with backgrounds in finance, Fed Up argues. There has never been a black or Latino president of one of the regional banks, the group notes in its reform proposal, and one-third of the current bank heads are alumni of Wall Street power player Goldman Sachs.Fed Up’s moment at this year’s Jackson Hole symposium was not without its hiccups.Earlier this month, Fed Up were informed that the Jackson Lake Lodge had canceled over a dozen of its room reservations. The hotel said a “computer glitch” had led to the overbooking of 18 rooms. But the fact that 13 of those rooms were booked by Fed Up raised concerns that they were being targeted.Although the activists found lodging at a nearby resort, Fed Up filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice, and members of Congress sympathetic to their cause sent Fed Chair Janet Yellen a letter asking for an explanation.In an apparent gesture of detente, George, the Kansas City Fed president, offered Fed Up the big meeting, and the campaign withdrew its objections to the lodging snafu.Fed Up agreed also to limit its presence in the lodge’s halls during a scheduled cocktail hour. In the past, activists have clustered inside the hotel to confront Fed officials in person. The group held a press conference-cum-rally outside the lodge before Thursday’s meeting. It also plans to run teach-in seminars and to canvass the city’s low-income neighborhoods to spread the word about Fed reform.But Haedtler, Fed Up’s campaign manager, wanted to focus on Thursday’s meeting. It is evidence, he said, that his fledgling movement’s priorities have made it into the mainstream.“We have clearly reshaped the discourse,” Haedtler said."

Their killer, disgruntled former WDBJ employee Vester Lee Flanagan, was filming when he gunned the pair down, and posted videos of the horrifying incident to social media before shooting himself dead during a police pursuit.Andy Parker then dedicated himself to anti-gun activism and lashed out at the NRA, saying at the time, “They messed with the wrong family.” He feared for his life as he took podium after podium, railing against lawmakers who voted against stricter gun laws.But over the past year, not enough has changed, so Andy Parker isn’t going to change.On Friday, he penned an op-ed in the New York Daily News, twisting his sword in the gut of “treasonous Republican leadership” that hasn’t moved toward reform despite a shocking amount of gun violence in America since Alison’s death.He writes:In the lead-up to this day, I’ve been asked what’s changed in the last year. The NRA still controls too many politicians. There is no new meaningful common-sense gun legislation passed at a federal level, and terrorists on watch lists can still buy weapons even if they can’t board a flight.READ MORE: Father of slain reporter remembers his daughter’s strengthHe pointed a finger directly at House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), a “coward” politician known for undermining a 9/11 first responder health care bill and refusing to hold hearings on gun control in his district after Parker and Ward’s slaying.Andy Parker continued:My only question for him was, “Bob, how do you sleep at night?”Today, Parker says he won’t falter in his fight for gun control. He won’t let us forget about Alison, and he won’t stop fighting “to be free of gun violence.”“Momentum is on our side and it’s only a matter of time until we prevail,” he said. “The needle has moved, and I’m not going to lose this fight. I’m Alison’s dad.”"

The country music group, which consists of singers Brian Kelley and Tyler Hubbard, joined forces with the boy band for the song “God, Your Mama, and Me.” The single is featured on FGL’s third studio album, “Dig Your Roots,” debuting Friday.The Huffington Post spoke to Kelley and Hubbard by phone as the duo promoted their first foray into the whiskey business, Old Camp Whiskey. The guys told us they’ve been fans of BSB for years ― the group provided Kelley’s first concert experience in 6th grade and their music was the first Hubbard owned on CD. Over the years, FGL told press about their love for the ‘90s band, and their words eventually reached the right people.“We got some good energies and good vibrations out and, next thing you know, Nick Carter was hanging out on our bus at the CMA Fest this summer,” Kelley said. “We played him the song and things just happened so quick. But you gotta jump on things like that when they happen and it was just a bucket list collaboration for us.” Earlier this year, BSB’s Nick Carter and Brian Littrell caused a stir when the two posted photos on Instagram announcing their Florida Georgia Line collaboration. Though the bands didn’t record in the studio together, Kelley says the final product is everything they thought it would be. “I mean, their voices sound amazing with ours,” Kelly said. “It just sounds amazing, it sounds exactly like we thought it would. Just having them on the record was a dream. Something that we were saying when the song was actually done ― me and Tyler had it done ― and we said it sounds kind of like a modern day Backstreet Boys song.” He’s not wrong.

The legendary entertainer’s social justice organization Sankofa.org will host the “Many Rivers To Cross Festival” in Atlanta, Georgia, on Oct. 1. The two-day music and arts event will serve as a platform for artists, community organizers and activists to collaborate on the advancement of voting rights, mass incarceration and police relations ― to name a few.Jesse Williams, John Legend, Common, Chris Rock and Carlos Santana are among the list of names set to participate. Belafonte said during a press call Thursday that the event, which has been billed as the “largest music and arts festival dedicated to racial and social justice,” will give artists the platform to connect their material with topics surrounding relevant issues, such as America’s judicial system. “Most of the artists will be dealing with material that’s relevant to the issue of justice and incarceration,” Belafonte said. “One of the things that we asked was that they create material to [discuss] the miscarriage of justice as the case may be.”The civil rights pioneer added that Sankofa has partnered with BET to film the the event which will be announced at a later date.In terms of laying the ground work for “Many Rivers To Cross,” Belafonte says he initially met with Prince, who he called “a force,” during its planning phase.“I was supposed to meet Prince on the week he died,” he said of the late musical icon. “We were going to have our fourth meeting in New York when we got word that he had unfortunately passed away.”Belafonte says the music icon’s tribute song, “Baltimore” ― which was recorded following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray ― will serve as a centerpiece for the event.In addition to the list of empowering symposiums and performances, fans will have the opportunity to meet community organizations and thought-leaders at the “Social Justice Village.” There will also be an activation area which will provide attendees with additional info on advancing today’s human rights issues.For Public Enemy member Chuck D, who is performing at the festival, the importance and urgency of artists and cultural leaders to come together and accept their responsibility for change is long overdue. “Historically, artists have come from the communities that face these same issues,” he said during the call. “But for the past 30 years artists have listened to and followed the program of their lawyers, agents, managers who have kind of dangled money in their career to get them away from the accountability and responsibility.“So this is necessary. Artists linking up with real situations, real people doing real things to redefine our society is necessary.” For more info on the “Many Rivers To Cross” festival click here."

Drew Gattine (D) accused him of being racist after the governor said he kept a binder full of drug traffickers arrested in Maine and that more than 90 percent of them were black or Hispanic. In an interview with the Portland Press Herald, Gattine denied he had made the claim.In the voicemail, obtained by the Press Herald, LePage directed several obscenities toward Gattine.“Mr. Gattine, this is Governor Paul Richard LePage. I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you cocksucker,” LePage said. “I want to talk to you. I want you to prove that I’m a racist. I’ve spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker. You, I need you to, just freakin’, I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you.”Listen to the full voicemail below:In January, LePage said men with names like “D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty” were dealing drugs in Maine and impregnating white women. Earlier this week, he said the binder he kept proved he isn’t racist because it supported his statements about the racial makeup of the traffickers.LePage released a statement Friday, saying he was angry and apologizing for his language.“When someone calls me a racist, I take it very seriously. I didn’t know Drew Gattine from a hole in the wall until yesterday. It made me enormously angry when a TV reporter asked me for my reaction about Gattine calling me a racist. It is the absolute worst, most vile thing you can call a person,” he said. “So I called Gattine and used the worst word I could think of. I apologize for that to the people of Maine, but I make no apology for trying to end the drug epidemic that is ravaging our state.”The governor also said that he never intended to harm Gattine.“When I said I was going after Gattine, I meant I would do everything I could to see that he and his agenda is defeated politically. I am a history buff, and I referenced how political opponents used to call each other out in the 1820s — including Andrew Jackson, the father of the Democratic Party. Obviously, it is illegal today; it was simply a metaphor and I meant no physical harm to Gattine,” he said. Gattine did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the incident, but he told the Press Herald that LePage’s voicemail was “inappropriate and uncalled for.”“What I said to the television reporter today is that the kind of racially charged comments the governor made are not at all helpful in solving what the real problem is,” Gattine told the Press Herald. “And that is, we have a crisis in the state of Maine of people overdosing on heroin and prescription drugs and we are not doing enough with respect to treatment and prevention.”After leaving the voicemail, LePage publicly attacked Gattine and invited a television crew and Press Herald reporter for an interview in which he said he wished he could duel Gattine.“When a snot-nosed little guy from Westbrook calls me a racist, now I’d like him to come up here because, tell you right now, I wish it were 1825,” he said, according to the Press Herald. “And we would have a duel, that’s how angry I am, and I would not put my gun in the air, I guarantee you, I would not be (Alexander) Hamilton. I would point it right between his eyes, because he is a snot-nosed little runt and he has not done a damn thing since he’s been in this Legislature to help move the state forward.”LePage and Gattine have clashed on a number of issues, according to the Press Herald, including the governor’s effort to get rid of food stamps in his state.LePage’s voicemail prompted Westbrook’s mayor, council president and school committee chair to write an open letter to the people of Maine condemning their governor. “Once more Governor LePage has humiliated himself and the Office of the Governor. He continues to again embarrass the citizens of this wonderful State,” they wrote. “LePage’s voicemail to Representative Gattine is so outrageous it is beyond our ability to know how to respond. Furthermore, his threat to want to ‘shoot him between the eyes’ would be reprehensible coming from anybody, but from the individual holding the position of Governor of our State is insanity.”Democratic leaders in the state legislature said the comments showed LePage was not fit to hold office.Gattine wasn’t the only target of LePage this week. On Wednesday, he called Khizr Khan, the father of a killed American soldier, a “con artist” for criticizing GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.This post has been updated with a statement LePage released Friday and a letter from officials in Westbrook to the people of Maine."

He’s a great guy who has done incredible work with charities,” McDowell said. “I’m confident that Pine Bros. fans will support our decision to give Ryan a second chance.”“Love your brothers,” text on the company website reads ― somewhat appropriately, given Lochte’s status as a consummate “bro.” “They’ll love you back.” This story has been updated with comments from Pine Bros and Lochte."
