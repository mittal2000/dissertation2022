King, the daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., is standing up to the dangerous rhetoric of Donald Trump. On Tuesday, Trump made one of his most inflammatory statements yet, when he “joked” about the possible assassination of Hillary Clinton, should she become President of the United States. During a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump said: “If she gets to pick her judges ― nothing you can do, folks. Although, the Second Amendment people. Maybe there is. I don’t know.”While a spokesperson for the Trump campaign later defended the statement, claiming he was really talking about the “power of unification,” his comments have been condemned by the Clinton campaign and across social media. One of the most important voices to speak out was Dr. King’s daughter, Bernice A. King, an activist who is currently the CEO of the King Center. On Tuesday evening, she posted a response to Trump’s comments that pretty much sums up what made the presidential candidates words so unacceptable:Assassination is no joking matter, and certainly not one that should be so flippantly mentioned in the speech of someone running for president. Of course, Trump has gotten away with saying a lot of awful things. But hopefully this recent comment, and the powerful responses of people like Bernice A. King, will give at least some of the people supporting Trump something to consider before they vote. "

The two women are left wondering why they were told that their basic displays of public affection were deemed inappropriate by the people who complained, including a Mariners staffer.On Friday, Giuliana Garcia and Calista Nabors attended the Mariners’ home game against the Anaheim Angels. Garcia, a San Francisco Giants fan, was there to watch the Angels’ new pitcher, Tim Lincecum, a former Giant who lasted three innings that night against some hot Mariners bats.Sometime around the seventh inning, the couple was on the concourse waiting for friends when they were approached by an usher and told that a complaint had been filed against them; They needed to stop “being affectionate” because this was a “family friendly environment” and their actions were against the park’s code of conduct, the women said they were told. That code of conduct bans “displays of affection not appropriate in a public, family setting.”They visited guest services, where the couple said they received an immediate, unequivocal apology. Garcia filed a complaint then posted it on Instagram:They were told they would receive a phone call from a manager over the weekend. On Monday they received a voicemail from Amy Swisher, senior manager of guest experience, who issued an apology:“I just want to apologize to you,” Swisher said in her voicemail message. “We do have a code of conduct as far as what people are doing in the ballpark, but hugging and embracing is totally fine. And I’m kind of upset with my staff that they made an issue of it. I want you to know that we spoke with [the staff member who reprimanded you], and we’ve coached her on what violates our code of conduct and what doesn’t. She feels bad and I’m just kind of appalled by the whole situation. I’m so sorry for what you guys went through. This is not how we treat people. It goes against our beliefs and the Mariners way, and I am, like I said, very very sorry about it.”Swisher also invited the couple back to a later Mariners game “to make up for it.”After receiving the voicemail, Garcia was pleased with the Mariners’ response, even if she was still shaken that someone would complain about two lesbians showing affection. She felt the team was handling the incident well, and that it was an isolated incident. Still, she wanted to speak out about the incident publicly so other teams could get ahead of these kinds of issues and make sure “this doesn’t happen to anybody else.”“It should not have happened,” she said, “but the way they handled it, I’m very impressed and appreciative with that.”Despite the overt apology by Swisher, and her absolving the couple of any wrongdoing in the voicemail, on Tuesday Mariners spokesperson Rebecca Hale spun a completely different story about what triggered the incident on Friday, telling Outsports that, according to reports, the couple acted inappropriately.Hale said the usher received two complaints — one of them from a fellow Safeco Field staff member — that the two lesbians were “making out” with one another and should be stopped. Plus, despite Swisher telling the couple that the usher regretted the encounter, Hale told Outsports that the usher’s own written statement maintained that the couple was “making out” and that the usher “felt it was not appropriate for the public setting.”When asked about Swisher contacting the lesbian couple and apologizing, Hale dismissed the outreach as protocol.“We always try to reach out to people who filed a complaint,” she told Outsports. Garcia had filed a complaint about the complaint against her.Garcia was appalled by the new accusations.“That’s not true at all,” Garcia said. “They never said that to us. The entire line they’ve given me is that they recognized we were just embracing and we shouldn’t have been approached in the first place. So that’s interesting that they have never shared that complaint to me in any correspondence. We would never make out in public. We would never do that in public. It was just a quick kiss.”If this all sounds strangely familiar, it is. In 2008 another lesbian couple accused the Mariners of treating them badly after they kissed one another. Just like with Garcia and her girlfriend, that couple was accused by the team of “making out” despite the women maintaining that they did nothing more than “exchanging pecks” on the lips.In 2000, the Los Angeles Dodgers stopped a lesbian couple from kissing, only to hold its first informal LGBT Night weeks later to make amends for the mistake.Hale said the team’s objection to “displays of affection” comes down to a “reasonable standard” by the observing individual. If the usher receives a complaint, they can reject the complaint, act on it, or if they are unsure ask for the guidance of a more senior official with the team.“In this case it doesn’t appear the seating host went up the food chain based on her believe that this was behavior that was in conflict with code of conduct,” Hale said. Again, that is in direct conflict with Garcia’s report of what the usher said to her, and Swisher’s voicemail.Helen Carroll, head of the Homophobia in Sports Project of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, isn’t remotely surprised that, given the Mariners’ vague written policy and Hale’s vague guidelines for interpretation, a problem like this would arise.“It sounds like the Mariners need to do some training so everybody is on the same page,” Carroll said. “It shows the team is not on the same page at all, with one person apologizing and the other person accusing. And they have different standards of what is appropriate. It sounds like they have some issues within their own organization.“They need to really spell out what is appropriate and what is inappropriate. The perception of anyone who isn’t used to seeing same-sex couples be affectionate, it’s going to take them a minute to take that in.”For example, Carroll said her interpretation could be vastly different from someone else. To Carroll, “unless you’re rounding third base,” kissing by same-sex couples should be accepted in a ballpark because she’s “watched straight people kiss in stadiums so many times.”Garcia and Nabors are now confused as to where they stand with the team. While they thought they had been invited back to Safeco Field for a game, given Hale’s comments they now fear they are the targets of accusations of wrongdoing. Either way, they continue to hope that every MLB team, including the Mariners, builds an understanding of public displays of affection between same-sex couples.Billy Bean, vice-president of social responsibility and inclusion for Major League Baseball, said each team is responsible for its own code of conduct in the league.“Each and every MLB club is governed and managed individually when it comes to their own stadium protocol,” Bean said. “Common sense prevails, as the goal of every venue is to ensure an enjoyable game experience for everyone....so they return.”Hopefully the Mariners can get this cleared up quickly, as the team’s LGBT Night is Aug. 19.For more from OutSports, check out these stories:The first Olympic marriage proposal in Rio is between a rugby player and her girlfriendMale Olympic gymnasts want to compete shirtlessNBC has a gay problem"

First, it was confirmed that the theme for the upcoming season of “American Horror Story” would remain a mystery until the premiere. Then, “American Crime Story” producers maintained the same level of irritating secrecy talking about what’s to come in “Katrina,” the Hurricane-Katrina-focused follow-up to last year’s installment, “The People vs. O.J. Simpson.”On Tuesday afternoon, executive producer Brad Simpson gave the crowd at the Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour the tiniest idea of what to expect in “ACS” Season 2.“There’s a writers room right now, working on ‘Katrina,’” he said. “ We’re just starting to get the episodes in. I’m sadly not going to make any big news, but you will have the famous people. You will also have the people who weren’t famous.”He continued: “It’s going to be about the intensity of what it was like to be there on the ground — and also the bigger crime, that Katrina was something that was predictable.”Simpson also said “Katrina” will be “tonally and thematically” different than “O.J.,” which we all could have assumed, and that it “turns the lens on America.” Showrunner Ryan Murphy also spoke about the upcoming series in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, admitting that some cast members from the first installment may return. He also revealed that the show is looking to cast the roles of former President George W. Bush, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin and former Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco.Back in January, Murphy also told THR that he wanted the show to be “a socially conscious, socially aware examination of different types of crime around the world.” “And, in my opinion, Katrina was a f***ing crime — a crime against a lot of people who didn’t have a strong voice, and we’re going to treat it as a crime. That’s what this show is all about,” he said. The only question we have at this point: Who will play Kanye West and Mike Myers? This post has been updated to include comments made by Ryan Murphy to The Hollywood Reporter regarding casting. "
3,THE WORLDPOST,"For These African Migrants, Life In China Isn't What They Were Promised","Eric Olander and Cobus van Staden, The China Africa Project",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/african-migrants-china_us_57aa5669e4b06e52746e420a,More and more Gambian migrants are giving up on their “Chinese Dream” and doing whatever they can to head home.,2016-08-10,An African man walks up a foot bridge in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou in Guangdong province.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ab179d1700002c00d1ddd0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"They did not know very much about China but they had heard it was the world’s second-largest economy and Africa’s leading trading partner, so they assumed there must be opportunity. Europe, of course, was their first choice but with European Union countries overwhelmed by migrants and cracking down on smugglers, China would have to do. Through a series of interviews and letters obtained by researchers, these Gambian migrants explained how they were lured by deceptive visa brokers who charged them a small fortune to pay for the long journey from Banjul to Guangzhou.The brokers told them it would be easy to find work and make thousands of dollars to send back to their families in Gambia. With few other viable options at home, these men, and they were all men, discovered almost immediately upon arrival in Guangzhou they had been lied to and they had made a dreadful mistake. Contrary to what they were led to believe, work was very hard to come by, particularly in a country where they could not speak the language. The high cost of living in China’s major cities also quickly drained the little money they came with. Soon, these migrants would be alone and destitute with no work, no money and the shame of having to admit to their families that they had failed. China, for its part, does not make it easy for African migrants. After years of lax enforcement, Chinese authorities are now regularly conducting immigration checks in migrant communities and detaining those who have overstayed their visas. African migrants also report considerable difficulties assimilating into Chinese society due to widespread discrimination against black people.Now, more and more Gambian migrants are giving up on their “Chinese Dream” and doing whatever they can to head home. This new trend of reverse migration from China is also known as “U-turning” and was recently documented by a pair of European scholars as part of an independent online multimedia research project. Dr. Heidi Østbø Haugen of the University of Oslo and Manon Diederich, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cologne in Germany, interviewed dozens of Gambian migrants to document their stories and learn more about the difficulties they faced both at home and in China. Haugen and Diederich join Eric & Cobus ― in the podcast above ― to discuss their digital project “U-Turn Asia.”What do you think? Are you sympathetic to the plight of these migrants or do you think they were naive and should have known about the challenges of life in China before embarking on this long, risky journey?Join the discussion:Facebook: www.facebook.com/ChinaAfricaProjectTwitter: @eolander | @stadenesque "
4,POLITICS,DOJ Tries To Make Nice With Judge Overseeing Major Immigration Case,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doj-immigration-case-dapa_us_57a9dcbee4b0aae2a5a13aeb,The department apologized after the judge accused its lawyers of being unethical.,2016-08-09,"The order for sanctions against the Department of Justice in a major immigration case reached the office of Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Now, the DOJ says it's sorry.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a9dd222a00002d004f928a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lawyers at the Department of Justice want to kiss and make up with the federal judge who accused them of misleading him during a major case over deportation relief for millions of undocumented immigrants. In new court filings submitted on Monday, DOJ was contrite about the whole episode ― which stemmed from an early stage in the multi-state challenge to President Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration ― and urged U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen to put the matter to rest.“We acknowledge and apologize for these mistakes, and for the valuable time the Court has expended on this matter as a result,” DOJ lawyers wrote in response to an earlier order by the judge. “But we did not intend to mislead the Court or to conceal any fact concerning implementation of the Guidance.”That “guidance” is Obama’s Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, which would allow certain undocumented parents to remain in the U.S. and apply for work permits for three years. Twenty-six states had joined a lawsuit against DAPA by early 2015, and the case ended up with Hanen, who issued a nationwide injunction blocking the program’s implementation.In May of this year, while the Supreme Court was considering the program, Hanen imposed sweeping sanctions on DOJ for “misstatements” made during his portion of the case. The judge complained that early in the proceedings, DOJ wasn’t forthright about how many DREAMers were receiving relief under another part of the program that wasn’t being directly challenged in the lawsuit.“Such conduct is certainly not worthy of any department whose name includes the word ‘Justice,’” Hanen wrote in his order, which imposed three hours of annual ethics training for all lawyers appearing for any of the 26 states that originally sued. But he also went a step further, ordering DOJ to turn over the personal identifying information of the immigrants who benefitted from the program during certain dates. The move drew strong criticism from immigration advocates, and Hanen later put it on hold pending further proceedings.In June, after the Supreme Court failed to issue a definitive ruling on DAPA’s future, the core of the dispute went back to Hanen. Now, DOJ wants to heal the rift between them.The Monday filing stressed that there was no “intentional misconduct” on the government’s part, but rather that lawyers made statements or submitted documents leaving the judge “with an incorrect understanding of the facts.”Because DOJ said it “acted in good faith at all times in the litigation,” it asked Hanen to set aside the earlier order requiring ethics trainings and the names of immigrants. It added that it’s already taking “voluntary measures” to require all the lawyers in the department’s civil division to attend a one-hour training within the next 90 days by “an outside expert in legal ethics and professional responsibility.”There’s no telling if Hanen will go along ― he’ll conduct a hearing on the matter later this month. But DOJ said in a court declaration it has “sincere hope that this training will help to assure the Court that we are making every effort to maintain the trust placed in the Department of Justice,” according to Benjamin Mizer, the head of the department’s civil division.Once this controversy is out of the way, the next step of the litigation will be to determine whether Hanen’s initial injunction blocking Obama’s immigration plan should be made permanent. That decision, too, should be headed to the Supreme Court, hopefully by the time a ninth justice is confirmed.H/T: Michael Scarcella at The National Law Journal"

Trump, a former reality TV star, has troubled many in the Republican establishment with his off-the-cuff, often insulting style, and controversial policies, including the proposed ban on Muslims visiting the United States and his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants.Ryan, Ayotte and McCain had criticized Trump’s feud with the family of Army Captain Humayun Khan, who died in the line of duty in Iraq in 2004 and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for bravery after his death. Trump has had a running dispute with Khan’s parents since they criticized Trump at last month’s Democratic National Convention.(Reporting by Brendan O’Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Gareth Jones)"

His subsequent insurance battle and his work to help victims of drunken driving are now spurring the 29-year-old to run for Wisconsin Assembly in the 47th District. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_632_5184_2824%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A last-minute radio ad in a Wisconsin Assembly district goes after a candidate for not “standing up” to Gov. Scott Walker (R). That candidate, Jimmy Anderson, is paralyzed from the chest down. Anderson, a 29-year-old Democrat, is one of three candidates running for the open seat in the 47th District in Tuesday’s election. The Construction Trades Coalition is behind the questionable ad, which also refers to giving Walker “walking papers”:When it comes to Scott Walker, Jimmy Anderson likes to talk tough. But to take on the governor, we need more than talk. When it came time to sign the recall petition, Jimmy Anderson didn’t sign, refusing to give Walker his walking papers. In 2010, a drunk driver hit the car Anderson was in. He lost his parents, his brother and the ability to move most of his body. His subsequent experience battling insurance companies and working to help victims of drunk driving pushed him to run for office.Anderson told The Capital Times that the reason he didn’t sign the petition to recall Walker in 2012 was because he hadn’t yet regained his ability to write after the crash. He called the ad “offensive.”“Whenever (organizers) would approach me, I would tell them that of course I would love to sign it but I just physically can’t. And I know that you can’t sign it for me because that’d be against the law,” he said. “I had to decline at the time.”Michael Ervin, the treasurer for the Construction Trades Coalition, defended the ad, telling The Capital Times, “Anderson’s use of his disability as an excuse for not signing the recall petition should be offensive to everyone with a disability and the voters of the 47th Assembly district.”Anderson uses an electronic wheelchair when he goes around campaigning, and his supporters use the phrase, “I sit with Jimmy.”Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist Daniel Bice called the Construction Trades Coalition spot “the worst political ad this year ― by far.” He also reported that the Operating Engineers Local 139, a union that represents 9,000 heavy equipment operators in Wisconsin, appears to be the group behind the Construction Trades Coalition. That union endorsed Walker in 2010 and 2014 but has since had a falling-out with the governor. Anderson is up against two other Democrats ― Fitchburg City Council members Julia Arata-Fratta and H. Tony Hartmann ― in Tuesday’s primary. No Republicans are running for the open seat. "
7,POLITICS,Polls Suggest Donald Trump Probably Can't Flip Rust Belt States,Janie Velencia,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-polls-pensylvannia-battleground_us_57aa40c8e4b0ba7ed23df890,He's trailing Hillary Clinton by double digits in Pennsylvania and struggling in crucial battleground states.,2016-08-09,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is losing ground to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in key states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida, according to recent polls.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57aa43741700002c00d1dc0c.jpeg?cache=RSkHEhKIco&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump has placed a big bet in his quest for the presidency: that his appeal to white working-class voters can make him competitive in Rust Belt states that traditionally vote Democratic. Increasingly, it looks like he’s going to lose that bet. A new set of battleground polls released on Tuesday show Trump trailing Hillary Clinton in the most critical states he’s hoping to flip. The Republican nominee sits 11 percentage points behind Clinton in Pennsylvania, taking just 37 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 48 percent, according to a NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll of registered voters. Similarly, a Quinnipiac University poll of likely voters conducted over the same week shows Trump 10 points behind, at 42 percent to Clinton’s 52 percent. Two other Pennsylvania polls released this week show Trump trailing by 10 points and 11 points. The HuffPost Pollster Pennsylvania chart, which aggregates publicly available polls, also shows a widening gap for Trump in the Keystone State. For Trump, being behind Clinton by double digits in multiple recent polls of Pennsylvania voters is bad enough. But Tuesday’s poll results in other key battleground states also portend a tough election night for the Republican nominee.In Ohio, Trump is trailing Clinton by 5 points, 38 to 43 percent, in the NBC/WSJ/Marist poll and by 4 points in the Quinnipiac poll, which has the race at 45 percent to 49 percent. The HuffPost Pollster chart also shows the race tied in Ohio, however.Trump is behind by 1 point in Florida, pulling 45 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 46 percent, according to Quinnipiac.The HuffPost Pollster Florida chart shows about a 2-point gap between the two candidates.Trump trails by 4 points in Iowa, where he’s polling at 37 percent to Clinton’s 41 percent, according to the NBC/WSJ/Marist poll. The HuffPost Pollster Iowa chart shows Trump about 3 points behind Clinton.The addition of third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein causes the race to tighten in both the NBC/WSJ/Marist and Quinnipiac polls. Clinton maintains an edge over Trump in Ohio and Pennsylvania, but ties with him in Florida and Iowa when third party candidates are added to the ticket.Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania are critical to winning the presidency. Since 1960, no candidate has ever prevailed without winning two of these three states. Not only do recent polls show Trump struggling in battleground states, they also show that he could be in deep trouble in others like Arizona and Virginia, which have historically been considered red states. Clinton has noticed, increasing her presence in states like Arizona and even Georgia in hopes of turning them blue.Trump has also suffered in national polls in the last two weeks. The HuffPost Pollster national Trump vs. Clinton chart shows him trailing Clinton by 9 points, 48 percent to 39 percent. He trails by the same margin in the aggregate of polls that include Johnson. NBC/WSJ/Marist surveyed 834 Pennsylvania registered voters, 889 Ohio registered voters and 899 registered Iowa voters on Aug. 3-7.Quinnipiac surveyed 815 Pennsylvania likely voters, 812 Ohio likely voters, and 1,056 Florida likely voters on July 30-Aug. 7.Both polls were conducted using live interviewers who made calls to landlines and cellphones. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

That means that if a veteran becomes homeless, he’ll get temporary housing within 30 days and permanent housing within three months.That’s a marked improvement from what veterans faced just a few years ago.When Denise O’Brien, a U.S. Air Force veteran, left her manual labor job due to an injury, she and her wife lived in the woods in Bergen County. They then secured a spot at a shelter in Hackensack where they remained for nearly year, according to NorthJersey.com.Only then was the couple able to get a subsidized apartment in Garfield where they’ve been living for the past six years, a place their daughter is able to visit.O’Brien was the first veteran housed by the Housing, Health and Human Services Center in Hackensack.Getting homeless veterans places to live has become a much more seamless operation, both in Bergen County and nationwide.The White House’s first-ever strategic plan to end veteran homelessness brought together HUD and the VA to tackle the issue together. HUD provides rental assistance, while the VA offers supportive services.Since 2010, the number of homeless veterans nationwide has dropped by nearly 50 percent. Bergen County began aggressively tackling the issue when it joined the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness, launched by first lady Michelle Obama in 2014. Last year, there were 17 veterans living in shelters in Bergen County and five without. This year, the area has 10 veterans living in shelters, and zero living on the streets, according to HUD. Since joining the challenge, Bergen County housed 125 veterans, according to N.J.com.“The men and women who have so bravely served our country deserve more than just our deepest gratitude,” Jim Tedesco, Bergen County executive, said in a statement. “They deserve to live securely and prosperously in our communities. That security starts with a roof over their heads.”Bergen County has looked to service providers to help find housing for vets. Those partnerships is what helped Vincent Weston, 52, secure housing last year more swiftly than O’Brien.Last year, the Army veteran was injured while working as a cook, a position he had for more than 30 years.

The Court of the Judiciary did, however, reject a motion by the state’s Judicial Inquiry Commission to remove him from the bench right away.The controversial justice sparked a firestorm in January when he issued an administrative ruling prohibiting Alabama probate judges from issuing same-sex marriage licenses. The order contravened the consensus interpretation of Obergefell v. Hodges, a June 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.Moore argued that the seminal ruling only struck down the same-sex marriage bans in Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee, since they were explicitly addressed in the decision. Federal courts have interpreted the Supreme Court decision as applying to other states as well. Almost immediately after Moore’s attempt to bar same-sex marriage in Alabama, the Southern Poverty Law Center, a Montgomery, Alabama-based civil rights group, brought ethics complaints against him. The SPLC celebrated the state Court of the Judiciary’s decision to deny Moore’s motion and continue to trial.“Roy Moore has abused his power to push his personal agenda for far too long,” SPLC President Richard Cohen said in a statement. “Alabama is a great state and it deserves better than a judge like Roy Moore who thinks he is above the law.” The Alabama chief justice views himself as a something of a folk hero for religiously devout social conservatives, and has previously taken a stand to protect what he sees as religious liberty.Moore was removed from the Alabama Supreme Court for an ethics violation in 2003 for refusing to comply with a federal court order to remove a stone monument to the Ten Commandments from the Alabama State Judicial Building. (Moore had sneaked the monument into the court overnight in 2001 without the knowledge of his fellow justices.) Alabama voters re-elected him in 2012.Alabama’s Judicial Inquiry Commission formally filed ethics charges against Moore in May, suspending him from the bench. He remains suspended.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated that Southern Poverty Law Center was based in Birmingham, Alabama. It is based in Montgomery, Alabama."
10,POLITICS,Here's The Most Indecipherable Defense Yet Of Donald Trump's 'Second Amendment People' Remarks,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-katrina-pierson_us_57aa5e93e4b0ba7ed23e17c4,"“He was saying what could happen ... He doesn’t want that to happen.""",2016-08-09,A large portion of Katrina Pierson's job is defending Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on television.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Supporters and staffers of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump had many explanations on Tuesday for his quip that “Second Amendment people” could do something about a potential President Hillary Clinton picking Supreme Court justices. The most indecipherable came from spokeswoman Katrina Pierson. Her comments to CNN raised a variety of possibilities: that Trump was talking about the need for pro-gun rights supporters to vote against the Democratic nominee or, perhaps, that he was talking about the need to prevent something that “could happen” if she became president.That second bit fell more in line with critics’ interpretation of Trump’s comments: that he was talking about violence under a Clinton presidency.“He was saying what could happen, as you said, what could happen,” she told Jake Tapper on “The Lead” after he pointed out that Trump specifically referred to events after the election.“He doesn’t want that to happen,” Pierson said. “And in order to stop that, people that support their Second Amendment rights need to come together and get out there and stop Hillary Clinton from winning in November.”Trump said at a rally earlier in the afternoon that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wants to “essentially abolish the Second Amendment.”“If she gets to pick her judges ― nothing you can do, folks,” he said. “Although, the Second Amendment people. Maybe there is. I don’t know.”The remark was quickly condemned as a threat of violence against Clinton or her potential judicial nominees, and some Democratic lawmakers called for Trump to be investigated by the Secret Service. The Clinton campaign put out a statement calling his comments “dangerous.”The Trump campaign, including Pierson, initially said Trump was talking about the power of pro-gun rights voters to keep Clinton out of office ― not referencing any concerns about violence at all.Pierson slipped from that argument when Tapper challenged her on the fact that Trump specifically referred to after the election, and she said Trump was talking about something that could happen but he doesn’t want to happen. She had been more on-message earlier in the segment.“He was talking about Hillary Clinton and gun control, essentially, which is something that has been talked about a lot on the campaign trail,” she said. “Hillary Clinton is a gun-grabber and everyone knows that if she’s in a position to appoint Supreme Court justices, she will do everything she can to remove the Second Amendment, so Mr. Trump was clearly pointing that out as he does every day on the campaign trail.” “We also know that unification is key, which is exactly what our statement says coming out,” Pierson continued. “There are a lot of Americans in this country who support the Second Amendment. There are millions of members of the NRA and the NRA endorsed Mr. Trump earlier than anyone in history. So this is very important in November, if you care about your Second Amendment rights, to get out there and vote.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
11,POLITICS,Why This Third-Party Candidate Could Spell Trouble For Donald Trump In Utah,Samantha Neal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/evan-mcmullin-donald-trump-utah_us_57aa32b3e4b0db3be07bfccc,Evan McMullin may help turn the traditionally red state blue.,2016-08-09,"Evan McMullin, a former CIA operative, could take enough votes away from Donald Trump to bring about a Hillary Clinton win in Utah.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57aa33d71800002000bc9cbf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Evan McMullin, former chief policy director for the House Republican Conference and CIA operative, filed as an independent presidential candidate Monday — a bid that poses a distinct problem for GOP nominee Donald Trump.It’s unlikely that McMullin will meaningfully shift the outcome of the general election. His announcement, however, reflects the efforts of many Republicans who refuse to vote for Trump, and his candidacy might conceivably turn the tide in one state: Utah, where White House run immediately was met with enthusiastic support. “People in Utah are especially disenchanted with their options this year,” McMullin told MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough on Tuesday. “They don’t know where to go. We have had an enormous outpouring of support since we announced; we’ve had people volunteering by the thousands to support us.”McMullin, a Brigham Young University graduate and devout Mormon, could pull a substantial number of votes away from Trump ― especially since the Mormon vote constitutes over 60 percent of the electorate in the reliably red state. High-profile Mormon leaders Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) have eviscerated Trump on numerous occasions, highlighting his incompatibility with Christian values.Many Republican strategists have acknowledged that Trump can’t win the presidency without holding down the states that Romney won in 2012, including Utah. The last time Utah swung blue was in 1964, when Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson ran against Republican Barry Goldwater. The 2016 presidential race, however, has been anomalous in many ways ― and Utah’s potential flip might prove as yet another example. Compared to Republican nominees of past years, Trump has been polling poorly in the Beehive State. Romney locked down the Utah vote by a landslide in 2012 (he had 73 percent of the vote, compared to Barack Obama’s 25 percent), as did John McCain in 2008 (62 percent to Obama’s 34 percent). But CNN has recently changed Utah to “leaning Republican” from “strongly Republican” on its general election map.The HuffPost Pollster model shows that Trump is polling, on average, at 36 percent in Utah, just ahead of Clinton’s 28 percent. And Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is surging in the state, according to Dan Jones & Associates’ latest survey of Utah voters. He’s polling at 16 percent this month, up from 10 percent in July. Johnson’s sharp increase in support in Utah ― the state where he polls the highest ― signals that voters there are resistant to the major party candidates, and that they could be inclined to throw their support behind a third-party challenger.Although McMullin has missed the filing deadline in many states, the independent challenger still has the opportunity to collect enough signatures to appear on the presidential ballot in a substantial number. Utah, for instance, only requires 1,000 signatures (a relatively low threshold) by Aug. 15 to appear on the ballot. The candidacies of McMullin and Johnson, coupled with Trump’s crippling unpopularity among Mormon voters, might just split the Republican vote enough that Hillary Clinton could end up winning traditionally deep-red Utah.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
12,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Economic Plan Would Protect His Wall Street Adviser's Ugly Activity,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-economics-john-paulson_us_57aa19fee4b0ba7ed23daa96,Who could have possibly seen that coming?,2016-08-09,"Weeks after he said he'd reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, Donald Trump now wants to halt all new financial regulations.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57aa1ba31800002100bc9c50.jpeg?cache=KFjWr5hk7w&ops=crop_51_206_2949_1320%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Back on July 18, Donald Trump’s campaign announced that it was backing a major Wall Street overhaul. Reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, a priority of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), would be an official plank of the Republican Party platform.And then on Monday, Trump called to halt all new financial regulations. As Trump policy reversals go, this one was a slow burn, with Trump savoring three full weeks of consistency before deciding he’s okay with establishment Republican orthodoxy after all. Usually, the flip-flop is faster: One day, Trump says “our wages are too high.” A day or two later, he insists he’s never said such a thing.Reinstating Glass-Steagall would be a major reform. It would require the largest banks to break up into smaller, safer institutions, and bar banks that do the boring business of extending loans and accepting deposits from playing in the riskier world of securities trading. This separation between deposit-taking and securities trading would cut off risky activity from cheap, federally subsidized funding.But Trump’s ban on new banking rules wouldn’t just undercut his own Glass-Steagall proposal. It would also derail many of the smaller-bore reforms included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. One of those still-unfinished rules is designed specifically to prevent some ugly activity that a member of Trump’s economic advisory team instigated during the lead-up to the 2008 crash.Most of Trump’s economic team consists of major Republican donors from the finance and real estate worlds. The biggest of the bigwigs, however, is billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson. Paulson initiated the infamous Goldman Sachs “ABACUS” trade, which ultimately resulted in Goldman Sachs settling securities fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $550 million. Paulson went to Goldman Sachs asking the firm to create a new security linked to particularly bad mortgages that he expected to default. Paulson could bet against it, and when the mortgages blew up, he would make money. Goldman Sachs did it, and sold the security to its clients as an investment in the housing market.But Goldman Sachs also joined Paulson in betting against the new security. As a result, the firm was betting against its own clients and, according to the SEC allegations, deceiving them by failing to note that the security was created by people who expected it to fail, including Goldman Sachs itself. The case relied on disclosures ― the SEC argued that Goldman Sachs had committed fraud not because the trade constituted a massive conflict of interest, but rather because Goldman Sachs had not disclosed important information about the trade to investors.As ProPublica detailed in April, an SEC attorney wanted the agency to go after not only Goldman Sachs, but its managers and even Paulson himself. “Each of them knowingly participated, as did Goldman and Tourre, in a scheme to sell a product which, in blunt but accurate terms, was designed to fail,” SEC attorney James Kidney wrote in a 2009 memo obtained by ProPublica. “The current pre-discovery evidence suggests they should be sued for securities fraud because they are liable for securities fraud.”Paulson was not immediately available to comment, but told ProPublica that the hedge fund never mislead anyone on the deal. Ultimately, the SEC only pursued the lowest-ranking Goldmanite involved in the deal, Fabrice Tourre, who was fined about $825,000 in 2014. The SEC has faced plenty of criticism for being soft on Wall Street. But the agency and other regulators have protested that fraud cases are hard to win, and they want to be careful with limited resources.Dodd-Frank tried to make the SEC’s job easier. Section 621 of the law simply banned trades like the Paulson-Goldman deal. If there’s a conflict of interest, you can’t do it. Regulators wouldn’t have to prove that a failure to disclose the conflict was fraudulent. Congress ordered the SEC to finalize a new regulation fulfilling this vision within 270 days of the law’s passage. But the SEC never did. Dodd-Frank passed over six years ago, and while the agency unveiled a proposal in 2011, it never acted on it. In April, eight senators, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), sent a letter to SEC Chair Mary Jo White urging her to finalize the rule. White has yet to take action.If Trump has his way, she’ll never have to.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Pro-government forces are trying to advance into the city from the north and east.On Sunday night the Saudi-led coalition killed nine civilians in an air strike outside Sanaa.In a separate development, residents in Azzan in Yemen’s southern Shabwa province said Al Qaeda militants had dismantled their checkpoints and had withdrawn from the city on Tuesday following airstrikes - apparently by the Saudi-led coalition forces - targeting their positions there.The militants took advantage of the country’s wartime chaos to seize control of much of southernYemen, but have suffered military setbacks inflicted by coalition-backed local forces.Saudi Arabia and its mostly Gulf Arab allies intervened in Yemen’s civil war in March 2015 after the armed Houthi movement had pushed the Hadi administration into exile in Saudi Arabia.The coalition has launched thousands of air attacks on the Houthis and their allies in Yemen’s army, but paused the strikes on Sanaa in March after reaching an informal agreement with the Houthis to tamp down combat on the Yemeni-Saudi border.Imposing a near-blockade aimed at weapons shipments to the Houthis, the coalition had mostly allowed Sanaa airport to operate civilian and humanitarian aid flights since March.(Reporting by Mohammed Mukhashaf; Writing by Noah Browning; Editing by Gareth Jones)"

But the rapid construction of reinforced hangars at all three features indicates that this is likely to change,” CSIS said in a report.China claims most of the South China Sea, through which $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei have overlapping claims.The images have emerged about a month after an international court in The Hague ruled against China’s sweeping claims in the resource-rich region, a ruling emphatically rejected by Beijing.The United States has urged China and other claimants not to militarize their holdings in the South China Sea.China has repeatedly denied doing so and has in turn criticized U.S. patrols and exercises for ramping up tensions.“China has indisputable sovereignty over the Spratly islands and nearby waters,” China’s Defence Ministry said in a faxed response to a request for comment on Tuesday.“China has said many times, construction on the Spratly islands and reefs is multipurpose, mixed, and with the exception of necessary military defensive requirements, are more for serving all forms of civil needs.”Ties around the region have been strained in the lead-up to and since The Hague ruling.China has sent bombers and fighter jets on combat patrols near the contested South China Sea islands, state media reported on Saturday, and Japan has complained about what it has said were multiple intrusions into its territorial waters around another group of islands in the East China Sea.The hangars all show signs of structural strengthening, CSIS said.“They are far thicker than you would build for any civilian purpose,” Gregory Poling, director of CSIS’s Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, told the New York Times, which first reported on the new images. “They’re reinforced to take a strike.”Other facilities including unidentified towers and hexagonal structures have also been built on the islets in recent months, CSIS said."

Most fear a looming reprisal by the ISIS militants that captured the city two years ago.SINJAR, IRAQ – A dust storm lashed the mostly uninhabited city just south of the eponymous mountains that has been in existence as a settlement since at least the 4th century.But since the so-called Islamic State took over Sinjar, located in northwestern Iraq, on August 3, 2014, it has been cleansed of a majority of its civilians, most of whom belong to the ancient Yazidi religious minority group that has called these mountains home for over eight centuries.‘‘We can’t go to the front right now, and it’s best not to go out at all,’’ a member of the Asayish, the security forces and primary intelligence agency for Iraq’s Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), told Refugees Deeply.“They shoot at us whenever they think coalition aircraft will have a harder time targeting them, due to weather conditions. I’ve received information they will be attacking soon,” the officer added.Deeming Yazidis “non-believers,” ISIS imprisoned civilians who failed to escape during its attack two years ago and killed at least 5,000 others, leaving the bodies in mass graves. The Sinjar massacre, where men were rounded up and shot and their wives and children abducted, raped and tortured, has left a harrowing imprint in the minds of residents who fled.In November 2015, the city was retaken by a massive operation involving Kurdish and Yazidi forces backed by the U.S.-led coalition. But with the frontline only a few miles away, very few of the town’s Yazidi inhabitants have returned.Much of the city has been destroyed, with sandbagged entrances to tunnels running under former homes, covered markets turned into crumpled masses of rafters and abandoned wares and rubble awaiting removal. Graffiti extolling the virtues and might of the ISIS “jihadists” remain on many of the buildings.When walking around the streets, there is no semblance of home or community. Desolation and tension hang heavy in the air.Many of the Yazidis who had been living here have left for Europe or are still in the hands of ISIS. Others remain in IDP camps in the areas controlled by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).Getting to Sinjar entails a few hours’ travel after passing through a military checkpoint that requires special authorization. After passing through, one option is a road winding through mountains still scattered with internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, tents and children running around. The alternate route is menacingly close to Mosul, pockmarked with crater-holes left by bombs and sporadic triangular signposts to warn drivers.After spending a night in the city, during which rockets hit outlying areas in three places, Refugees Deeply spoke to a man from the area named Fares Elias. The 27-year-old was trying to connect his welding shop to electricity from a utility pole that was among those still standing.No services have been restored. But various security forces present in the city – including the Asayish, the Peshmerga and the PKK-linked Yezidi Sinjar Resistance Units (YBS) – have generators and the Peshmerga provide water to the few inhabitants that have returned.Elias’ family’s home is the only inhabited residence on the street. A protective wall prevents those on the street from knowing whether anyone is inside the house, a feature that saved the family when they were trapped for a week after the city was captured by ISIS in August 2014.‘‘Not even our neighbors who joined ISIS knew we were here,’’ Elias’ mother, 56-year-old Manje Murad, explained, adding that they didn’t go out at all and baked bread in the basement to prevent the smell from wafting too far.Their chance for escape came when an ISIS position was struck about a week after the group took over the city, which had nearly 90,000 inhabitants in 2013. There are no reliable figures for the number of people who have returned.‘‘We gave the children Valium (tranquilizers) and left, carrying them and walking through the night, through a valley and up a mountain, trying to be as quiet as possible,’’ added Elias’ father, Kheiri.He said that they were later helped by Kurdish armed groups to get to Malikiyah in neighboring Syria and then later to Zakho, in northern Iraq.‘‘As soon as we heard that [our] town had been retaken, some of us came back.

18,THE WORLDPOST,The Specter Of ISIS Reprisal Keeps Fearful Yazidis From Returning Home,"Shelly Kittleson, Refugees Deeply",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yazidis-fear-return-to-sinjar_us_57a9fb69e4b0ba7ed23d8929,"Despite Kurdish forces retaking Sinjar and its neighboring towns in northern Iraq last November, few of the region’s historic",2016-08-09,"A sandbagged entrance to a tunnel built by ISIS under a home in Sinjar, when the group captured the city on August 3, 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a9fc4e1700003400c721b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Despite Kurdish forces retaking Sinjar and its neighboring towns in northern Iraq last November, few of the region’s historic residents are returning. Most fear a looming reprisal by the ISIS militants that captured the city two years ago.SINJAR, IRAQ – A dust storm lashed the mostly uninhabited city just south of the eponymous mountains that has been in existence as a settlement since at least the 4th century.But since the so-called Islamic State took over Sinjar, located in northwestern Iraq, on August 3, 2014, it has been cleansed of a majority of its civilians, most of whom belong to the ancient Yazidi religious minority group that has called these mountains home for over eight centuries.‘‘We can’t go to the front right now, and it’s best not to go out at all,’’ a member of the Asayish, the security forces and primary intelligence agency for Iraq’s Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), told Refugees Deeply.“They shoot at us whenever they think coalition aircraft will have a harder time targeting them, due to weather conditions. I’ve received information they will be attacking soon,” the officer added.Deeming Yazidis “non-believers,” ISIS imprisoned civilians who failed to escape during its attack two years ago and killed at least 5,000 others, leaving the bodies in mass graves. The Sinjar massacre, where men were rounded up and shot and their wives and children abducted, raped and tortured, has left a harrowing imprint in the minds of residents who fled.In November 2015, the city was retaken by a massive operation involving Kurdish and Yazidi forces backed by the U.S.-led coalition. But with the frontline only a few miles away, very few of the town’s Yazidi inhabitants have returned.Much of the city has been destroyed, with sandbagged entrances to tunnels running under former homes, covered markets turned into crumpled masses of rafters and abandoned wares and rubble awaiting removal. Graffiti extolling the virtues and might of the ISIS “jihadists” remain on many of the buildings.When walking around the streets, there is no semblance of home or community. Desolation and tension hang heavy in the air.Many of the Yazidis who had been living here have left for Europe or are still in the hands of ISIS. Others remain in IDP camps in the areas controlled by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).Getting to Sinjar entails a few hours’ travel after passing through a military checkpoint that requires special authorization. After passing through, one option is a road winding through mountains still scattered with internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, tents and children running around. The alternate route is menacingly close to Mosul, pockmarked with crater-holes left by bombs and sporadic triangular signposts to warn drivers.After spending a night in the city, during which rockets hit outlying areas in three places, Refugees Deeply spoke to a man from the area named Fares Elias. The 27-year-old was trying to connect his welding shop to electricity from a utility pole that was among those still standing.No services have been restored. But various security forces present in the city – including the Asayish, the Peshmerga and the PKK-linked Yezidi Sinjar Resistance Units (YBS) – have generators and the Peshmerga provide water to the few inhabitants that have returned.Elias’ family’s home is the only inhabited residence on the street. A protective wall prevents those on the street from knowing whether anyone is inside the house, a feature that saved the family when they were trapped for a week after the city was captured by ISIS in August 2014.‘‘Not even our neighbors who joined ISIS knew we were here,’’ Elias’ mother, 56-year-old Manje Murad, explained, adding that they didn’t go out at all and baked bread in the basement to prevent the smell from wafting too far.Their chance for escape came when an ISIS position was struck about a week after the group took over the city, which had nearly 90,000 inhabitants in 2013. There are no reliable figures for the number of people who have returned.‘‘We gave the children Valium (tranquilizers) and left, carrying them and walking through the night, through a valley and up a mountain, trying to be as quiet as possible,’’ added Elias’ father, Kheiri.He said that they were later helped by Kurdish armed groups to get to Malikiyah in neighboring Syria and then later to Zakho, in northern Iraq.‘‘As soon as we heard that [our] town had been retaken, some of us came back. We now take turns being here,’’ Kheiri explained.‘‘But for now, it’s not safe. One night, six rockets fell in the area within 20 minutes. I didn’t sleep until 2 a.m., waiting to see if we should leave [again],” Elias pointed out.Desperate for outside assistance, some of the more prominent members of the Yazidi community have contributed their own money, resources and time. However, they express doubts that any large-scale return will be immediate or certain, especially without substantial international support.Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi MP who became well known in the wake of the conflict-induced displacement for using her own money to ‘‘buy the freedom’’ of several women taken as sex slaves by ISIS, spoke to Refugees Deeply at her home in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi-Kurdistan.She claimed that she had had to pay as much as $20,000 for some families, and that she had seen girls as young as nine years old who had been raped.Some of the Yazidi survivors of sexual violence have been sent to Germany for medical and psychological rehabilitation, and Dakhil said that many of women and girls say now that they would like to return afterwards.Refugees Deeply also met with Mirza Dinnayi, head of the Germany-based humanitarian organization Air Bridge Iraq and a Yazidi community leader, when he was in Erbil.He said that approximately 1,100 Yazidi girls and women were taken to Germany for treatment and that ‘‘many of them have lost most of their families’’ – thus, ‘‘even if a girl wants to come back, it would be to a camp, alone.”Dinnayi, whose organization was tasked with interviewing the women and girls prior to their transfer to Germany, said that returning to the camps with no prospects for the future was not a feasible option.Khidher Domle, another prominent member of the Yazidi community who has written a book about the mass kidnapping and enslaving of Yezidi girls called ‘‘The Black Death,” explained that the offensives that liberated ISIS-held cities – such as Shaddadi in northeastern Syria – led to many Yazidi families losing contact with family members in captivity.Over 3,000 Yazidis remain in ISIS hands, he said.Domle added that several hundred boys have reportedly been taken to ISIS training camps in both Syria and Iraq and are currently being “radicalized.”“They are being taught to kill their own family members,’’ he claimed.Sheikh Ido Baba, a brother of Baba Sheikh, the Yazidi spiritual leader, explained that there are hundreds of thousands of Yazidis living away from their homes.“Close to Erbil, close to Dohuk, some in Zakho – everywhere,” he specified, adding that it is not just the Yezidis who are leaving.“The Christians, the Muslims and the Kurds’’ also want to go, he said.“Some 40 percent of the area around Sinjar is still in the hands of Daesh,’’ he explained, using the Arabic description for ISIS. “And the people here are afraid of the Daesh mentality, which is still here, among the people living here.’’Back in Sinjar, one of the Asayish security officers recollected how the town had once been a place of refuge for Iraqis fleeing other cities.“First in 2004, when the Sunnis escaped’’ to Sinjar following the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, he said. “And then in 2014 when the Shia [fled an ISIS onslaught].’’“The schools [in Sinjar] were filled with IDPs then,’’ he recalled.For now, the schools and most of the homes in the city are empty and will remain so, as long as the possibility of an ISIS take-over remains a threat.Meanwhile, the U.N. officially recognized the Yazidis as “victims of genocide’’ based on their findings from the Sinjar massacre and related events, which were released in a June 2016 report.This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.
