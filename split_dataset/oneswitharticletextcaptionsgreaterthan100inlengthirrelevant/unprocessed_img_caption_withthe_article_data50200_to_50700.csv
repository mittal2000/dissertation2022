0,POLITICS,Liberals Put Corporate Democrats On Blast Over Trans-Pacific Partnership,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/not-down-with-tpp_us_579a7166e4b0e2e15eb518f9,They made their voices heard at the convention.,2016-07-29,Delegates show their opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement on the first day of the Democratic National Convention at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579a71b11200007404a54117.jpeg?cache=IcW09Umfa3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"So, that happened. This week, Philadelphia played host to the 2016 Democratic National Convention, where the big issue of the week was party unification after a bruising primary fight between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and the man she dispatched, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But while Sanders’ supporters have, to some extent, made peace with Clinton’s nomination, one issue emerged on which Sanders supporters, in alignment with economic liberals, refused to back down ― the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.On this week’s edition of “So That Happened,” we discuss the way constant criticism of the TPP seized a place in the spotlight.Getting the TPP in place, which would open up new trading avenues between the United States and Pacific Rim nations, has been a major project of the Obama White House and businesses. But it’s come under no small amount of bitter opposition, especially as national figures like Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D) have emerged as influential leaders on the left. And their skepticism as to whether the trade deal would work for all Americans has real merit.For example, one area of bitter disagreement is over what’s known as “investor-state dispute settlement.” Like a lot of global trade agreements, the TPP grants corporations the right to challenge laws passed by member nations that are deemed to be too restrictive to trade in international tribunals, which have final say in arbitration. Liberals don’t like this because the laws that are most likely to be tossed in the woodchipper are those that enhance environmental restrictions, labor rights and antitrust regulations.While conservatives don’t necessarily love those laws either, many of them dislike this arrangement simply because they have a basic, principled objection to international bodies interfering in America’s sovereign affairs. And it’s worth noting that there is no corresponding right for labor unions or environmental groups or humanitarian nongovernmental organizations to issue the same kind of challenges.A more specific objection to the way the TPP has come together involves Malaysia, a linchpin partner in the trade agreement. The Southeast Asian nation is well-known on the world stage as being among the worst actors in terms of human trafficking and slave labor. Rather than use the TPP as the basis to force Malaysia to embark on much-needed reform, the State Department ― which previously ranked the nation as a “Tier 3” violator of human trafficking laws (a certification that would have prohibited it from being part of the partnership) ― conveniently reclassified the nation as a mere “Tier 2” violator, thus allowing it to participate.So, the U.S. government withdrew a vital human rights “stick” and fed Malaysia a bunch of “carrots” it had not earned. And lest you think that not holding people accountable creates a culture of accountability, we’ll point out that the U.S. Department of Justice just froze $1 billion in assets that Malaysia’s prime minister embezzled from his nation’s sovereign wealth fund.Beyond the vocal opposition heard from those in the Wells Fargo Center this week, the TPP found its way into the news after ardent Clinton supporter and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe badly fluffed his talking points, implying to an interviewer at the convention that Clinton ― after having switched from being a TPP supporter to a TPP opponent (in its current form) ― was going to switch back after the election. This touched off a frenzy of denials from the Clinton campaign, followed by a day of awkward walk-back from McAuliffe (who is very pro-TPP).This made for an amusing twist in the horse race. But let’s face it, it also revealed something else ― whenever you hear politicians that live comfortably at the nexus of corporate and political power offer promises to oppose the TPP, they are well and truly being as phony as a rubber nickel. And the only thing that gives them pause is the threat of citizen prosecutors, like the ones who showed up in Philadelphia, threatening to capsize their electoral careers.That is why, despite what you’ve heard, they’ll probably try to pass this thing in the next lame-duck session.Also on this week’s “So That Happened,” Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) talks to us about Sanders’ campaign and Donald Trump’s tax returns, and we discuss the recent hack of the Democratic National Committee’s servers ― and the looming specter of Russia’s involvement.“So, That Happened” is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney. Joining them this week: Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid as well as Huffington Post reporters Akbar Shahid Ahmed, Christine Conetta, Ryan Grim, Mike McAuliff and Sam Stein.

1,POLITICS,Joe Biden Will Appear On 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit',Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-law-order-svu_us_579aaa27e4b0693164c0ab6b,He'll guest star on the show to support a very important cause.,2016-07-29,"Vice President Joe Biden, seen with actress and Joyful Heart Foundation founder Mariska Hargitay, will appear in an upcoming episode of ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579aab432a00002e004f72c7.jpeg?cache=yk3JcqIOpD&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Coming soon to your television set (or later to your Netflix binge): Vice President Joe Biden. He’ll tape an appearance Friday on “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” the popular and long-running procedural drama that focuses on sex crimes. Biden’s appearance will focus on the backlog of untested rape kits, according to the White House. Combating violence against women has been one of the top issues of Biden’s political career. During his time as a senator from Delaware, he introduced the Violence Against Women Act, which eventually passed in 1994, and as vice president he has been involved in efforts to stop campus sexual assaults.Biden has collaborated with “Law & Order: SVU” star Mariska Hargitay on advocacy efforts several times in the past. The two visited a domestic violence hotline together in 2013 and co-starred in a 2014 public service announcement. Hargitay narrated the video that played before Biden’s Democratic National Convention speech on Wednesday. Biden announced plans last fall to award nearly $80 million in grants toward eliminating the backlog of untested rape kits, in a combined effort between the federal government and the New York County District Attorney’s office. Rape kits are containers that include information and specimens, such as blood samples and swabs, gathered in an exam after a sexual assault.DNA evidence is often critical to prosecuting sex crimes, but more than 100,000 rape kits have never been tested, according to RAINN, an anti-sexual violence organization. In some states, they can be thrown in the trash, and no state gives a victim the right to retain a rape kit until the statute of limitations is up on the alleged crime.Hargitay founded the Joyful Heart Foundation, which works with survivors of sexual and domestic violence. The organization gave Biden an award earlier this year for his work on the issues.“When I wrote the Violence Against Women Act over 20 years ago, domestic violence was considered a private matter,” Biden said after receiving the award. “There was no hotline or special-victims units, and the legal system and public opinion routinely re-victimized the victim. I became convinced that if we pulled back the mask on this epidemic that occurred in the country, we can begin to not only change the laws, but we could change lives.”"
2,POLITICS,Fox News Contributor Savaged On Twitter After Scolding Hillary For Not Wearing Flag Pin,Mercy Yang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-flag-pin_us_579b743fe4b0693164c0f59e,"""Forget competence, intelligence and experience, it's f**king pins that matter.""",2016-07-29,"A commentator called out Hillary Clinton for not wearing a flag pin during her speech Thursday night, yet there were plenty of flags to be seen at the DNC.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579b75bf1200007404a542fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Twitter users are defending Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton after Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich attempted to jab her Thursday night for a supposed lack of patriotism ― all because she wasn’t wearing an American flag pin on her lapel.In a series of replies to Pavlich’s tweet, Daily Beast senior news editor Ben Collins posted screenshots of four male Republican presidential nominees at their own party conventions in years past ― George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, John McCain and Bob Dole. None of them wore flag pins, either.Other users ridiculed Pavlich, noting the huge American flag on stage. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump likewise tried to score points this week over what he called the “pathetic” lack of patriotic regalia at the Democratic convention.On Wednesday, the North Carolina GOP mocked Clinton’s running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), for supposedly wearing a Honduran flag pin during his nomination acceptance speech. It turned out to be a Blue Star service pin honoring Kaine’s son, a Marine. Ironically, many Republicans were impressed, surprised and even envious of the patriotic themes shown at this week’s Democratic convention, leaving them to wonder if the Democratic Party might be the new GOP.“Running for president is an act of patriotism,” the political analyst Mark Plotkin wrote last year in a blog post for The Hill. “For political consumption, it is not required to affix the flag pin on your clothes. The life you have led, the acts you have performed, the things you say and believe in: That’s how you should be viewed and judged.” "
3,POLITICS,"At DNC, Democrats Spoke Out On A Topic That Republicans Mostly Avoided","LAWRIE MIFFLIN and MEREDITH KOLODNER, The Hechinger Report",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dnc-education_us_579b7626e4b0693164c0f8fd,"Still, they dodged the most controversial issues.",2016-07-29,he Eagle Academy principal David Banks delivers remarks on the second day of the Democratic National Convention.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579b91dd1200008104a54362.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During the Republican and Democratic conventions, The Hechinger Report will publish a new story each day, examining what the party proposals might mean for the future of education. Our staff reporters will provide education coverage from Cleveland and Philadelphia. In her acceptance speech at the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia Thursday night, Hillary Clinton pledged to create new economic opportunities for all Americans by generating more and better jobs; expanding affordable childcare and preschool programs, and making higher education “debt-free for all.”Like other convention speakers, she spoke mostly about the bookend age groups of the education spectrum – very young children at one end, young adults at the other.“Bernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all,” she said. But she also said, “Here’s something we don’t say enough: college is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job. We’re going to help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it.”In striking contrast to the Republican convention, where education got cursory mention, the Democrats talked about it every night – although mostly in platitudes. Give all children a fair start with free preschool? Check. Help struggling learners stay in class and out of jail? Check. Crack down on crooked for-profit universities? Make college tuition free for most families, and reduce crushing college-loan burdens? Check, check.Absent were specific policy proposals about the K-12 education system. Almost no speaker, including Clinton, addressed such contentious issues as charter schools, excessive testing, the achievement gap, the technology-access gap, Common Core standards and the current racial segregation in so many of the nation’s schools.“This is an event that is designed to bring the party together, and there are these sharp divisions between the education reform folks and traditional education people, so it makes sense that they would avoid talking about them beyond generalities,” said Michael Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an education policy think tank.School choice and charter schools tend to be the divisive issues in the Democratic Party. Many unions – traditional bulwarks of Democratic get-out-the-vote efforts – support teachers and other educators in opposing charters because most charters employ non-union teachers. But many parents and even some union educators believe that certain charter schools merit support, for their efforts to find innovative teaching methods and to boost the learning success of children from historically disadvantaged populations. The Democratic platform states that charter schools should be authorized if they do not “replace and destabilize” existing public schools, a tough standard to meet.And when Clinton mentioned moderate support for some school-choice plans at a National Education Association union gathering earlier this month, she was booed.One of the featured speakers Tuesday night in Philadelphia was David Banks, the principal of Eagle Academy, a small alternative school whose creation Clinton supported when she was a senator. It has built a model for successfully educating low-income black and Latino male students; mimicking many charters, it requires students to wear uniforms, attend school until 5 p.m. and receive test prep and academic help on Saturdays.The Eagle Academies (there are now six) are not charters ― they are regular public schools. They emphasize music, art and athletics, not just academic subjects and test scores. But like a growing number of small-school networks, the Eagle Academies depend to some extent on private money to augment the funds they get from public budgets. The Eagle Academy Foundation raised $2.2 million in 2013 and 2014, according to the latest records.Related Link: How one innovative school district has closed the gaps on harder Common Core testsAlthough racial tension in the streets and with police forces were major topics at the convention, racial segregation in the nation’s schools was not – except for speeches highlighting Clinton’s past work to fight school segregation. Interestingly, the wife of Clinton’s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, actually lived through the process in Virginia, as he noted in his speech. Anne Holton, who stepped down as Virginia’s education secretary on Tuesday to join her husband on the campaign trail, was 11 years old when her father, Linwood Holton, became governor in 1970 and enrolled his children in previously all-black public schools in Richmond, in support of desegregation. That same year, Virginia stopped giving state tuition aid to white parents to send their children to “segregation academies.”As a young lawyer, Clinton exposed some of these academies’ whites-only policies. She posed as a newcomer to an Alabama town asking to enroll her children in such schools. Hundreds of these schools had opened across the country in the 20 years after the Brown v. Board decision, particularly in southern states like Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Virgina.More than four decades later, many still exist, particularly in the Mississippi Delta area. Related Link: Mississippi town still fighting desegregationConvention commentary on higher education ranged from Senator Al Franken’s comedy routine, where he mocked being ripped off as a Trump University student, to Jill Biden’s praise of community colleges as the nation’s “best kept secret,” to Bernie Sanders highlighting the way he and his supporters had pushed Clinton to adopt a more expansive free-college plank.“During the primary campaign, Secretary Clinton and I both focused on this issue but with somewhat different approaches,” he said. “Recently, however, we have come together on a proposal that will revolutionize higher education in America. It will guarantee that the children of any family in this country with an annual income of $125,000 a year or less, 83 percent of our population, will be able to go to a public college or university tuition free.”One who did speak about K-12 issues was Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, who said:“Let’s be honest, right now in this country we have two education systems. Not public and private, but rich and poor,” the former with laptops for all, the latter with metal detectors at school entrances.“That,” he added, “is not educating every child equally,” although like other speakers, he made no policy suggestions. His state includes the largest school system in the country, New York City’s, which is also one of the most segregated and unequal in the terms he used. Rep. Xavier Becerra of California praised Clinton for her past advocacy for children, and was among many who mentioned support for teachers. He said Clinton would “rebuild our crumbling schools. She’ll give our teachers the support and tools they need, and the pay they deserve.”Several teachers gave speeches during the convention. Dustin Parsons, a fifth-grade teacher in Bauxite, Arkansas, spoke Tuesday night. In an interview afterward, he said, “I want to keep hearing her vision for the future. What is her vision? How are we going to help keep education, schools moving into the right direction and not looking back? We went back and forth so many times, and now we’ve got to keep going forward.”This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

6,BUSINESS,Bill Clinton Could Be The 'First Spouse' Hillary Was Punished For Being,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-clinton-first-gentleman_us_579b7770e4b0e2e15eb59bda,No one expects this guy to bake cookies or host teas. And that's good news for America.,2016-07-29,"First mate? First dude? Hillary Clinton has said that if she wins the presidency, she'd like Bill to be called the ""first gentleman.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579b77b92a00002d004f7439.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last night, the dream seemed close to reality: A woman could be president. Hillary Clinton’s glorious blazing white pantsuit. Her strong words. Her triumphant acceptance of the Democratic nomination. All of it gave us an idea of what the future would look like with a woman in the Oval Office.Less clear is what path Bill Clinton will forge. What will it be like to be the first male “first spouse”? Will he be able to finally cut loose from the gendered expectations we hold for that role?Of course he will. If Hillary Clinton is breaking the glass ceiling, her husband is breaking the glass cage ― or whatever metaphor you want to use to describe the heavy weight of expectations that hold both women and men back in life. In his new role, Bill Clinton can redefine what it means to be a political spouse and bring us closer to gender equality.Is it a spouse’s job to stay home, bake cookies and host teas (the famous tasks Hillary Clinton seemed to disparage nearly a quarter-century ago)? Not if the spouse is Bill Clinton. There’s hardly anyone who expects him to do things like select tableware, craft menus or host social events. In December, Hillary said he wouldn’t do those things. She might.“Bill Clinton does not know his way around a china pattern,” The New York Times recently declared.OK, but how many Americans do know anything about china patterns in 2016? Bill Clinton is by all accounts a brilliant man. Did Michelle Obama, Harvard Law school graduate and longtime corporate lawyer, have an expertise in these matters? C’mon. No. Stop.Here’s what’s really going on. Men aren’t expected to do this stuff, but women are. It doesn’t matter if the man is a former president or a former corporate lawyer or a bricklayer or whatever. It doesn’t matter if the woman is an Ivy League graduate with decades of professional experience.While Bill isn’t expected to take on these duties, some are suggesting his daughter should. “An insult,” one DNC attendee told the Times in response to the idea.Of course, there’s nothing wrong with being a gracious host who sets a perfect table, arranges elegant events and keeps a home humming. The problem is if we want gender equality, if a woman can be president, we have to let go of the assumption that girls do girl stuff and boys do boy stuff. That’s over.Free from the gendered expectations we have for the presidential spouse, Bill can go another way. As “first gentleman,” or whatever you want to call him, Bill will finally achieve what Hillary was seeking as a political spouse decades ago: the choice to shape the job and the freedom from domestic duties that perhaps don’t seem all that fulfilling.And by showing himself to be a passionate and supportive spouse ― which he already did in his loving speech earlier this week in Philadelphia ― Bill is also already redefining what it means to be a man and a husband.The dated notion that women are homemakers but men don’t have to do that stuff is part of the reason that even in dual-earner couples, women still take on more of the child-rearing and homemaking tasks. It’s why so many of us are freaking exhausted.The idea that men don’t need to be supportive or care for a home or shouldn’t have to take a back seat to their wives also constrains men’s ability to develop as full, emotionally whole human beings.These unspoken gender expectations hold us back just as much as the ones that define who gets to be president or CEO.The reality is there aren’t many women or men these days who devote their lives to homemaking. In nearly half of two-parent households, both mother and father work outside the home.Forty-percent of American households are headed up by a female breadwinner. Most married couples look like Barack and Michelle did back in 2007 ― two careers, super busy. No time for picking out china.They look, of course, like Bill and Hillary Clinton. Two professionals who made choices about what they want to do with their adult lives.When Hillary Clinton defended that choice in 1992, she was crucified. In response to a question about conflicts of interest between her work at an Arkansas law firm and her husband’s job as governor, she made an admittedly inelegant comment that would haunt her for years.“I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life,” she said.It was before the social media age, but that quote essentially went bonkers viral. Some homemakers thought it was insulting. It certainly wasn’t the best way to put it, but what Hillary was doing was simply defending her choice to work.Would a man be criticized for saying something like that? Imagine if Bill Clinton said that today? What if he said: “I suppose I could stay in the White House and host teas, but what I’d like to do is continue my work for my foundation.”Would anyone take offense?"
7,POLITICS,Bernie Supporters Are Ready To Pay The Bills For The Revolution,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-delegates-crowdfunding_us_579b8b80e4b08a8e8b5de7dc,They just crowdfunded delegates traveling to the convention.,2016-07-29,"“Bernie supporters all across the world are excited about supporting him,” said Kimberly Tucker, a Sanders delegate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579b8eff1200007404a5434b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― When the cost of five nights in a high-priced hotel is combined with the price of food, travel and other expenses, delegates to the Democratic National Convention were warned they could spend as much as $4,000 to $8,000.Delegates for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were particularly determined to reach Philadelphia. So some of them did what the candidates do when they need money: reach out to equally fervent, likeminded Americans.At least 300 Democratic delegates or alternates raised more than $325,000 through GoFundMe, according to an analysis from the crowdfunding site. That’s an average of nearly $1,100 a piece. (Republicans gave it a lesser try: Some 60 delegates or alternates pulled in a total of $60,000 on GoFundMe.)While the site didn’t break down how many of those Democratic delegates were for Bernie, his multitudes of passionate supporters had already chipped in for him online. They showed a high level of engagement, to quote the political scientists.Kimberly Tucker, a 50-year-old delegate from Virginia who hadn’t originally intended to fundraise for the Philly trip, exceeded her GoFundMe goal of $1,000 in two weeks.“Bernie supporters all across the world are excited about supporting him,” she said, “and a natural extension of that is supporting his delegates.”Tucker also noted that the money she raised wasn’t enough to cover her expenses ― even with a roommate and the state of Virginia providing buses to the convention.The Democratic National Committee arranges hotel assignments for state delegations. The rooms can be expensive, especially since hotels raise their prices for convention week. Tucker’s room, for example, was about $500 per night. But none of that dimmed her enthusiasm. Tucker doesn’t even feel betrayed by Sanders’ endorsement of Hillary Clinton.“I’ve been following politics for a long time and that’s part of the process. I know people who aren’t familiar with the process might feel betrayed, but Bernie’s supporting the Democratic Party,” she said. “And as a Democrat, Bernie says that he’s going to do whatever he needs to do to make sure that Trump is not in the White House.”Helping a delegate attend a convention is one more way in which Americans can engage in politics, said Samara Klar, an assistant professor at the University of Arizona’s School of Government and Public Policy. “This is a hugely symbolic thing that somebody can do.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were particularly determined to reach Philadelphia. So some of them did what the candidates do when they need money: reach out to equally fervent, likeminded Americans.At least 300 Democratic delegates or alternates raised more than $325,000 through GoFundMe, according to an analysis from the crowdfunding site. That’s an average of nearly $1,100 a piece. (Republicans gave it a lesser try: Some 60 delegates or alternates pulled in a total of $60,000 on GoFundMe.)While the site didn’t break down how many of those Democratic delegates were for Bernie, his multitudes of passionate supporters had already chipped in for him online. They showed a high level of engagement, to quote the political scientists.Kimberly Tucker, a 50-year-old delegate from Virginia who hadn’t originally intended to fundraise for the Philly trip, exceeded her GoFundMe goal of $1,000 in two weeks.“Bernie supporters all across the world are excited about supporting him,” she said, “and a natural extension of that is supporting his delegates.”Tucker also noted that the money she raised wasn’t enough to cover her expenses ― even with a roommate and the state of Virginia providing buses to the convention.The Democratic National Committee arranges hotel assignments for state delegations. The rooms can be expensive, especially since hotels raise their prices for convention week. Tucker’s room, for example, was about $500 per night. But none of that dimmed her enthusiasm. Tucker doesn’t even feel betrayed by Sanders’ endorsement of Hillary Clinton.“I’ve been following politics for a long time and that’s part of the process. I know people who aren’t familiar with the process might feel betrayed, but Bernie’s supporting the Democratic Party,” she said. “And as a Democrat, Bernie says that he’s going to do whatever he needs to do to make sure that Trump is not in the White House.”Helping a delegate attend a convention is one more way in which Americans can engage in politics, said Samara Klar, an assistant professor at the University of Arizona’s School of Government and Public Policy. “This is a hugely symbolic thing that somebody can do. That’s a very high level of engagement,” Klar said of those who donated to the delegates. “The percentage of people who are willing to do that is, I imagine, is very small.”Klar and co-author Yanna Krupnikov of New York’s Stony Brook University wrote a book that helps explain the dedication of Bernie voters.Independent Politics, published in January, examines how Americans are responding to high levels of negativity in politics.

9,POLITICS,How Donald Trump Won The Convention Battle,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-clinton-conventions_us_579ab709e4b0e2e15eb54cd2,"Hillary Clinton’s was better, but Trump’s made him look more normal, which he badly needed.",2016-07-29,"Hillary Clinton and Democrats staged a smoother, more powerful convention, but Donald Trump's convention helped give him the image of a normal candidate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579ab7aa2a00002e004f72df.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA – It was a tale of two swing-state cities.Cleveland, where Republican Donald Trump’s official presidential nomination was marred by a prime-time speaker who refused to endorse him, a plagiarized speech from his wife, and a workmanlike acceptance address that painted a gloomy portrait of America.And Philadelphia, where Hillary Clinton became the Democratic nominee in a program that, despite early worries of divisive drama, featured A-list entertainment and soaring, optimistic speeches from the sitting president and vice president.First impressions notwithstanding, it was Trump who likely won.While the four days in Philadelphia brought Clinton the traditional benefits of a nominating convention – especially party unity and free media – Trump got from Cleveland something he needed far more: A big step toward normalcy.A reality TV star with a long, troubled business record, prone to grade-school insults against those who challenge him and a propensity for nearly daily falsehoods has, thanks to the Republican National Committee, won the veneer of a traditional presidential candidate. The packed arena, the roll-call vote, the repeated “next president of the United States,” the big balloon drop at the end – just like candidates from Ronald Reagan to Bob Dole to Mitt Romney have enjoyed.“For Trump, he had one job: be seen as a legitimate choice ― and honestly, just standing on stage and not throwing up did that,” said Steve Schale, the Florida Democratic strategist who helped President Barack Obama win that state twice. “Given that no one circles the wagons like the GOP, there was almost no chance he wouldn’t leave Cleveland with a bit of a boost.”How much attention typical voters pay to political conventions is unclear, particularly in recent elections as broadcast networks have devoted less and less time to covering them and other entertainment options have become easily available. Networks’ decisions were based, in large part, on the growing importance of primaries. Conventions have became less a place where choices and decisions are made, and more of a four-day advertisement (although both Republican and Democratic primaries this year held the possibility of brokered conventions).Still, most political professionals and observers see the conventions as the start of the general election campaigns, when the majority of voters start paying serious attention to the candidates. And as such, both sides expend tremendous amounts of time and energy trying to give the impression of party unity and showcasing the candidate in the best possible light.By those traditional measures, Democrats clearly had the advantage. Their main worry was that supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders would disrupt the proceedings, potentially making it harder for Clinton to bring the most liberal segment of the party onboard behind her. And while groups of Sanders’ delegates and guests managed to heckle speakers – including Obama – they were relatively few in number. More important, while they were audible in the hall itself, they were not really noticeable on the television feed, which is how the overwhelming majority of viewers see the conventions.Apart from that, leading Democrats, from Obama and Vice President Joe Biden to former President Bill Clinton and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, offered full-throated endorsements for Clinton while simultaneously painting Trump as dangerously unfit and unprepared.In sharp contrast, the only effective endorsements for Trump in Cleveland came from his own children. Among the previous GOP nominees and presidents still alive, only Bob Dole from 1996 attended. Former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush skipped the convention, as did the 2008 and 2012 nominees, John McCain and Mitt Romney.Romney, in fact, delivered a scorching speech in March to denounce Trump and is now considering an endorsement of Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson.Yet even that was outdone by Trump’s runner-up in the primaries, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who did appear at the GOP convention in a prime-time speaking spot, only to urge delegates to vote their conscience – the rallying cry of anti-Trump Republicans’ last attempt to deny him the nomination.The RNC, which held daily news conferences two miles from the Democrats’ convention arena to sell the media on how badly it was going, downplayed the significance of Cruz and the party’s other problems.“We might have had a couple of hiccups last week, but when someone came out and didn’t endorse the presidential candidate of our ticket, they were booed,” RNC strategist Sean Spicer said Thursday. “Night after night, speaker after speaker, some very prominent Democrats have been booed. Leon Panetta, [former] secretary of defense, booed last night. Former presidents, booed – by their own party.”But Mo Elleithee, a Clinton campaign aide in 2008 and now director of Georgetown University’s Institute for Politics and Public Service, said Republicans had a bad convention at a far more fundamental level than the scorecard of who endorsed and who was booed.“It’s the first real opportunity to begin to expand beyond the base and begin reaching out to a broader electorate. General elections are about addition ― appealing to a broader group and trying to bring them into the fold,” Elleithee said. “To that end, I think the Republican convention actually failed.”Elleithee said that with the exception of Trump’s children, the other GOP speakers largely stayed on Trump’s message that the United States is in terrible shape and that only he can set things right. “Most of the big-name speakers used a lot of the same rhetoric from the primaries that is alienating a lot of the broader electorate,” Elleithee said.Schale, of Florida, said that given Trump’s lack of knowledge or interest in the functioning of government, a much more significant inflection point in this election could well be the first debate this autumn.“I believe the biggest challenge Trump faces is this basic question, if he is up for the job. I am not convinced that toe-to-toe with Clinton that he can pass that test, and if he doesn’t, I think the race is functionally over at that point,” Schale said. “But if he does, I suspect it is going to be an exceptionally tight race with small margins in a small number of states.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

What is the solution? If military is the solution, military would have already done it. Military is not the only solution,” Khizr Khan told The Huffington Post in an interview on Friday. “To really eradicate terrorism is to join hands, not build walls and exclude each other. That is not a solution. That is adding fuel to the fire.”Pakistan-born Khan, 65, appeared on stage at Wells Fargo Arena, the site of the Democratic convention, with his wife, Ghazala, at his side. He spoke of the heroism of his son, Army Capt. Humayun S.M. Khan, who was killed in action in Iraq in 2004 by an advancing vehicle loaded with hundreds of pounds of explosives. The 27-year-old soldier, who was born in the UAE, ordered his unit to halt while he walked toward the vehicle, saving the lives of his fellow soldiers from the ensuing explosion.“If it was up to Donald Trump, he never would have been in America,” he said.Khan then addressed Trump directly, unleashing a searing critique of his proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States.“Let me ask you, have you even read the U.S. Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy,” Khan said, pulling a copy of the document from his pocket and holding it up in the air.“You have sacrificed nothing and no one,” he added.Last week, Trump said he was expanding his proposal to ban immigration of Muslims into the U.S. to include countries “compromised by terrorism.” The Manhattan real estate mogul has said such steps are needed in the wake of terror attacks in France, San Bernardino, California and Orlando, Florida.Reflecting on his speech at his hotel room a few hours after Hillary Clinton accepted her party’s nomination for president, Khan said he was humbled he could take part in such an historic moment.“It is a moment of pride for all of us that a minuscule person like myself would stand and address a convention,” he said. “I feel very humbled and very grateful. This is a great moment in American history. That gesture, that action, symbolized how the free world works, how democracy works.”Khan said he was inspired to speak in part by the U.S. Constitution, which he accused Trump of violating “every time he opens his mouth.” He called the Bill of Rights and the protections laid out in the 14th Amendment, in particular, his favorite portions.“That’s where the constitution comes alive,” he said, adding that he was a little embarrassed he showed the country how poorly he maintained it by carrying it in his pocket.But it was the prospect of a Trump presidency that truly worried Khan. He warned that if the brash businessman is elected in November, the country would face a constitutional crisis like it has never seen before.“Can you imagine him issuing an executive order? Who would follow that executive order? Which police department would go, ‘Alright folks we’re throwing you out,’” he said. “What a chaos it will be. Which sheriff will there be to execute those orders? 11 million people? How would you throw them out of here? Will we bring the army to expel these people?”Still, Khan remained hopeful that Republican leaders would come to their senses and reject their nominee before it was too late.“They’re going to begin to realize, either he doesn’t mean what he preaches,” he said, “or he just doesn’t understand most of it.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

With its self-defense classes for schoolchildren, the charity Ujamaa gives girls the confidence to say no – and the skills to back it up.DEDZA, Malawi – The girls at Makankhula primary school in Malawi’s Dedza district say they want to be nurses, so that they can take care of people.But as soon as class starts, fists and fingers start flying towards faces. The girls are learning how to hurt people, so that they can take care of themselves.“We teach these girls that they don’t have to fight using knives, stones. No, they use the parts of their body that they were born with,” says Alinafe Kambalane, a self-defense teacher working with Kenyan charity Ujamaa. The girls in the class start pumping their knees upwards. “As you can see, the girls are hitting the groins of the assailant, so that they can get away,” says Kambalane.According to UNICEF, one in five girls in Malawi has experienced some kind of sexual violence. Cultural norms and taboos make it difficult for victims of abuse to report incidents or get the support they need, and even less likely that the perpetrators will face any consequences. With the country’s adults failing to protect its children, Ujamaa wanted to put the power into the children’s hands. In late 2014, the charity started going to schools to teach self-defense and self-awareness classes.One of the students, Fazani, 14, used to be scared of the older men who followed and called to her on her way to school, but didn’t know what to do. “I told my parents about it, but they would ignore me,” she says.And Tiamiga, 17, didn’t know that what the boys at school were doing to her was wrong, although it made her feel bad. “A lot of boys used to grope me, but I was afraid of them beating me if I said no,” she says.Stories like these are common among Malawi’s girls and young women, says Nankali Maksud, head of child protection for UNICEF Malawi. “We know that young girls, as they’re walking to school, are inappropriately touched by men, by the taxi drivers, when they’re in school by teachers” and by their peers, she says.When it comes to being inappropriately touched, “young girls see that that’s the norm,” and don’t even recognize it as wrong, Maksud says.In its own survey of 11,460 female pupils, Ujamaa found that, on average, one in five girls reported having been raped. Teachers at Makankhula primary school say that many girls who have been raped stay silent because they usually know the perpetrators and worry about the repercussions of reporting them.“This is really key because I think a lot of the time, we tend to assume it’s strangers,” says Maksud. “It’s not. It’s uncles, step-fathers, fathers, neighbors,” as well as friends or boyfriends.The teachers say some students who are abused withdraw into themselves, cutting off close friends and family due to the fear of stigma and a sense of personal shame and blame about the rape. “When girls are abused, they can’t see a future, and can drop out of school or even kill themselves,” says Mary Waya, herself an abuse survivor and now a netball coach for Malawi’s national women’s team and for girls in her charity netball academy.For many girls, Ujamaa’s self-defense trainers are the only people they feel they can trust with the truth of their abuse. “Most of these shocking stories are how they have been harassed by men, and how they have not talked to anyone about it,” says Kambalane, a former social worker and now one of Ujamaa’s 50 teachers. The youngest girl so far to reveal to Kambalane that she had been raped was 12 years old.While two-thirds of the children Ujamaa trains are girls, the sessions also help boys combat bullying, violence and pressure from peers and parents to get girlfriends, leave school and marry in their teens.Many boys, like 17-year-old Godfrey, end up using their Ujamaa skills to protect girls.“I saw a man trying to rape a woman on the way home from school and I screamed ‘no’ and he ran away,” says Godfrey.In Kenya, where Ujamaa teaches children in slum areas, a study carried out by Stanford University found that half the boys had seen a man physically threatening or sexually assaulting a girl or woman within six months of the course ending. And around three quarters of those had managed to successfully intervene.But getting grownups to step in and stop the abuse will take more work, says Ujamaa board member Brendan Ross. “Getting through to [adults] is going to be three times harder,” he says, especially as Malawi’s customs include things like forced child marriage. “I think we know that sexual violence in the Malawian context is a social norm,” says Ross.Even if the justice system was serious about tackling the problem, “the prevalence of rape and sexual violence is so high that there’s no way that any system could respond to that,” he says.For now, the children have to challenge abuse on their own. And according to the Stanford University study, some are doing that already. The study showed that half the girls who attended Ujamaa classes reported using their new skills within a year, and in the schools where they were taught, rape rates fell by half.“These classes are really helpful because, if I come across attackers, I will be able to defend myself,” says Fazani, who now uses the first move taught in the class – saying or shouting “No” – against the men who used to follow her to school. “I now tell people ‘no’ and that I will tell an adult.”Tiamiga has also used that move to stop the boys who would grope her at school. It took her using another move, the eye poke – twice – to finally get rid of the boys who used to wait for her on the way home from school, often forcing her to skip school altogether.Now, she never misses school. “[The class] has been really useful and has helped me in my community,” says Tiamiga. “People have really seen the change in me.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

It hosts 30,000 military personnel on bases that cover a fifth of the island.“We are respectful of the feelings of Okinawans that our footprint must be reduced,” Lieutenant General Lawrence D. Nicholson, the U.S. commander on the island, said in a press release.Once new helipads are completed, the U.S. military will hand back 4,000 hectares (40 square kilometers) of land to the Japanese government, which is 17 percent of the area it controls.The tract is part of the U.S. Marine Corp jungle training camp known as Camp Gonsalves in Northern Okinawa.Okinawa was under U.S. occupation until 1972.The return of the land was agreed in 1996, but has been delayed by protesters blocking the construction of the helipads. The Japanese government recently resumed work at the site.Local resentment over the U.S. military presence surged after an American civilian working at a U.S. base, Kenneth Franklin, was arrested last month in connection with the murder of a local 20-year-old Japanese woman, Rina Shimabukuro.Nicholson announced a 30-day mourning period after the murder and temporarily banned marines from drinking off base. Washington and Tokyo agreed to limit legal protections and benefits to some U.S. civilians working for the military.The murder and a subsequent arrest of a U.S. Navy sailor for drunk driving spurred large scale demonstrations and calls, backed by Okinawa Governor Takeshi Onaga, for Washington to move military personnel off the island.After the rape of a Japanese schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen in 1996, the U.S. and Japanese governments agreed to relocate some troops outside Okinawa but said others would be moved to less populated parts of the island.(Reporting by Tim Kelly; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Michael Perry)"

Two other individuals with suspected ties to the attackers are also being interrogated by police, the source said.France is reeling from two strikes by assailants loyal to Islamic State in the space of 12 days. A Tunisian delivery man plowed his heavy goods truck through a crowd in Nice on Bastille Day killing 84 people.The security record of President Francois Hollande and his Socialist government is under intense scrutiny following the revelation that Kermiche carried out his attack despite being under tight surveillance for two failed bids to reach Syria.France had also been alerted by a foreign intelligence service that a suspected militant might be preparing an attack, with a nameless photo of Petitjean circulated among intelligence services.The two men stormed a church service, forced the 85-year-old Roman Catholic priest to his knees at the altar and killed him. They were later shot and killed by police.Unlike last year, when politicians mainly emphasized unity in the wake of militant attacks on the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper and on Paris entertainment venues, opposition politicians have strongly criticized Hollande’s leadership in the wake of the recent attacks.Nicolas Sarkozy, Hollande’s predecessor and potential opponent in next year’s presidential election, has called for stronger steps to track down and detain known Islamist sympathizers.He has called for the detention or electronic tagging of all suspected Islamist militants, even if they have committed no offense ― an idea rejected by Prime Minister Manuel Valls.“My government will not be the one that creates French-style Guantanamo centers,” Valls told the Le Monde newspaper.Valls said France had a strategy to defeat “Islamic totalitarianism” both in Iraq and Syria where it has launched hundreds of air strikes as part of a U.S.-led coalition, and at home. But he warnedFrance would be targeted again.“This war, which doesn’t just involve France, will be long and we will be subjected to other attacks,” he said.Islamic State’s affiliated news agency AMAQ released a new pre-recorded video late on Thursday purportedly showing Petitjean urging Muslims to destroy France.Addressing Hollande and Valls directly, Petitjean says in the recording: “The times have changed.

You know, Abraham Lincoln said, give the people the facts, and the republic will be saved,” Pence told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “I mean, I think that’s the point that [Trump is] making. He’s not encouraging some foreign power to compromise the security of this country.”Trump said on Wednesday that he hoped that Russia, which is suspected of hacking and leaking Democratic National Committee emails, would find the emails Clinton’s legal team deleted from the private server she used as secretary of state.“Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” he said.Clinton’s use of a private email server has been a common line of attack from Republicans. Her legal team deleted about 33,000 emails before handing over the rest to government officials, on the grounds that they were personal. The FBI was able to recreate some of them during its investigation into her email use ― an investigation that led to no criminal charges, but a rebuke from FBI Director James Comey that her State Department team was “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.” Trump was widely criticized for his remarks on Russia, including by Republicans. He said the next day that he was being sarcastic, although he had made the comments not just in the press conference, but also on Twitter afterwards.Pence seemed to take the issue more seriously, issuing a statement around the time of Trump’s Wednesday press conference saying, “If it is Russia and they are interfering in our elections, I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences.”He repeated that point to Hewitt on Friday.“If it is found that Russia or China or any other foreign power compromised the private email, or captured classified information, and then released that information through the WikiLeaks release or otherwise, there’d be serious consequences for that,” he said. Pence also defended Trump’s comments, insisting that he was simply saying that the American people would like to see Clinton’s emails.“He’s just making the kind of candid reflection that you know, the thing about Donald Trump that I’ve found so refreshing is that the man says what the majority of folks are thinking, and doesn’t worry about, you know, what the media has to say about that,” Pence said.“But the bottom line is that the people deserve to know what’s happening here,” he added later, “and I think Donald Trump calling attention again to these emails this week was an important part of the narrative during the Democrat National Convention.” Listen to the full interview:Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

We look at the obstacle course they,2016-07-29,"Ola Al-Junde, 43, is a Syrian math teacher who juggles her day job managing one school for Syrian refugee kids with volunteering at others.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579b8d2d1200008104a54344.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A quarter of a million Syrian children are growing up in Lebanon without an education. We look at the obstacle course they have to cross to get into the classroom.MARJ, LEBANON – Ahmad was 13 years old, but he looked nine. He swaggered through the schoolyard like a little boxer: feet spread wide, arms folded across his chest, trying to look tough.“I used to love the other school very much,” he said in a husky bellow, flexing his shoulders to look bigger. “It was prettier and better. We would go to study. Math, English – I studied a lot. We were among friends, and we used to love to go there.”The school Ahmad used to attend was run by the same organization as the one where he was standing, Kids for Kids, a nongovernmental organization funded by private donations. But there was one major difference: His old school was located directly inside Camp Rashid, the informal refugee camp in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley where he used to live.“This school has new friends,” he said. “But at that school I had all my friends. Here, they’re new. I don’t know them.”In May 2015, the hundred or so families who lived in Camp Rashid got a warning from the owner of the land that they had 48 hours to evacuate. Everything in the camp was dismantled, including the school where Ahmad used to study. After that, he started taking a bus every morning to his new school, which wasn’t close enough for him to walk.Even with the extra commute, Ahmad was one of the lucky ones. About half a million school-age Syrian children are registered as refugees in Lebanon. According to a new report by Human Rights Watch, over half of them – a quarter of a million kids – are not in school. Instead of spending their days in class, many if not most of them are working digging up potatoes, shining shoes, fixing cars or hauling bricks at construction sites.The barriers to keeping kids like Ahmad in school are legion. But the main one lies in something outside the schoolyard itself: the instability of refugee life, where a parent’s work and housing, a child’s school, or even an entire camp can be uprooted overnight. When parents’ lives are precarious, children end up not attending school. “In order for many of these families to be able to send their kids to school, Syrian families in Lebanon have to be able to make a living here,” says Bassam Khawaja, Sandler fellow in the children’s rights division at Human Rights Watch. “The issues are tied very closely.”Lebanon’s Ministry of Education has allowed Syrian children to enroll in public schools for free, with or without legal residency. This past year, 238 public schools opened a second “afternoon” shift especially for Syrian children. But Khawaja and the HRW team found a number of other roadblocks – many of them tied to the relentless difficulties of everyday life for Syrian families – keeping them from being able to enroll.Lebanon, a country with a population of just under 6 million, hosts about 1.5 million Syrian refugees – 1.1 million officially registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and an estimated 400,000 unregistered. In January 2015, the Lebanese government imposed several new restrictions on Syrian refugees. In order to get or renew legal residency – which is essential for passing checkpoints, getting to work and carrying out other daily activities without getting arrested – Syrians have to pay $200 a year, sign a pledge not to work and, if they are not registered with UNHCR, find a Lebanese sponsor.Because most of them can’t meet those requirements, humanitarian groups estimate that over two-thirds of the Syrians in Lebanon don’t have residency. And when parents cannot go to work without fear of arrest, their kids end up dropping out of school to work and support their families. The result is what Ola al-Junde, Ahmad’s former teacher from his old school, called “an epidemic of child labor.”Many of the Syrian children in Lebanon are working – often at dangerous or backbreaking jobs like welding or picking tobacco. Of those, the vast majority are not in school, and probably won’t go back. “The child who is 13 or 14 years old when he goes to work, and starts getting money, even if it’s just a little, will become a worker and not a student,” says Junde, who now juggles her day job managing another school with volunteering at Kids for Kids (which has since changed its name to Gharsah Team, for a plant or seedling, especially one transplanted in a new place). “Even psychologically, there becomes a barrier between him and learning.”Classes are free, but getting to them is not: transportation can cost from $10 to $50 a month, according to HRW. Even $10 a month is a lot for most Syrian refugees, about 70 percent of whom live below the Lebanese extreme poverty line of $3.84 per person a day, and 89 percent of whom are in debt. Ahmad and his friends were able to take a special bus, organized by Al-Junde; others are not so lucky. “It’s the relationship between the residency policy, and the economic or the livelihood situation of a refugee family,” says Khawaja. “This, and the economic situation that they’re living in, is what’s causing them not to be able to afford to send their kids to school, even though the enrollment fees themselves are covered.”Even when families live close enough to walk to school, Khawaja found that many Syrian parents don’t feel safe allowing their kids to walk home, since the second shift ends after dark in the fall and winter, and Syrian kids are vulnerable to sexual harassment and attacks. Human Rights Watch documented extensive cases of Syrian students facing harassment, bullying and physical attacks from other students, bus drivers and even teachers.Parents face hostility as well. School directors often impose arbitrary requirements on Syrian families, such as asking them for paperwork that the Ministry of Education does not require. Khawaja’s team spoke to one Syrian mother who tried to explain to one such school official that UNICEF told her she could enroll her children; according to her testimony, the school official threw her papers in her face and told her “go boil the paper and drink it with UNICEF.”All of these difficulties build on each other, making an insurmountable barrier for Syrian kids. High dropout and low enrollment rates, for example, lead to a catch-22: Schools won’t offer afternoon classes in a given grade without a minimum of children (25 for grades 1–6, and 20 for 7–9). When classes in their grade level aren’t offered, Syrian students end up having to repeat a previous grade, and often drop out, further fueling the problem that put them there in the first place.Alternative schools run by NGOs like Gharsah Team can help, at least temporarily. Syrian parents from Rashid Camp said they felt more comfortable sending their children to schools inside their camp, with Syrian teachers like Junde and her colleagues, who know how to talk to children traumatized by war. “It’s like a miracle to us,” said a 35-year-old mother of five from Homs, who gave her name as Umm Hassan. “All of the kids were outside of the tents, doing nothing, and then they were getting an education.”Unlike the official Lebanese schools, alternative schools are allowed to employ experienced Syrian teachers like Junde, who taught math for 14 years in Syria before moving to Lebanon during the war. Turkey, Jordan and Egypt allow Syrian teachers to work in public schools; Lebanon, which has by far the highest number of refugees per capita in the world, and faces internal political pressure against employing Syrians, does not. “This is something that Lebanon has refused to do, and I think they’re losing out on an opportunity to take advantage of that population,” says Khawaja. “We are asking for the Lebanese government to allow Syrians to teach in Lebanon, in whatever form, either in non-formal schools or as teaching assistants.”But while alternative schools can fill the gap, only the official Lebanese public schools offer the accreditation needed for children to advance from one grade to the next. “We push our students in the alternative programs to go to the formal education,” says Junde. “We always stress that alternative education is a stopgap between the students who don’t attend school at all and the formal education system. We try to empower the students during one year so we can send them to official Lebanese schools.”Ahmad was one of the success stories. A year and two months after leaving his old school, he is now enrolled in an official Lebanese school. He even goes twice a week to sing in a choir, says Junde with pride, “and he succeeded.”This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply.

Poland is renowned for keep its Catholic flame burning during decades of Communist rule.As the 79-year-old pope was blessing the altar at the start of the Mass, he tripped on a step but was helped up by aides and did not appear to be hurt. He continued the Mass and read his homily normally. Francis suffers from sciatica, a medical condition in which pain sometimes shoots down the leg from the lower back.The shrine is home to the Black Madonna, a Byzantine icon from sometime between the sixth and ninth centuries and brought to Poland some 600 years ago. The icon is painted on wood and covered with silver and jewels.The shrine has been a focal point in difficult periods of Polish history. Poles flocked there to pray when martial law was declared by the communist government in the early 1980s.The late Pope John Paul II, who reigned for nearly three decades until his death in 2005, visited the shrine often during his trips to his homeland and donated the blood-stained white sash he was wearing on May 13, 1981, when he was shot in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican by Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca."

(AP Photo/Bullit Marquez)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK, July 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - More than half of newborn babies are not breastfed within the first hour of life, putting them at heightened risk of disease and death, the United Nations’ children’s agency said on Friday, highlighting sub-Saharan Africa as an area of concern.Feeding babies within an hour of birth passes on critical nutrients, antibodies and skin contact with their mothers that can protect them, UNICEF said.Delaying breastfeeding by two to 23 hours after birth increases the risk of a baby dying in its first month by 40 percent and delaying by 24 hours or more increases the risk of death to 80 percent, UNICEF said.Studies shows newborns account for nearly half of all deaths of children under age 5.UNICEF, which has been campaigning to promote early breastfeeding, estimates 77 million babies around the world each year are not breastfed within the first hour of their life. It estimates about 130 million babies are born each year.“Breast milk is a baby’s first vaccine, the first and best protection they have against illness and disease,” France Bégin, UNICEF senior nutrition adviser, said in a statement.“Making babies wait too long for the first critical contact with their mother outside the womb decreases the newborn’s chances of survival, limits milk supply and reduces the chances of exclusive breastfeeding.”Efforts to promote early breastfeeding have been slow, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where mortality rates for children under age 5 are high, UNICEF said.Early breastfeeding rates nudged up to 60 percent in 2015 from 51 percent in 2000 in East and Southern Africa and were unchanged in West and Central Africa, it said.In South Asia, rates of early breastfeeding tripled from 2000 but 21 million newborns a year are not breastfed in the first hour, UNICEF said.Among the obstacles, UNICEF said, doctors, nurses and midwives assisting births in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia are less likely to promote early breastfeeding than are unskilled attendants or relatives assisting.In some countries UNICEF said it is customary to feed a baby infant formula, cow’s milk or sugar water in its first three days.If all babies were fed nothing but breast milk from birth to six months, more than 800,000 lives could be saved each year, UNICEF said.Around the world, 43 percent of infants less than 6 months old are fed breast milk exclusively, according to UNICEF. Those who are not breastfed at all are 14 times more likely to die than those fed only breast milk, it said.The figures were released ahead of World Breastfeeding Week running from August 1 to August 7 in more than 170 nations.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5797c3c01200007404a538d6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Kenyan government’s decision in May to close the world’s largest refugee camp sent shockwaves through the humanitarian aid community. But the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, has put out a new appeal to donors for additional funds to help relocate and reintegrate Somali refugees from the Dadaab refugee camp.There are 343,043 refugees in Dadaab ― the majority are originally from Somalia, but refugees from Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya live there as well. The U.N. set up the camp in 1991 for those escaping Somalia’s civil war.The UNHCR initially appealed for $369.4 million to address the humanitarian needs of about 1.1 million internally displaced Somalis and close to 1 million Somali refugees living in Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya. Now, it’s appealing for an additional $115.4 million to address, among other priorities, the needs of Somalis in Dadaab. The new funds will go partly toward effectively moving some refugees back to Somalia and relocating others to another refugee camp in Kenya.The UNHCR hopes to move about 50,000 Somalis to their homeland, but only those who have volunteered to go. While many Somalis are reluctant to return to Somalia, the UNHCR is incentivizing refugees with benefits packages.Their travel costs would be covered, and each Somali who goes back gets $200, regardless of family size, a move that might encourage large families to return, according to UNHCR. Each family would also get a stipend of the same amount to help cover basic needs.If the UNHCR meets its appeal goal, it’s proposing supplying six months of food to returnees and $25 per child for education services.UNHCR may also consider providing health insurance for returnees.“UNHCR is committed to ensuring that all returns to Somalia are voluntary and carried out in dignity, safety and with the protection of refugees paramount at all times,” Valentin Tapsoba, UNHCR’s Africa bureau director, said in a statement.But even some destitute refugees say those kinds of packages aren’t enough of a motivator to go back to the country they fled.Part of the issue is that 20 years of conflict has left the country bereft of public services such as schools and healthcare, according to the Guardian.A 20-year-old refugee from Somalia, who didn’t give his name, told CNN that his parents lost all of their land and property during the war. He said even giving $1,000 to start a new life in Somalia all over again wouldn’t suffice.“I agree no one has to live in a refugee camp all their life,” he told CNN. “It’s not correct morally, but then if you’ve left your home 25 years ago, going back is like going back to a new place.” In addition to taking some refugees back to Somalia, UNHCR also plans on relocating Somalis and non-Somalis to the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, which houses South Sudanese, Congolese, Rwandan and Burundian refugees, according to CNN.The Kenyan government is intent on closing the Dadaab camp due to security challenges posed by militant terror group Al-Shabaab, but aid groups say there’s no established link between any terror activity and Dadaab.

It probably won’t end well.The bowtie-wearing badass that is Toomas Hendrik Ilves, pictured above, meted out some well-deserved internet justice last weekend after an apparent Donald Trump supporter criticized him for tweeting in English.“Your the President of Estonia ― why in heck are you tweeting in English?” asked the user, called @Trump_Gabbard. “Use your own language MATE!”Ilves, who knows a thing or two about Twitter battles, replied to the snarky message immediately.He first addressed the person’s grammatical error of using “your” instead of “you’re.” Ilves then explained that he regularly posts in English because “Estonians know English” but “others don’t generally know Estonian.”His final burn came with the use of the Latin phrase “Quod erat demonstrandum” ― which translates to “which was to be proved” and is often used to formally end a mathematical, logical or physical proof. Or, in less formal situations, to demonstrate that you’ve totally won an argument.There’s also the fact that Ilves was born in Sweden but moved to the U.S. as a toddler, graduated as valedictorian of his New Jersey high school and received degrees from two Ivy League universities ― which means he probably has as much right as anyone to claim English as his “own language.”Ilves’ tweet appeared on Saturday, but it’s only now going viral. It appears his smackdown was so severe that @Trump_Gabbard ― who seems to have at one point been calling for a presidential ticket featuring Donald Trump with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) ― has now deactivated his or her account in shame.The president isn’t sure who was behind the now-defunct profile. But he did indicate in a later tweet that, judging by the troll’s choice of words (”mate,” anyone?), he or she was probably not American.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Obama also went after GOP nominee Donald Trump, portraying him as uninterested in facts and insulated by a lifetime of not caring about poor people.In her speech, Clinton will say the U.S. faces a “moment of reckoning.”“Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart,” she says in excerpts of her speech released by her campaign. “Bonds of trust and respect are fraying. And just as with our founders there are no guarantees. It’s truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we’re going to work together so we can all rise together.” But the Democratic convention in Philadelphia got off to a rocky start as Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced she would resign as head of the Democratic National Committee after an embarrassing email leak that the Obama administration suggests points to Russia. Supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also threatened to upend the convention before Sanders himself urged the party to unite behind Clinton and moved to nominate her unanimously by acclimation.The early star of the convention was first lady Michelle Obama, who gave a moving speech in which she said this election “is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives.” Obama noted progress the country has made and said Clinton would take it further. “I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves. And I watch my daughters, two beautiful and intelligent black young women, playing with their dogs on the White House lawn,” Obama said. Because of Clinton, she said, her daughters will “take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States.”DNC delegates nominated Clinton on Tuesday. In his speech that night, former President Bill Clinton detailed their 45-year relationship, starting at Yale Law School in the 1970s, and described some of the ways she had inspired change throughout her career. The following day, Trump drew headlines when he said he hoped Russian hackers had personal emails deleted from Hillary Clinton’s private email server when she was secretary of state. The comments were widely criticized, even by Republicans, who accused Trump of suggesting that a foreign country intervene in a U.S. election.Trump’s gaffe played right into Wednesday’s DNC speakers, who said it shows Trump is unfit to lead the United States. Clinton, after her nomination on Tuesday, appeared in a video noting the historic moment. “I can’t believe we just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet,” she said. “And if there are any little girls out there who stayed up late to watch, let me just say I may become the first woman president, but one of you is next.”Thursday night, Clinton will make an even bigger crack.This article has been updated to include a comment from Clinton’s speech."

Both of the alleged murderers of a Catholic priest in France earlier this week were on that country’s own terror watchlist. One of the suspects was wearing an electronic monitoring tag at the time of the murder. It’s not that hard to end up on the United States’ terror watchlist, officially known as the Terrorist Screening Database. The government’s own March 2013 Watchlisting Guidance says that “irrefutable evidence or concrete facts are not necessary” to put a person on the watchlist. There are a staggering 680,000 people ― 280,000 of whom, by the government’s own admission, have “no recognized terrorist group affiliation” ― on the U.S. terror watchlist. Of that tally, anywhere from 21,000 to 40,000 are American citizens or legal residents. “People can be listed as ‘suspected’ terrorists not because of any wrongdoing but because of unwitting associations with someone else the government deems suspect,” wrote ACLU staff attorney Hugh Handeyside in 2014. Often people end up on the list for having a name similar to another person’s.And American Muslims are disproportionately represented on the list. It’s no coincidence that Dearborn, Michigan ― which has the highest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. ― has the second highest number of watch-listed individuals in the U.S., despite having a population of under 100,000 people. Being on the list can have a range of consequences, including being blocked from flying in or out of the country, denial of immigration visas, and detention and questioning by authorities. The government does not disclose its reasoning for the inclusion of certain names on the watchlist, and getting a name removed from the list can be exceedingly difficult. “Maybe the list should be more accurate,” Giuliani said Thursday. “Maybe we should make the procedures for people to complain if they are erroneously there easier. I would like the opportunity to take a look at what percentage is faulty. If the percentage is very high, like 20 percent, 30 percent, then I wouldn’t do it until the percentage was down to something like 1 or 2 percent. If the percentage is more like 1 or 2 percent, then I would do it. But I do think it’s something to consider.”Giuliani’s support of electronic monitoring falls in line with Trump’s dragnet counterterror strategies, most of which are aimed at Muslims. Trump has called for a national database of Muslims, said Muslims should be racially profiled, said mosques should be surveilled, and called for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. During the press conference Wednesday, Giuliani touted his own counterterror record, saying he “put undercover agents in mosques for the first time in January 1994” after the 1993 truck bombing of the World Trade Center that killed six people. “I did it because the 1993 bombing was planned in a mosque in Union City, New Jersey, and a second plan was uncovered to bomb our subways, which was foiled,” said Giuliani. “And I kept those police officers in those mosques until I left as mayor.”The NYPD’s secretive, six-year program of mass surveillance of Muslims after 9/11 ― which had police place informants and undercover officers inside mosques ― yielded exactly zero leads into criminal or terrorist activity, an NYPD lieutenant later admitted in court. At his press conference Thursday, Giuliani told reporters that “this country and the Western world is in more danger today than it has been at any time since the Second World War.”“The picture painted by the fantasizer in chief last night was of a world that he made peaceful,” he continued, referring to President Barack Obama’s Democratic National Convention speech Wednesday, in which the president urged Americans to “reject cynicism, reject fear” and vote for Hillary Clinton. “[Obama] has made the world much more dangerous than the world that was handed to him, and Hillary Clinton played a material, important role in that,” Giuliani said. “We would make a terrible mistake making her our next president.”S.V.

The cause of death of the eighth astronaut, Apollo 14’s Edgar Mitchell, who died in February 2016, has not been released, so he was excluded from the study, Delp said. Mitchell was the sixth person to walk on the moon.Delp and colleagues are working on a follow-up study that includes more detail on family medical histories, smoking and other factors.(Reporting by Irene Klotz; Editing by Julie Steenhuysen and Peter Cooney)"

Despite being traded for the third time in six years and despite battling an onslaught of shoulder problems, the 27-year-old pitcher earned the first All-Star appearance of his career. Better yet, the Midsummer Classic took place in San Diego, where he’d been starring for the lowly Padres, accumulating the third-best ERA in baseball (2.47) while ranking first in opponents’ batting average (.184) for all National League pitchers.Yet less than 48 hours after the All-Star Game ― in which Pomeranz pitched a scoreless inning in relief ― he found out he’d been traded to the Boston Red Sox. He wasn’t necessarily surprised, however. Although the recently engaged pitcher did have to bow out of wedding-planning mode, getting set to play for his fourth team in six years almost felt like a relief.“I’ve been hearing stuff for a while about different teams that were on me,” the 6-foot-5, 240-pound Pomeranz told The Huffington Post. “My agent called me earlier in the day and said something might go down with the Red Sox. ... I was excited. I think that’s why I keep getting teased. Someone sees something in me.”That “something” was never more evident than it’s been this season.A former University of Mississippi star and first-round draft pick of the Cleveland Indians in 2010, Pomeranz was drafted right behind superstars like Bryce Harper, Manny Machado and Matt Harvey. Yet AC joint surgery dealt a significant hit to his velocity as he entered 2016.The soft-spoken left-hander entered spring training with the Padres eager to add a third pitch to his arsenal, which already consisted of a fastball and a deadly curveball that consistently ranks near the top of the bigs. Starting pitchers generally need a minimum of three pitches, though, whereas relievers ― especially with power arms ― can rely on just two.“I’ve always wanted [a third pitch], but nothing ever stuck,” said Pomeranz, who has been both a reliever and starter throughout his six-year MLB career. “I picked up a cutter about two weeks before spring training. ... I met with our manager and pitching coach and said: ‘It feels like you’re writing me off in the bullpen. I’d really like an opportunity to start.’”The Padres’ coaching staff agreed and were rewarded when Pomeranz put together an excellent spring. On the final day of spring training, they informed him he’d made their starting rotation.Pomeranz knew he had earned it. And a crucial reason for that was the effectiveness of his new pitch.It came about rather inauspiciously, while he was rehabbing on a trip during the offseason ― hardly a time to develop a go-to out pitch. Pomeranz, who always attempts to find throwing partners wherever he goes, developed his cutter by playing catch with Travis Higgs. A career minor league catcher without a big league team to his name, Higgs was eager to help.“I noticed his ball would cut, so I asked him about it,” Pomeranz said. “He showed me how to throw it. At first, maybe 1 out of 10 [of my balls] would cut. I kept doing it every day, and guys were missing it. No one was squaring it up, so I was like, ‘I guess this thing works.’”Pomeranz was right, and in a big way. This season, he throws the cutter about 11 percent of the time, resulting in a commendable 30 percent swing-and-miss rate, according to Overthemonster.com. That’s a great clip for a pitcher with a dominating curveball, and a complement he never previously had in his repertoire.Meanwhile, after a brutal opening start at Fenway Park for his new team ― Pomeranz was shelled for five runs in just three innings of work ― the Tennessee native rebounded in his second start, tossing six innings and allowing two runs in front of the Red Sox faithful. In pitching 111 innings thus far in 2016, he has already surpassed his MLB single-season high.To be sure, starting at Fenway ― a premier hitter’s ballpark compared to the more pitching-friendly confines of Petco Park ― for a legitimate World Series contender comes with additional pressure. The mound at baseball’s most prized cathedral can be a lonely place, and that pressure only intensifies when you consider that Boston traded away one of its top pitching prospects for Pomeranz because it desperately wanted to bolster its starting rotation. Then again, Pomeranz has come a long way since his first day at spring training just a few months ago. His mindset then, without question, was more fragile, though he hardly wavered.“It’s hard to tell yourself to get ready,” Pomeranz said, “when it’s like: ‘I need to make this freaking team first.’” To read HuffPost's exclusive interview with Milwaukee Brewers six-time All-Star Ryan Braun, click here.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

Despite being traded for the third time in six years and despite battling an onslaught of shoulder problems, the 27-year-old pitcher earned the first All-Star appearance of his career. Better yet, the Midsummer Classic took place in San Diego, where he’d been starring for the lowly Padres, accumulating the third-best ERA in baseball (2.47) while ranking first in opponents’ batting average (.184) for all National League pitchers.Yet less than 48 hours after the All-Star Game ― in which Pomeranz pitched a scoreless inning in relief ― he found out he’d been traded to the Boston Red Sox. He wasn’t necessarily surprised, however.
