It is likely to start later than its October deadline, however, take longer to fight than anticipated, and will likely result in the destruction of much of the city. Even if the campaign is ultimately successful, it will not bring an end to the violence that has plagued Iraq; it will simply open a new chapter in the continuing sectarian violence and political instability that plagues it.Moreover, regardless of its outcome, it will prove to be a far-reaching human tragedy for hundreds of thousands of its inhabitants. Baghdad does not have the billions that will be required for its reconstruction nor is it prepared to deal with the onslaught of refugees that the fighting will create. The campaign itself will be hard fought against a tenacious enemy that will unleash even more new battlefield horrors and will be hampered by political divisions and sectarian conflicts and by the absence of a unified command structure.In his address to the UN on September 20, 2016, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced that the campaign to liberate Mosul would begin in a few weeks and predicted victory by year's end. Earlier, General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had also confirmed an imminent campaign. In Washington, it is common knowledge that the Obama administration is pushing to have Mosul liberated before President Barack Obama steps down on January 20, 2017.It's impossible to predict how effective Iraqi forces will be or how tenacious they will find the Islamic State (IS) resistance; much less the date of Mosul's liberation. There are a number of factors, however, that suggest that the campaign will drag out over many months, that it will be far bloodier than previous campaigns and that it is unlikely that Mosul will be liberated before next spring.First, there is no central command authority. There are four armies descending on Mosul: the Iraqi Army, the Hashd al-Shaabi Shiite Militia, Sunni Militias, and the Kurdish Peshmerga Forces. All four of these groups are controlled by their own commanders and operate independently of each other. In some cases, the groups have multiple, disparate commanders with seperate agendaas.The U.S. and its coalition partners are providing air and artillery support, and training and logistical services, and have deployed advisors at the brigade level to work with Iraqi troops. The US has also deployed special forces units and provided advisors to Kurdish Peshmerga units. American and coalition forces report to and are coordinated by the U.S. Central Command.In addition, Turkey has sent a battalion-sized force into Bashiqa in northern Iraq, ostensibly to train Sunni militias. Recently, Ankara has expanded that force. It's unclear what role, if any, Turkish forces might seek to play in the liberation of Mosul. Iran has many officers and ""volunteers"" drawn from Iran's Revolutionary Guard (IRG) within the Shiite militias. It also has approximately 5,000 troops along with tank divisions, helicopter gunships and mobile missile batteries along the border with Kurdistan. What role Iranian forces might seek to play is also unknown.Soldier with Hashd al-Shaabi Shia MilitiaCoordinating such a disparate force, especially when so many of them are mutually antagonistic, will prove difficult and is bound to hinder the campaign. Indeed, there have already been repeated clashes between Shiite militias and Sunni and Peshmerga units. In addition, there have also been military clashes between IRG and Peshmerga forces. Secondly, Islamic State (IS) has had more than two years to prepare for the campaign. Judging by its determined resistance in the campaigns to liberate Tikrit, Ramadi and Fallujah, IS can be expected to mount a tenacious, scorched earth resistance that will see protracted urban fighting. In Mosul, it appears that Islamic State has taken additional steps to slow down the Iraqi advance. Mosul has been ringed with oil tanks ready to be set afire if Iraqi troops penetrate the city limits. In addition, when IS militants retreated from the Qayyarah air base they set local oil fields afire. Given the importance of smuggled oil for IS's finances, their willingness to torch oil fields suggests that IS understands they are approaching the end game and that once dislodged from the area they are unlikely to regain control anytime soon. Expect more oil fields to be torched once the fighting begins.There have been persistent reports that Islamic State militants have been digging tunnels in Mosul to allow them to stage attacks in the rear of advancing Iraqi troops. This was a practice also evidenced in the Tikrit, Ramadi and Fallujah campaigns. It's likely it will prove true in Mosul as well.Equally troubling, has been IS's use of chemical weapons. Pentagon fears that IS was manufacturing mustard gas, a highly toxic WWI era nerve gas, was confirmed when Sleiman Daoud-al Afari, IS's head of chemical weapons development, was captured. To date, IS has used primarily chlorine gas as a chemical weapon. Chlorine gas is relatively easy to acquire. Liquid chlorine gas is used to disinfect water supplies and is a common item at municipal waterworks. When deployed as a chemical weapon it is deadly but has the disadvantage of dispersing rather quickly, as WWI combatants found out.Video of US airstrike against chemical weapons facility in Mosul, September 12, 2016. Video footage courtesy Dept. of Defense.Mustard gas, on the other hand, is highly toxic, tends to hug the ground, and remains persistent in the environment. IS militants have fired artillery shells containing mustard gas at opponents. Most recently, in mid-September against the Marine artillery base at Kara Soar (Fire Base Bell). In an urban setting, in large quantities, it could also be used to create area denial zones that would slow down advancing troops or force them into prepared kill zones. The release of mustard gas in the rear of advancing Iraqi troops could also prove to be highly disruptive. Widespread use of mustard gas would also make post liberation clean up highly dangerous and could result in significant civilian casualties. Pentagon estimates put the strength of IS fighters in Mosul at around five thousand militants. Iraqi government sources place the strength at around 30 thousand. The likely number is probably in the middle. Regardless of the number, it is going to be a larger force that Iraqi troops have previously dealt with. Coupled with a civilian population of between one and two million people, and an opponent determined to die fighting, the liberation of Mosul is going to be the bloodiest, most bitterly fought urban campaign since Stalingrad.UN sources estimate that upwards of one million people in Mosul will be displaced by the fighting and that it will take months, if not longer, before the city would be safe enough for them to return. Judging from the Anbar campaigns, large areas of Mosul will likely be rendered uninhabitable by the fighting. UNHCR officials in Mosul believe that neither they nor the Kurdish and Iraqi governments have the ability to handle this scale of refugees. Baghdad's proposal to bus 250,000 Mosul refugees to abandoned buildings in Tikrit was denounced by Sunni leaders as hopelessly inadequate and as little more than a thinly veiled attempt at the ethnic cleansing of Sunnis from Mosul.At the moment, Iraqi forces have been advancing up the Tigris Valley from the south, while other Iraqi troops have been advancing from the east in an attempt to secure the Tigris Valley to their rear and flank before they advance on Mosul.Peshmerga unit in Northern Iraq. Photo courtesy Dept of Defense.On September 22, Iraqi troops took the town of al-Shirqat, about thirty-five miles north of Baiji and due west of Kirkuk. Al -Shirqat is about 25 miles south of the town of al-Qayyarah. This section of the Tigris Valley is the last remaining portion, outside of Mosul, still controlled by Islamic State.Closing this last gap would completely isolate IS militants in Hawija and the surrounding region and make it harder for any Islamic State fighters to escape from Mosul down the Tigris Valley. Along with Tal Afar, Hawija is one of the last two remaining IS controlled towns in Iraq besides Mosul.Ironically, al-Shirqat is where the last battle between British and Ottoman troops was fought in the Mesopotamian Theater. Had British troops stopped there in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice of Mudros, this would have been the northern border of Iraq. Clearing this last stretch of the Tigris Valley would also secure the rear area of the al-Qayyarah military base. That base, only 40 odd miles south of Mosul, is expected to serve as a key logistical center and a forward air base for American and coalition planes providing ground support. The base was heavily damaged, however, and it is unclear how quickly it will be operational. It's entirely possible that the advance on Mosul will begin before the rest of the Tigris Valley is secured. Given Islamic State's history of trying to deflect attacks by striking elsewhere, however, securing the rest of the Tigris Valley and further strengthening their hold on Highway 1 to Mosul would be prudent, even if that means the advance on Mosul is deferred into late October or November.Moreover, even stripped of its territorial holdings, Islamic State will remain a formidable opponent. IS has already been largely ejected from the major urban centers in Anbar province. As expected, however, it has simply returned to its ""insurgency mode,"" launching a string of attacks and bombings against Iraqi government targets and Iraqi Shiites. It is likely that Mosul and the rest of Nineveh province can expect the same. Sorting out post liberation Mosul will likely prove to be equally complex. Mosul, and much of the region of Iraqi Kurdistan, was never part of the historic region of Mesopotamia on which modern day Iraq is based. Officially, the fighting in the Mid-East theater during WW I, including the Mesopotamian campaign, ended when the Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros with the Allied powers effective October 31, 1918. Arbat refugees transit camp in Iraqi KurdistanThe British Commander Sir William Raines Marshall, was instructed by the War Office in London, however, to make ""every effort...to score as heavily on the Tigris before the whistle blew."" The armistice specified that all sides were to hold their positions as of October 31, but Marshall ordered General Alexander Cobbe to continue to advance on oil rich Mosul. Despite Turkish protests, Cobbe continued to advance unopposed for an additional two weeks, covering 80 miles, until he had secured Mosul and its oil fields.Were it not for that advance, in violation of the Armistice of Mudros, northern Iraq, including most of Nineveh Province and Iraqi Kurdistan, would have remained part of the Turkish state that emerged from the detritus of the Ottoman Empire. Historically, Mosul was a Kurdish city. During the 1980s, Saddam Hussein's government resettled large numbers of Sunnis in Mosul in order to reduce its predominantly Kurdish population. The disposition of Mosul and its surrounding oil fields is likely to become a contentious issue between Erbil and Baghdad.Despite Iraqi and U.S. government hopes that Mosul will be liberated by the end of the year, such an outcome seems highly unlikely. In the meantime, no one seems prepared to deal with the hundreds of thousands of new refugees that will result from this impending tragedy."

He also said Scott was in possession of marijuana at the time.Police have continually said that Scott was armed at the time of the encounter with officers, a contention that his family has disputed and which gave rise to the protests and rioting in Charlotte.A video taken by Scott’s wife and released to the public on Friday did not provide an answer on whether Scott had a gun.Putney on Saturday said the evidence was clear.“Yes, based on the totality of what we see, he absolutely was in possession of a handgun,” Putney told a news conference.“There was a crime that he had committed that caused the encounter, and then the gun exacerbated that situation,” Putney told reporters.“What I can tell you is there is no single piece of evidence that proves all the complexities involved in this investigative process,” he said.Putney said earlier in the week that police were not ready to release the video because doing so could compromise the investigation into the shooting. On Saturday, he said that after speaking with state investigators he concluded the video could now be released without “adversely impacting” the investigation.“What we are releasing are the objective facts,” Putney said.Protesters have called for officers involved in the shooting to face criminal charges, but Putney said, “Officers are absolutely not being charged by me at this point.”“But again, there’s another investigation ongoing,” he added.Demonstrators on Saturday mounted a fifth day of protests in Charlotte. They called for the end of emergency measures imposed on the city this week, the removal of National Guard troops and for officers involved in the incident to be prosecuted.(Writing by Will Dunham in Washington; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

Republicans have criticized her for putting national security at risk.The FBI closed the year-long investigation in July, recommending no charges, although FBI Director James Comey said Clinton and her staff had been “extremely careless” in handling classified government secrets.Pagliano has declined to answer questions by Republican lawmakers about his work on Clinton’s server, but spoke to federal investigators after securing a form of immunity from prosecution.He told investigators two colleagues from the technology office approached him with concerns during Clinton’s first year after learning about the email system. One said it could lead to a “federal records retention issue,” Pagliano told investigators, and urged him to raise the concern with Clinton’s “inner circle.”A colleague also warned Pagliano “he wouldn’t be surprised” if classified information was being sent through Clinton’s unsecure system, Pagliano told the FBI.The newly released interview summaries from the FBI investigation show government employees undercutting other aspects of the public accounts given by Clinton and senior State officials.A State Department employee, whose name was redacted, told investigators they believed senior department officials interfered with the screening of Clinton’s emails for public release last year in a way that helped Clinton.The employee, who worked on the screening process, said there was pressure to obscure the fact they were finding classified information in the messages. John Kirby, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement the department “strongly disputes” the claim of interference. Clinton repeatedly said last year she never sent or received classified information, but now says she did not do so knowingly since the release of the FBI findings.The employee also said the Defense Department told the State Department last year it had found about 1,000 emails between Clinton and David Petraeus in its records from his time as the director of the United States Central Command.The State Department has said that Clinton did not include any of her emails with Petraeus when her lawyers screened and returned what they said were all her work emails in 2014. A single conversation of about 10 emails later emerged last year after the Defense Department provided it.Spokesmen for Clinton have declined to discuss the omission, and did not respond to questions about the new interview summaries.Kirby, the department spokesman, said he could not “speculate” whether the Defense Department had found more than just a single conversation between Clinton and Petraeus. “We can only speak to the records in our possession,” he said.(Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Editing by John Whitesides and Mary Milliken)"

The Trump campaign did not respond to The Huffington Post’s request for confirmation.Trump threatened to invite Flowers if Mark Cuban, a celebrity billionaire backing Clinton, attended the debate.Juanita Broaddrick, a retired nurse who maintains that Clinton raped her in 1978, told HuffPost that Trump had not asked her to attend.“It’s a little late to make travel arrangements but it would be delightful to attend such an epic event. Maybe I will get an invitation to the next one,” she said in a Twitter message. Monday night’s showdown, which will be the first time Hillary Clinton and Trump appear on the same stage as candidates, is expected to draw upwards of 100 million viewers.If Trump indeed invited Flowers to the debate, it will be a virtually unprecedented stunt for a presidential candidate.President Bill Clinton admitted in sworn testimony in 1998 that he had had an affair with Flowers while he was governor of Arkansas. During his 1992 presidential campaign, he denied having the affair, which Flowers claimed lasted 12 years.Trump experimented with dredging up 1990s-era conspiracy theories and scandals associated with the Clintons, including the former president’s well-documented sexual peccadilloes. But he has mostly refrained from employing these attacks in recent months.In inviting Flowers to the debate, Trump has decided it’s wise to humiliate the first female presidential nominee from a major party for her husband’s infidelities. “Hillary Clinton plans on using the debate to discuss the issues that make a difference in people’s lives,” Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said. “It’s not surprising that Donald Trump has chosen a different path.”This story has been updated with comment from the Clinton campaign.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

And more importantly, listen to each other. And most importantly, see each other. Black and white and Latino and Native American and Asian American - see how our stories are bound together,” he said standing on a stage outside the bronze-colored, latticed museum.The museum, located on the National Mall, officially opened its doors on Saturday. It contains 36,000 items that trace the journey of African Americans from slavery in the 1800s to the fight for civil rights in the 20th century and lauds modern icons, such as media mogul Oprah Winfrey and tennis champion Serena Williams.With a ring of a bell, Obama and wife Michelle and four generations of an African American family inaugurated the $540 million museum designed by Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye, who was inspired by Yoruban art from West Africa.‘PLACE TO UNDERSTAND’Obama, who made history as the first black president of the United States, spoke as racial tensions flared once again across the nation in the aftermath of police shootings of two black men in the past two weeks.In Tulsa, Oklahoma, a white police officer has been charged with manslaughter for fatally shooting Terence Crutcher, 40, whose car had broken down and blocked a road. Violent protests broke out after a separate incident in Charlotte, North Carolina, where police shot Keith Scott, a 43-year-old father of seven. The deaths were the latest in a string of fatal encounters between police and African Americans that have sparked unrest and threaten to overshadow Obama’s legacy on race relations. Obama said the museum’s exhibits on the fight against racial discrimination and segregation could provide context for current movements against police brutality.“It reminds us that routine discrimination and Jim Crow are not ancient history. We shouldn’t despair that it’s not all solved,” Obama said, noting all the progress that the country has made just in his lifetime.“This is the place to understand how protest and love of country don’t merely coexist, but inform each other,” he said.The dedication ceremony was attended by a who’s who of American officials, including Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, as well as entertainment luminaries including Winfrey, Stevie Wonder and Will Smith.The Obamas were joined on stage by former President George W. Bush, and his wife Laura. Bush signed the law authorizing construction of the museum in 2003.“A great nation does not hide its history, it faces its flaws and it corrects them,” Bush said.Demand to visit the museum is high, with free tickets to the museum quickly snatched up online.Obama has joined in the excitement for the new attraction. The first family enjoyed a private preview earlier this month. He also hosted a reception at the White House on Friday in honor of the opening and attended a star-studded concert heralding the museum at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Friday night.(Reporting by Ayesha Rascoe; Editing by Mary Milliken)"

The petition for review will have no impact on the November election, since the Supreme Court can take several months before it decides whether to add a case to its docket.That means the summer ruling stands, and a lower court judge’s orders to implement it ahead of Election Day will remain in full force.In August, U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzalez Ramos ordered Texas to institute a series of remedies prior to the election to ensure no citizen who lacks ID is turned away at the polls ― including allowing voters to sign an affidavit attesting to their identity.Still, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) on Friday repeated what he and many Republican politicians insist it’s true about voter ID laws: that they’re necessary to keep people from committing voter fraud.“Safeguarding the integrity of our elections is essential to preserving our democracy,” Paxton said in statement, which conceded the state’s appeal won’t affect its current obligations to offer relaxed rules to voters. “Texas enacted a common-sense voter ID law and I am confident that the U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately reinstate it,” he added.Voting rights advocates, who earlier this week convinced Ramos that Texas was flouting her earlier order and misleading voters about the softened ID rules for voting, said they weren’t so sure the state has much of a case left to make.“Despite four different federal courts finding that its photo ID law is discriminatory, Texas is investing more state time and resources ― to date, more than five years and 3.5 million dollars ― to tilt at windmills against a problem, impersonation voter fraud, that does not exist,” Janai Nelson, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said in a statement.The Supreme Court has already taken brief looks at Texas’ voter ID law, most significantly in 2014, when the court allowed it to go into effect for the 2014 election.But this could be the first time the justices get to examine it in depth, presenting them with an opportunity to revisit their own thinking on voter ID laws. The Supreme Court has blessed voter ID laws in the past, but not since a conservative majority in 2013 struck down an important part of the Voting Rights Act.As with a similar high-profile dispute in North Carolina, the Texas case is a “test case” by voting rights plaintiffs ― with full backing by the U.S. Department of Justice ― that aims to show voting discrimination is alive and well and that, short of reviving stalled efforts to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, litigation can be an avenue for reform and oversight for offending states.In its appeal to the Supreme Court, Texas points to some of these cases, and says that the July ruling against it creates a situation that requires the justices to step in and provide clarity. Without Supreme Court review, state officials warn, the July ruling “threatens countless longstanding election laws” and “subjects the Texas Legislature to the ongoing charge of intentional racial discrimination.”Whether the Supreme Court agrees to get involved in the case will be known in due time ― but after the election."
6,POLITICS,Some Good News For Dems For A Change: Trump Could Cost GOP A Ton Of State Legislatures,"Ryan Grim, Michael McAuliff, and Paul Blumenthal",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-state-legislature-elections_us_57e59d50e4b0e28b2b541d62,The Republican nominee is very unpopular in states Democrats are targeting.,2016-09-24,The New York State Senate is one of more than two dozen state legislative chambers Democrats hope to win control of in November.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e59f921a00002d005b4491.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democrats are finally paying attention to state politics. Over the past few years, major donors, national Democrats, the White House and state officials have begun organizing to win back state houses that have been dominated by Republicans since 2010. And even as the presidential race tightens nationally, Democrats are increasingly confident the party will be able flip a significant number of state legislative chambers, riding a wave of disgust with GOP nominee Donald Trump. At least 14 state House or Senate chambers are well within reach, according to a Democratic memo circulated this week.Presidential election years are better for Democrats, as the party’s voters tend to sit out midterm cycles, when Republicans rack up big wins down-ballot at the state level. And 2014, with ISIS sweeping across the Middle East and the country panic-stricken over Ebola, was a particularly bad year for Democrats, meaning a sizable number of blue seats are now in Republican hands, ripe for retaking. As Congress has become snarled in dysfunction, power has shifted laterally to the White House and the Supreme Court, and has devolved downward to states. Republicans have made major gains there, and have enacted an often-times extreme conservative agenda that voters are now reacting against. (In Kansas and Louisiana in particular, where the most extreme experiments played out, the states have become utter basket cases ― so much so that Louisiana recently elected a Democratic governor.)State-level races are also gaining importance with the approach of 2020, when elections will determine who draws future district lines based on the next census. In 2010, the tea party wave delivered most of the country’s state legislatures to Republicans, who used the wins to gerrymander state-level and congressional districts. Those districts mean it’s much more difficult for Democrats to take back the U.S. House. In 2012, for instance, more people voted for Democratic congressional candidates than Republican ones, but Republicans still comfortably control the House.The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which coordinates state-level efforts, sees prime opportunities in the following 14 states. At the same time, Democrats are playing defense in some places, in danger of losing their control of the Kentucky House and the Iowa Senate.Arizona SenateRepublicans have a six-seat advantage here, but Latino registration is surging across the state in reaction to the racism espoused by Trump and his prominent supporter, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, who is facing federal investigation for racial profiling. Democrats would need to flip four seats to control the chamber, 16-14.One GOP incumbent, Jeff Dial, was already upset in a primary by conservative challenger Frank Schmuck, giving Democrats hope of claiming the seat. (It also gave the world this headline: “Schmuck upends Dial in Republican Senate primary election.”)Colorado SenateRepublicans control the chamber by one seat, following the stunning NRA-driven recall of two Democratic senators in 2013, payback for gun control legislation. But Democratic activists are buoyed by a dramatic upset in November, which saw three conservatives recalled from the Jefferson County Board of Education, in suburban Denver. The board members had been pushing hard against the teachers union, aiming to privatize schools and shift toward a charter model. Jefferson County is now home to Republican state Sen. Laura Woods, who is fighting for her political life. If that same organization can pick up one seat, Colorado’s Senate belongs to Democrats.EMILY’s List, which supports pro-choice Democrats, has endorsed three candidates in the Colorado Senate, and made flipping the chamber a priority of its Focus 2020 project. One of them, Rachel Zenzinger, is running against Woods, and trying to yoke her to Trump ― which isn’t terribly hard to do. Rick Palacio, chair of the Colorado Democratic Party, did the same in a statement to HuffPost. ”Candidates like Rachel Zenzinger are running to bring people together on these issues instead of running on the fear and divisiveness we hear from candidates like Donald Trump and Laura Woods. We are confident that come November we will flip the Senate,” he said.Iowa HouseRepublicans have a 14-seat advantage in the lower chamber, and Trump leads in the state. But Democrats see an opportunity. Republicans are protecting five open Republican seats in districts President Barack Obama carried in 2012. If they win all five, they still need three more to flip the chamber. “Several targeted swing districts are suburban and home to highly-educated, middle-income families ― a voting bloc that has been skeptical of Donald Trump,” the DLCC memo reads, hopefully.Maine SenateRepublicans have a five-seat margin in the state Senate, meaning Democrats need to flip three seats. They believe they have five legit pickup opportunities, where Obama won with at least 55 percent of the vote in 2012. Helpfully for Democrats’ political prospects, the GOP in Maine is run by a racist demagogue, Gov. Paul LePage, who is widely disliked.Maine Democratic Party Chairman Phil Bartlett said the struggling economy and the antics of LePage ― the two are not necessarily disconnected ― have fueled the pushback against the GOP.“Maine is one of only seven states in the country that have not recovered all the jobs we lost in the recession, and we’ve lost 40 percent of our mill jobs in the last five years,” Bartlett told HuffPost. “While we take nothing for granted, we are feeling good about our ground game. Voters are channeling their frustration into volunteering for us in our 29 field offices across the state, and we are cautiously optimistic that we will flip the Senate in November. Even Governor LePage has predicted his party will likely lose the chamber.”Nevada SenateRepublicans have a bare one-seat, 11-10 majority in the Senate, and Democrats think GOP primary voters gave them a gift in selecting as their candidate for a Las Vegas-area contest Victoria Seaman, a member of the state Assembly who rallied for right-wing rancher Cliven Bundy and backed legislation to help him. Democrats believe they have a stronger choice for the diverse district in Nicole Cannizzaro, a Clark County prosecutor. Democrats also are investing heavily in a Reno contest where they lost in 2012 by just 300 votes.Nevada AssemblyDemocrats were especially hard-hit in the state Assembly in 2014, and they hold a 17-21 disadvantage there. But turnout was especially low, and that leaves some nine GOP-held seats where Democratic voters outnumber Republicans. Longtime Nevada political observer and columnist Jon Ralston rates control of the chamber as “strong lean Democratic.”New Hampshire HouseTrump looks to be a huge factor in New Hampshire, where Granite State Republicans are not super-enthusiastic about him. In the most recent Monmouth University poll of the state, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was leading by 9 points. That’s a potential formula for a down-ticket wipeout, especially in a House that has 400 members, all poorly known. While Republicans hold 235 of those seats, “It certainly has flipped a good bit over the last several cycles. It’s definitely in play,” said the University of New Hampshire’s Dante Scala. One thing that could save Republicans is if Sen. Kelly Ayotte and governor candidate Chris Sununu can significantly outperform Trump, and stop a wave, he said. Still, Republicans are only fielding a total of 335 candidates, compared with 361 Dem contenders, making for a field that starts slanted against the GOP.New Hampshire SenateThe New Hampshire Senate has a more manageable 24 members, with 14 of them Republicans. But six of those Republicans are retiring. Democrats think each one of those districts can swing their way, and have bolstered local campaign accounts to take advantage.Michigan HouseRepublicans have a strong majority in the Michigan House, with 63 seats, against one vacancy and 43 seats held by Democrats. But Michigan is a term-limit state, and 25 Republicans have to leave office, while just 13 Democratic seats are opening up, giving the Democrats more room to grow. On top of that, Republican Gov. Rick Snyder gets terrible job-approval numbers, and Clinton is maintaining a lead on Trump in the state. The tally at the top of the ballot will be especially important in Michigan, after courts affirmed the state’s straight-ticket voting system, in which voters have the option to just vote for one party, making ticket-splitting less common, and down-ballot contests more likely to look like the presidential result. Minnesota HouseDemocrats in Minnesota’s House have a 61-73 disadvantage after the GOP took control in 2014. But 2016 is especially unusual in Minnesota, with the only statewide race being the presidential contest. That magnifies the Trump factor. And Clinton leads Trump in the state, with the most recent poll giving her a 6-point edge. Since the GOP did especially well two years ago, there are a number of Democratic-leaning districts where Democrats think they’ll knock off Republicans. On top of the Trump problem, Democrats think they can capitalize on public discontent with an ugly legislative session in which the split legislature was unable to get several large important projects passed, mostly because of blockades from the GOP House. New Mexico HouseRepublicans hold a four-seat advantage in the New Mexico House of Representatives. The majority party won control in the 2014 election, but recent history favors Democratic control of the state House. The state’s Democratic Party sees a favorable map and environment to flip the three seats it needs to win back control.“The map we are looking at has a lot of opportunities to unseat Republicans, but also pick up seats from retiring members,” said Felicia Salazar, communications director for the New Mexico Democratic Party.The party has already seen a growth in registration, including in key swing regions. The Santa Fe New Mexican reported a jump of 50,000 new registrants since the end of January. Big increases occurred in key districts, like the west Albuquerque district where Democrat Ronnie Martinez is looking to unseat the incumbent Republican Rep. David Adkins. There was also a jump in registration that Democrats hope to exploit in the Las Cruces district represented by Republican Rep. Terry McMillan.Trump may very well be a factor in these races, especially in a state that is basically divided three ways among Latinos, whites and Native Americans. Salazar sees the unpopularity of Trump and his “racist remarks” as “putting a lot of Republicans in a tough spot.” Trump’s rhetoric and policies could become an issue in the nine House districts where Obama won in 2012.New York SenateNew York is a peculiar state for Democrats, considering that they already control a majority of the state Senate. Their problem is a splinter group called the Independent Democrats, which has given the keys of the Senate to Republicans. Currently, one Independent Democrat caucuses with Republicans, while the others sit in between.This complicated situation may be somewhat clarified in November, as Democrats see at least 10 seats that could switch to their side. Most of the targeted seats are in Long Island and the northern suburbs of New York City, where Democratic turnout should be higher for the presidential election.Democratic state Sen. Mike Gianaris, chairman of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, said he’s “confident” Democrats will pick up enough seats, as the environment significantly favors them. He noted that the party has won more than one seat in every presidential cycle going back to 2000. The candidates at the top of the tickets will be a factor, on top of the usual increase in turnout in a presidential year.“Unlike some parts of the country, we’re feeling pretty good with Hillary Clinton at top of the ticket and we feel great with Donald Trump at the top of ticket,” Gianaris said. “Pretty unpopular is being kind. He’s horribly unpopular. Particularly in the districts we need to flip.”There’s polling to back this up. “We expect it to become a big issue in a lot of these campaigns,” Gianaris said.Washington SenateDemocrats in Washington state are optimistic about their chances to regain control of the state Senate. Republicans control 26 seats in the legislative chamber, and Democrats hold 23. That means Democrats only need to win two seats to win the chamber. They only have one Democratic incumbent facing a tough challenge to defend.Washington is different than most states in that it operates a nonpartisan top-two, or jungle, primary system. In this system, candidates from all parties run in the primary with the top two advancing to the general election. This can give an early preview of the general election. For Democrats, their candidates did quite well in the primaries in the suburban districts they are targeting in November.Lisa Wellman, a former teacher and tech executive running for state Senate in a district covering Mercer Island and suburban Bellevue, is one of those candidates. She polled just ahead of Republican incumbent Steve Litzow in their primary matchup. “It was a major shock to him and a pleasant surprise to us that we did that well,” Wellman said.The district has trended heavily toward Democrats in recent elections. It is the only Senate district occupied by a Republican that Obama won in 2012.Like many other states that favor the Democratic Party at the national level, the Trump candidacy could be an anchor around the necks of Washington Republicans. “Washington state has been a state where Trump has been wildly unpopular,” Bond said. There is limited polling in the state, but two polls have shown Trump down by 12 points and 19 points to Clinton. Obama won the state by 17 points in 2008, and 15 points in 2012.“We think we’re well positioned to win,” said Alex Bond, political director for the Washington Senate Democratic Campaign. “We definitely see a very clear path to victory based on the strong primary results and the strong electorate for Democrats in the general.”West Virginia SenateWest Virginia isn’t usually thought of as favorable environment for the Democratic Party these days. The state gives Trump some of his best marks, and Clinton some of her worst. In 2012, Obama lost 40 percent of the primary vote to an imprisoned felon.State-level elections, however, favor Democrats. Billionaire Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jim Justice posted a 10-point lead in a recent poll. State legislative candidates see hope that their Democratic Party, while maybe not the national party, will do well in November.“There’s a reaction throughout the state after two years of the Republican control of the legislature that is not favorable,” said Democratic state Rep. Stephen Skinner, who is running for an open Senate seat currently occupied by a retiring Democrat.Republicans control the Senate by an 18-16 margin, meaning Democrats need only flip two seats. Major issues include the economic impact of sinking coal and gas prices and controversial issues the Republican legislature passed in the past two years. They include the enactment of right-to-work legislation that could, if it survives a court challenge, gut union organizing rights in the state.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

7,POLITICS,Some Good News For Dems For A Change: Trump Could Cost GOP A Ton Of State Legislatures,"Ryan Grim, Michael McAuliff, and Paul Blumenthal",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-state-legislature-elections_us_57e59d50e4b0e28b2b541d62,The Republican nominee is very unpopular in states Democrats are targeting.,2016-09-24,Donald Trump is a potential drag for Republican state legislative candidates in some of the states targeted by Democrats.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e5a03a1a00002d005b4492.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democrats are finally paying attention to state politics. Over the past few years, major donors, national Democrats, the White House and state officials have begun organizing to win back state houses that have been dominated by Republicans since 2010. And even as the presidential race tightens nationally, Democrats are increasingly confident the party will be able flip a significant number of state legislative chambers, riding a wave of disgust with GOP nominee Donald Trump. At least 14 state House or Senate chambers are well within reach, according to a Democratic memo circulated this week.Presidential election years are better for Democrats, as the party’s voters tend to sit out midterm cycles, when Republicans rack up big wins down-ballot at the state level. And 2014, with ISIS sweeping across the Middle East and the country panic-stricken over Ebola, was a particularly bad year for Democrats, meaning a sizable number of blue seats are now in Republican hands, ripe for retaking. As Congress has become snarled in dysfunction, power has shifted laterally to the White House and the Supreme Court, and has devolved downward to states. Republicans have made major gains there, and have enacted an often-times extreme conservative agenda that voters are now reacting against. (In Kansas and Louisiana in particular, where the most extreme experiments played out, the states have become utter basket cases ― so much so that Louisiana recently elected a Democratic governor.)State-level races are also gaining importance with the approach of 2020, when elections will determine who draws future district lines based on the next census. In 2010, the tea party wave delivered most of the country’s state legislatures to Republicans, who used the wins to gerrymander state-level and congressional districts. Those districts mean it’s much more difficult for Democrats to take back the U.S. House. In 2012, for instance, more people voted for Democratic congressional candidates than Republican ones, but Republicans still comfortably control the House.The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which coordinates state-level efforts, sees prime opportunities in the following 14 states. At the same time, Democrats are playing defense in some places, in danger of losing their control of the Kentucky House and the Iowa Senate.Arizona SenateRepublicans have a six-seat advantage here, but Latino registration is surging across the state in reaction to the racism espoused by Trump and his prominent supporter, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, who is facing federal investigation for racial profiling. Democrats would need to flip four seats to control the chamber, 16-14.One GOP incumbent, Jeff Dial, was already upset in a primary by conservative challenger Frank Schmuck, giving Democrats hope of claiming the seat. (It also gave the world this headline: “Schmuck upends Dial in Republican Senate primary election.”)Colorado SenateRepublicans control the chamber by one seat, following the stunning NRA-driven recall of two Democratic senators in 2013, payback for gun control legislation. But Democratic activists are buoyed by a dramatic upset in November, which saw three conservatives recalled from the Jefferson County Board of Education, in suburban Denver. The board members had been pushing hard against the teachers union, aiming to privatize schools and shift toward a charter model. Jefferson County is now home to Republican state Sen. Laura Woods, who is fighting for her political life. If that same organization can pick up one seat, Colorado’s Senate belongs to Democrats.EMILY’s List, which supports pro-choice Democrats, has endorsed three candidates in the Colorado Senate, and made flipping the chamber a priority of its Focus 2020 project. One of them, Rachel Zenzinger, is running against Woods, and trying to yoke her to Trump ― which isn’t terribly hard to do. Rick Palacio, chair of the Colorado Democratic Party, did the same in a statement to HuffPost. ”Candidates like Rachel Zenzinger are running to bring people together on these issues instead of running on the fear and divisiveness we hear from candidates like Donald Trump and Laura Woods. We are confident that come November we will flip the Senate,” he said.Iowa HouseRepublicans have a 14-seat advantage in the lower chamber, and Trump leads in the state. But Democrats see an opportunity. Republicans are protecting five open Republican seats in districts President Barack Obama carried in 2012. If they win all five, they still need three more to flip the chamber. “Several targeted swing districts are suburban and home to highly-educated, middle-income families ― a voting bloc that has been skeptical of Donald Trump,” the DLCC memo reads, hopefully.Maine SenateRepublicans have a five-seat margin in the state Senate, meaning Democrats need to flip three seats.

8,POLITICS,Erdogan Banned Turkish Reporter From Twitter Because He Doesn't Care What You Think,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/erdogans-big-new-york-week-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper_us_57e5993ce4b0e28b2b54153f,The outcry against this latest repression is unlikely to deter the Turkish president.,2016-09-24,President Recep Tayyip Erdogand apparently felt no need to answer the criticism over mistreatment of a noted Turkish reporter.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e599731700002900ac6bfc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Turkey’s president attracted fresh international outrage on Monday after prominent Turkish reporter Mahir Zeynalov revealed that a court had ordered Twitter to ban his tweets within Turkey.Well-known human rights advocates, fellow journalists and readers of Zeynalov’s work spoke out to defend the reporter, whose work is followed closely in the West. They linked the court judgment to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s growing repression of journalists. Hundreds of people tweeted complaints and messages of solidarity at the Twitter support account and the company’s CEO, Jack Dorsey.And within hours, Zeynalov said his Twitter handle was trending in Toronto, London, New York, San Francisco and Washington.The controversy began to settle down later on Monday after a Motherboard story suggested that Twitter would not comply with the court’s judgment ― though Zeynalov said he remained worried.The conversation on Twitter and in the news media reflects how intimidated dissenters feel in the face of the Turkish government’s actions since the failed coup in July and how wary the international community is of Erdogan’s rule. The most telling aspect, however, was that one perspective was conspicuously absent: There was no clear response to the controversy from the Turkish authorities. Erdogan didn’t attempt to defend the decision, which his government had sought. He didn’t seem to care about the backlash.Disregard for international uproar has long been one of Erdogan’s defining characteristics. Between Turkey’s power as a major economy and its key role in current crises in Europe and the Middle East, he has had the leverage to get his way regardless of how pearl-clutching outside observers feel. But since the coup attempt, Erdogan has begun signaling that he cares less than ever about the views of the rest of the world. The Turkish leader made this new confidence clear in a largely overlooked move days before the Zeynalov incident, during his visit to New York for the United Nations General Assembly.On Friday morning, Erdogan was expected at an event in New York City that was billed as a definitive discussion on the failed coup.As his first chance to give an American audience his view, it seemed a prime opportunity for him to win sympathy and to substantiate why the Obama administration should immediately repatriate Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based cleric the Turkish government blames for the plot ― something the United States says it is not yet prepared to do. And unlike his U.N. address earlier in the week, this speech could be focused entirely on Turkey’s complicated internal politics.So reporters, academics and observers of the U.S.-Turkey relationship gathered at the ritzy Harvard Club early that day, to have enough time to navigate Erdogan’s notorious security protocol.Then they learned that the president had already flown back to Turkey.His substitute was Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, a relatively minor figure whose last big moment in international news came when he misinterpreted a New York Times article following the failed coup.The sudden change surprised many attendees. On its surface, it immediately reduced the importance of the entire event. But the bait and switch actually gave Turkey-watchers an important message: Here is the kind of approach that Erdogan will now follow in his relationships with the outside world. Already wary of the international community, and the West in particular, the Turkish leader has now rallied so much local support that he is betting he has even greater leeway to disregard global opinion.Cavusoglu cheered this new reality, saying he saw an unprecedented level of unity in Turkey following the failed putsch. Attendees at the Friday gathering and at a Thursday event featuring the Turkish president’s wife, Emine Erdogan, told The Huffington Post they now see defending the president as continuous with defending their country, a frequent victim of coups, rather than with supporting his party, an Islamist movement that has never received even 50 percent of the Turkish popular vote.It’s striking that this is the government’s strategy at a time when it seems to be trying to persuade the world to help it target Gulen and his followers and ignore Erdogan’s growing domestic repression.But it’s becoming increasingly clear that the carefully curated government materials about the dangers of Gulen are for the Turkish people at home and abroad, rather than hard-to-convince foreigners. Many Turkish citizens feel that outsiders cannot and do not want to understand their political reality. They point to examples of Western media coverage that encouraged the coup because of the broad sense in the West that Erdogan has become an undesirable leader ― a narrative that ignores how the attempted overthrow of the elected government horrified millions of Turkish people, including government critics. This helps explain why Erdogan can flippantly cancel a key U.S. event. It’s not the American media or commentariat that he wants to appeal to; it’s his and Turkey’s base. Attendees close to the Turkish government were previously aware that Erdogan would ditch the expectant crowd on Friday and leave New York City on Thursday night, two of them told HuffPost. Turkish diplomats informed one source of this two days earlier, they said.(The Turkish Embassy in Washington did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Cemil Ozyurt, a Turkish journalist involved in organizing the event, said the president had changed his program Thursday night and informed the organizers Friday morning. Asked about embassy officials informing others about the change on Wednesday, Ozyurt responded, “If I had known that, what would have been a reason not to tell you? I did not know that.”)Turkey’s turn appears fine by the U.S., so long as Erdogan continues to cooperate on the Syrian civil war and the self-styled Islamic State. U.S. officials say they now treat the Turkish government with kid gloves, hoping not to spark a row and to enable President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry to achieve the resolutions they’re looking for on Syria. To respond to lingering anxieties in Turkey about alleged American support for the attempted coup, the administration has even sent a team to Turkey to help analyze potential evidence of Gulen’s role.And it was Erdogan’s comments on topics of U.S. interest like Syria ― particularly on his problems with the U.S.-aligned Syrian Kurds ― and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that drew the most press coverage during his time in the U.S.This leave-well-enough-alone attitude risks putting off conversations about tough issues that could decide Turkey’s future stability, such as how the state will function with thousands of officials purged and what authoritarian impulses Erdogan might follow next. Turkey has unleashed a fierce crackdown on the Kurdish community in recent months ― a bid to thwart a militant insurgency. Kurdish activists warn that the government brutality they have experienced may soon become commonplace around the country because of the environment of intense nationalism, suspicion and anger that Erdogan is helping foment.Some outsiders still mention such issues. Linda Robertson, a Kent State University professor, asked the foreign minister about her friends in academia who had been fired during the Friday event.But Erdogan’s government has already mapped out a narrative for responding to these concerns: The minister swiftly tied the question back to the popular Turkish idea that foreigners are not fully appreciating the trauma of the coup and may even have endorsed it. The country can’t afford another such crisis, Cavusoglu told Robertson, so anyone remotely suspicious must be removed from a position of power. Human rights advocates should simply have faith that the system will recognize who is a real threat and who isn’t.It was an example of the cycle that Erdogan’s government is helping create, which seems set to justify all manner of government excess in the eyes of most of the Turkish public.Meanwhile, the alarms grow louder abroad. Hours after the event concluded, with Erdogan safely back home, the credit ratings agency Moody’s took the unprecedented step of downgrading Turkey’s sovereign credit to the status of “junk.”The president had already made his views clear. He told Bloomberg that he would see any such moves as a political action against his country. After Moody’s announced the news, his followers promptly joined the chorus.If even the arbiters of global finance can’t penetrate Erdogan-world, complaints on Twitter stand almost no chance.This story was updated following the news that Turkish reporter Mahir Zeynalov’s tweets had been banned in Turkey.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

9,POLITICS,Erdogan Banned Turkish Reporter From Twitter Because He Doesn't Care What You Think,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/erdogans-big-new-york-week-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper_us_57e5993ce4b0e28b2b54153f,The outcry against this latest repression is unlikely to deter the Turkish president.,2016-09-24,Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told those gathered at Friday's event that there is unprecedented unity in Turkey following the failed putsch.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_8_24_3432_1924%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Turkey’s president attracted fresh international outrage on Monday after prominent Turkish reporter Mahir Zeynalov revealed that a court had ordered Twitter to ban his tweets within Turkey.Well-known human rights advocates, fellow journalists and readers of Zeynalov’s work spoke out to defend the reporter, whose work is followed closely in the West. They linked the court judgment to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s growing repression of journalists. Hundreds of people tweeted complaints and messages of solidarity at the Twitter support account and the company’s CEO, Jack Dorsey.And within hours, Zeynalov said his Twitter handle was trending in Toronto, London, New York, San Francisco and Washington.The controversy began to settle down later on Monday after a Motherboard story suggested that Twitter would not comply with the court’s judgment ― though Zeynalov said he remained worried.The conversation on Twitter and in the news media reflects how intimidated dissenters feel in the face of the Turkish government’s actions since the failed coup in July and how wary the international community is of Erdogan’s rule. The most telling aspect, however, was that one perspective was conspicuously absent: There was no clear response to the controversy from the Turkish authorities. Erdogan didn’t attempt to defend the decision, which his government had sought. He didn’t seem to care about the backlash.Disregard for international uproar has long been one of Erdogan’s defining characteristics. Between Turkey’s power as a major economy and its key role in current crises in Europe and the Middle East, he has had the leverage to get his way regardless of how pearl-clutching outside observers feel. But since the coup attempt, Erdogan has begun signaling that he cares less than ever about the views of the rest of the world. The Turkish leader made this new confidence clear in a largely overlooked move days before the Zeynalov incident, during his visit to New York for the United Nations General Assembly.On Friday morning, Erdogan was expected at an event in New York City that was billed as a definitive discussion on the failed coup.As his first chance to give an American audience his view, it seemed a prime opportunity for him to win sympathy and to substantiate why the Obama administration should immediately repatriate Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based cleric the Turkish government blames for the plot ― something the United States says it is not yet prepared to do. And unlike his U.N. address earlier in the week, this speech could be focused entirely on Turkey’s complicated internal politics.So reporters, academics and observers of the U.S.-Turkey relationship gathered at the ritzy Harvard Club early that day, to have enough time to navigate Erdogan’s notorious security protocol.Then they learned that the president had already flown back to Turkey.His substitute was Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, a relatively minor figure whose last big moment in international news came when he misinterpreted a New York Times article following the failed coup.The sudden change surprised many attendees. On its surface, it immediately reduced the importance of the entire event. But the bait and switch actually gave Turkey-watchers an important message: Here is the kind of approach that Erdogan will now follow in his relationships with the outside world. Already wary of the international community, and the West in particular, the Turkish leader has now rallied so much local support that he is betting he has even greater leeway to disregard global opinion.Cavusoglu cheered this new reality, saying he saw an unprecedented level of unity in Turkey following the failed putsch. Attendees at the Friday gathering and at a Thursday event featuring the Turkish president’s wife, Emine Erdogan, told The Huffington Post they now see defending the president as continuous with defending their country, a frequent victim of coups, rather than with supporting his party, an Islamist movement that has never received even 50 percent of the Turkish popular vote.It’s striking that this is the government’s strategy at a time when it seems to be trying to persuade the world to help it target Gulen and his followers and ignore Erdogan’s growing domestic repression.But it’s becoming increasingly clear that the carefully curated government materials about the dangers of Gulen are for the Turkish people at home and abroad, rather than hard-to-convince foreigners. Many Turkish citizens feel that outsiders cannot and do not want to understand their political reality. They point to examples of Western media coverage that encouraged the coup because of the broad sense in the West that Erdogan has become an undesirable leader ― a narrative that ignores how the attempted overthrow of the elected government horrified millions of Turkish people, including government critics. This helps explain why Erdogan can flippantly cancel a key U.S. event. It’s not the American media or commentariat that he wants to appeal to; it’s his and Turkey’s base. Attendees close to the Turkish government were previously aware that Erdogan would ditch the expectant crowd on Friday and leave New York City on Thursday night, two of them told HuffPost. Turkish diplomats informed one source of this two days earlier, they said.(The Turkish Embassy in Washington did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Cemil Ozyurt, a Turkish journalist involved in organizing the event, said the president had changed his program Thursday night and informed the organizers Friday morning. Asked about embassy officials informing others about the change on Wednesday, Ozyurt responded, “If I had known that, what would have been a reason not to tell you? I did not know that.”)Turkey’s turn appears fine by the U.S., so long as Erdogan continues to cooperate on the Syrian civil war and the self-styled Islamic State. U.S. officials say they now treat the Turkish government with kid gloves, hoping not to spark a row and to enable President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry to achieve the resolutions they’re looking for on Syria. To respond to lingering anxieties in Turkey about alleged American support for the attempted coup, the administration has even sent a team to Turkey to help analyze potential evidence of Gulen’s role.And it was Erdogan’s comments on topics of U.S. interest like Syria ― particularly on his problems with the U.S.-aligned Syrian Kurds ― and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that drew the most press coverage during his time in the U.S.This leave-well-enough-alone attitude risks putting off conversations about tough issues that could decide Turkey’s future stability, such as how the state will function with thousands of officials purged and what authoritarian impulses Erdogan might follow next. Turkey has unleashed a fierce crackdown on the Kurdish community in recent months ― a bid to thwart a militant insurgency. Kurdish activists warn that the government brutality they have experienced may soon become commonplace around the country because of the environment of intense nationalism, suspicion and anger that Erdogan is helping foment.Some outsiders still mention such issues. Linda Robertson, a Kent State University professor, asked the foreign minister about her friends in academia who had been fired during the Friday event.But Erdogan’s government has already mapped out a narrative for responding to these concerns: The minister swiftly tied the question back to the popular Turkish idea that foreigners are not fully appreciating the trauma of the coup and may even have endorsed it. The country can’t afford another such crisis, Cavusoglu told Robertson, so anyone remotely suspicious must be removed from a position of power. Human rights advocates should simply have faith that the system will recognize who is a real threat and who isn’t.It was an example of the cycle that Erdogan’s government is helping create, which seems set to justify all manner of government excess in the eyes of most of the Turkish public.Meanwhile, the alarms grow louder abroad. Hours after the event concluded, with Erdogan safely back home, the credit ratings agency Moody’s took the unprecedented step of downgrading Turkey’s sovereign credit to the status of “junk.”The president had already made his views clear. He told Bloomberg that he would see any such moves as a political action against his country. After Moody’s announced the news, his followers promptly joined the chorus.If even the arbiters of global finance can’t penetrate Erdogan-world, complaints on Twitter stand almost no chance.This story was updated following the news that Turkish reporter Mahir Zeynalov’s tweets had been banned in Turkey.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

10,RELIGION,That Is Not My Jesus,"Travis Eades, ContributorSpeaker, Writer, and Pastor at Forefront Church in Manhattan, NYC",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/that-is-not-my-jesus_us_57e6b4e7e4b00267764fc221,"The more I get to know Jesus, the less I recognize him in His church today.",2016-09-24,“Piece of s--t n-----s. Every one of them needs a damn bullet in their head. If you don’t like this country get the hell out.”,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e6b58c1700001300ac6de0.jpg?ops=crop_1_295_747_632%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Skittles, Bullets and SnapchatI’ve been spending far too much time on Facebook this week. It’s sucking my soul dry. First was the meme comparing Syrian refugees to Skittles that was shared by countless people who identify as Christians. After that, I saw many of the same people rationalizing the killing of an unarmed black man because he was not “cooperating” with police. Those two things were already more than I could handle, but ever since a freshman at a prominent Christian college in Nashville, Tennessee took to Snapchat, I’ve reached new levels of frustration with my own religion in America.The Belmont University student posted a screenshot of three black NFL athletes raising their fists in solidarity with victims of police brutality with the most disgusting caption I’ve seen in recent memory.These words were typed by a young man who, at the very least, identifies with Christianity enough to pay tuition to a Christian college and is still willing to spew vitriol, violence and racism toward other human beings. This is how a Christian college freshman feels about people made in the image of God who have brown skin. This Christian college student believes black people should only be allowed to live in their home country (a country for many where their ancestors brought to by force and then sold as property for generations) if they are willing to quietly accept a life of oppression and marginalization. Should they ever choose to exercise their right to peacefully protest against systems racism and violence by simply taking a knee or raising a fist in silence, they deserve to be shot in the head.This is the beast lurking in the dungeon of American Christianity.How does a Christian reconcile Christ’s teachings with such deplorable thinking?In the eyes of privileged, white, Christian America, “life to the fullest” is reserved for those who are “like us.” If you are different, then you should get the hell out. If you are unhappy, then you should get the hell out. If you won’t cooperate, we will shoot you in the head. If you don’t like it, then get the hell out.WHOSE LIVES MATTER?In John chapter 5, Jesus heals a crippled man on the Sabbath and then tells him to stand up and carry the mat he had been laying on, which was a violation of the Mosaic Law. The Pharisees, ignoring the fact that Jesus had just transformed this man’s life forever, interrogated the man in order to find out who told him to violate the Sabbath. They then summoned Jesus to come answer for his “sin” where Jesus says the following in John chapter 5 verse 21,For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whomever he wishes.Whomever he wishes.So who did Jesus wish to give life to?Matthew 8- a leperMatthew 9- a tax collectorJohn 4- a Samaritan womanLuke 7- a sinful womanJohn 8- an adulterous womanLuke 7- a Centurion’s slaveLuke 18- a blind beggarJohn 5- a faithless crippleJohn 9- a man born blindMark 5- a demon possessed manMark 5- a bleeding womanMark 5- Jairus’s dead daughterJohn 18- an officer who came to arrest HimLuke 23- a convicted criminalJohn 21- everyone who had abandoned and betrayed HimThe “Jesus” that permeates American theology today is a powerful political leader, the founder of the Christian Religion, and the ultimate champion of conservative ideals.Is this who Jesus really is?I struggle to find any evidence of that in the scriptures.Jesus was the “stone the builders rejected,” because there was never a time when Jesus was accepted. Jesus lived his entire life in the margins of society.Jesus was a brown skinned, Middle Eastern, poor, Jewish refugee. His community assumed he was a bastard child. His people lived in fear of the Roman military. His family settled in an insignificant town on the outskirts of the Jewish world. He learned a humble trade, worked in order to help provide for his poor parents at a young age, and then devoted his adult life to everyone in his path who had been marginalized by people in positions of authority. Jesus brought life to those who NO ONE wished to offer life to.That Jesus, the one I just described, is not the Jesus that molds the hearts and minds of American Christianity today. That Jesus has been gentrified. The most important parts of the Jesus we find in the gospels have been co-opted by those in positions of privilege. Anyone who had previously been a part of the original community of Christ ― the poor, the sick, the disadvantaged, the shamed, the sinful, the racial minorities, and the social outcast- have been priced out of the “Kingdom of God” in America. They have been displaced to make room for the comfortable amenities preferred by those who have never had to live in discomfort.That is not my Jesus.The more I get to know Jesus, the less I recognize him in His church today. That needs to change.Jesus gave life to those who had their lives taken from them. If we are truly Christian, we must devote our lives to doing the same."

God, that sounds so good, right? I can almost see the flag flying. My little Southern heart nearly skips a beat, as I hear the tune of ""I'm Proud to be an American"" in my ears.As a senior in high school, I attended George W. Bush's inauguration. At 18, it was the biggest thrill of my life. But these days, I've never been more ashamed to be a former Republican. I really wish this was a nightmare we could all wake up from. And friends, to be clear: this is a nightmare.But we are wide awake.This is not the America of my childhood. The Republican party has proven they are no longer the party they used to be. Or maybe it's that they are finally bold enough to be exactly who they've always been.Why does the Grace is Messy guy suddenly care so much about politics? Because I have the sinking suspicion that Donald Trump's America doesn't look anything like a place that will respect and regard all people. I want to create and live in a place that accepts people as they are and celebrates their varied stories.America is a melting pot - a mixture of the most beautiful individuals you've ever seen. From my trans friend Jake, who I had tea with yesterday, to my amazing friends Kevin and Liz who are changing the face of what it means to be a queer Christian, to the beautiful Hispanic family we swam with last night at the neighborhood pool. This is my America. And I fear Donald Trump doesn't have what it takes to lead this America. Rather, he's a schoolyard bully, whose only intent is to prove just how powerful he really is. He has made it clear that he does not value my black brothers and sisters, my trans friends, or my queer church peers.Donald Trump's America is anything but great.But instead of giving you my assumptions, let's look at his own words.Here's what Trump has had to say about sex and women: •""You know, it doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass."" -- Esquire, 1991 •""I wouldn't mind if there were an anti-Viagra, something with the opposite effect. I'm not bragging. I'm just lucky. I don't need it. I've always said, ""If you need Viagra, you're probably with the wrong girl."" -- Playboy, 2004 •""No, I don't do anal."" -on Howard SternI have to ask how in the world evangelical leaders - our pastors - can read comments like the ones above and say this is the man I want to lead my country. How can they rail against sexual immorality on Sundays but hold this man up as the role model for your sons and grandsons? This is what it means to be the most powerful and influential man on the planet? THIS IS WHAT WE ARE DOING TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT?!And let's not forget Trump's love of ""the blacks"": •""I have a great relationship with the blacks."" -Celebrity Apprentice •""And if you look at black and African American youth, to a point where they've never done more poorly. There's no spirit."" -Twitter •""...laziness is a trait in blacks."" -TrumpedThe White House has seen Bill Clinton and his cigars, and Nixon and his politics. Certainly scandals have been a part of past Presidencies. But Donald Trump introduces a whole new level of immaturity, disrespect, and disregard for people. I have never known a more openly hateful, vile, abrasive person to be this close to leading the free world. On reality TV, Trump's brash opinions may earn him ratings. But this is not reality TV. What happened to a sense of dignity, self-respect, and acting Presidential?If you're asking yourself how can the messy grace guy be so harsh? Friend, it is because I am the grace guy. I cannot think of a more divisive, foul, or toxic American, other than maybe The Donald's good friend, Howard Stern. I used to admire the Office of the President so much. Now I fear for it.In a time when racial tensions are higher than they have ever been in my lifetime, Donald Trump wants to create America: Land of the Fearful, Home of the Bigot. It's like we've lost our minds and invited the old, fat, drunk uncle over for dinner. The one nobody wants to be around, who thinks his money entitles him to say whatever he wants. He's the one who slaps Grandma's ass as she gets the turkey out of the oven, and offends your wife with his filthy jokes at the table. And this guy isn't coming over for dinner, he's coming to lead the free world.My desire for the Church and for our nation is to see love and grace grow. To embrace everyone, as they are. And to respect the dignity of every human life. But that can't happen with a reality TV President."
12,POLITICS,The Debates Won't Change The Minds Of Trump Or Clinton Backers,"Earl Ofari Hutchinson, ContributorAuthor and political analyst",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-debates-wont-change-a_b_12159416.html,It doesn't make much difference what Trump or Clinton have to say about each other and policy issues. It won't change the fact that presidential debates make good theater but not much more.,2016-09-24,"A combination of file photos show L-R: U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2016 and U.S. President Barack Obama, and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. REUTERS/File Photos",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb82c35240000500098bd3b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reportedly has spent countless hours sequestered with a team of advisors, analysts, and debate coaches preparing for her round of debates with GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. They're throwing every kind of question and attack point that they can think of at her to get ready to parry either Trump's bombastic attacks or pirouette and deal with a kinder, gentler, calmer and more focused Trump. The point is not just to one-up Trump, and score more debate brownie points, but to dial her poll numbers up a notch over Trump. Presidential candidates see debates as their chance to really shine before millions and show that they, not the other guy, or in this case woman, is really not in their league as a fit match for the Oval Office. The blunt reality is that it doesn't make much difference what Trump or Clinton have to say about each other and policy issues. It won't change the fact that presidential debates make good theater but not much more. Studies back that up and show that a majority of voters feel they don't learn much from the debates, and are disappointed at that. Even the minority of respondents who say they learn something from the debates insist that they don't influence their decision on who to vote for. Party affiliation, long-standing political preferences, personal beliefs and values largely determine that.Richard Nixon, more than any other presidential candidate in modern times, found that out the hard way. The widely held belief is that Nixon's fidgety, wooden style, and unkempt appearance in his first 1960 televised debate with a relaxed, tanned, youthful looking John F. Kennedy did him in.In their two follow-up debates, though, a much better composed and relaxed Nixon came off as having as good, if not better, command of the issues than Kennedy. His perceived debate loss to Kennedy didn't finish him. Yet, it sealed the belief that an afternoon shadow, mussed hair, a malapropism, and a gaffe during a debate will make or break presidents and their challengers. That's a myth. In 1976, President Ford's bid for a full elected term supposedly went down the tubes when he blurted out that Poland wasn't under Soviet domination during his debate with Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter. Presumably, that gaffe shot to pieces Ford's credibility on vital foreign policy issues. But Ford could not shake Republican blame for the Watergate scandal, and his pardon of Nixon. This more than his debate miscue did him in.In 1980, it was thought that Republican challenger Ronald Reagan's carefully scripted and rehearsed ""There you go again"" retort to Jimmy Carter when he accused him of wanting to slash Medicare so befuddled Carter that his re-election bid came unglued. But by the time of their debate, Carter's presidency was badly tattered. Voters blamed him for high inflation, unemployment, waves of business failures, and the bungled Iran hostage rescue mission.In 1988, Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis' automaton-like answer in his debate with Vice President Bush Sr. to the loaded question about the death penalty supposedly blew his presidential bid. But Bush Sr. carried Reagan's imprimatur. The Reagan administration gave the appearance of fostering an economic boom, had stunning foreign policy successes marked by the collapse of the Soviet Union, and stratospheric public approval ratings.In his debate with Democratic challenger Bill Clinton in 1992, President Bush Sr. repeatedly glanced at his watch and seemed impatient to get the debate over. That allegedly soured voters on him. That did not torpedo his re-election bid. Bush's inability to resuscitate the economy and urban racial turmoil badly hurt him. What really nailed him was the insurgent campaign of Reform Party presidential candidate Ross Perot. He siphoned off thousands of potential Republican votes. In 2000, George W. Bush came off as personable, witty, and conversational in his debate with Democrat Al Gore. By contrast Gore was perceived as stiff, arrogant, and condescending. Yet, many experts believed that despite Gore's personality glitches, he still beat Bush on the issues. Gore went on to win the popular vote. It took the Florida vote debacle and a Supreme Court ruling to settle the matter for Bush. In the 2008 and 2012 debates between Obama and respectively McCain and Romney, the debates were pretty much seen as a draw. But the draw had almost nothing to do with any perceived erudition of either of the candidates on the issues. The voters that liked Obama liked him just as much or at least no less after the debates than before. The same held true for McCain and Romney.Trump versus Clinton will be good for the ratings, good TV watching for legions of viewers, and a good chance for Clinton and Trump's backers to cheer wildly for their guy or woman when they score a hit on a point. But after the cheers and telecast end they'll still be just as likely to vote for Clinton or Trump as they were before the two took center stage.

Children endured school once again, the birds twittered merrily, and lovers everywhere fell in love. Life went on for hundreds of millions. Lucky them.In the world of wonkcraft, though, political observers everywhere are caught in a waiting game, ticking off the moments until the first presidential debate (which happens this Monday night -- which you probably already knew, if you're reading this sort of article.) What will happen? Will Donald Trump melt down? Will he strain his ""presidential"" muscle? Will he storm off the stage in a tantrum, halfway through? Will Hillary Clinton make it through the evening without stumbling (either metaphorically or physically, one might add)? Will Lester Holt redeem NBC News after the fiasco named Matt Lauer? Will Trump reference body parts (his own, his opponent's, or perhaps even the moderator's)? It's certainly happened before.The audience, when the debate actually happens, will be huge. Tremendous, in fact. Some (we won't say who) are even predicting it could be a bigger television event worldwide than the 1969 moon landing. We aren't sure we'd go that far, but it certainly will be popular television, that's for sure. But while the vast majority of Americans won't be thinking about the debate until it actually happens, the rest of us in the world of political obsession have been thinking about little else all week long.Hillary Clinton is spending a lot of time on debate preparation, but Team Hillary has managed to keep quiet who is ""playing Trump"" in her practice debate sessions. Donald Trump, on the other hand, appears to be comfortable just winging it -- which, it must be admitted, worked pretty well for him in the primaries.Both candidates are being given conflicting advice on how tough to be. Clinton is being told to essentially ignore Trump and just ""be presidential"" the whole time, but another faction is urging her to whip out a verbal switchblade and plunge it into her opponent. Hey, why not? Even the Dalai Lama's now mocking Trump! Trump's natural inclination, of course, is to toss verbal hand grenades willy-nilly, but he is being urged by many Republicans to forgo the pleasure of doing so and (again) just to ""look presidential"" the whole time. Both sides are working the media refs, and will continue to do so right up to Monday night. Trump's team insists that if Trump just refrains from cursing (and/or being vicious), then he'll have ""won"" the night. Clinton's team has already worked the refs to its advantage, because the spectre of Matt Lauer's fiasco will be hanging over Lester Holt in a big way.But no matter what happens, and no matter what is said about it afterwards, we've all still got a few days left to wait. To fill the time, let's take a look back at the past week.One thing we do know for certain about Monday's debate -- there will only be two candidates on stage. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein didn't make the official cut (of polling 15 percent or better nationally), even though this race could indeed be affected by third-party voting in a big way.A fun fact that few have noticed: Donald Trump hasn't given a press conference in almost two months. What's up with that? Trump used to love sparring with (and taunting) the press, so the absence is notable.Perhaps there's a reason for this, since yet another conservative newspaper broke a century-old tradition by endorsing Hillary Clinton rather than the Republican candidate (as they usually do). It's getting so this barely even qualifies as news anymore. Trump may go down in history with the fewest newspaper endorsements ever, but (to be fair) that might not matter too much at all.As we were writing this, there was some breaking news on the Trump endorsement front, as Senator Ted Cruz swallowed the remaining shreds of whatever dignity he possessed, and went ahead and endorsed Donald Trump. For handy reference, the Washington Post put together a list of just some of the nasty things Cruz and Trump have said about each other. Cruz has called Trump: ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" ""a serial philanderer,"" ""utterly amoral,"" ""a bully"", and ""a sniveling coward."" That last one was right before he defended his wife by saying: ""Leave Heidi the hell alone.""Cruz was booed at the Republican National Convention for not openly supporting Trump during his speech, after which he explained why he couldn't honor the pledge all the GOP candidates made to support the eventual nominee: ""I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father. That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander my wife that I am going to come like a servile puppy dog for maligning my wife and maligning my father."" Today, servile puppy dog Ted Cruz came crawling to Trump. It'll be interesting to see what Trump has to say about it, because back during the convention Trump had pledged, about a Cruz endorsement: ""If he gives it, I will not accept it. I don't want his endorsement. Just, Ted, stay home, relax, enjoy yourself.""Speaking of spineless Republicans who have endorsed Trump, Chris Christie had a pretty bad week, because it came out in court that he probably did know all about the bridge closure while it was happening. Whoops! The New Jersey state congress is now reportedly considering impeaching him, which might guarantee that he'd never get to be Trump's attorney general. To convict Christie, Democrats would need to convince three state GOP senators to vote to convict, though, so it's not a sure thing.One quick note from the other side of the campaign aisle (if that metaphor isn't too mixed) that few have yet noticed: Hillary Clinton seems to be recovering somewhat in the polls. Now, this trend is recent and could just be statistical noise, and no matter what happens the credit or blame will likely go to her debate performance, but while most pundits are still going with ""Clinton down in the polls!"" the reality is that she's been doing better for at least a week -- while Trump's numbers have topped out and started to slide backwards. If she does well in the debate, she'll already have a tailwind at her back, to put this another way.And finally, a last item unrelated to the campaign. Not to be outdone by hating on Obamacare, a whole bunch of mostly-Republican states have now sued the Obama administration to try to stop the new overtime rule from going into effect this December. Obama announced the new rule a while back, which will double the threshold where employees can be called ""salaried"" -- thereby avoiding pesky overtime payments for their employers. The old limit was decades old, whereas the new limit of $47,500 is much more in line with today's working reality. As it turns out, greedy corporations aren't the only ones abusing low-paid workers by working them 50 or 60 hours a week with no extra pay -- state governments have been exploiting the same loophole! And now they're sad, because they are going to have to stop the practice. What was interesting was what one of the attorneys general suing predicted, should the new rule take effect: ""it may lead to disastrous consequences for our economy."" Um, yeah, because giving workers more money or more time to enjoy it would certainly be a disaster, right? Yet another difference between the two parties that Democrats out on the campaign trail really should be exploiting.This week's Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week award was pretty easy to pick, as Senator Elizabeth Warren proved once again what a bang-up choice she would have been for Hillary Clinton's veep.Warren excels at raking Wall Street executives over the coals in Senate hearings, of course, and this week was no different. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf was on the hot seat this time around, for running a scam for five years and then ""cleaning it up"" by firing a bunch of low-level employees and giving all the executives (himself included) fat multi-million-dollar bonuses.Warren was scathing in her indictment not only of Stumpf, but of the culture that allows such things to happen. She lit into him with barely-concealed disgust, saying to his face: ""You should resign. You should give back the money you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated."" She had plenty of other things to say, as well:""This just isn't right,"" Warren said. ""You squeezed employees to the breaking point"" to drive up the stock price and your compensation, she said, referencing the bank's fierce drive to ""cross-sell"" or make customers open up multiple accounts. ""You went on television to blame thousands of $12-an-hour"" workers.Amen to that, sister. Elizabeth Warren continues to be the worst scourge Wall Street has seen since Teddy Roosevelt, and she more than earned her eleventh MIDOTW award this week. Since the veep slot is already taken, might we suggest Secretary of the Treasury Elizabeth Warren?[Congratulate Senator Elizabeth Warren on her Senate contact page, to let her know you appreciate her efforts.]For the second time inside the same month, our obvious winner of the Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award is none other than serial peter-tweeter Anthony ""Most Appropriate Last Name Ever"" Weiner.This one may be a whole lot more serious than all the other times he got caught ""sexting"" with women who were not currently married to him. Because this time, Weiner was reportedly committing digital hanky-panky with a 15-year-old girl. Wow. We really thought he had already hit the lowest part of the gutter, but it turns out he has sunk even further into the slime down there. So far into the slime that he is now facing a criminal investigation, because getting raunchy with underage high school students online is actually against the law (which wasn't true for all his other exploits with adult women).In fact, we can't even bring ourselves to rake through the sordid details, so we'll just provide one link to an overview story with nothing but the broad details, as well as a link to the original story, which comes complete with all the naughty texts and the eyebrow-raising details (which include rape fantasies and an actual schoolgirl dressing up like a schoolgirl). Choose which link to read, based on the strength of your intestinal fortitude, we suppose.One thing that didn't give us a moment's pause, however, was to hand Anthony Weiner his sixth Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week -- all given out for his amorous online behavior. Four weeks ago, when we gave him his fifth award, we wrote: ""Hopefully, three strikes means he will forever be out of the public eye, and we'll never have to give him another MDDOTW award ever again. Hopefully, at any rate.""Our hopes, as it turned out, were dashed -- within a single month's time.[We do not provide people's contact info who are not currently in public office as a rule, but as it turns out it appears you can send Anthony Weiner a text message quite easily. I mean, it must be pretty easy because it has happened so often, right?]Volume 409 (9/23/16)After typing in this week's volume number, we were reminded of a time when music and automotive enthusiasm were one and the same. Yes, we speak of the Beach Boys, and the immortal lines:She's real fine, my 409These were simpler times, back when a band could include a line like: ""My four-speed dual-quad Posi-Traction 409"" and everyone knew what they were talking about (without having to have Marisa Tomei explain it in My Cousin Vinny, either). Good times, indeed. Seriously, given the choice between that and the brand name of a household cleaner, we'll choose the Beach Boys every time. Truer words were never spoken: ""Giddy up, giddy up, 409.""Ahem. Where were we? Oh, right, politics. Somehow we got distracted there for a moment. We do apologize, it won't happen again.The business at hand is, of course, attempting to create some zingers for Hillary Clinton to use in Monday's debate. We tried to pick just the things that will really get under Trump's orange skin. He's awfully touchy about certain subjects, so if the moderator isn't hitting them hard enough, Clinton should step in and do so herself. Given the fact that she'll have a couple of minutes for each response, the talking points came out longer than normal this week. But if Clinton even says anything close to any of them, we'll be happy enough.Trump is pretty easy to bait, and if he hasn't melted down by (say) halfway through, then Clinton should start needling him to provoke the ""Mr. Hyde"" version of Trump millions of people will be tuning in to see. So here are our seven suggestions to be included in Hillary's debate prep sessions. Whose hands?No, that's not a lead-in to a ""tiny hands"" joke. Sure, it'd be amusing if Hillary went there, but we seriously doubt she will. Instead, it's an answer to a riff Trump let loose earlier this week.""Donald, you said earlier this week, and I quote: American hands will rebuild our nation, not the hands of people from other nations. Unquote. I find this a little laughable, because it's a well-known fact that Trump Tower was built using Polish laborers, some of whom were illegal immigrants at the time. Your new D.C. hotel was built with lots of Central American construction workers, also including some undocumented immigrants. Down in Mar-a-Lago, you import foreign workers every summer rather than hire American workers who according to you should have jobs made available to them before any foreigners are even considered. And don't even get me started on all the products -- your signature ties, your suits -- which are made in China and elsewhere overseas. So why should anyone believe you when you say you'll make sure 'American hands' are put to work? After all, you certainly have never operated any of your own business that way."" Ever? Really?This one is such an easy shot, we'd be downright surprised if Clinton doesn't take it.""Last week, you said the following: 'our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever.' Wow -- that's pretty definite, isn't it? 'Ever, ever, ever.' Really? Can you not even think of one single period of American history where African-American communities were in worse shape? Not even one? Do any of these words mean anything to you at all? Jim Crow. Segregation. Slavery. Lynchings. Race riots. Dred Scott. Separate but equal. Any of these ringing a bell? But according to you, the current situation is worse than all of those bygone eras. I mean, have you ever taken an American history class? Ever? Ever? Ever?"" Why should anyone believe you?This subject is going to come up, obviously.""You know, Donald, you are asking American voters to take a whole lot on nothing but your word. You say you're worth billions -- but you won't let anyone look at your taxes. You say you give millions to charity, but won't prove it in any way. You say you hate all the influence-buying in politics, but it turns out your campaign is handing millions of dollars that other people have donated to you over to your own businesses -- seven percent of all the money you've recently spent went to your own businesses. Now, I've released decades of my tax returns so the public can see how much I give to charity, how much money I make, and where it comes from. You refuse to do the same. You say you're under audit, but you won't even release older tax returns which are not covered by the audit. Why won't you show the public your tax returns for 2006? Or 2005? Or 2001? Or any year before that? What do you have to hide? What are you scared the public will figure out? That you're nowhere near as wealthy as you pretend to be? That you don't pay any taxes at all? I'll even make it easy for you, so you can keep your big secret hidden in every tax return you've ever filed -- just answer me one simple question: how much money did you personally donate to charity last year? How much? Just a ballpark figure -- that won't affect your audit in any way, shape, or form. So how much did you give last year, Donald -- out of your own pocket? It's a pretty easy question, after all."" Cracks in the foundationClinton, of course, will be asked about her family foundation. After answering the question, she should demand equal time from Trump.""The Clinton Foundation has consistently earned the highest ratings from independent organizations who carefully examine non-profit records. We just earned four stars out of four, as a matter of fact. Meanwhile, the Donald J. Trump foundation has been operated like a personal slush fund by Mr. Trump. He hasn't donated one thin dime to his namesake foundation in over six years, which is rather astonishing. The Trump Foundation just got caught giving a political donation to an attorney general who was thinking about filing charges against the Trump University scam. That's illegal, and led to a fine from the I.R.S. But there's plenty of other questionable activities the Trump Foundation has been caught doing -- like spending tens of thousands of dollars on paintings of Donald Trump that were then hung in his for-profit businesses. That's illegal, too. The Trump Foundation has even been exposed for paying off Donald Trump's personal legal obligations, in court, to the tune of over a quarter-million dollars. Donald, you stiffed a guy who thought he had won a million bucks by hitting a hole-in-one -- since you promised this amount during the tournament -- and then after he had to sue you, you paid the man off by donating to his charity from your own charity, instead of out of your own pocket like you should have. Which is, once again, illegal. My charity does good work all over the globe. Yours seems to be nothing more than a cookie jar for you to dip into whenever you feel like."" Show me the money!I considering going with ""Where's the beef?"" but that's even staler than Jerry Maguire.""You know, Donald, I hear a whole lot of ideas from you about what you're going to do as president. You make all kinds of promises, but the one thing that you won't admit is that all the things you say you're going to do -- walls, deportations, stuff like that -- cost money. And you never seem to get around to saying how you're going to pay for any of it. Your plans would add trillions of dollars to the national debt, something you say you disapprove of. When I propose a plan, I say how I'm going to pay for it. You don't. Plain and simple. What are you going to do if you actually do pass some of these things into law, and it blows a trillion-dollar hole in the budget? In the real world, things have to be paid for. I know this might be a foreign concept to you, since you're used to stiffing people who work for you and daring them to sue you if they want more than pennies on the dollar of what you promised you'd pay them, and you're also used to just declaring one of your companies bankrupt and walking away from all your debt, but the government doesn't work that way. So I ask you, Donald, for all of these supposedly-wonderful things you're promising you'll do: Where's the money going to come from? Show me the money!"" Hundreds of millions?Getting back to those tax returns....""Why should America trust Donald Trump to set our foreign policy when he won't even tell us how much he owes foreign banks? Rumor has it that Trump has a tough time getting American banks to lend him any money anymore, because he's stiffed them so many times in his convenient bankruptcies. They've learned their lesson -- lending money to Trump is a bad bet. So he had to go overseas to get funding. He finally found some banks in China and Russia that would lend him money, and now I've seen estimates that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to banks in both countries. So again, because you have such a big secret in your tax returns that we aren't even going to get a chance to see them, let me ask you point-blank: How much money do you owe Chinese and Russian bankers, Donald? It's an easy question, and one that anyone auditioning for commander-in-chief needs to clearly answer. Because you'd better believe that's going to influence our entire country's foreign policy if Donald Trump is elected."" C'mon, you can say it!Perhaps it's all the talk of ""Where's the beef?"" and Beach Boys songs, but I couldn't resist the urge to reach way back for this one. Those who recognize it will immediately get the joke. Those who don't, ask someone over the age of 45 to explain it to you.""Can you even say the words 'I was wrong,' Donald? Is it even physically possible for you to utter that phrase? So far, there's been no evidence of it. You spent how many years stating Barack Obama was hiding something in his birth certificate, or was perhaps born elsewhere. Then, last week, I guess your political handlers and donors made you dance like a puppet on a string and admit that Barack Obama was indeed born in Hawai'i, just like he had been saying all along. So, he was right. You were wrong. Man up, Donald. Admit it. Just say the words 'I was wrong' once, to prove you can. Otherwise, we'll all just have to believe you've got the same speech impediment that so famously afflicted the Fonz.""Chris Weigant blogs at:Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"

She and her policy advisors have taken a page out Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's political ""playbook."" When he was White House Chief of Staff during President Obama's first term his political strategy and ""mantra"" was ""You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that it's an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.""For more than a year the Black Lives Matters Movement, including white people and other People of Color who supported them, have been crying out for national, State, and community leaders to intervene to stop the repeated shootings of Black men by police. They pleaded for our attention to stop the repeated actions of police in choosing lethal force as their first option in seeking to effect an arrest, that might, in some cases, have otherwise been lawful.President Obama convened meetings at the the White House between Chiefs of police and other law enforcement representatives with select community leaders from across the country. Police killings of Black men continued. During the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, NC this summer Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton invited ""Mothers of The Movement"" to come to the Convention. The mothers of Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Jordan Davis, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Dontré Hamilton, Hadiya Pendleton, Blair Holt and Oscar Grant took the stage to speak about the deaths of their  children and express their support for Hillary Clinton to become president. Republican candidate Donald Trump began speaking about the living, education, and lack of jobs conditions in Black communities, asking Black Americans publicly, based upon his perception of life in our communities, ""What have you got to lose?""Against this background, our initial reaction to the news that Hillary Clinton plans to go to Charlotte tomorrow was ""beware of Greeks bearing gifts""; a phrase used to warn against possible deception by an adversary. (When a ""Trojan Horse"" was left at the gates of Troy, the Trojans thought the Greeks had left it as a parting gift because they had given up & sailed home)Then we read the Op Ed column by Rev, William Barber, II, in today's New York Times. He is President of the NAACP in Charlotte. He reminds us""That systemic violence, which rarely makes headlines, creates the daily traumatic stress that puts our communities on edge, affecting both those of us who live there and outside observers who often denounce ""black-on-black"" crime. We cannot have a grown-up conversation about race in America until we acknowledge the violent conditions engendered by government policy and police practice.""""Anyone who is concerned about violence in Charlotte should note that no one declared a state of emergency when the city's schools were re-segregated, creating a school-to-prison pipeline for thousands of poor African-American children. Few voiced outrage over the damage caused when half a million North Carolinians were denied health insurance because the Legislature refused to expand Medicaid.""So, we will have wait and see what difference, if any, candidate Hillary Clinton visit to Charlotte will make on the issues recited by Reverend Barber and the repeated pleas by the Black Lives Matter Movement for the conscience of America to stop the police killings of black men."
15,POLITICS,Americans Still Aren't All That Scared About Terrorism,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americans-still-arent-all-that-scared-about-terrorism_us_57e5926ce4b0e80b1ba21a4c,Most of the public doesn't trust either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump to make the country safer.,2016-09-23,U.S. President Barack Obama walks from the lectern after speaking about last Saturday's bombing in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood in New York.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e592d01700002900ac6be3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last weekend’s bombing in New York City set off another wave of discussions about how fears of terrorism could affect the 2016 election ― but it didn’t leave Americans particularly shaken up, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll suggests.Twenty-one percent of Americans say they’re “very scared” about the way things are going in the world today, and 71 percent say they’re at least somewhat scared, little changed from the 22 percent and 70 percent, respectively, who said the same in a HuffPost/YouGov survey taken last December.Also virtually unchanged was the percentage of Americans who say they worry a great deal that they or someone in their family will become a victim of terrorism ― 12 percent in the most recent survey, and 13 percent last winter.And, as was the case last year, the possibility of being personally affected by terrorism or gun violence isn’t at the top of most Americans’ minds. While 30 percent rated that as among their two biggest worries in the most recent poll, the top spot went to economic and health concerns. Forty-two percent of Americans say they worry about losing a job or having financial problems, while an equal 42 percent are concerned about suffering a serious illness or injury.Different demographic groups have different concerns. Younger Americans are most worried about losing a job, while those over age 65 are far more anxious about the possibility of suffering ill health. Twenty-eight percent of black Americans rank the possibility that they or someone in their family will be the victim of police brutality among their biggest fears, while just 4 percent of white Americans say the same. Forty percent of Republicans, but just 28 percent of Democrats, consider becoming the victim of terrorism or gun violence a top worry.It’s not clear which of the two presidential candidates would benefit more should their campaign turn to focus more on issues related to America’s safety.Americans say by a 14-point margin, 36 percent to 22 percent, that electing Hillary Clinton would make the country less safe, rather than more safe. By a 7-point margin, 42 percent to 35 percent, they say the same about Donald Trump. About a third of Americans say Clinton wouldn’t do much to change the safety of the U.S., while just 14 percent say the same of Trump.Americans who think Trump would make the country safer are, by almost every measure, more concerned about their safety than the rest of the public. They’re more than twice as likely as their fellow countrymen ― 32 percent, as opposed to 15 percent ― to say they’re “very scared” about the way things are going in the world today. Twenty percent, compared to 8 percent of everyone else, worry a great deal that they or someone in their family will be affected by a terrorist attack. And they’re 10 points likelier than others to cite becoming the victim of such an attack as among their top two concerns.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 20-Sept. 21 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here. More details on the polls’ methodology are available here.Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov’s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample, rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling.
