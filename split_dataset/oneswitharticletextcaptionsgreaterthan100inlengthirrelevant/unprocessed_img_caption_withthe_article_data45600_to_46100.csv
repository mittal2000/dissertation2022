0,POLITICS,Here's Why Republicans Are Suddenly Demanding Tougher Bank Regulation,Amanda Terkel and Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cfpb-wells-fargo_us_57e1a76ee4b08d73b82e102e,GOP senators want to know why Elizabeth Warren's consumer watchdog didn't go after Wells Fargo earlier.,2016-09-20,Senate Banking Committee Chair Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) was skeptical of CFPB's oversight during a hearing Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e1ac381800006c32bd2c3f.jpeg?cache=488X30fISh&ops=crop_0_518_3913_2148%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans don’t like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They opposed the very idea of the watchdog when Elizabeth Warren first proposed its creation, and they have been trying to defang and defund it ever since Congress made her vision into a reality. Republicans typically attack the CFPB for being good at its job. The agency has returned over $11 billion to a total of 25 million bilked consumers in its first five years, and every dollar that goes back to customers is a dollar that a financial firm doesn’t get to book as its own profit. Banks, payday lenders and other operators have spent a lot of money on lobbying and campaign contributions to stem this cash outflow. And Republicans have responded by crafting legislation to tie up the CFPB with red tape and made it harder to enforce its consumer protection rules. Both the House and Senate are currently pushing bills that analysts at the investment bank Keefe, Bruyette and Woods describe as “weakening” the agency.The CFPB has enjoyed a run of good press after it slapped a $100 million fine on Wells Fargo for using customers’ personal information and money to sign them up for online banking services that the customers never asked for. Over at least the past five years, bank employees created more than 1.5 million sham checking accounts and applied for 565,000 credit cards. Many customers found out about the new accounts after they started accumulating fees. But CFPB is still facing heat from Republicans ― ironically, this time, for not regulating Wells Fargo hard enough. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf and CFPB Director Richard Cordray, among others, faced the Senate banking committee Tuesday morning. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), the committee chairman, pressed the CFPB on why it didn’t go after Wells Fargo more quickly, noting that the Los Angeles Times first reported on the problems in December 2013 and the Los Angeles city attorney sued the bank in 2015. “This timeline begs the question: Where were the federal regulators during those years?” Shelby asked. “Why did it take an LA Times reporter to uncover what should have been uncovered by Wells Fargo’s regulators? If there were ever a textbook case where consumers needed protection, this was it,” the senator added. “How many millions of unauthorized accounts does it take before the CFPB notices?”Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), another committee member, told The Huffington Post after the hearing that he was also concerned the Los Angeles Times was more on top of the issue than the CFPB was. “From what I can tell, the consumer bureau had nothing to do with finding this. I know they came along to vacuum up a fine, if you will. But from what we understand, it was actually the LA Times reporter who uncovered this,” Corker said. “Look, I think we should have consumer protection. I always have,” he added. “I was part of negotiating a bill that would certainly create a consumer protection bureau. I do think having a commission or board members would be a good check and a balance. But I have no indication here ― and again, I support their existence ― but I have no indication that they had anything whatsoever toward uncovering this.”“In today’s Banking hearing, Wells Fargo CEO Stumpf admitted that he knew about the fraudulent sales practices back in 2013, but in fact, this was a problem back in 2011. This is a classic example of a ‘Too Big to Fail’ megabank being ‘Too Big to Manage’ and ‘Too Big to Regulate,’” Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “If the federal regulators had been doing their job all along, we would have ended this scam several years ago.” Vitter previously co-authored a bill with Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) that would have broken up big banks.Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said the Wells Fargo incident didn’t change his mind about the need to change CFPB.“I have yet to see any proof that the CFPB would have prevented the mess we are seeing unravel at Wells Fargo,” Scott said in a statement. “It remains an unelected and non-transparent board that is only enlarging the bureaucracy.”ER Anderson, spokesman for Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), also said the senator believes CFPB “was asleep at the switch.” He said Toomey believes Well Fargo employees’ actions were “outrageous and fraudulent,” and the guilty employees and negligent management “should be held accountable.” “But let’s be clear,” Anderson added. “CFPB did not discover the wrongdoing by Wells Fargo. ... In fact Senator Toomey asked the CFPB, other federal regulators, the L.A. City Attorney, and even Wells Fargo about the CFPB’s involvement and none can provide any evidence that the CFPB discovered any wrong doing. Unlike the OCC and the L.A. City Attorney, the CFPB continues to refuse to provide evidence that it played any role in unearthing or cleaning up the mess other than collecting the $100 million fine from the bank ― not a penny of which the CFPB will give to the victims.”Cordray said Tuesday, however, that the CFPB knew about the abuses before the Los Angeles Times, first learning about them from whistleblowers in mid-2013. Shelby pressed Cordray on the timeline of investigations, trying to get him to admit that the CFPB essentially glommed onto the work of the LA city attorney and the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Cordray replied that his agency was doing its own investigation all along:SHELBY: Prior to filing the city lawsuit in May 2015, did CFPB personnel accompany [the Los Angeles city attorney’s] investigators as they did the following: conducted numerous interviews with former Wells Fargo employees, met with aggrieved victims, poured over public records including court records from wrongful termination lawsuits by Wells Fargo. Did they?The other GOP senators on the banking committee did not return requests for comment. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said during Tuesday’s hearing that the Wells Fargo revelations show that the agency has had a “very salutary influence” and is “a necessary part of our system of banking and governing.” And Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton pledged to protect the CFPB in an open letter to Wells Fargo customers Tuesday.This article has been updated to include comments from Sens. Scott and Toomey."

Biden said the new measures will allow patients to find clinical trials more easily and quickly and increase transparency in reporting trial results.Cancer researchers welcomed the moves.“I would characterize the changes Vice President Biden announced as good first steps,” Dr. Barbara Ann Burtness, clinical research program leader for head and neck cancers at Yale Cancer Center said.“Better information about the trials that are available and how to find these trials will undoubtedly be helpful to patients,” she said. “Innovative trial designs which ask bigger questions more efficiently are also badly needed.Dr. Ronald DePinho, president of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, which conducts more clinical trials than any other U.S. center, said ‘Moonshot’ is timely because progress is being made faster than ever.“What is being recognized by the Vice President,” he said, “is that there are certain processes that we have in place that are relatively inefficient,” including the ability for institutions to share data.Among Friday’s announcements: The National Institutes of Health is seeking to make ClinicalTrials.gov, where clinical trials are posted, more user friendly and the NIH is publishing a final rule specifying reporting requirements for clinical trials, the statement said.In future, investigators will be required to publish summaries of trial results whether or not they resulted in an approved product.“This will enhance transparency within the clinical trials enterprise, allowing people to make more informed decisions about participating in research,” the statement said.Biden, who’s son Beau died last year at the age of 46 from brain cancer, has helped fuel Biden’s sense of urgency about the project, which was first announced by President Barack Obama in his State of the Union address in January.(Reporting by Toni Clarke in Washington; editing by Grant McCool)"
2,BUSINESS,Feds Investigating Exxon On Climate Change,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sec-investigates-exxon_us_57e17efce4b04a1497b7099f,"The investigation has been called a ""moment of reckoning"" for the corporation.",2016-09-20,"The logo of Exxon Mobil Corporation is shown on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, New York, U.S.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e18c55180000113cbd2baa.jpeg?cache=uf8DQxED9c&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has joined the growing list of agencies and offices probing ExxonMobil on climate change.The federal agency has launched an investigation into how the oil and gas company values its future projects in the face of global climate change and plunging oil prices, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed sources.The SEC, the Journal reports, is looking into Exxon’s practice of not writing down the value of its assets ― something other major U.S. energy companies have done in response to falling oil prices ― and how the company “calculates the impact to its business from the world’s mounting response to climate change.”The investigation adds to those led by the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts. In November 2015, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Exxon seeking documents related to the allegations that the company lied to its investors and committed fraud by covering up the risks of climate change. In March, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said her office would join the ExxonMobil probes in New York and California. Alan Jeffers, media relations manager for Exxon Mobil Corporation, acknowledged the investigation in an email Tuesday to The Huffington Post, and said the SEC is the “appropriate entity to examine issues related to impairment, reserves and other communications important to investors.”“We are fully complying with the SEC request for information and are confident our financial reporting meets all legal and accounting requirements,” Jeffers said.The SEC declined to comment Tuesday.Questions about what Exxon and other big oil companies knew about carbon emissions and climate change, how early they knew it, and what they did with that information have taken center stage in recent years. As state attorneys general and environmental groups continue digging into these matters, Republican politicians have run to Exxon’s defense.In July, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), a longtime climate change denier and chair of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, subpoenaed those involved in ongoing investigations, claiming their probes “amount to a form of extortion” and are a “blatant effort to silence free speech.” The subpoenaed parties have refused to turn over the demanded documents.Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org, one of the subpoenaed parties, said in a statement Tuesday that the SEC investigation is a “remarkably important development” that adds to the “courageous” actions of state attorneys general and clues uncovered by “powerful investigative journalism.”“Before they’re done we’ll understand considerably more about how the world overheated ― but in the meantime, every institution that invests in Exxon should take real note of who you’re keeping company with,” he said.Katherine Sawyer, senior international organizer of Corporate Accountability International, said in a statement that the world has long been pushing for Exxon to be held accountable.“This investigation marks a moment of reckoning for the corporation,” she said. “Coupled with attorneys general investigations into Exxon’s campaign of climate denial, the SEC’s probe means the corporation’s days of deception are numbered.”ExxonMobil shares fell 1.5 percent Tuesday following news of the SEC’s investigation.This story has been updated to include a statement from ExxonMobil."
3,POLITICS,Health Insurers Fire Volley In New Battle Over The Public Option,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/public-option-fight-insurance_us_57e03a66e4b08cb140974781,"“The big insurance lobby is spooked because the public option is back,” said one advocate for a government-run insurance plan.",2016-09-20,"Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) has recruited 32 co-sponsors for a bill expressing support for the public option, but it isn't expected to pass. Still, the insurance industry seems concerned.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e03c1e180000c7063159ec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Senate Democrats announced a new push for a public option in Obamacare last week, the private insurance industry swung into action. And it did so quickly.On Friday, the industry’s main trade group sent out an “action alert” to members, asking them to call Senate offices and offering a set of talking points critical of the public option ― that is, a government-run insurance plan for people buying coverage through one of Obamacare’s exchanges. “We need proven solutions that will make healthcare more affordable for everyone,” Marilyn Tavenner, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement accompanying the action alert obtained by The Huffington Post. “A public option is not one of those solutions – not for consumers, for doctors, for hospitals, or for taxpayers. We need to solve problems, not make them worse.”The alert came hours after Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) announced he’d recruited 32 co-sponsors for a new bill expressing support for a public option ― a position that both President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton have publicly endorsed in the last few weeks.Merkley’s resolution is nonbinding and unlikely to pass, since Republicans have a majority and unanimously oppose the public option. But the insurance industry’s vigorous reaction suggests it considers the prospect of a public option becoming law to be real ― and dangerous. “The fact that insurance companies are already rallying to kill this idea shows all the more the importance of a public option in holding insurance companies accountable and providing much-needed competition in the marketplace,” Merkley said.Democrats have recently renewed their push for the public option to shore up the exchanges, which have been plagued by rising premiums and dwindling competition in many parts of the country. Besides Obama and Clinton, supporters include Democratic leaders such as Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and high-profile progressives like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).The fight over the public option was one of the most high-profile battles in 2009 and 2010, when Congress was crafting the legislation that eventually became the Affordable Care Act. Depending on how it’s designed, a public option could use government leverage to demand cheaper prices from hospitals, drug makers and other medical care providers. The idea would be to pass those savings along to consumers as lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs ― in theory, forcing private insurance companies selling through the exchanges to bring down their premiums as well.During the Obamacare fight, the public option had enthusiastic, sustained support from progressives. But it couldn’t get past opposition from more conservative Democrats ― and even concerned some more liberal ones. One big reason was lobbying from trade groups representing pretty much every part of the health care industry, including insurers.In the memo that went out to AHIP members on Friday, vice president Jeremy Allen, AHIP’s senior vice president for federal affairs, said that a public option “would not do anything to address the challenges in the Exchanges” and called for other measures to shore up the exchanges ― like tighter scrutiny of people who apply for insurance during the year, outside of the normal open enrollment period. The letter also called for delaying a tax on insurers that’s scheduled to take effect again this year after Congress temporarily suspended it last year.“This is not anything new,” Clare Krusing, AHIP press secretary, told HuffPost. “Our position on the public option has been clear and consistent. The public option is not a solution that will fix the Exchanges, nor is [it] an answer to the cost challenges facing consumers.”“The big insurance lobby is spooked because the public option is back,” said Sarah Badawi, senior lobbyist for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is part of a seven-member coalition leading the public option charge. The other members of the coalition are Daily Kos, Democracy for America, MoveOn.org, Presente.org, UltraViolet, and the Working Families Party."
4,BUSINESS,Dr. Bronner's Just Made A Dank Donation In Fight For Legal Weed,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dr-bronners-marijuana_us_57e1695ee4b08cb140983ef3,It plans to give over half a million to nonprofits campaigning for this change.,2016-09-20,"CEO David Bronner was once arrested for locking himself in a cage full of hemp in the middle of Washington, D.C. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e185a91800006c32bd2b84.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soaps wants to see laws legalizing marijuana get puff-puff passed. The endearingly quirky organic soap-maker said Monday it plans to donate $660,000 to two nonprofit groups ― New Approach and the Marijuana Policy Project ― campaigning for legal weed in California, Massachusetts, Maine, Arizona and Nevada. In November, all five states are set to vote on ballot measures that could make recreational marijuana use legal. “The expected sweep of these states will exert enormous pressure on federal lawmakers to end the racist, outdated policy of cannabis prohibition, that shreds productive citizens’ lives and families for no good reason, and focus law enforcement resources instead on actual crime,” the Vista, California-based company, which operates as a family business, said in a statement.Dr. Bronner’s has long supported ending prohibition laws on cannabis. In 2012, CEO David Bronner was arrested in Washington, D.C., after he locked himself in a cage full of hemp plants to protest laws banning the plant. The company’s latest move comes as part of a broader push to tout the $1.01 million it’s spending to assert its credibility as a for-profit ally of politically progressive causes.Dr. Bronner’s said it plans to contribute $250,000 to the nonprofit Fairness Project to back campaigns to hike the minimum wage in Arizona, Colorado and Maine to $12 and in Washington to $13.50 in the next four years.The company said it already gave another $100,000 to the Humane Society of the United States to support the animal rights group’s push for a ballot measure in Massachusetts that would end confinement of veal calves, egg-laying hens and pigs.The firm announced the donations on Monday, when it resigned from the Organic Trade Association, an industry group, over its support for a bill that undermines efforts to label products containing genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. About 88 percent of Americans support mandatory labeling of foods containing GMOs, according to a survey released in July by the University of Pennsylvania. Just 39 percent of those polled agreed that “GMO crops are safe to eat,” while 27 percent disagreed with the statement and 30 percent abstained. GMOs remain a lightning rod issue in the U.S., despite study after study debunking the fearmongering and myths surrounding them. For Dr. Bronner’s, the problem seems to be less about crops and more about the chemical companies, like Monsanto, that promote their use. As Mother Jones reported in a 2013 profile of Bronner: His beef with GMOs has less to do with ambiguous fears about “frankenfoods” than with the well-documented effects of the widespread deployment of herbicide- and pest-resistant genetically modified crops. While those breakthroughs were meant to cut down on the need for chemical inputs, studies have found that they’ve instead bred new superbugs and superweeds that, in turn, must be suppressed with ever more and stronger pesticides and herbicides.In 2013, Adam Eidinger, who now serves as Dr. Bronner’s head of activism, was arrested for posing as a Monsanto lobbyist and dumping $1,600 in dollar bills in a Senate building. That same year, Dr. Bronner’s funded a 6,000-mile cross-country tour to raise awareness about the use of fish genes in genetically modified produce.“I have no in-principle objection to genetic engineering or synthetic biology,” CEO David Bronner told Mother Jones. “Far from freeing us from the chemical treadmill, GMOs are doubling down on it.”"

7,POLITICS,Donald Trump Helped Spread Birtherism. Now He Can't Stop It.,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-birther-poll_us_57e12c21e4b04a1497b68044,"The Republican nominee now admits that President Obama was born in the U.S., but many Republicans still aren't so sure.",2016-09-20,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump publicly renounced his long-held belief that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. But many of his followers have not done the same, polls show.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e12d051800006c32bd2987.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump, one of the loudest proponents of the conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the U.S., publicly abandoned the idea last week. “President Obama was born in the United States, period,” he said. At the time he was giving that speech, however, most Republicans still espoused the belief that Obama wasn’t American-born.If anyone could help convince members of the GOP to stop questioning the president’s birthplace, you might expect it to be their presidential nominee ― especially since he’s spent years leading the crusade. But Trump may only be able to stuff the genie partly back into the bottle.In the wake of Trump’s statement, Republicans are now less likely than they were in January to say Obama was not born in America, but a substantial majority still refuse to say affirmatively that he was, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds.“People will go to great lengths to cling to their prior beliefs, even in the face of a good deal of contradictory evidence. Trump’s statement is just one more piece of contradictory evidence. It doesn’t seem to have been enough to move people from one side to the other,” said Joanne Miller, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota who’s researched the impact of ideology on conspiracy theories. “For Republicans who have clung to the belief that Obama was not born in the U.S. for a very long time, it is difficult to now admit they were wrong, even when their presidential nominee tells them they are,” she said.In January, 21 percent of Republicans surveyed by HuffPost/YouGov said Obama was born in the U.S., 53 percent said he was not and 26 percent said they weren’t sure. In this week’s poll, by contrast, 33 percent of Republicans say Obama was born in the U.S., 39 percent say he was not and 28 percent say they aren’t sure.Meanwhile, 47 percent of Republicans now say there are still reasons to doubt that Obama was born in the United States, while 18 percent say there were reasons to doubt that Obama was born here, but those questions have now been settled. Just about one-fifth say there has never been any reason to doubt that Obama was born in America.“It’s discouraging that Trump’s retraction does so little to reduce belief in the birther myth,” said Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College who’s studied the difficulties of correcting political misinformation. “But we shouldn’t be surprised ― even the release of Obama’s long-form birth certificate had a relatively small and short-lived effect.”In order to test the effects of Trump’s statement on public opinion about Obama’s birthplace, the HuffPost/YouGov poll divided survey respondents into two groups and asked each group slightly different questions. Half were simply asked, “Do you think Barack Obama was born in the United States, or not?” The other half were first told about Trump’s statement that Obama was American-born. About the same percentage of Republicans in both groups said they believed Obama was born in America ― 32 percent of those who didn’t see Trump’s quote, and 34 percent who did, staked out that position. But while 46 percent of those who weren’t prompted with Trump’s quote said that Obama was not born in America, 33 percent of those who were told about his quote still felt that way. Respondents presented with Trump’s statement were more likely to hedge by saying that they weren’t sure whether Obama was born in the U.S. or not. Democrats and independents were also divided into two groups, but showed considerably less variation in their answers.The experiment lays bare two of the competing rationales that can motivate survey-takers. On the one hand, people tend to jump at the chance to endorse any negative statement about their candidate’s political opponents, a tendency that’s only been exacerbated by increasing political polarization in recent years. That’s always been part of the appeal of birtherism for many Republicans, who loathe Obama and are prone to agree with any statement that casts him in a bad light.On the other hand, people also tend to rely on partisan cues when answering surveys, making them more likely to take a particular stance on an issue if they think it puts them in line with their party’s leaders. HuffPost/YouGov polling last year found that, for instance, Republicans were far more likely to support universal health care when the idea was attributed to Trump, while Democrats were more enthusiastic about the concept when it was attributed to Obama.That leaves Republicans who’ve supported birtherism caught between either abandoning their belief or opposing their presidential nominee.“The best they can do, while still ‘saving face’ is to move to the ‘uncertain’ category,” Miller said. “A full reversal would be too identity threatening.”From here, she predicted, one of two things could happen. Republicans could continue to soften in their beliefs, eventually admitting that Obama was, in fact, born in the U.S. Or ― in perhaps a more likely scenario ― a “boomerang effect” might kick in as those who originally believed the birther theory are threatened but unwilling to change their minds, and instead succeed in re-convincing themselves of what they believed in the first place.Some survey respondents are already dealing with the cognitive dissonance by deciding that Trump didn’t really mean what he said. More than 40 percent of Republicans who don’t believe Obama was born in the U.S., for instance, say they think Trump himself secretly still believes the same thing.Overall, 61 percent of Americans say that Obama was born in the U.S., up from 50 percent in January. Independents were also more likely to acknowledge that Obama was born here ― in the most recent poll, 59 percent said so, up from 43 percent in January. (Perhaps not coincidentally, Obama’s approval rating has also improved significantly over the past nine months.)Twenty-nine percent of Americans don’t think Trump ever believed Obama was born outside the U.S., while 19 percent think he’s changed his mind on the issue and 27 percent believe that the Republican nominee is still a birther at heart.A 51 percent majority of Americans, including 80 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of independents ― but only 18 percent of Republicans ― say that Trump should apologize to Obama for having questioned his birthplace.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 17-Sept. 19 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here. More details on the polls’ methodology are available here.Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors.

8,POLITICS,Donald Trump Helped Spread Birtherism. Now He Can't Stop It.,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-birther-poll_us_57e12c21e4b04a1497b68044,"The Republican nominee now admits that President Obama was born in the U.S., but many Republicans still aren't so sure.",2016-09-20,Being told that Donald Trump had renounced his birther stance led fewer Republicans to say they were sure Obama was born outside the U.S.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e147bc1300002b0039d375.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump, one of the loudest proponents of the conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the U.S., publicly abandoned the idea last week. “President Obama was born in the United States, period,” he said. At the time he was giving that speech, however, most Republicans still espoused the belief that Obama wasn’t American-born.If anyone could help convince members of the GOP to stop questioning the president’s birthplace, you might expect it to be their presidential nominee ― especially since he’s spent years leading the crusade. But Trump may only be able to stuff the genie partly back into the bottle.In the wake of Trump’s statement, Republicans are now less likely than they were in January to say Obama was not born in America, but a substantial majority still refuse to say affirmatively that he was, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds.“People will go to great lengths to cling to their prior beliefs, even in the face of a good deal of contradictory evidence. Trump’s statement is just one more piece of contradictory evidence. It doesn’t seem to have been enough to move people from one side to the other,” said Joanne Miller, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota who’s researched the impact of ideology on conspiracy theories. “For Republicans who have clung to the belief that Obama was not born in the U.S. for a very long time, it is difficult to now admit they were wrong, even when their presidential nominee tells them they are,” she said.In January, 21 percent of Republicans surveyed by HuffPost/YouGov said Obama was born in the U.S., 53 percent said he was not and 26 percent said they weren’t sure. In this week’s poll, by contrast, 33 percent of Republicans say Obama was born in the U.S., 39 percent say he was not and 28 percent say they aren’t sure.Meanwhile, 47 percent of Republicans now say there are still reasons to doubt that Obama was born in the United States, while 18 percent say there were reasons to doubt that Obama was born here, but those questions have now been settled. Just about one-fifth say there has never been any reason to doubt that Obama was born in America.“It’s discouraging that Trump’s retraction does so little to reduce belief in the birther myth,” said Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College who’s studied the difficulties of correcting political misinformation. “But we shouldn’t be surprised ― even the release of Obama’s long-form birth certificate had a relatively small and short-lived effect.”In order to test the effects of Trump’s statement on public opinion about Obama’s birthplace, the HuffPost/YouGov poll divided survey respondents into two groups and asked each group slightly different questions. Half were simply asked, “Do you think Barack Obama was born in the United States, or not?” The other half were first told about Trump’s statement that Obama was American-born. About the same percentage of Republicans in both groups said they believed Obama was born in America ― 32 percent of those who didn’t see Trump’s quote, and 34 percent who did, staked out that position. But while 46 percent of those who weren’t prompted with Trump’s quote said that Obama was not born in America, 33 percent of those who were told about his quote still felt that way. Respondents presented with Trump’s statement were more likely to hedge by saying that they weren’t sure whether Obama was born in the U.S. or not. Democrats and independents were also divided into two groups, but showed considerably less variation in their answers.The experiment lays bare two of the competing rationales that can motivate survey-takers. On the one hand, people tend to jump at the chance to endorse any negative statement about their candidate’s political opponents, a tendency that’s only been exacerbated by increasing political polarization in recent years. That’s always been part of the appeal of birtherism for many Republicans, who loathe Obama and are prone to agree with any statement that casts him in a bad light.On the other hand, people also tend to rely on partisan cues when answering surveys, making them more likely to take a particular stance on an issue if they think it puts them in line with their party’s leaders. HuffPost/YouGov polling last year found that, for instance, Republicans were far more likely to support universal health care when the idea was attributed to Trump, while Democrats were more enthusiastic about the concept when it was attributed to Obama.That leaves Republicans who’ve supported birtherism caught between either abandoning their belief or opposing their presidential nominee.“The best they can do, while still ‘saving face’ is to move to the ‘uncertain’ category,” Miller said. “A full reversal would be too identity threatening.”From here, she predicted, one of two things could happen. Republicans could continue to soften in their beliefs, eventually admitting that Obama was, in fact, born in the U.S. Or ― in perhaps a more likely scenario ― a “boomerang effect” might kick in as those who originally believed the birther theory are threatened but unwilling to change their minds, and instead succeed in re-convincing themselves of what they believed in the first place.Some survey respondents are already dealing with the cognitive dissonance by deciding that Trump didn’t really mean what he said. More than 40 percent of Republicans who don’t believe Obama was born in the U.S., for instance, say they think Trump himself secretly still believes the same thing.Overall, 61 percent of Americans say that Obama was born in the U.S., up from 50 percent in January. Independents were also more likely to acknowledge that Obama was born here ― in the most recent poll, 59 percent said so, up from 43 percent in January. (Perhaps not coincidentally, Obama’s approval rating has also improved significantly over the past nine months.)Twenty-nine percent of Americans don’t think Trump ever believed Obama was born outside the U.S., while 19 percent think he’s changed his mind on the issue and 27 percent believe that the Republican nominee is still a birther at heart.A 51 percent majority of Americans, including 80 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of independents ― but only 18 percent of Republicans ― say that Trump should apologize to Obama for having questioned his birthplace.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 17-Sept. 19 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

Some of them also come from neighboring countries such as Guinea, Mali and Guinea Bissau. However, some of the religious instructors, also known as marabouts, exploit the children, forcing them into begging, and in some cases, beating them to death.Parallel to the talibé problem is the number of incarcerated minors in the country. Almost 5% of the country’s prison population is under the age of 18, according to one estimate cited by the Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA). Many of these children also face dire conditions in prison, including lack of basic food and sanitation needs, proper education, or getting prepared for social reintegration.In response to this problem, OSIWA started a fencing practice for incarcerated minors and street kids in 2012. The project was started in the prison in Thiès city, an important economic and transport hub and the gateway to the capital, Dakar.The fencing project was launched as a way to encourage social harmony and dialogue between juveniles and law practitioners. Photographer Sam Phelps captured the boys and girls as they were being instructed on fencing techniques.“Prisoners often face particular difficulties from a societal perspective, both during and post-incarceration,” says Hawa Ba, who manages the fencing project. “This can be especially damaging for youth, who have their whole lives in front of them and may not ever recover from the heavy social stigma that falls on them once having served time behind bars.”The project uses the sport as a form of restorative justice, giving the minors an opportunity to help them deal with their troubled pasts. The street children are given the chance to attend once a week, while the incarcerated youth attend the training twice a week.The sessions also give the detainees the chance to take part in activities outside the prison’s compound. Fallou, an inmate at the prison, said that it was previously hard “to stay every day in the same place, and to watch always the same people.” With the fencing, he said, “If we go out to the center or the fencing studio, we are so happy to see the street.”The training is also done as a way to reduce violence in the prison environment, and to offer a space for socialization, discipline, and self-control. The intention, prison guard Fatoumata Sy says, is to show them that there are rules and laws in all aspects of life and that they have to adhere to them while living amongst their communities.Young detainees also receive the opportunity to speak with educators about their fears and prospects for the future. Many have also spoken about their tales of arrest, the procedural delays, and their sentencing.For prison officers, the fencing project creates the chance to have a relationship based on dialogue and trust. The Senegalese Federation of Fencing, in collaboration with the French Federation, have further designed a training aimed at offering guards and educators the possibility of becoming certified fencing instructors.More importantly, the sessions offer young detainees the opportunity to speak with these educators about their fears, regrets, and dreams for the future. Many have also spoken about their tales of arrest, the procedural delays in their cases, besides their sentencing. OSIWA says this communication relieves the stress that inevitably accumulates between the children, the police and the prosecutors throughout the course of the hearings.“The prison workers have been able to gain the trust of the minors, creating a space that allows them to open up and tell them their personal stories,” Ba, the program manager, said. “It also teaches the youth about honesty and can play a huge role in calming kids and teaching them how to accept defeat.”Instead of looking at the children’s time in prison as punitive, fencing brings a rehabilitative approach to their incarceration, says OSIWA. It’s one step forward in ensuring that they reintegrate better and are able to forge healthier social ties once released.This article originally appeared on Quartz Africa.

One school of thought suggested that Syrian Kurdish forces, which are key U.S. partners in the fight against Islamic State militants but terrorists in the eyes of U.S. ally Turkey, raised the flags to fake a U.S. presence in their territory. Another said that U.S. special forces raised them while visiting Kurd-controlled territory to avoid becoming collateral damage in one of the occasional Turkish attacks on the Syrian Kurds.The new Pentagon statement puts one of those theories to bed. Asked specifically about the American flags spotted flying over the town of Tal Abyad, U.S. Army Maj. Josh Jacques, a U.S. Central Command spokesman, said, “I can confirm last week that U.S. forces operating in northern Syria used flags to denote their positions.”And the U.S. is not permitting any other groups ― including the Syrian Kurds ― to fly the U.S. flag, according to Col. John Dorian, a spokesman for the campaign against the self-described Islamic State.The need for damage control over the seemingly minor incident is a reminder that as the Obama administration tries to secure a nationwide ceasefire so that the various actors involved in Syria can focus on ISIS, it may ignore concerns that actually drive those players ― and could lead to continued conflict for years to come. While Turkey and the Syrian Kurds are both battling ISIS, the Turks say the Kurdish forces are just as dangerous as the radical Islamists because of their links to a violent Kurdish insurgency inside Turkey. Turkey encourages Syrian Arab groups to take a similar line, despite the fact that many Arabs and Kurds share the larger goal of unseating Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. On Monday, Turkey’s ambassador to the United Nations, Mehmet Ferden Carikci, called on the organization to investigate the Syrian Kurdish fighters for alleged human rights abuses.Media close to the Turkish government made it immediately clear that Ankara was unhappy about the sighting of the flags in Kurd-controlled territory. Turkish sources presented the event as an example of Kurdish overreach ― a way to exaggerate the Syrian Kurds’ ties with Washington, and a deliberate deception.That portrayal has turned out to be inaccurate. Instead, sources close to the Kurdish militia, the YPG, appear vindicated. Before the Pentagon shared its statement, one activist with close ties to the Syrian Kurdish leadership told HuffPost that U.S. forces were present in the town and raised the flags to prevent potential bombardment by Turkey, echoing a narrative popular in pro-YPG social media. Kurdistan24, an outlet based in Iraqi Kurdistan, used a Kurdish name to refer to the town where the flag was spotted and published multiple stories suggesting that U.S. forces there were worried about Turkey’s behavior. In one story, a YPG official was quoted saying the Americans wanted to monitor their treaty ally ― a striking claim given that the Americans and Turks are partners in NATO and have a history of military cooperation. In another, the outlet quoted unnamed U.S. officials who had suggested to CNN and Hurriyet, a Turkish paper, that American forces suffered firing from Turkey. Both Pentagon spokesmen that HuffPost contacted declined to comment on that claim this week.The U.S. has struggled to satisfy both its partners. While it agrees with Ankara on calling the Kurdish movement in Turkey, the PKK, a terrorist organization, it describes the chief Kurdish militia in Syria, the YPG, as distinct from that group. “It’s a complicated and crowded battlefield,” Dorian said. “We understand that in order to be successful we’ll have to manage all these operations. Sometimes partners have interests that aren’t aligned.”The flag drama carries echoes of an earlier controversy connected to the U.S.’s blossoming relationship with the Syrian Kurds. In May, photographs published in major media outlets showed American special forces in northern Syria wearing uniforms bearing the YPG insignia. Turkey lambasted the U.S. government, calling it “two-faced.”The flag incident is even more complex because it suggests an American acceptance of the status quo in the town where the sighting took place. Kurdish forces have controlled Tal Abyad since June 2015. Though they liberated the town from ISIS, their rule there has been controversial because of its effect on thousands of local Arabs. Syrians who fled the region because of fighting between ISIS and the YPG told HuffPost they were wary of ethnic discrimination from the Kurds, and a VICE News investigation months later found that many chose to remain in Turkish refugee camps. Amnesty International has accused the YPG of forcibly displacing Arabs in regions they have captured during the Syrian civil war and said that amounts to war crimes.Alienating Arabs, the majority ethnic community in Syria, would make getting anything done there more difficult for the U.S. Still, Syrian Arab forces skeptical of the YPG have long complained that Washington is ignoring their grievances. The Arab groups, many of whom have ties to Turkey, say they do not trust the Kurdish militia because of its behavior toward Arabs and because it has had a cold truce with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s regime in some areas.The YPG say they have clearly indicated they want Assad’s rule to end, in large part because of his continuing crimes against Syrian Kurds, and that they are willing to work with Arabs as long as they disavow fundamentalist thinking rooted in Islam. They note that thousands of Syrian Arabs live in the Kurd-run region of Syria, Rojava, and are involved its politics and its defense. The U.S. tried to soothe these tensions last year by encouraging the YPG to join with some Arab forces in a new organization called the Syrian Democratic Forces, but many dismiss the alliance as a front for Kurdish ambitions. Last week, video emerged that appeared to show Syrian rebels in the northern Syrian town of Al-Rai threatening to “slaughter” U.S. special forces as they pulled out of the town in heavily armed vehicles. The rebels had slammed the Americans for supporting the YPG, according to Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. Despite these tangles, the U.S. is only getting more involved in the region and trying to maintain ties on all sides. American officials announced last week that some 40 U.S. special forces would be tasked to work alongside Turkish forces on the ground in Syria, to aid an operation Turkey has launched to create a zone that is controlled by neither ISIS nor the YPG. Announced less than a month after the latest direct clash between Turkey and the Syrian Kurds, this plan means that there will soon be U.S. forces on both sides of this cold peace. (Hundreds of U.S. special forces are already embedded in Kurd-controlled territory.)The U.S. had negotiated a quasi-truce between the two forces that held for months, with the understanding being that the Turks would leave the Kurds alone as long as they remained on the eastern side of the Euphrates river and did not expand their presence into largely Arab areas west of the river. But the Kurds argue that they need to have access to that western side to be able to reach a small Kurdish enclave in northwestern Syria that is otherwise surrounded by unfriendly forces. They have made incursions into the region since January of this year, angering Turkey because it says it cannot tolerate a Kurdish corridor all along the Turkey-Syria border that could eventually be used for attacks on the Turkish state. These worries are a prime reason for the current U.S.-backed Turkish operation in Syria.Dorian, the anti-ISIS campaign spokesman, acknowledged that there’s a quandary the U.S. has yet to resolve. But he couldn’t offer a solution just yet.“When we have to be flexible because something doesn’t go as planned, we’ll have to figure out how to get everyone refocused on the unifying principle: nobody wants Daesh in Syria and Iraq except Daesh.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

(Hundreds of U.S. special forces are already embedded in Kurd-controlled territory.)The U.S. had negotiated a quasi-truce between the two forces that held for months, with the understanding being that the Turks would leave the Kurds alone as long as they remained on the eastern side of the Euphrates river and did not expand their presence into largely Arab areas west of the river. But the Kurds argue that they need to have access to that western side to be able to reach a small Kurdish enclave in northwestern Syria that is otherwise surrounded by unfriendly forces. They have made incursions into the region since January of this year, angering Turkey because it says it cannot tolerate a Kurdish corridor all along the Turkey-Syria border that could eventually be used for attacks on the Turkish state. These worries are a prime reason for the current U.S.-backed Turkish operation in Syria.Dorian, the anti-ISIS campaign spokesman, acknowledged that there’s a quandary the U.S. has yet to resolve. But he couldn’t offer a solution just yet.“When we have to be flexible because something doesn’t go as planned, we’ll have to figure out how to get everyone refocused on the unifying principle: nobody wants Daesh in Syria and Iraq except Daesh.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

I said they should pick him up and show him out of the country,” Khama said in an interview. “We don’t want hate speech in this country. Let him do it in his own country.”The president said Anderson had been put on a visa watch-list two days ago after being barred from South Africa but appeared to have slipped into Botswana before all border posts were fully alerted.Banning him from South Africa on Sept. 13, that country’s home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba also equated Anderson’s views with hate speech.Anderson denied he was being deported.“I am not being arrested. I am leaving Botswana voluntarily,” he told witnesses at the radio station, adding in the local Setswana language that he loved Botswana very much.During Tuesday’s radio interview, in which he also called for pedophiles and adulterers to be killed and said the Bible barred women from preaching in church, Anderson said he had arrived in Botswana last Thursday from Ethiopia.Onkokame Mosweu, a commentator on gay and lesbian affairs, welcomed the government’s move to remove Anderson, adding: “He should have never been allowed to come to Botswana in the first place.”(Reporting by Ed Cropley; Writing by Tiisetso Motsoeneng; Editing by Catherine Evans)"

Oded Balilty, who nabbed a Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography in 2007, is bringing his colorful series, “Miss Trans Israel,” to Photoville, which opens Sept. 21 at the Brooklyn Bridge Plaza. Balilty’s photographs feature each of the 12 Miss Trans Israel contestants, who participated in a swimsuit competition, two formalwear competitions and a question-and-answer segment as part of the pageant, held May 27 in Tel Aviv. The 37-year-old photographer, who has been working for the Associated Press since 2003, told The Huffington Post that he received “complete access” to all 12 women, including the winner, Ta’alin Abu Hanna. “I feel it is our job as photographers to open the windows to the world, and also the Israeli community,” Balilty said. Noting that he rarely encountered trans people on the street, he added, “There are many parts of Israel that are very religious, and are against this way of life and the only way for them to experience the community is through my pictures.”Although Israel continues to be fraught with religious and political turmoil, Balilty said each of the contestants were able to “look beyond ethnic barriers” as they aimed for pageant glory. “Some of them are Jews, some Muslim and others Christian. They all know each other because they belong to this small community,” he said. “They don’t care about the ethnic groups they come from. They don’t care about the conflict around them ― they just live their life.” The photographer hopes that, in some small way, his Photoville exhibit inspires visitors to “look beyond the pictures” and to understand that the transgender women in the series just “want to live their lives and do normal things.”“This was an opportunity to go inside this hidden community and more importantly, to show others,” he said, adding. “I never call my job work because, for me, it is very enjoyable.” Balilty’s photo series is not the only exhibit with a queer focus at Photoville, which is now in its fifth year. Photographer Wayne Lawrence’s #OrlandoStrong series for National Geographic, which captured the LGBT and Latino communities in Orlando, Florida, following the June 12 shooting at the city’s Pulse nightclub, will also be featured at the festival.Head here for more information on Photoville, which runs from Sept. 21-25.

17,THE WORLDPOST,Obama Gathers World Leaders To Pledge Billions In Refugee Aid,Willa Frej,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-refugees-aid_us_57dc2edbe4b04a1497b457ba,That includes a serious financial commitment from the U.S.,2016-09-20,"U.S. President Barack Obama talks with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 20, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e1a72c180000c706315f0b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UNITED NATIONS ― President Barack Obama had more than words for desperate refugees during a Leaders’ Summit that he hosted at the United Nations on Tuesday.He announced that more than 50 nations and organizations have agreed to provide a combined $4.5 billion in financial assistance to groups helping refugees find work and education. That includes $1 billion from the U.S.“I called this summit because this crisis is one of the more urgent tests of our time, a test of collective action,” said Obama, speaking just hours after he delivered his final General Assembly speech as president.The Leaders’ Summit followed the first U.N.-wide summit on refugees and migrants, held Monday.Around the world, some 65 million people are displaced from their homes due to violence and persecution, more than at any time since World War II. Over 20 million of them are refugees, the vast majority of whom are now living in just 10 countries.“It’s a test of our international system where all nations ought to share in the responsibility,” Obama said. “It’s a crisis of our shared security, not because refugees are our threat but because refugees are often fleeing war and terrorism. They are victims.”Obama emphasized the need not to demonize refugees, implicitly hitting back against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s proposals to ban Muslim immigrants (including refugees) from entering the U.S. and to build a wall along the border with Mexico.“If we were to turn refugees back, we would be reinforcing terrorist propaganda that nations like my own are somehow opposed to Islam. It’s an ugly lie that must be rejected,” the president said. “It’s a test of our common humanity, whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls.”The co-hosts for the Leaders’ Summit included the U.N. General Secretary, Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico and Sweden. Several of those countries have been struggling under the burden of hosting refugees. Germany, for instance, took in 1 million in 2015 alone.Jordan’s King Abdullah II, whose country has seen 2.5 million Syrian refugees pass through since 2011 and is currently hosting 1.5 million, stressed the need to work on a macro level in order to make progress on a micro level.“We need to work as a team,” Abdullah said at the summit. “Jordan’s burden is skyrocketing.”Jordan has already handed out 28,000 work permits to Syrians this year and expects to offer more.Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven pledged to donate more funds and to increase refugee resettlement in his country. Sweden has already offered $625 million in humanitarian aid this year, he said.“I promise you, we will all be better for it,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said of welcoming refugees.In his remarks, Obama also referred to the White House call for the private sector to step up. In total, 51 companies ― including Accenture, Airbnb, Citigroup, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Google and IKEA ― have pledged to invest, donate or raise $650 million to go toward refugee education and employment.“I am hopeful, especially after Obama’s speech,” Hussam Al Roustom, a Syrian refugee resettled in New Jersey last year who attended the summit, told The Huffington Post. “The speech was good, realistic and gave me hope about ending the Syrian problem. Hopefully words will be turned into action.”Although the United States has long considered itself a humanitarian leader, it has been slow to welcome the latest flood of displaced people. In September 2015, Obama pledged to increase the total number of refugees allowed to resettle in the U.S. to 85,000 ― up from 70,000 in the last three fiscal years ― and to reserve 10,000 of these spots for Syrians. Secretary of State John Kerry announced last week that the administration plans to set a goal of welcoming up to 110,000 refugees in fiscal 2017.These increases are welcomed by refugee advocates, but the numbers represent only a drop in the bucket compared to what many other smaller countries are grappling with.And there are some who feel that the back-to-back U.N. summits are just plain late.Amnesty International “called for a meeting of world leaders two years ago,” Sahil Shetty, secretary general of the human rights group, told The Huffington Post. “There are some credibility issues. We’ve got to be a bit more serious than this.” "

He graduated from high school with a Regents diploma in 2013 — a feat accomplished by only 18 percent of students with disabilities in New York City that year, compared to 70 percent of students without disabilities.But when Thompson met with a counselor from the state agency that is supposed to help people with disabilities get training or a degree that will lead to a job, the counselor refused to sign off on her son’s plan to go to community college. That meant he wouldn’t get wheelchair-accessible transportation, tuition help or voice-activated software from the agency — all of which he qualified for under federal law.“I know too many young men with all kinds of disabilities just sitting around at home doing nothing,” said Thompson, who raised her son on her own. “They’re not even given a chance. I didn’t want that for him.”See the full list of all states/territories.Thompson’s frustration is shared by people with disabilities and their parents nationwide.More than 800,000 people with disabilities found eligible for services received no assistance between 2010 and 2014, according to federal data. More than a dozen states failed to provide services to over 40 percent of those they themselves deemed eligible. And many more states have left people in limbo for months, despite laws that expressly forbid that.“It’s happening across the country, and it’s inexcusable,” said Ron Hager, senior staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network.This despite $3 billion in tax dollars spent last year by the agencies responsible, known as Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) offices. Created by the Rehabilitation Act three decades ago, VRs are supposed to help people with disabilities become independent. Some people need a hearing aid, for example; others require voice-activated note-taking software or screen-readers for college.Studies have shown that people with disabilities benefit even more than the general public from having a college degree, in terms of employment and getting out of poverty — people with disabilities with a bachelor’s degree are almost 50 percent more likely to have a job than those with just a high school diploma. Yet, while 76 percent of people with disabilities have high school diplomas, only 12 percent have college degrees.Some VR agencies work well; counselors respond promptly to applications and help clients further their education and secure employment. But in many states the VR offices are understaffed, poorly run or hamstrung by political battles. Staff turnover is high, successful job placement is fleeting and money is spent without significant results.Delays in service provision were so widespread that, in 2014, Congress mandated that a person with a disability must receive a plan for employment within 90 days of being deemed eligible for assistance. In 20 states, more than one-third of cases stretched past the 90-day limit in 2015. Close to 14,000 cases stretched past a year. Once an applicant gets an approved plan, the next step is to get the services — which often takes even longer. The delays lead to missed job and educational opportunities and longer government dependence, all at a cost to taxpayers.Part of the problem, advocates say, is high caseloads. The situation is most severe in urban centers. The recommended caseload per VR counselor is between 80 and 100 clients. But in the Bronx, for example, the average caseload rose to 270 in 2016, up from 222 in 2015. The current New York statewide average is 185, according to state officials.“VR is an underfunded ghetto for people with disabilities,” said Susan Dooha, executive director of the Center for Independence of the Disabled, New York. “I don’t understand why, given the large cost of maintaining people with disabilities in poverty, in institutions, the state doesn’t invest more in VR services, but I cannot remember the last time that an increase was proposed that would allow the hiring of more counselors.”Josh Greene, who has several learning disabilities, felt the impact of those high caseloads firsthand. He lives in the Bronx, and in the fall of 2014, he was brimming with hope. He had his first appointment with a counselor at the Bronx VR agency. He was found eligible for services and was accepted that spring to Guttman Community College in Manhattan.See the full list of all states/territories.Related: Students on the autism spectrum are often as smart as their peers, so why do so few go to college?It went downhill from there. Greene has dyslexia and needed software to help him take notes without scrambling the letters. He also needed an audio recorder so he could listen to lectures again at home, and some extra help with writing.He spent 10 months emailing, leaving messages and resubmitting forms, but by the following September when he started classes, he still had received none of the academic assistance for which he had been approved.A spokeswoman for the Education Department, which oversees New York’s VR office, said the agency could not comment on individual cases, but acknowledged that turnover among Bronx counselors was about 30 percent last year.New York isn’t the only place struggling with high caseloads.The backup in Milwaukee is so severe that it is not uncommon for people to wait six weeks to get a first appointment to begin the eligibility process, said Cathy Steffke, an advocacy specialist at Disability Rights Wisconsin.“I feel very badly for a VR counselor stuck with a [high] caseload,” said Steffke. “Can you imagine going to school to help people and then find out you can’t help anyone?”By law, VR caseworkers must have a master’s degree, but in most states their pay is lower than that of their counterparts at the veterans administration or the department of education. The private sector pays even more, so many people leave after just a few years, passing on their cases to less-experienced counselors who already have their own loads.“I think more people would stay, even with lower pay, if they felt like they had the possibility of helping people,” said a recently retired caseworker who spent close to three decades at a Wisconsin VR office and asked to remain anonymous because he still works with the agency. Of the 22 co-workers when he left his office less than two years ago, only two are left, he said.Statewide, 30 percent of casework-related staff left between 2012 and 2015, according to a state audit.“It’s a caseload issue that’s basically political,” said Linda Vegoe, the director of Wisconsin’s client assistance program (CAP). State CAPs are also federally funded and were established to help people having difficulty getting services from the VR agencies. “They don’t want to increase the number of positions.”In 2013, Governor Scott Walker became the first Wisconsin governor in more than a decade to put up the full amount of state matching funds for Wisconsin’s VR. Walker supported moving people from government assistance to work. Nonetheless, the number of counselors in Wisconsin has stayed flat since 2012, according to a state audit, although there has been an increase in the number of counselors in training.State officials say that new initiatives, including one that enlists the counselors in training to handle some eligibility-related tasks, allowed them to successfully close a record-number of cases last fiscal year. The Wisconsin waiting list now averages only 150 people at a time (down from 4,900 in 2013), according to John Dipko, communications director at Wisconsin’s Department of Workforce Development, and the agency has streamlined its intake process.But advocates say that some of the changes have only pushed people off the waitlists and into the system, where the waiting time isn’t tracked but has increased. “Waiting for service inside the system takes longer than waiting on the outside,” said Vegoe, who has worked at CAP for 25 years. “The external waitlist basically became an internal one.”High caseloads translate into delays and lack of services for people like Amy Kerzner.Multiple sclerosis struck Kerzner relatively late in life, making it impossible for her to keep working as a nurse.“I knew one thing: I would never, ever live the rest of my life on disability,” said Kerzner, 49. “I would find a way to be a productive citizen.”She met with a VR counselor in Calumet County, where she lived, who approved her plan to attend Alverno College in Milwaukee so she could get training to become a psychologist. She moved to Milwaukee in October 2010 and called her new caseworker there — repeatedly. Even though the paperwork had been transferred and she was due to start classes in January, she couldn’t get an appointment until March. She began the program anyway.“He kept making appointments and canceling, not returning emails,” she recalled.When she finally met with the caseworker, he told her that he was denying her request to attend Alverno. She called an advocacy hotline, appealed the decision and won, although it took several more months before she was reimbursed.Kerzner graduated four years later with a GPA of 4.0 and is now working on a master’s degree. “Movement is painful, you ache and throb all the time, you just get used to that level of pain,” she said. “But I will take that pain all day long, as long as I can be independent.”Wisconsin VR officials dispute Kerzner’s account of her treatment. They say they have requested but have not received permission from her that would allow them to make the details of her case public.Steffke says Kerzner’s experience is not an anomaly.“These people just want to work, they just want a job, they’re not asking for cars and boats and property,” she said.Yet high caseloads are not the only reason that some people leave the system without receiving services, according to a U.S. Department of Education spokesman. In light of a shortfall of funding, some states have created waiting lists to prioritize the most disabled, so clients on the waitlist who have been found eligible for VR services but whose needs are less “significant” may be redirected to other agencies, such as a Veterans program if the disability occurred due to military service.“No one wants to say it, but I’ll say it: funding, funding, funding,” Steffke argued. “There’s lots of people who can get off of social security, or at least just partial social security, but the federal government has never dealt with this well.”Federal funding for VR has dropped by 6 percent since 2009, accounting for inflation. And 21 states did not put up enough state money in 2015 to get the full amount of federal matching funds.The failure to fund is shortsighted, say advocates. Not only does a successful job placement reduce government assistance rolls, they argue, but when services for clients are denied or delayed, the agency is still spending time and money on those clients.In 2012, VR agencies around the country spent close to $365 millionon people who left the system before they completed services, and that’s up from $326 million in 2009, according to a study from the University of Montana.Related: More people with autism as getting training for technology jobsIn Louisiana, 44 percent of people found eligible for services never received any in 2014. This year, statewide budget cuts forced an even worse crisis — the office ran out of money and stopped taking new clients on February 29. In addition, hundreds of people who had been found eligible but hadn’t gotten approval for their employment plan also had their cases put on hold. The office reopened its caseloads on June 1, and counselors are now wading through the backlog.“It’s had a big impact on everyone,” said David Gallegos, program director at the Advocacy Center of Louisiana who has been working there for 17 years.Caseloads in New Orleans are now between 150 and 200 clients, said Gallegos, who is also the state’s CAP director.Similarly, in January 2015, Tennessee’s agency also temporarily stopped taking new clients. Although it has opened its doors again, a state report found that 100 of the 243 positions that provide direct services to clients were vacant last year. The result has been caseloads of up to 200 in Knoxville and elsewhere, and many dropped clients, advocates say.Tennessee is actively hiring, said Devin Stone, spokesperson for the state Department of Human Services. Stone added that over the past four years, the agency has increased the number of clients getting jobs each year; advocates say things have gotten worse.People with disabilities and their advocates in many states also say that even when applicants do get plans and see counselors, the results are disappointing due to the counselors’ skepticism about their abilities.Loria Richardson, a project specialist from the nonprofit advocacy group The Arc Tennessee, said she has seen this happen on numerous occasions. She is currently working with a young man who was accepted at the Tennessee College of Applied Technology. He visited the school, met with instructors and decided to enroll in its HVAC program. School officials said it was not a problem that he had graduated high school with a special education diploma. They assured him that others without regular diplomas had been successful there, and that they would work with him to provide accommodations, such as digital access to class readings so he could use headphones to hear the required texts. Yet when he applied to VR, although he was immediately found eligible for services, his case manager said she did not think he would be able to complete the HVAC class. She was not moved by the school officials’ opinion, the young man’s successful four-year employment history, or the fact that he had a driver’s license and could already perform basic car mechanic tasks. Richardson is now trying to help the young man find other forms of financial aid so he can enroll at TCAT. An HVAC assistant — the job he aspires to — starts at about $15 an hour, which would be a big step up from his current job where he makes minimum wage.Similarly, in Ohio, a VR counselor determined that a woman with spina bifida was incapable of handling college and refused her request for assistance. The woman managed to cobble together financial aid from other public agencies and got her associate’s degree. Yet when she returned to the VR office to seek help for a bachelor’s degree, she was again deemed ineligible for college. It took a lengthy appeal, but she eventually won and got the assistance she needed. She graduated two years later and landed a job as a social worker.Many people with disabilities say that such bias is not only offensive but also threatens the independence they desperately seek.“There is still a profound ignorance about what it means to have a disability,” said Hager of the National Disability Rights Network. “The vast majority of learning disabilities do not affect a person’s ability to handle a college curriculum.”The poverty rate for people with disabilities is 30 percent, twice that of people without a disability. But a college degree makes a difference.“Underemployment is a big problem for people with disabilities in VR,” said Gallegos, the CAP director in Louisiana. “College can help with that, but it seems like we’re having to advocate much harder for everything than we ever have before.”This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

21,POLITICS,Trump: 'I Never Said' Muslims Should Be Profiled,Christina Wilkie,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-muslims-profiling_us_57e08416e4b08cb14097a5e4,This is laughably false.,2016-09-20,Donald Trump (L) looks on as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi speaks during a meeting at the Plaza Hotel on Monday in New York.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e0ab69130000930639d1db.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Monday said he has never suggested that law enforcement or immigration officials screen Muslims more than other groups.“I never said the term ‘Muslim,’” Trump told Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, who asked whether Trump’s profiling plan could cause all Muslims to be viewed with suspicion. “I’m saying we’re going to profile people that maybe look suspicious, I didn’t say [if] they were Muslims or not.”Trump has built his presidential campaign on the promise to keep other people out of the U.S. ― be they immigrants from Central and South America, refugees from the war-torn Middle East, or citizens of countries Trump says are “compromised” by “terrorism,” although he won’t actually name those countries. His remarks on Fox News followed bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend that left scores of people injured. The suspect, Ahmad Rahami, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who came from Afghanistan as a child with his asylum-seeking father. Trump promised to expand the use of “profiling,” an illegal tactic in which authorities target certain individuals for suspicion based on their race, ethnicity, religion or nationality. Though he tried to distance himself from illegal profiling, his presidential campaign website still proudly displayed Trump’s longstanding promise to institute “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”Pressed by O’Reilly on what it means to “look suspicious,” Trump exclaimed, “I don’t know! These are [profiling] experts, that’s what they do.They profile. You go to Israel, and [U.S. law enforcement] should study [Israel], because Israel’s done a phenomenal job at this. They’re not happy about [having to profile], but they do it. And people aren’t complaining about it. But we have to do it, we have to profile.” O’Reilly noted that Trump’s plan wasn’t aimed at profiling “guys with leather jackets and blue eyes,” which both men understood to mean that Trump would single out Muslims and people from the Middle East, and not blue-eyed caucasians.“I’m not using the term Muslim!” Trump insisted.“I’m saying we’re going to have to start profiling. And I don’t know if it’s that bad, but certainly it’s not a wonderful thing. But we have a country to keep safe. And you know, and I know, it’s going to get worse.” For anyone who’s paid even remote attention to Trump’s campaign over the past year, Trump didn’t have to use the word Muslim. Since announcing his candidacy, Trump has used the terms “Muslim” and “Islam” thousands of times, almost always in order to warn his supporters of the threat posed by the world’s 1.6 billion followers of the religion.On Monday evening, Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a move intended to make the reality TV star look presidential. Trump’s campaign said the nominee emphasized to Sisi “his high regard for peace-loving Muslims.” Sisi is a career military officer who seized power in a coup, and whose government detains political dissidents indefinitely without trial.The profiling system Trump has pointed to as a model for the United States is Israel’s system of profiling and screening Arabs, non-Jews, and occupied Palestinians. The United Nations has labeled Israel’s institutional oppression and segregation of the largely Muslim Palestinians an “apartheid.” “Israel does it, and Israel does it very successfully,” Trump told O’Reilly. “And when they see someone they’d like to talk to, or have a look at, or open up their satchel and see what’s inside, they do it. And they don’t like to do it, but they do it. And we have to do it.”Trump complained that constitutional protections against police profiling in the United States mean that “you have a woman who’s 87 years old from Sweden, and we have to look at her the same way we’re going to look at somebody else [who looks suspicious]. It’s ridiculous.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

REUTERS/Christopher Aluka Berry",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e1253a1800002f00315c0b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump has a slight edge in Georgia. Hillary Clinton has a small advantage on national security. And Americans are very reluctant to say being prejudiced makes someone a bad person. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, September 20, 2016.TRUMP LEADS NARROWLY IN GEORGIA - Monmouth University: “Donald Trump has a 3 point lead in the contest for Georgia’s electoral votes while Johnny Isakson is comfortably ahead in his bid for re-election to the U.S. Senate, according to the Monmouth University Poll. Among Georgia voters likely to participate in November’s presidential election, 45% support Trump and 42% back Hillary Clinton.  Another 8% intend to vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson and 5% are undecided….Clinton has a commanding 88% to 4% lead over Trump among black voters statewide. Trump holds a strong 66% to 20% advantage, though, among white voters across Georgia….’There has been some talk of Georgia becoming part of a demographic realignment in presidential politics. However, Clinton is not quite making the needed inroads among young white voters to take the lead here,’ said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.” [Monmouth] Aggregate shows an even tighter race - HuffPost Pollster’s model gives Donald Trump just a 1.8 point advantage over Hillary Clinton, similar to what the average has been since this summer. Individual surveys since July, though, have shown far more variation, with everything from a 4-point Trump lead to a 4-point Clinton lead. HILLARY CLINTON’S WORST WEEK STILL SHOWS SOME GOOD NEWS - Sean Trende: “To say Hillary Clinton had a rough week last week would be an understatement. After declaring that half of Donald Trump’s supporters – that is, some 30 million Americans – fall into a “basket of deplorables,” she was seen collapsing at a 9/11 memorial ceremony…. It’s unsurprising, then, that her poll standing took a hit. What was a three-point lead in the RealClearPolitics average as of September 11 was a 0.9 point lead one week later. Her solid 340-198 electoral vote lead had subsided to a narrow 293-245 advantage... On its face, this looked like atrocious news. I’m not sure that assessment is correct…. [T]his was a particularly awful series of news cycles for her, while Trump had managed to go over a month without reprising some of his more polarizing statements... We would expect a big swing in the polls, and there was one. But it did not put Trump over the top…. In a strange way, that’s good news for Clinton…. The bad news cycle can also cause Republicans to break through likely-voter screens while Democrats become less likely to answer the polls; this ‘differential response’ issue explains a lot of the ebb and flow of campaigns. But we have to wonder: If this didn’t catapult Trump to an electoral lead, what could?” [RealClearPolitics] One poll shows Clinton ticking back up - Hannah Hartig, John Lapinski and Stephanie Psyllos: “Back on the campaign trail after being diagnosed with pneumonia and a subsequent break from campaigning, Hillary Clinton plugged her leaking lead against Donald Trump, according to this week’s NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking Poll. She now enjoys 50 percent support among likely voters and Trump has 45 percent support…. In addition to expanding her lead this week, Clinton outperforms Trump on the question that asks voters who they think will win. Currently, 56 percent of likely voters think Clinton will win. Just 39 percent think Trump will win.” [NBC]VOTERS TRUST CLINTON MORE ON TERRORISM - Nick Bayer: “In the wake of three potential terrorism-related incidents in New Jersey, New York City and Minnesota over the weekend, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has trotted out his common refrain of getting tough on terrorism…. But most Americans aren’t buying this type of rhetoric. Polls show Clinton maintaining a slight edge over Trump when it comes to which major-party nominee voters trust on terrorism. Clinton leads Trump 49-45 percent among registered voters when it comes to who would do a “better job of handling terrorism and national security,” according to a new CBS/New York Times poll. Likewise, a new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows Clinton leading Trump by 9 points among Americans asked who they trust more to handle terrorism. That’s the same margin by which Clinton led in a late-August Fox News poll. Most August polls showed Clinton leading on the topic.” [HuffPost]But Trump supporters are more concerned about the issue - Steven Shepard: “[E]ven though more voters, on average, trust Clinton over Trump on terrorism, rising unease about more attacks could benefit the Republican. Prior to this weekend, Trump voters were far more concerned about terrorism: In last week’s Quinnipiac University poll, a combined 79 percent of likely voters said it was ‘very’ or ‘somewhat’ likely that there would be a terrorist attack in the U.S. ‘in the near future … causing large numbers of lives to be lost.’ (No one was killed in this weekend’s incidents.) Virtually all of Trump’s supporters, 96 percent, said it was at least ‘somewhat likely’ there would be an attack in the near future, including a 57-percent majority who said it’s ‘very likely.’ But just 64 percent of Clinton backers said it was likely, and only 19 percent said it was ‘very likely.’” [Politico]MOST AMERICANS DON’T EQUATE PREJUDICE WITH BEING A BAD PERSON - HuffPollster: “When Hillary Clinton dismissed half of Donald Trump’s supporters as belonging to a ‘basket of deplorables,’ much of the debate that followed focused on attempts to quantify what percentage of Trump’s supporters actually held bigoted views…. So, in a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, we asked Americans how they’d describe people who hold negative views of Muslims, black people, women, gay people and immigrants.... Most of those polled fell into the middle category, saying that disliking an entire race, religion, gender or other class of people was prejudiced, but didn’t necessarily make someone a bad person…. Democrats and Republicans expressed largely similar views about people who disliked blacks. But most Democrats say that negative views about Muslims made some prejudiced, but not necessarily a bad person, while the majority of Republicans don’t even consider such views to be prejudiced.” [HuffPost] BLOOMBERG LAUNCHES A ‘POLL DECODER’ - Ken Goldstein on the project, which visualizes the turnout assumptions made by pollsters: “As Election Day nears, we’re being deluged with public opinion polls attempting to measure whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is on track to win the White House. It’s hard to know what to make of the numbers because the polls often tell very different stories....You can glean a lot from looking beneath the top-line horse race numbers at the internals of a poll—not just what pollsters learned when they interviewed voters, but also the assumptions and models they used, which are built on what occurred in the past. Can Hillary Clinton reassemble the Obama coalition, or will an enthusiasm gap keep some home? Will Trump bring new voters—the sort that haven’t voted in the past—into the process? And how loyal will these different segments of potential voters be? White voters will almost certainly cast the majority of their votes for Trump, but by what margin? And what proportion of the vote will they make up? No one knows for sure.” [Bloomberg] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e1596f130000930639d400.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Bank of America said Monday it will power 100 percent of its operations with clean energy in the next four years, making it the latest big bank promising to aggressively shrink its carbon footprint.But until the country’s second-largest bank by assets stops funneling money to dirty fossil fuel projects, such commitments amount to little more than fig leaves at best, and manipulative “greenwashing” at worst, environmentalist groups said. To pull it off its new commitment, Bank of America plans to cut back on electricity use and buy more renewable energy and carbon offsets, credits voluntarily purchased by companies to counterbalance pollution. As part of the announcement Monday, Bank of America also said it had joined the RE100, a coalition ― led by the nonprofit Climate Group ― of big corporations committed to becoming completely carbon neutral.“Addressing global issues like climate change and the transition to a sustainable and low-carbon future takes collaboration, innovation and investment,” Anne Finucane, vice chairman of Bank of America, said in a statement. “This demonstrates the measurable actions we are taking to reduce our environmental impacts.”Bank of America made the announcement at New York’s annual Climate Week ― a series of events coinciding with the United Nations General Assembly ― which it sponsored along with JPMorgan Chase and French banking giant BNP Paribas. It’s unclear how much money the banks spent on the sponsorship.JPMorgan and BNP Paribas are not part of the RE100, which Goldman Sachs and Swiss bank UBS joined last year. But Bank of America’s membership highlights the dissonance between its corporate values and the actual assets it and many other financial institutions keep on their books.Between 2013 and 2015, Bank of America invested $3.92 billion in coal mining companies, according to an annual report by the nonprofit Rainforest Action Network. The bank put $10.85 billion into the 20 largest coal-fired power producers in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It spent $24.85 billion underwriting or lending to firms building liquid natural gas terminals across North America. Another $29.61 billion in funding went to companies drilling for oil in “extreme” locations in the Arctic, tar sands or underwater sites located far offshore. “To meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and BNP Paribas must stop funding extreme fossil fuels, which are simply incompatible with a climate-stable world,” Amanda Starbuck, climate and energy program director at Rainforest Action Network, said in a statement Monday. “If these banks aspire to be climate leaders, they must accelerate their exit from coal, and commit to getting out of extreme oil and fracked-gas terminals as well.” Bank of America, for its part, began moving away from coal last year, when it announced a new policy to curtail financing for new mining projects. The policy, posted on the firm’s website, states that the bank believes “climate change poses a significant risk to our business, our clients, and the communities in which we operate.”Despite this, Bank of America remains one of the chief backers bankrolling the company building the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline, which faces fierce opposition from Native American tribes whose water supply is threatened by the oil conduit. The Obama administration temporarily halted construction on the pipeline earlier this month as the Army Corps considers whether the project violates any federal laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act. “It’s significant that the Bank of America is taking steps toward greening its operations, but it’s the Bank’s investments that count,” Jenny Marienau, U.S. campaigns director at the environmental advocacy group 350.org, said in a statement. “Not only is the Bank of America continuing to invest in fossil fuel companies, but it is also playing a key role in financing dangerous fossil fuel infrastructure like the Dakota Access Pipeline.” The $3.8 billion pipeline has become a flashpoint at the intersection of the environmental and racial justice movements. Security personnel loosed guard dogs on demonstrators earlier this month, conjuring images of police crackdowns on Civil Rights-era demonstrations. The Standing Rock Sioux and their tribal allies, who call themselves “protectors” rather than protesters, say the pipeline jeopardizes the safety of their drinking water.“These institutions are undermining their own climate goals by funding massive and risky fossil fuel infrastructure that tramples community rights,” Alex Doukas, a senior campaigner at the research nonprofit Oil Change International, told The Huffington Post.Still, he said Bank of America’s announcement was a positive step. “From my perspective, it is a substantive move,” he said. “It’s just orders of magnitude smaller than the impact would be if they actually restricted their financing of fossil fuel projects.”Kelly Sapp, a Bank of America spokeswoman, told HuffPost the bank has invested $53 billion dollars into low-carbon projects and “other environmental business activities” since 2007. It pledged last year to increase that investment to $125 billion by 2025. “RAN and others have acknowledged that we are a leader in the transition to clean renewable energy future and we have committed significant financial and intellectual capital to do so,” Sapp wrote in email.

25,POLITICS,Obama Warns Against 'Aggressive Nationalism' And 'Crude Populism' In UN Speech,Willa Frej,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-unga-speech_us_57e0453ee4b04a1497b60ce3,"""We can choose to press forward with a better model of integration, or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and in conflict,"" he said.",2016-09-20,"U.S. President Barack Obama addresses the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Sept. 20, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e15728180000c706315d12.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UNITED NATIONS ― In his final speech at the United Nations General Assembly, President Barack Obama hailed progress on the world stage while warning against the perilous forces that seek to dismantle peace and prosperity.Referencing various global crises ― including the war in Syria, the plight of refugees, nuclear tests in North Korea and the self-described Islamic State ― Obama highlighted the need to promote inclusive governance. He also cautioned about a looming choice between future integration and conflict:“This is the paradox that defines our world today. A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world is, by many measures, less violent and more prosperous than ever before, yet our society is filled with unease and strife. Despite enormous progress in institutions, governing becomes more difficult. Tensions between nations [have] become more quick to surface. So I believe that, at this moment, we all face a choice. We can choose to press forward with a better model of integration, or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and in conflict.”That statement, and a number of others Obama made before the U.N. ― grouping “aggressive nationalism” and “crude populism” into the same category as religious fundamentalism ― could be interpreted as swipes at U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. “Today, a nation ringed in by walls would only imprison itself,” Obama said, in apparent reference to Trump’s proposal to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. “Our identities do not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by lifting someone else up.”While Trump has also made offensive comments about Mexican immigrants and said he wanted to ban Muslims from entering the United States, Obama urged compassion for the 65 million people who are currently displaced from their homes due to conflict and persecution. “In the eyes of innocent men and women and children who, through no fault of their own, have had to leave everything they’ve known and loved, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves,” Obama said.“We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, our children, if the unspeakable happened to us. Ultimately, our world is more secure if we are prepared to help those in need.”That message fits in well with the theme of this year’s U.N. general debate, titled “Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world.” The SDGs, launched a year ago by the international community, lay out a 15-year blueprint designed to eliminate extreme poverty around the globe.“I am more convinced than ever [that we can] end war, poverty and persecution,” U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in his own opening remarks. “We have the means to prevent conflict, we have the potential to close the gap between rich and poor.”Yet it also seems that little has progressed on the world stage since Obama’s last General Assembly speech. A year ago, the president referenced an “epic” refugee problem caused by failing states, as well as the “brutal networks of terror [that] have stepped into the vacuum.” He denounced Russian President Vladimir Putin’s support for Syrian leader Bashar Assad, “who drops barrel bombs to massacre innocent children.” Obama has been criticized himself for not doing more to curb the civil war in Syria and the rise of ISIS. Meanwhile, U.S. troops are still active in Iraq and Afghanistan, another crack at negotiating peace between Israel and Palestine fell apart and North Korea is allegedly running nuclear tests.While the president said we’ve made progress in facilitating economic development, democracy and the collective fight against climate change (namely, by signing the Paris climate agreement last December), he singled out the “wasteland” of North Korea and the continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory as issues that demand attention.“The enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities have left international institutions underfunded and unequipped to handle transnational challenges,” he said.Obama did highlight some major foreign policy wins that have occurred during his time in office. Last year, the U.S. led the charge on a nuclear deal with Iran, which would curb the country’s nuclear program in exchange for sanction relief. Supporters of the deal viewed it as a pathway to a possible restoration of relations between the two countries. Obama also spearheaded the restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba.Obama plans to speak again on Tuesday during the Leaders’ Summit on the Global Refugee Crisis, a meeting the U.S. is hosting with Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden and the U.N. Secretary-General. It will build on Monday’s first-ever Summit on Large Movements of Migrants and Refugees, which resulted in a nonbinding declaration asking countries to commit to more support.The president will also host a meeting with 35 business leaders and philanthropists who have made commitments to improving the lives of refugees. George Soros pledged to donate $500 million to the cause on Tuesday.And in light of the collapse of the U.S.-Russia negotiated ceasefire in Syria, Obama will meet with representatives from Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia. That meeting is bound to be fraught.

But most Americans aren’t buying this type of rhetoric. Polls show Clinton maintaining a slight edge over Trump when it comes to which major-party nominee voters trust on terrorism.Clinton leads Trump 49-45 percent among registered voters when it comes to who would do a “better job of handling terrorism and national security,” according to a new CBS/New York Times poll. Likewise, a new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows Clinton leading Trump by 9 points among Americans asked who they trust more to handle terrorism. That’s the same margin by which Clinton led in a late-August Fox News poll. Most August polls showed Clinton leading on the topic. One poll did find Trump doing better: A September CNN poll found that 51 percent of registered voters think Trump would handle terrorism better than Clinton, who wins the confidence of 45 percent of Americans. In May, Clinton held a 5-point lead over Trump when CNN asked registered voters the same question. Like any other controversial topic in an election year, the partisan divide on this issue is quite strong. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats in the September CNN poll said Clinton would handle terrorism better, while 90 percent of Republicans said the same of Trump. The ABC/Washington Post and Fox polls reported similarly polarized results. It is still too early to determine if the events of the weekend will give either candidate a boost in support ― at least until new polling data is published. But Trump’s harsh rhetoric hasn’t worked in the past. Americans did not approve of the he responded to the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll: 46 percent believed that Clinton responded better than Trump, while only 28 percent felt that way about Trump. In that same poll, 50 percent of Americans said Clinton would best handle terrorism while only 39 percent put their faith in the GOP nominee.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

First American Fried Chicken, on the ground floor of their home on Elmora Avenue, is owned by Rahami's father.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e03d781300002b0039d094.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The family of the man suspected in weekend bombings in New York City and New Jersey had a history of clashes with police and had accused officers and neighbors in their New Jersey town of anti-Muslim discrimination. Bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami’s family members hold a fraught history with police and neighbors in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where they live and operate a fast-food chicken restaurant, according to court records. Rahami was arrested nearby Monday after a shootout with police. Rahami’s father, Mohammad, alleged in a 2011 discrimination lawsuit against the city of Elizabeth and its police that neighbors and officers conspired to “maliciously harass, intimidate and threaten” his family based on race, religion and national origin. The alleged discrimination stemmed from ongoing disputes over how late the family’s First American Fried Chicken restaurant was allowed to stay open. “We had some code enforcement problems and some noise complaints when they opened” in 2002, Elizabeth Mayor Chris Bollwage (D) said during a press conference following Rahami’s arrest Monday. The mayor said that the city passed an ordinance in 2009 that forced restaurants to close at 10 p.m. Rahami’s brothers and father sued, and a court ruled in the city’s favor in 2012, Bollwage said. The chicken restaurant ― well regarded by some customers for its “friendly service” and known for attracting noisy late-night crowds ― had been the subject of complaints from neighbors, according to court records. According to the federal discrimination suit, neighbor James Dean McDermott repeatedly complained to police about the restaurant. McDermott allegedly told the Rahamis that “you are Muslims” and “Muslims make too much trouble in this country.” The lawsuit claims police validated McDermott’s complaints without question. Officers told the Rahamis “there’s too much crime around here” and “this area by your restaurant is a known place for criminal activity,” the lawsuit says.The complaints from McDermott and other unnamed individuals continued, as did police citations against the Rahamis. During a 2009 incident, Rahami’s brothers reportedly clashed with officers over recording them on cell phones as police tried to close down the restaurant. Rahami’s father was detained and released, while his brother was arrested and later pleaded guilty to obstruction. Rahami eventually took over day-to-day operation of the restaurant, Ryan McCann, a regular customer at First American Fried Chicken, told The New York Times on Monday. “He’s always there, he’s a very friendly guy,” Ryan McCann told a scrum of reporters Monday. McCann described the Rahami family as “just trying to fit in.” Rahami would often talk about cars and give him free meals, McCann said. After Rahami’s most recent visits to Afghanistan, where he was born, McCann said he noticed a “change.” He described Rahami as “not angry, but more distant.” Other regular customers expressed shock that Rahami was wanted in a terror attack.Flee Jones, who co-wrote a song about the restaurant’s chicken, said the family was hospitable and would let him host rap battles at the eatery with his friends.Rahami was arrested Monday, roughly 36 hours after an explosive device that police say he planted rocked the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea and injured 29 people. A second, undetonated pressure cooker explosive device was found blocks away. FBI Assistant Director Bill Sweeney said Rahami was “directly linked” to another small bomb that detonated along the route of a 5K race in a New Jersey beach town Saturday morning.Prosecutors said they expect to charge Rahami with five counts of attempted murder and two gun charges in connection with Monday’s shootout. Terrorism charges will likely follow once federal officials assemble a more detailed case."
30,POLITICS,That Pledge The GOP Chair Is Talking About – Trump Already Reneged On It,S.V.

It’s so clear. It said, ‘I will endorse’ the person that wins the primaries, right? And not only did I win, I got 14 million votes,” Trump said during a phone interview with Fox News. “These people all want to run in four years, right? If I were head of the Republican Party, I’d say you can’t do it!”Neither Trump nor Priebus, of course, brought up Trump’s own declaration on March 29 ― when it appeared many in the party establishment were trying to block the real estate mogul from getting the nomination ― that he was no longer bound by the pledge.“I have been treated very unfairly ... by basically the RNC, the Republican Party, the establishment,” Trump said at a CNN town hall event back then.John Weaver, a top political adviser to Kasich, said Monday that Trump had been even more cavalier in earlier statements. “He also said if he wasn’t the nominee, he wouldn’t honor it,” Weaver said. “That pledge? Yeah.”Neither the Republican National Committee nor Trump’s campaign responded to Huffington Post queries on the topic.Matt Borges, chairman of the Ohio GOP who is both loyal to Kasich and trying to help the Republican nominee carry the state, said he did not understand why Priebus and Trump are making an issue of this now.“I think the governor is pretty clear about where he is at this point in time. I don’t see that changing,” Borges said. “John Kasich is the most popular elected official in Ohio. To go out and pick a fight with the guy with just 50 days to go just makes no sense.”As to punishing Kasich, Bush and other 2016 GOP candidates who fail to endorse Trump, Weaver said that might be a question for voters in the future, but not for the RNC chairman.“There’s no such rule that a party candidate can be penalized for something that’s happened in the past,” Weaver said, adding, “Otherwise he wouldn’t be the nominee. He donated to Clinton.” (Trump and his oldest son donated repeatedly to Hillary Clinton when she was a New York senator.)The fact the pledge exists at all is testament to how much Republican leaders feared a third-party run by Trump at a time when they didn’t see him as a realistic threat to win the nomination. They believed Trump could self-fund an independent White House bid from his personal fortune, despite numerous published analyses over the years suggesting he was worth far less than his purported “$10 billion” net worth.At the first GOP presidential debate in August 2015, Trump was the sole candidate on stage to raise his hand when moderator Brett Baier asked who would not promise to back the ultimate Republican nominee and to refrain from running as an independent.“If I’m the nominee, I will pledge I will not run as an independent,” Trump said. But he was unwilling to say what he would do if he didn’t win the nomination. He then suggested he could use the offer of his support as a bargaining chip: “I’m, you know, talking about a lot of leverage.”In response, the RNC drew up a written pledge for its candidates to sign promising to support the eventual nominee. Priebus took a copy to Trump at Trump’s Manhattan office to collect his signature in person ― an action that critics fear forever altered the power relationship between the party and the reality TV host-turned-presidential candidate.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

TMZ cameras found the late-night host after the Emmys Sunday night and asked him about that particularly nauseating moment. Fallon called Trump a “good sport” for participating in the bit and that he asked the candidate’s permission before the segment because he’s not “one of those ‘Gotcha!’ people.” As for the texture of his hair, the former “SNL” star said that Trump’s hair felt like “an Easter basket, that grass that you have in an Easter basket that just keeps coming out and it’s kind of a fascinating texture. It wasn’t that bizarre.” Things got a little less funny when the TMZ cameraperson asked the comedian about accusations that he went “too soft” on Trump. In typical Fallon fashion, he attempted to smooth things over with a tired cover-up. “Have you seen my show?” Fallon mumbled with a slight smile. “I’m never too hard on anyone, yeah.” The 42-year-old then refused to comment on which candidate was “best for New York” and played it totally neutral. “Get out there and vote. Everyone just vote, vote, vote,” Fallon said. “Vote, vote, vote. Register, vote vote vote.” Perhaps, instead of trying to go for ratings gold, Fallon should’ve considered banning Trump from his show, like Seth Meyers has instituted, or asking Trump tougher questions, like David Letterman has in the past. Tune in to “The Tonight Show” Monday to see how Fallon handles Democratic candidate for president Hillary Clinton.
