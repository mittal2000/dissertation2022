And in a stunning development -- are you sitting down? -- he then did not stomp all over his message by saying monumentally stupid things for the rest of the week. No, really!",2016-08-20,"Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump attends a campaign rally at the Erie Insurance Arena in Erie, Pennsylvania August 12, 2016. REUTERS/Eric Thayer",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb826ac3c000032000dbecd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some weeks, it's tough coming up with a subtitle for these columns. Some weeks, not so much. This is one of the latter, because the juxtaposition of a colorful (to say the least) description of Donald Trump with a soap opera's title just naturally presented itself.The quote comes in response to Trump's campaign shakeup, which we'll get to in a moment. One of the new people Trump hired comes from Breitbart News, and former Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro was being interviewed by CNN's Brianna Keilar for his response to the shakeup. Here is the transcript, for everyone's edification:SHAPIRO: I mean, as you probably know, I think Donald Trump's a turd tornado, but I also understand that he has no capacity whatsoever to control himself and be this staid politician that everyone wants him to be. Telling him to double down is not necessarily terrible strategy. If he's gonna go down, he's gonna go down being Trump.Thanks for clearing that up, Ben! We'll just add that to the images we never thought we'd have to think about in the world of politics (a list which has grown to epic proportions during this presidential race, it's worth pointing out). With such an auspicious metaphor to work with, let's see just how the turd tornado (turdnado?) turned last week.The week began with a speech Donald Trump read off a TelePrompTer. And in a stunning development -- are you sitting down? -- he then did not stomp all over his message by saying monumentally stupid things for the rest of the week. No, really! True, his message was stomped all over by the shakeup news from his campaign, but this is actually an improvement for Trump. There wasn't a single tweet or off-the-cuff statement at a rally that derailed Trump's message this week -- which has got to be a new record for him. How many days can he keep this up? We certainly don't know, as evidenced by the fact that on Monday we wrote of the inevitability of it already happening by the end of the week -- which we have to admit turned out not to be the case at all.Before we get to the shakeup, a word about Trump's messaging this week. He actually read three TelePrompTer speeches this week, and he seems to be improving (somewhat) on his delivery with each one. The first was on the subject of defeating terrorism and foreign policy in general. The Morning Joe program helpfully put together a mashup video of just a few of the things he said in Monday's speech that utterly contradict what he's said about the subjects in the past, which is pretty amusing to watch. The second was a law-and-order speech in front of a mostly-white audience, warning of the dangers of urban crime (which has been par for the course for Republicans since Richard Nixon's time, it's worth noting). By week's end, Trump had made some astonishing news in the third speech, but we'll get to that in a moment.The campaign shakeup news was rather ominous for Republicans, since Trump pushed aside the only guy running his campaign who has had actual experience running campaigns before, and replaced him with two additions -- a woman who worked for Todd Akin's campaign (in the ""outreach to women"" job -- you just can't make this stuff up), and a guy who ran Breitbart News, a website for those who think that Fox News is just another part of the mainstream media's liberal conspiracy. Yes, there are people out there who think Fox isn't rightwingy enough, and they all apparently get their news from Breitbart. They also get plenty of conspiracy theories, but that almost goes without saying. The new theme for the campaign, as Shapiro referenced above, is going to be returning to ""letting Trump be Trump."" Hoo boy. Buckle up, boys and girls!Little-noticed in the midst of all this news was the very first poll Breitbart ever commissioned, which was intended to ""unskew"" all that liberal polling saying Trump wasn't beating Clinton. The only problem was that even after all this unskewing, Clinton still beat Trump by five points. Guess they'll have to rework that unskewing formula, eh?But back to the Trump campaign. With Trump adding a Breitbart executive to his campaign, the rest of the Republican Party spent the entire week waiting for the other shoe to drop. Nobody knew what form it would take, but this morning that shoe hit the ground with a thump, with the announcement that Paul Manafort would be stepping down from the Trump campaign. All week long, the Trump campaign had insisted that they weren't going through a shakeup at all, they were instead expanding the campaign by hiring more people to run things. This falsehood was exposed with Manafort's resignation. The Trump campaign is now being run by people who have never run a national campaign for anyone before. And it's worth pointing out that this isn't the first such top-level shakeup in Trump's campaign (and likely won't be the last).All of this news has led to noticeable glee over in the Clinton camp (and among Democrats in general). It's easy to understand such giddiness, since Clinton's recent polling is so strong, both in battleground states and in previously-deep-red states as well. Tim Kaine is campaigning in places like Wyoming, Idaho, and Missouri (to be fair, the first two aren't realistic for Clinton to even hope for, as he was just fundraising there from wealthy Democrats). People are beginning to ask whether Trump's defeat will rival Barry Goldwater's -- and it's only August. With Trump doubling down on ""being Trump,"" things look pretty rosy for Hillary Clinton right now.But there's a cautionary tale running through the week that few inside-the-Beltway pundits have so far noticed. Could Trump actually be successfully pivoting, in the midst of the shakeup? He gave three TelePrompTer speeches, and had zero blowups this week. He didn't say (or tweet) anything so radical it dominated the news cycle in a negative way -- this during a week when naked Donald Trump statues mockingly appeared in multiple U.S. cities (more on that in the awards). He introduced his first two television ads of the general election. This is all new, for Trump. To end the week, Trump decided to pay a visit to flooding victims in Louisiana -- an opportunity for him to show some compassion and ""look presidential."" And in the third of those speeches he read this week, he kind-of sort-of apologized for all his previous outrageous statements. Here's what he read off the screen:Sometimes in the heat of debate, and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that. And believe it or not, I regret it. I do regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues. But one thing; I can promise you this: I will always tell you the truth.Laughable as that might sound (especially that last line), this appears to be the first time Donald Trump has ever even remotely admitted any sort of mistake he's made during the campaign. So, to review: three speeches read from prepared texts, two new television ads that will run in battleground states, one presidential-looking photo op, zero speeches ad-libbed at rallies, zero new controversial statements, and one semi-apology. That's a much more focused Trump than we've yet seen. So perhaps all the Democratic celebration about his new campaign team might be a wee bit premature. Has Trump truly pivoted? Has he ridden out his own personal poopstorm? Time will tell. Perhaps this is all the final influence of Manafort, on his way out -- perhaps next week Trump will return to form. But even with all the campaign shakeup news, Trump had a better week on the campaign trail than usual.Finally, before we move along to the awards, we have to say a formal goodbye to John McLaughlin, who died earlier this week. The McLaughlin Group was a pioneer in political television, and for many (without cable subscriptions) was the only view into the contentious world that cable political shows have regularly become. With regulars on the right like Pat Buchanan and on the left people like Clarence Page, the show was always pretty freewheeling and interesting to watch. Countless political shows were inspired by their format, and McLaughlin had actually been trained as a Jesuit priest, which includes formal training in forming an argument (pro or con), so he was always able to examine strange angles and odd views that others routinely missed. OK, occasionally this veered into conspiratorial thinking, but McLaughlin usually seemed to be playing devil's advocate (rather than ""true believer"") by bringing such subjects up.We'll miss seeing John, and we'll miss his show. Every year in this space, we run our year-end list of ""McLaughlin awards,"" since his categories were so complete and well-thought out. So we have a personal connection to the show (even if they never knew about it). So, in homage, there is only one possible way to salute John McLaughlin: with the final phrase he used to close each of his shows, to show how we will miss his presence.""Bye-bye.""Occasionally, we redefine our awards, and this seems a dandy week to do so. Rather than handing out a Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week this week, we are handing out a Most Impressive Anarchist Collective Of The Week award instead. We thought that changing it to the MIACOTW award would be more appreciated by an anarchist group, who might be offended by being linked to any official political party (even in an award).The group INDECLINE had already made a name for itself by creating the largest-ever piece of illegal graffiti, by painting a political statement on a deserted military landing strip in the Mojave Desert. That's pretty cool, we have to admit, especially when you consider that they spent $20,000 creating it.But this week, INDECLINE outdid themselves, by placing a rather unflattering statue of a naked Donald Trump in five American cities (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Cleveland, and Seattle). Being anarchists, they didn't ask anyone's permission, just set the statue up (and epoxied it to the ground, to make it harder to remove). This bit of political theater was even given a name: ""The Emperor Has No Balls."" Reportedly, the statue didn't, but it's hard to tell from the available photos.The artist, a guy from Las Vegas who goes by ""Ginger,"" reportedly ""has a long history of designing monsters for haunted houses and horror movies."" That certainly seems like experience enough to create such monstrous statues, at least in our humble opinion.The people behind the political theater knew their installations would be temporary. Reportedly, Cleveland was the fastest to remove it, while some in San Francisco are looking to preserve the statue in a suitable place. No real surprise there, we suppose.Regular readers of this column will know that we are suckers for political theater (good, bad, and indifferent). As always, such theater must be judged on how amusing it is and how effective it is. On both these scales, ""The Emperor Has No Balls"" has to rate somewhere near the top end. It's funny, it made a huge splash online, and now millions of people have laughed at a naked Trump provided by a group that few had ever previously heard of. All around, that's pretty impressive, and well worth our special Most Impressive Anarchist Collective Of The Week award. Well done![Congratulate INDECLINE on their official contact page, to let them know you appreciate their efforts.]This one wasn't hard to select this week. Former Pennsylvania state attorney general Kathleen Kane easily wins the Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award for being convicted of nine criminal charges, two of them felonies. It's pretty disappointing when any Democrat is convicted of crimes, but when it is the person who is in charge of the entire state's justice and law enforcement divisions, it reaches a whole 'nother level.The whole story is convoluted and rather sad. It began with the Jerry Sandusky/Joe Paterno scandal, widened to sexist and racist emails, and wound up in a personal vendetta Kane waged against a political rival. The scandal not only shook up the Penn State's athletic department but also brought down two justices on the state supreme court, and even Kane's twin sister (who, it turned out, had sent some of the emails).At the heart of the charges against Kane was a leak of grand jury evidence that she later tried to pin on a scapegoat rather than admitting to leaking. Not only did Kane commit the crime, she also tried to cover it up, to put it more bluntly.Kane was once considered a rising star among Pennsylvania Democrats, but not any more (to put it mildly). Among her other woes this week, we simply have to add our own Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week. This was a shameful episode in the midst of an investigation of an even-more-shameful crime, and there's simply nothing good to say about it.[Since Kathleen Kane has quit her office, she is now a private citizen, and our longstanding policy is not to provide contact info for people not currently serving in office.]Volume 404 (8/19/16)We should really just be able to write ""Volume 404 -- Talking Points Not Found"" here, but we fear few would get the joke (and it'd be awfully lazy to do so). Kidding aside, we actually do have to admit we have been rather lazy in putting together the talking points for the past month or so. This was due to the fact that all it took was repackaging what Republicans were saying about Donald Trump. No Democratic input was even necessary -- just repeating the scathing things Republicans were saying was enough.This week, we're going to try to wean ourselves off this habit, by only providing a mere three (less than half!) of our talking points directly from Republicans slamming Trump. And we promise, our last talking point is one of the funniest we've come across yet, so there's that to look forward to.As always, use these talking points responsibly, and refrain from operating heavy machinery while doing so. Heh. The middle fingerThe Washington Post set the tone for what was going on this week, most notably in a headline to an article run immediately after the first news of the Trump campaign shakeup:Donald Trump's Hire Of Breitbart News Chief Is A Middle Finger To The GOP Establishment Right back atcha...Of course, to be fair, the number of Republicans giving Trump the finger has been growing for weeks, now.""You can't really blame Trump for turning his back on the GOP establishment, because they've been running away from his campaign in droves. The letter begging the R.N.C. to pull all money from Trump in a desperate attempt to salvage Congress, which was released last week, was initially said to have 70 signatures of Republicans on it. Now it's got more than 100. Maybe by next week it'll have another 50, who knows? Also last week, a member of George W. Bush's cabinet came out in support of Hillary Clinton. Will the last Republican to leave Trump's campaign please turn out the lights?"" Divine intervention necessaryGeorge Shultz weighed in on Trump this week, too.""When George Shultz -- one of the most-respected Republican foreign policy voices around -- was asked recently about the prospect of a Trump administration, his response was brief and personal: 'God help us.' Shultz is right -- if Donald Trump is elected president, this country is going to need all the divine intervention it can possibly get."" Sorry, you can't come inEven right-wing pundits are getting in on the act.""What with all the news about Trump's campaign shakeup, the content of his Monday TelePrompTer speech was all but ignored. But Washington Post conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin (whose column is even called 'Right Turn,' so you know where she's coming from) hilariously took Trump to task for his concept of 'extreme vetting.' Rubin pointed out that Trump might just be a victim of his own program, if his 'extreme vetting' idea were ever to become law. Trump would fail on the metrics of 'shares American values and respect for the American people,' as well as falling short on being one of 'those who we expect to flourish in our country and to embrace a tolerant American society.' Be careful what you wish for, Donald, as you might not pass your own test quite as easily as you might think."" What, precisely, was Trump apologizing for?The list is a long one.""Donald Trump issued a blanket 'apology' this week. It was actually a non-apology, merely that he 'regretted' having said some things which 'may have caused personal pain,' but it's as close to saying 'I'm sorry' as we're ever likely to get. But his remarks were generic, with no specifics. The Washington Post then helpfully compiled a list of two dozen things he might have been referring to. Somebody needs to ask Trump which items on this list his non-apology apology covers, just to clear things up. With so many to choose from, inquiring minds want to know precisely what Trump actually 'regrets' having said so far."" A conspiracy theory that makes senseThe facts do seem to fit....""Since Donald Trump began running, I've heard a lot of wild-eyed conspiracy theories from the left over what his plans actually were going to turn out to be. Most of these involved reading Trump's mind and figuring out what his next move would be. Almost all of them have so far been proven hilariously wrong. My personal favorite was: 'Trump will drop out of the primaries the minute he loses his first state.' Or maybe: 'Bill Clinton talked Donald into destroying the Republican Party' -- that was a fun one, right? But there's a new conspiracy theory on the scene which actually could make a whole lot of sense. Is Donald Trump merely using a run for the presidency to launch his own branded media empire? Will 'Trump News' soon be on the air, competing with Fox News? Trump has reportedly been cozying up to Roger Ailes, and now he's got the head of Breitbart News running his campaign, so it's pretty easy to see how the effort could morph into 'Trump TV,' right after he loses in a landslide to Hillary Clinton. I mean, it could all make a twisted sort of sense, don't you think?"" Score one for NYC ParksIssuing dry press releases all day in a mundane local government department must get pretty boring. And then a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity crosses your desk....""The funniest thing I've heard this week was the official New York City parks department response, after they removed a nude statue of Donald Trump which had been illegally mounted in Union Square. Whoever came up with this gem deserves a raise, or a promotion to a P.R. job where they can better utilize their obvious skills. After removing the statue, an official statement was then released: 'NYC Parks stands firmly against any unpermitted erection in city parks, no matter how small.' NYC Parks certainly rose to that occasion, as it were.""Chris Weigant blogs at:Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"

It depends on your country of residence, but citizens of the UK and U.S have quite an advantage",2016-08-20,Female tourist walking with luggage at Big Ben in London. See my other photos from London: http://www.oc-photo.net/FTP/icons/london.jpg,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9b1ba0250000360035953d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When asked about travel, most people say that it's something they want to do more of but aren't able to afford. For years, traveling has been looked at like a luxury; something expensive that revolves around resorts, tropical cocktails and shopping sprees in world famous boutiques. However, as more and more of today's youth are figuring out, long term traveling is all about experiencing new places, other cultures and learning to love the journey along the way. Instead of deciding that long term travel is too expensive or out of your reach, try reaching your travel goals through these affordable ways to travel for a longer and more rewarding period of time.Find a Volunteer ProgramVolunteering abroad is one of the most rewarding ways to dive into extended travel. While you are getting to live and work in a new place and culture, you also are giving back to communities and helping individuals at the same time. Since volunteer programs typically allow you to engage with the locals, there is a higher chance of you making connections, seeing aspects of a place that you would never see as a tourist and gaining a broader perspective of life around the world as a whole. Volunteer work can not only help you see the world for low costs but also allow you to gain valuable skills for your resume that could help you find jobs in the future. Despite your skills or experience, there is bound to be volunteer work that you can do from building houses and helping with environmental efforts to teaching English, working with non-profits and providing health care. Get a JobPart of the reason why long term travel seems so unrealistic is due to financial reasons. However, there are plenty of opportunities to both travel and have the money to afford it. Getting a job in another country can actually be easier than you think and allow you to earn an income, use it to further your travels, save a bit for a rainy day and gain valuable skills and connections with people to further your future career. There are various jobs in the tourism industry like tour guides, group leaders and staff at tourist sites to other options like becoming an English teacher, working at a hotel or hostel, waitressing or making coffee in a city café. Focus on the skills and experiences you already have and see what kind of jobs you can find.Get a Second PassportOK, this option isn't for everyone, but getting a second passport can allow you to live in another country as a resident; no visa fees or hassle. While it doesn't apply to all, some people are able to get a second passport if they have a family heritage from a certain country, have an investment or even marry someone from a different country. Some countries have specific citizen programs such as places in the Caribbean, U.S.A, Belgium, Austria and the E.U that have various guidelines which eventually allow for citizenship to be granted and a second passport to be given. Look Into Work & Visa ProgramsTaking in foreign employees is often so sought after that entire countries have established visa programs that make it easy. It depends on your country of residence, but citizens of the UK and U.S have quite an advantage when it comes to work programs with other countries. Places like Australia and New Zealand have specific work visas just for foreigners that allow for interesting jobs that range from wait staff to grape picking in wineries, horticultural work and career based jobs in various fields."

Well good for you, but that’s absolutely nothing compared to what the participants in the Rio Olympics decathlon just went through. Over the course of two grueling days, the Olympic athletes participate in 10 events. Day 1 includes a 100-meter race, a 400-meter race, a long-jump competition, a shot-put competition and a high-jump competition. Day 2 involves 110-meter hurdles, pole vaulting, throwing a discus, throwing a javelin and then, to top it all off, a 1500-meter race.At the end of it, you feel something like this:Seriously, just look at these exhausted world-class athletes.

All that’s left to do are some finishing touches, including mixing and final packaging. The upcoming set (release date to be determined) would mark her first new studio effort since 2009’s “My Turn.” And by the sound of it, she’s pretty proud of the result. “I think it’s the best I’ve done … What makes me say that is that I’ve been involved in every part of it … every intricate detail, I’ve been there. I’ve been involved with this album more than I’ve ever been with a record,” she told The Huffington Post during an AOL Build interview on Monday. But what she really wants to tackle next is a duets album. The 57-year-old country singer has already talked to Bob Dylan about recording something together.  “I’ve yet to really do the collaborations that I really want to do. I’m really looking forward to taking that on … I’m thinking Tom Petty. I always wanted to do something with Merle Haggard, and of course time ran out on that,” she said about working with the late singer, who died in April. “But different people ... Eric Clapton is one of my favorites … These guys aren’t getting any younger and neither am I so we need to get to it!”She also has her eyes on some younger country talent.  “I’d love to do something with maybe one of the new boys,” she added, tossing out names like Keith Urban and Blake Shelton.Clearly, the singer, who joined the country music scene at the tender age of 13, isn’t ready to hang up her cowboy hat any time soon. She has a slew of tour dates lined up this year and, later this month, she’ll receive the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award during the 10th annual ACM Honors. “I still have a lot left to do,” she said. “There’s always going to be something new. You’re never at the top of the mountain. I always feel like I’m looking at Mount Everest and putting my hiking boots on … I never feel like I’m there yet. It’s always a journey.”For more from Huffington Post’s AOL Build interview, check out the video below."
5,POLITICS,Supreme Court Is About To Get A Good Look At How North Carolina Messes With Voting Rules,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-north-carolina-voting-rules_us_57b5e8dee4b0fd5a2f41cbd8,"The state's Republican Party is making tweaks to early voting, and the justices will know all about it.",2016-08-19,"An appeals court in July said that North Carolina's voter ID law and similar provisions targeted black voters ""with almost surgical precision.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b602d6180000ad02bcb9ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Late last month, a federal appeals court struck down North Carolina’s restrictive voting law, noting that it targeted African Americans “with almost surgical precision” and likening it to the worst of Jim Crow-era laws. Even as Gov. Pat McCrory (R) is imploring the Supreme Court to put the ruling on hold, the North Carolina Republican Party is acting as if the decision never happened.In striking down the law, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit effectively restored seven days of early voting that North Carolina lawmakers had taken away ― bringing the total to 17 ― thus benefitting minority voters. Many of them take advantage of features such as Sunday voting, same-day registration and extended voting hours ahead of Election Day.But the appeals court didn’t tell North Carolina what to do with the restored days ― only that they needed to be restored. And the state’s board of elections went along, setting Oct. 20 as the start for early voting in North Carolina but leaving it up to each of North Carolina’s 100 county boards to specify what rules to follow on those days.That left an opening for Republicans. And on Sunday, they struck: County election boards should “make party line changes to early voting,” the state GOP’s executive director, Dallas Woodhouse, wrote in a memo sent to GOP election officials and later obtained by The News and Observer.“Our Republican Board members should feel empowered to make legal changes to early voting plans, that are supported by Republicans,” Woodhouse wrote in emails sent to county board members, the majority of whom lean Republican because they’re appointed by party leadership. “Republicans can and should make party line changes to early voting.”The Supreme Court and election law experts have long struggled to set guidelines for when race and party affiliation, which are closely linked, may or may not be used when changing the rules of elections.And for Woodhouse ― who calls himself “an unabashed partisan” ― it seems as though tweaking the rules of early voting is nothing more than kowtowing to party interests, not an exercise in invidious racial discrimination. (His own partisan brother appears to think otherwise.)You be the judge ― these are some of the legal changes Woodhouse suggested to election officials:Limited hours and thus fewer opportunities for same-day registration, which Woodhouse said is “ripe for voter fraud.” Yet the 4th Circuit said that claims of in-person voter fraud in North Carolina are “merely imaginable.”No Sunday voting, which African-American voters favor as part of “souls to the polls” drives after church on Sunday. The GOP leader justified this move as a favor to poll workers who need at least one day off after working tirelessly for six days.No early voting at campus sites, because college students are apparently not “entitled to their own voting site.” But the measure benefits them because college students often don’t drive.This is precisely the kind of tinkering ― benign on paper but discriminatory in practice ― that could have subjected North Carolina to federal government oversight under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

So far, he said, some counties have bucked the GOP’s wishes and offered Sunday and on-campus early voting, as well as extended hours of operation at polling sites.But with 100 counties to keep track of, the data collection will continue until right before the advocacy groups make their case to the high court.

6,POLITICS,Supreme Court Is About To Get A Good Look At How North Carolina Messes With Voting Rules,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-north-carolina-voting-rules_us_57b5e8dee4b0fd5a2f41cbd8,"The state's Republican Party is making tweaks to early voting, and the justices will know all about it.",2016-08-19,"Gov. Pat McCrory (R) has taken a hardline approach to North Carolina's broad swath of voting restrictions, which an appeals court in July likened to Jim Crow-era laws.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b61cf01700002c00d1fb2d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Late last month, a federal appeals court struck down North Carolina’s restrictive voting law, noting that it targeted African Americans “with almost surgical precision” and likening it to the worst of Jim Crow-era laws. Even as Gov. Pat McCrory (R) is imploring the Supreme Court to put the ruling on hold, the North Carolina Republican Party is acting as if the decision never happened.In striking down the law, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit effectively restored seven days of early voting that North Carolina lawmakers had taken away ― bringing the total to 17 ― thus benefitting minority voters. Many of them take advantage of features such as Sunday voting, same-day registration and extended voting hours ahead of Election Day.But the appeals court didn’t tell North Carolina what to do with the restored days ― only that they needed to be restored. And the state’s board of elections went along, setting Oct. 20 as the start for early voting in North Carolina but leaving it up to each of North Carolina’s 100 county boards to specify what rules to follow on those days.That left an opening for Republicans. And on Sunday, they struck: County election boards should “make party line changes to early voting,” the state GOP’s executive director, Dallas Woodhouse, wrote in a memo sent to GOP election officials and later obtained by The News and Observer.“Our Republican Board members should feel empowered to make legal changes to early voting plans, that are supported by Republicans,” Woodhouse wrote in emails sent to county board members, the majority of whom lean Republican because they’re appointed by party leadership. “Republicans can and should make party line changes to early voting.”The Supreme Court and election law experts have long struggled to set guidelines for when race and party affiliation, which are closely linked, may or may not be used when changing the rules of elections.And for Woodhouse ― who calls himself “an unabashed partisan” ― it seems as though tweaking the rules of early voting is nothing more than kowtowing to party interests, not an exercise in invidious racial discrimination. (His own partisan brother appears to think otherwise.)You be the judge ― these are some of the legal changes Woodhouse suggested to election officials:Limited hours and thus fewer opportunities for same-day registration, which Woodhouse said is “ripe for voter fraud.” Yet the 4th Circuit said that claims of in-person voter fraud in North Carolina are “merely imaginable.”No Sunday voting, which African-American voters favor as part of “souls to the polls” drives after church on Sunday. The GOP leader justified this move as a favor to poll workers who need at least one day off after working tirelessly for six days.No early voting at campus sites, because college students are apparently not “entitled to their own voting site.” But the measure benefits them because college students often don’t drive.This is precisely the kind of tinkering ― benign on paper but discriminatory in practice ― that could have subjected North Carolina to federal government oversight under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But in 2013, the Supreme Court struck a key part of it, lifting that oversight requirement from North Carolina and other states and localities with a history of voter discrimination.In a statement, Woodhouse defended himself and his party’s positions, which seek “to preserve the integrity of the voting process so everyone’s vote is properly counted” ― a rationale for North Carolina’s restrictive law that the 4th Circuit all but discarded.“The county board members are an independent body, and we have the right to lobby them as much as anybody else, for Republican positions,” Woodhouse said.Perhaps.

Harris Funeral Homes, after it fired its funeral director, Amiee Stephens, a transgender woman who was undergoing transition.Stephens, who had worked at the funeral home for six years and was known as Anthony Stephens until 2013, was fired after she sent a letter to her boss and coworkers announcing that she had gender dysphoria and was undergoing treatment, with plans for sex reassignment surgery at a later date.“The first step I must take is to live and work full-time as a woman for one year,” she told coworkers. “At the end of my vacation on August 26, 2013, I will return to work as my true self, Amiee Australia Stephens, in appropriate business attire.” But Stephens never went on vacation or made it back to work. Her boss, Thomas Rost, fired her soon after receiving her letter. “Anthony, this is not going to work out,” Rost told her at the time, according to a later deposition. He also said he fired her because Stephens “wanted to dress as a woman” and because “we have a dress code that is very specific that men will dress as men.”Stephens filed a complaint with the EEOC, and the agency later sued in federal court, alleging the funeral home discriminated against her on the basis of sex and her gender identity in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The law protects against discrimination in the workplace.On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sean Cox said that the funeral home deserved an exemption from complying with the law because compliance “would impose a substantial burden on its ability to conduct business in accordance with its sincerely-held religious beliefs.”That language is lifted from the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a federal law that protects individuals from government action that may “substantially burden” their religious tenets. Rost had raised it as a defense in the litigation.Rost, it turns out, is a longtime Christian, and in an affidavit he said that he operates his business “as a ministry to serve grieving families.” The funeral home, he said, “administers its dress code based on our employees’ biological sex, not based on their subjective gender identity.”According to Rost’s affidavit, “the Bible teaches that it is wrong for a biological male to deny his sex by dressing as a woman,” and that allowing Stephens to do so “would be violating God’s commands.” Curiously, Rost also said he wouldn’t have a problem with Stephens dressing as a woman if she did so during non-work hours.In light of these and other beliefs, Cox ruled for the funeral home and found that requiring it to not discriminate against Stephens for living as a woman would impinge on those beliefs.The court relied in great part in the Supreme Court’s decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, which made waves in 2014 for allowing a religiously owned arts-and-crafts corporation to be exempted from providing contraceptive coverage to its female employees under the Affordable Care Act. Brian Hauss, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union ― which filed a legal brief in support of Stephens ― said in an email that the ruling was “way, way out there” and could have serious repercussions down the road.“I’m not aware of any court holding that an employer has a religious right to ignore Title VII’s prohibition against sex discrimination,” he said. “If allowed to stand, this decision would seriously jeopardize federal anti-discrimination protections for transgender people, women and people of color.”A spokeswoman for the EEOC said the agency is disappointed in the ruling and that it’s evaluating whether to appeal.According to the Transgender Law Center, only 20 states plus the District of Columbia have employment non-discrimination laws protecting transgender individuals. And even Title VII, which covers the entire country, doesn’t explicitly cover gender identity discrimination, but relies on court rulings to provide such coverage.“Because there is no federal law explicitly banning discrimination against transgender people ... allowing employers to use religion to discriminate would put transgender people across the country ― people like Aimee Stephens ― at an even greater risk of losing their jobs just for being who they are,” Hauss said."

Uber says it will launch a fleet of self-driving cars in the city by the end of August.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b71baa1700001108c74382.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - Ride service Uber Technologies Inc said on Thursday it acquired self-driving trucks startup Otto and formed a $300 million alliance with Volvo Car Group to develop self-driving cars.Uber’s moves reflect its eagerness to advance self-driving technology. If its ambitions are realized, these vehicles could over time reduce its biggest cost, paying drivers.Uber would also be positioned to expand into the trucking industry, which had revenue of about $726.4 billion in the United States in 2015, according to trade data.Carpooling firms have formed alliances with large automakers, such as General Motors Co and ride-hailing service Lyft, to accelerate those efforts, which depend on software and hardware working together to give a vehicle the right reflexes in traffic.“Partnership is crucial to our self-driving strategy because Uber has no experience making cars,”Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick wrote in a blogpost.“To do it well is incredibly hard, as I realized on my first visit to a car manufacturing plant several years ago.”Uber, which has a research center in Pittsburgh, will by the end of this month begin a pilot program in which trusted Uber customers will be able to use their phones to summon a self-driving car for use in a downtown Pittsburgh, according to a source with knowledge of Uber’s plans.It will be the first time members of the public will be able to use self-driving vehicles. A driver trained to handle the autonomous cars will be behind the wheel to step in if needed.The purchase of Otto, a start-up company less than a year old with fewer than 100 employees, will be for 1 percent of Uber’s valuation, if certain technical targets are met, said the source.Recently, that valuation was about $68 billion, placing the value of the deal at about $680 million. Current Otto employees would get a fifth of profits Uber earns from a self-driving trucking business, if those targets are met, the source said.Current Otto employees would get a fifth of profits Uber earns from a self-driving trucking business.Anthony Levandowski, one of Otto’s co-founders, will lead Uber’s self-driving efforts in San Francisco, Palo Alto and Pittsburgh, Kalanick said on the company’s website.That includes personal transportation such as ride-hailing services, as well as delivery services and trucking, Kalanick said.Levandowski was one of four founders of Otto, each of whom worked at Alphabet Inc’s Google and its self-driving program.VOLVO DEAL FOCUSES ON SUVThe Uber-Volvo partnership will allow Uber to pool resources with the Swedish-based carmaker, owned by China’s Geely, into initially developing the autonomous driving capabilities of Volvo’s flagship XC90 SUV model. The investment will be shared roughly equally by the two companies..There was no timeline given for the alliance, but the source said the goal is to develop a fully self-driving car by 2021, and that Uber, which does not plan to make its own vehicle, will align with other automakers over time.Uber will buy Volvos and then install its own driverless control system. Some of the Volvos will join a handful of Ford Motor Co Fusion sedans that will be used to start the pilot program that combines self-driving and ride-hailing in downtown Pittsburgh.So far Otto has tested self-driving trucks for highway use only.Developers hope for productivity gains with the new technology that will enable trucks to drive around the clock, leaving humans to rest, do paperwork and take controls only while going on and off highways.Over the long-term, Uber and rivals such as Lyft could cut the cost of paying drivers if they can gradually incorporate self-driving cars into their fleets. But at least for now, said the source familiar with the Uber-Otto agreement, Uber will expand its driver network, which now stands at 1.5 million globally in more than 450 cities.A spokesman for U.S. safety regulator National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it “continues to engage with all entities that are developing, testing and deploying automated technologies to ensure that they are advancing road safety.”Federal guidelines will be issued soon on development and testing of “highly automated vehicles,” he said."

The NBA had originally planned to hold next year’s All-Star Game in Charlotte, North Carolina, but withdrew the city’s selection in July in protest of North Carolina’s anti-LGBT law.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) actively courted the NBA in a July letter to Silver, noting the state’s “diversity of heritage, culture, cuisine and people.”Louisiana is one of the few Southern states not to pass so-called bathroom legislation allowing private entities to restrict transgender individuals’ ability to use the facilities of the gender with which they identify. Edwards signed an executive order in April barring discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. “By moving the 2017 All-Star Game to New Orleans, the NBA and Commissioner Adam Silver have sent a clear message to lawmakers in North Carolina and across the country that discrimination against LGBTQ people has consequences and will not be tolerated,” Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. North Carolina has faced a massive backlash from businesses and state and local governments over the anti-LGBT law it passed in March. A number of major corporations have canceled plans to expand or invest in North Carolina in response to the law, and progressive governors and mayors have issued travel bans to the state. North Carolina’s legislation bans discrimination on the basis of race, gender and other criteria, but does not forbid discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. It also precludes municipalities like Charlotte from establishing their own ordinances to protect LGBT people against discrimination.This will be the third time since the founding of the New Orleans Pelicans in 2002 that the Big Easy has hosted the All-Star Game. The game took place in New Orleans in 2008 and 2014 as well."

Hamid, a flight attendant who lives in Charlotte, drew national attention in January when she stood up in silent protest at a Trump rally in South Carolina and was promptly expelled, drawing cheers from the crowd.Anantha said he felt singled out for the color of his skin, since he saw throngs of white people being allowed to enter after he was ejected.“I thought (Trump) was for all people. I don’t believe he is for all people anymore,” he told the Observer. “Why are all these white people allowed to attend and I’m not?”Trump’s staff is legally permitted to control who comes into his rallies since they are private events typically held in private venues.Anantha, whose grandparents immigrated to the United States from India, recalled defending Trump to critics, claiming the candidate’s offensive rhetoric was an appropriate way to express frustration with unauthorized immigration and jihadism.Now Anantha may cast the first presidential vote of his life for Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson.Clinton currently leads Trump by nearly 4 percentage points in North Carolina, according to HuffPost Pollster. The state voted for GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 and with 15 electoral votes, it is considered a must-win for Trump.During the primary, the real estate mogul became known for goading the crowds at his events against protesters, many of whom were people of color ― including by musing about beating them up. In several instances, rally attendees physically attacked demonstrators. At least one event in Chicago infiltrated by liberal demonstrators descended into an all-out violent brawl between pro-Trump and anti-Trump activists.Trump’s openly racist rhetoric has ensured that he enjoys record low support for a Republican candidate among communities of color. Among African Americans, he is trailing not only Clinton, but Green Party nominee Jill Stein and Johnson. Only 1 percent of African Americans plan to vote for him, according to HuffPost Pollster. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). A woman identifying herself as Allison Moss tried to sign up as a volunteer at Feingold’s office in Madison, Wisconsin, this week, claiming she had been involved in College Democrats at the University of Minnesota. But after some vetting turned up suspicious information, the campaign brought Moss back in on Wednesday to ask her questions about her background. Moss actually appears to be Allison Maass, a former correspondent for Campus Reform whose author page says she “exposes liberal bias and abuse in the Land of 10,000 Lakes.” The group is a project of the Leadership Institute, an organization committed to building up conservative activists that spawned provocateur James O’Keefe and his Project Veritas. Maass initially tried to deny to the Feingold campaign that she was a wolf in sheep’s clothing, but eventually simply stopped answering questions: FEINGOLD CAMPAIGN: Can you tell us if you’re working for anyone in particular?Campus Reform said Maass is no longer affiliated with the group, and a call to the phone number she provided to the Feingold campaign was not returned. Project Veritas has said it does not reveal the identify of its operatives. But this isn’t the first time Maass has attempted to infiltrate a campaign.After The Huffington Post reported on the Feingold infiltration attempt in Wisconsin, two former Sanders campaign staffers immediately recognized Maass as the woman who tried to do the same thing in Nevada. Jordan Barbeau and John Gagain Jr. said they confronted Maass when she tried to volunteer at their headquarters in Las Vegas ahead of the February caucuses. Maass, who also used a fake name in February, said she was from the Bay Area and flew out with a friend to help Sanders win, Barbeau told HuffPost. She first noticed something was amiss when Maass provided not a California phone number, but a New York one ― just as she did to the Feingold campaign. “It seemed weird to me that she had a New York phone number when she had been telling me she was a California native, and I’m from the Bay Area and I’ve lived in New York,” Barbeau told HuffPost Friday. “She didn’t seem to want to talk about it and was weirdly vague. It just seemed odd to me.”Maass, who had brought along a friend, was particularly interested in issues of voter registration ― particularly whom the Sanders staffers were trying to get to caucus. “She was asking things like, ‘Do you have to show ID? What if you’re out of state?’ ‘What if you just moved here?’ She was asking various staff whether they were from Nevada, whether they were from other states, whether they were going to be caucusing in Nevada. ... She was asking these questions over and over again of multiple staffers and multiple volunteers, and that’s what really threw up the red flag,” Barbeau said.Barbeau added that the campaign policy was that people who did not live in Nevada prior to being hired by the campaign could not caucus there. Staffers were on alert because O’Keefe operatives had earlier showed up at Sanders’ New Hampshire offices. Maass came back to Sanders’ Vegas office to volunteer again later in the week. This time, Gagain approached her and asked her why she was there. According to Gagain, she initially tried to claim she was with the campaign ― until he informed her that he was with the campaign and didn’t know her. She then claimed she knew people there, throwing out random first names of people who didn’t exist. Gagain then encouraged her to leave, snapping a photo of her on her way out: The man sitting in the chair in the burgundy shirt appears to be Christian Hartsock, a conservative filmmaker who has worked with O’Keefe on his stings. Hartsock did not immediately return a request for comment. Maass was also involved in an undercover sting attempt against Hillary Clinton last year, trying to entrap supporters in Iowa. She and two other women tried to pass a cash donation to Clinton volunteers and asked whether they could refuse to register voters who weren’t Clinton supporters. (The answer was no.) In March, one of O’Keefe’s plots went astray when he called up the liberal Open Society Institute and left a voice message under the name “Victor Kesh,” saying he was a Hungarian-American man representing a foundation. The problem was that O’Keefe forgot to hang up the phone before he proceeded to talk about his plot with his colleague. This piece has been updated with information about Hartsock."

He now holds eight Olympic medals, all of them gold.Bolt failed to beat his own world record of 19.19 seconds set in 2009, but snagged first place regardless with a time of 19.78 seconds. Andre De Grasse of Canada came in second with 20.02, and Christophe Lemaitre of France won the bronze with a time of 20.12.Bolt, often dubbed the “fastest man on earth,” has been credited with reviving a dying sport with his charisma and unprecedented speed, becoming a legend on the track and an international superstar.In Rio, he’s retained his legendary status of being infinitely photographable. Earlier this week, his grin became a meme during his semifinal race of the 200-meter race. The Jamaican let out a good-natured laugh while crossing the finish line alongside Canadian Andre De Grasse, who appeared to try and pass Bolt.Earlier this month, the 29-year-old confirmed Rio would be his last Olympics.“Yes, this is the last Olympics for sure, I have done everything, and have proven myself,” he told reporters at a press conference.Bolt has the chance to win one last medal during the men’s 4x100-meter relay on Friday. If the Jamaican team wins, his triple-double will be upgraded to an unimaginable triple-triple."

19,SPORTS,Brazilian Officials Say U.S. Swimmers Should Face Charges For Fabricating Rio Robbery [UPDATE],Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ryan-lochte-indicted_us_57b639a8e4b03d5136876a1e,The swimmers' account of a late-night robbery unraveled when video footage contradicted their claim.,2016-08-19,"Journalists surround American Olympic swimmers Gunnar Bentz, left, and Jack Conger, center, as they leave the police station at Rio International airport early Thursday Aug. 18, 2016. The two were taken off their flight from Brazil to the U.S. on Wednesday by local authorities amid an investigation into a reported robbery targeting Ryan Lochte and his teammates. According to their lawyer they will not be allowed to leave Brazil until they provide testimony about the robbery.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Brazilian authorities have recommended American swimmers Ryan Lochte and James Feigen face charges of false reporting of a crime, according to reports Thursday from ABC News and Brazilian outlet Globo News.Lochte and Feigen, along with fellow U.S. Olympic swimmers Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger, initially claimed on Sunday they were robbed at gunpoint by armed men posing as police. The athletes claimed officers confronted them in their taxi while stopped at a gas station in Barra da Tijuca, a western suburb of Rio.Reports say the athletes have been “indicted” ― but while indictments in the U.S. indicate formal charges have been filed after a grand jury has determined there’s sufficient evidence to proceed, the term is used differently in Brazil. BuzzFeed Brazil notes a Brazilian “indiciamento” is a “preliminary conclusion of the investigation by police,” after which prosecutors decide whether to pursue charges and a judge decides whether to validate the case. The International Olympic Committee denied the robbery in question happened, and the swimmers’ claim soon unraveled after they gave conflicting accounts of the incident to authorities. Surveillance footage further contradicted the swimmers’ narrative and indicated they may have been drunk and disruptive. News of the situation gained traction after Lochte, 32, allegedly lied to his mother about the nature of the ordeal and she repeated his account to the press. Brazilian officials, citing surveillance footage from the gas station, said the Americans had vandalized a restroom and fought with a gas station security guard on the night of the alleged incident. The gas station owner told the O Globo newspaper he directed the swimmers to the bathroom but that at least one of them urinated on the wall instead.Reports differ on whether an armed security guard pulled a gun on the swimmers before police arrived, but Reuters reported the athletes paid for the damage on the scene in Brazilian and U.S. currency, leaving the equivalent of about $50. Lochte on Sunday described the incident to NBC’s Bill Bush Sunday as such: “The guy pulled out his gun, he cocked it, put it to my forehead and he said, ‘Get down,’ and I put my hands up, I was like, ‘Whatever.’ He took our money, he took my wallet — he left my cell phone, he left my credentials.”But on Wednesday, the 12-time Olympic medalist told Matt Lauer the gun was just pointed in his direction. Lochte also revised the lead-up to the scene, saying the swimmers had stopped at a gas station to use the bathroom when the incident occurred, after first claiming the armed men pulled them over. Bentz and Conger were pulled off their return flight home on Wednesday to be questioned by police. A Brazilian judge ordered police on Wednesday to seize Lochte and Feigen’s passports so they could be questioned, but Lochte had flown back to the U.S. Monday on a commercial flight.In a statement released Thursday night, the U.S Olympic Committee said Bentz and Conger had given statements to local officials and recently departed Rio. Feigen also gave a revised statement in hopes of reclaiming his passport, which was seized.Early Friday morning, Feigen agreed to make an $11,000 donation to a Brazilian charity in exchange for his freedom, his lawyer in Rio, Breno Melaragno Costa, announced. According to ABC News, once Feigen makes the donation to the Reaction Institute, his passport will be returned and he will be free to leave the country.The USOC said its understanding of the incident was the account given by Brazilian police: an act of vandalism at a gas station in Rio, an argument with security and the monetary payment. “The behavior of these athletes is not acceptable, nor does it represent the values of Team USA or the conduct of the vast majority of its members,” the statement from the organization said, promising to review the incident and any possible consequences for the swimmers.“On behalf of the United States Olympic Committee, we apologize to our hosts in Rio and the people of Brazil for this distracting ordeal in the midst of what should rightly be a celebration of excellence,” it concluded.The false account from the Americans has hit a nerve with many Rio residents, who chafed at the way the foreigners fed the characterization of the city as a dangerous, crime-ridden place. Despite the mounting evidence against the swimmers’ original claims, Lochte’s lawyer on Thursday still insisted that a robbery occurred. Chief of Civil Police Fernando Veloso said in Thursday press conference that potential charges of false communication of a crime and damaging private assets were unlikely to stick since the swimmers paid for the damage and the gas station owner was not pressing charges, CNN reports.This story has been updated with a statement from the U.S. Olympic Committee and news about Feigen’s deal with authorities."

Madaya is under siege by the Syrian government, so Yaman’s family in Syria and the United States have pleaded for help from aid organizations and lawmakers so he could leave the town to get treatment elsewhere. On Friday, their prayers were finally answered as the Syrian Arab Red Crescent evacuated Yaman and 12 other children out of the besieged town and took them to Damascus for needed medical attention, Yaman’s doctor said. The news came less than 24 hours after The WorldPost first reported on Yaman’s condition. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent said in a tweet that it was evacuating a total of “36 humanitarian cases” from Madaya and two government-held towns, Kafraya and Fuaa, in northwestern province of Idlib.A local Syrian doctor, Mohamed Darwich, who had diagnosed Yaman, told The WorldPost that Yaman was among those evacuated to Damascus to receive treatment, along with children suffering from malnutrition and two babies with blood poisoning, according to AFP. Yaman’s uncle, Yousif Jabir, who lives in Allentown, Pennsylvania, has been appealing to local organizations for help. He said he was overcome with emotion at the news. “I am not able to express what I want to say from my heart and how much gratitude I have,” Jabir said. Yaman’s mother, Khawala Jabir, said Friday from Madaya that she only wished she could go with her son to Damascus. “But I am very thankful,” she said.For Khawala Jabir and others in Madaya, a rural town on the outskirts of Damascus, starvation and a severe lack of medical and humanitarian aid are a part of daily life. An estimated 40,000 residents have been affected by food and medicine shortages in the town. The starvation and blockades persists despite multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions aimed at ensuring the delivery of aid to those in need, regardless of who controls the territory.There are 4.5 million people who live in regions of Syria that are hard to reach for aid groups, 400,000 of whom live in besieged areas, according to the United Nations."
