The reason for its return to the fold remains murky, but Jamaat also never specifically disavowed Islamic State.Only last week, Jamaat was added to the United States’ list of global terrorists, triggering sanctions.Baluchistan, which borders Afghanistan, is home to many militant groups, most notably sectarian outfits who have launched a campaign of suicide bombings and assassinations of ethnic Hazaras - Persian-speaking Shi’ites who mostly emigrated from Afghanistan and are a small minority of the Shi’ite population in Sunni-majority Pakistan.“Many groups based in Baluchistan have an anti-Shia agenda, so they find ideological linkages with ISIS,” said a military official who was based in Quetta until 2015.“But is ISIS present there to a degree that they can carry out this kind of well-planned, pre-meditated attack? I don’t think that is possible.”"

Last week a State Department spokesman said Washington was evaluating new documents it had received.The 75-year-old Gulen, who built up a network of schools, charities and businesses in Turkey and abroad over decades, denies any involvement in the coup and has condemned it. He has also accused Erdogan of using the coup to amass greater powers.“POLITICAL DECISION”“Whether the U.S. extradites Gulen or not this will be a political decision,” Bozdag said. “If he is not extradited, Turkey will have been sacrificed for a terrorist.”A recent opinion poll showed two thirds of Turks agree with their president that Gulen was behind the coup plot. Turkey has been holding almost daily mass rallies since July 15 in support of democracy and the government and against the plotters.Authorities have suspended, detained or put under investigation tens of thousands of people in the armed forces, the judiciary, civil service and elsewhere since the coup, in which a faction of the military commandeered warplanes, helicopters and tanks in an attempt to topple the government.On Tuesday Bozdag put the number of people now formally arrested awaiting trial at 16,000, adding that a further 6,000 detainees were still being processed. Another 7,668 people are under investigation but have not been detained, he said.Since the abortive putsch, pro-government papers have been awash with conspiracy theories accusing the United States and the CIA of being the masterminds. Turkish officials privately said such reports do not reflect Ankara’s formal stance.One paper said the attempted power grab was financed by the CIA and directed by a retired U.S. army general using a cell in Afghanistan while another claims CIA agents used an island hotel off Istanbul as a nerve center for the plot.Echoing Erdogan’s criticism of the West, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim on Tuesday repeated a pledge to bring Gulen back to Turkey.“That terrorist leader will come to Turkey and pay for what he did. We will hold him accountable for the blood of our martyrs and veterans,” Yildirim told a meeting of his ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party in parliament.“That religious, impudent, lying, bloody murdering nothing will be surely held accountable.”NATO member Turkey hosts American troops and warplanes at its Incirlik Air Base, an important staging area for the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State militants in neighboring Iraq and Syria.The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford tried to soothe strained ties with Turkey during a visit to Incirlik and Ankara just over a week ago. In Ankara he inspected the damage inflicted by the plotters’ fighter jets on the Turkish parliament building.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is expected to visit Turkey on Aug. 24.Turkish authorities have said the country’s intelligence service has cracked into several smartphone messaging apps that Gulen’s followers used to communicate with each other in the years ahead of the coup attempt and was able to trace tens of thousands of people from the group.A senior Turkish official said Turkey’s intelligence agency has identified at least 56,000 operatives of Gulen’s network after cracked a little-known smartphone messaging app called ByLock, which he said the group began using in 2014. By this year, Turkish intelligence were able to map their network.“Our assessment is that 150,000 unique operatives used ByLock to communicate with others,” the official said. The group had also used another app called Eagle which could be disguised as other popular instant messaging apps such as Whatsapp and Tango, he added.“We assess that Eagle was used by operatives to share various operational details as well as during the planning stage of the July 15 coup attempt,” the official said, adding that the Gulen network continued to use Eagle.

5,POLITICS,Groundbreaking Lawsuit Targets ‘Extortionist’ Cities Near Ferguson That Lock Poor People In Cages,Mariah Stewart and Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawsuit-extortionist-ferguson-municipal-courts_us_57a8e636e4b06adc11f0f0c9,"Cities outside St. Louis have created ""a modern day police state and debtors’ prison scheme that has no place in American society today.""",2016-08-09,"Demonstrators march to mark the first anniversary of the death of Michael Brown on August 7, 2015, in Ferguson, Missouri.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57aa646d1700002600c7237f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ST. LOUIS ― Civil rights lawyers sued 13 St. Louis-area cities in federal court on Tuesday, alleging they violated the constitutional rights of poor people by locking them in squalid jail cells in connection with minor traffic infractions ― a practice that contributed to the tension that boiled over in Ferguson two years ago after a police officer shot an 18-year-old to death.The lawsuit, filed on the two-year anniversary of the killing of Michael Brown, targets the city of St. Ann and 12 smaller municipalities ― some with just a few hundred residents ― that use St. Ann’s jail to hold municipal debtors under what the lawsuit calls “inhumane” conditions.Brown’s death helped bring attention to a rigged municipal courts system in St. Louis County that allowed municipalities to use their courts to pad city coffers rather than administer justice. An in-depth investigation by the Justice Department revealed a policing and court system in Ferguson that treated residents as “potential offenders and sources of revenue” rather than constituents to be protected, resulting in a recent agreement to reform the city’s policing practices. Nearby municipalities have engaged in the very same unconstitutional practices, according to the lawsuit.The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, represents a broad challenge the fractured municipal court system in St. Louis County and has the potential to help bring about widespread changes in a region where municipalities have treated their courts as cash generators.ArchCity Defenders, a civil rights organization in St. Louis that has aggressively challenged the region’s municipal courts, and Arnold & Porter, a Washington-based law firm, filed the suit on behalf of 13 people they say have been “terrorized” by the municipalities. The municipalities operated a “modern day police state and debtors’ prison scheme that has no place in American society today,” the suit says.“I’ve never encountered anything like this,” said Robert Weiner, a partner at Arnold & Porter. His remark echoed a comment by the head of the Police Executive Research Forum, who said the “dysfunctional” system in St. Louis County was unlike anything he’d seen. The suit, which also named the cities of Edmundson, Normandy, Cool Valley, Velda City, Beverly Hills, Pagedale, Calverton Park, St. John, Bel Ridge, Wellston, Velda Village Hills, and Bellefontaine Neighbors, alleges:Defendants have abused the legal system to bestow a patina of legitimacy on what is, in reality, extortion. If private parties had created and implemented this scheme, enforced it by threatening and imposing indefinite incarceration, and milked poor families of millions of dollars, the law would punish them as extortionists, or even racketeers, and the community would take steps to prevent them from exploiting the most vulnerable of its members. These predatory practices are no more legitimate ― and indeed, are more outrageous ― when perpetrated under color of law.The lawsuit accuses the municipalities of operating “de facto debtors prisons” used “as a tool to cow poor people into financing municipal government.” The system places poor defendants into a “Kafkaesque web of indignities and incarceration that plunge the victim ever deeper into poverty,” the suit says.Inmates incarcerated by St. Ann, the suit alleges, are held under horrific conditions that include overcrowded cells, “reused” blankets, “disgusting and unsanitary” mattresses, and “unhealthy and nearly inedible” food. Inmates were not allowed to shower until they had been held at the jail for a week, the lawsuit says, and trash piles in cells gave off a “very pungent odor.” One legally blind plaintiff alleges officers refused to allow her to keep her glasses. Another says she was denied her medications, and that guards called her “crazy” and an “African child.” Yet another says she was held in a cell with a schizophrenic inmate announcing she wanted to kill someone.Blake Strode, a St. Louis native who attended Harvard Law, interned at the Justice Department and now works for ArchCity Defenders, said there’s been a misconception in recent months that the problems in St. Louis County municipal courts have been addressed. In reality, he said, it’s been “business as usual” for many cities in the region.“This is really a widespread, structural problem in the region, and so we thought we needed a more widespread, systematic attack on that practice,” Strode said in an interview. “Our goal is not to bankrupt every city in St. Louis County, but our clients have suffered serious constitutional violations, and they’re owed something for that. So our priority is to make the case for our clients, to push for the policy changes, and to make sure that they are compensated for the losses they’ve suffered.”By imprisoning those who can’t afford to pay fines, the municipalities have violated rights of due process and equal protection guaranteed under the 14th Amendment, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit also alleges violations of the Fourth Amendment because the municipalities issued warrants without probable cause, as well as violations for the Sixth Amendment due to failure to provide for effective assistance of counsel.ArchCity Defenders recently reached a settlement of nearly $5 million with the city of Jennings in a similar lawsuit filed on behalf of an estimated 2,000 people who had been jailed over unpaid debt. Jennings also agreed to significant changes, including an end to the cash bail system. A lawsuit against Ferguson is still pending. A plaintiff in the new class-action case, Donya Pierce, was previously part of a lawsuit against the tiny city of Velda City, which agreed to end its fixed cash bail system in 2015. An organization called Equal Justice Under Law has filed lawsuits against debtors’ prison practices in several other states and had success in stopping unconstitutional bail practices.Several municipalities named in the lawsuit have imprisoned the lead plaintiff, Quinton Thomas, a 28-year old factory worker, in connection with minor driving-related offenses like running a stop sign, lacking proof of insurance, and improper vehicle registration. Thomas was issued hundreds of dollars in fines in Normandy, a city neighboring Ferguson that shares many of the same issues with using its municipal court to generate revenue. More than 40 percent of Normandy’s revenue came from fines and fees.  Thomas was fined more than $600 from a traffic stop in Normandy. He said he tried to explain to a judge that he could neither afford to pay the full amount, nor the minimum payment of $100 the city was demanding. When he asked if he could pay $50 toward the fine, the judge said no, he said. “They told me if I couldn’t do $100, they were going to put a warrant out for me,” Thomas said in an interview. When Thomas was pulled over in 2013, he was arrested on that outstanding warrant from Normandy, as well as on warrants from other cities. Officers took him to jail in St. Ann, where Thomas said everything ― the mattresses, the walls, the floors ― were so dirty he didn’t want to touch anything.“It was just nasty,” he said. Meals, the lawsuit alleges, consisted of a “bologna sandwich (with greenish meat and hard bread), apple sauce, and black coffee.”Thomas said he once had to sit in jail for several days just to wait for a direct deposit into his bank account that would allow him to pay the court. He said he lost two jobs because of the time he spent behind bars. He said he was seldom allowed to appear before a judge after being arrested.“I lost my job and they impounded my vehicle,” Thomas said. “I couldn’t go to work. I couldn’t get a job because a lot of jobs be so far out and you need a car.” Thomas is employed again, but said he fears being pulled over and thrown into a cage every time he gets inside his car. He’s currently paying the city of St. John, which claims Thomas owes more than $500 on what started out as a ticket for less than $100. His offense? A parking violation.“I got it down to like $300, but it was all the way up to $560 all for a parking ticket,” he said.Although the White House and Obama administration have tried to put a spotlight on excessive fines and fees, organizations like ArchCity Defenders and Equal Justice Under Law have been effective in using federal lawsuits to force change. Some advocates have called for the Justice Department to prosecute judges and public officials who have engaged in conspiracies to deprive people of their constitutional rights en masse as part of an effort to raise revenue.Earlier this year, the Justice Department reminded local courts that some practices that they may consider a “routine administrative matter” ― like forcing defendants to pre-pay a bond or bail before they can schedule a court date ― are unconstitutional. Locking up someone simply because they aren’t able to afford paying a fine, without taking their financial circumstances into account, is a blatant constitutional violation, yet continues to happen with regularity. That won’t change, some advocates say, until the feds start locking up municipal judges. Missouri lawmakers attempted to rein in municipalities that relied heavily upon municipal court revenue last year, passing bipartisan legislation that lowered the percentage of their budgets that cities were allowed to fund through court fines and fees. That percentage was trimmed from 30 percent to 20 percent statewide, and to 12.5 percent in St. Louis County. But several cities in St. Louis County filed suit challenging the limits, and a circuit judge struck down the county cap because it targeted specific municipalities.St. Ann kept its revenue flowing after a major mall closed by operating a highway speed trap near the St. Louis airport. St. Ann earned 37 percent of its revenue from court fines and fees in 2013, according to a 2014 report from state-appointed research group Better Together.Black drivers in St. Ann were nearly 10 percent more likely than whites to get arrested in traffic stops, a disparity similar to the other cities named in the lawsuit.Nicole Hudson, who worked with the Ferguson Commission, said the lawsuit has the potential to force change rather than wait for those in power to move at their own speed.“Having a lawsuit like this that is swinging for the fences in this way is going to move the needle on what change looks like and what the universe looks like for everybody,” Hudson said.Bradley Jiles, 24, said he was strip-searched and forced to sit in a restraint chair for 24 hours while in the Hillsdale jail. Jiles has been jailed more than 10 times in five years for municipal ordinance violations.Meredith Walker, a 47-year-old mother of two, has been jailed at least 10 times and said she paid more than $15,000 in fees over five years ― even though she said she hasn’t been ticketed for a moving violation in more than 15 years. Walker even changed her appearance, according to the lawsuit, “because she discovered that she was stopped by the Defendant Municipalities’ police officers more often when she had dreadlocks in her hair and appeared more masculine.”Ronald Tucker, 51, was pulled over in 2014 because his car was smoking. The officer ran his name, discovered old traffic warrants from Cool Valley, and took him into custody.Cool Valley covers less than 0.5 square mile, with a population of just over 1,000 people. A few years back, it disbanded its 10-person police department in part because it ate up more than half of the city’s entire budget. Tucker, who said he skipped court dates on the old case after he lost his job and feared a judge would lock him up, was incarcerated in Cool Valley for three days in what he called a “dog cage.” Left unsupervised in a holding cell without a bathroom, he sometimes got desperate. “I was in a cage with no restroom and had two more females in the cell with me and I had to use the restroom real bad,” Tucker said. “I urinated on the floor. I mean, I wasn’t going to do it on myself. I’m a grown man.” Tucker said he spent several hours locked to a bench before he was booked, which he said was one of the worst experiences of his life. Later, when he suffered an asthma attack, he said jail attendants refused to allow his girlfriend to bring him an inhaler.While bail is supposed to be set by a judge who evaluates an individual’s circumstances, there was no judicial involvement in Tucker’s incarceration. Tucker said police officers tried to negotiate with him.“They said if someone come up with $150 or $175, we’ll let you go,” Tucker told HuffPost. Tucker said he couldn’t reach anyone for money because he only was allowed one five-minute phone call per day.Tucker spent three days at Cool Valley before being transferred to the St. Louis County Justice Center, where he finally received an inhaler and was bonded out for almost $400. But Tucker’s time served was never applied to his outstanding fines, and a warrant for him remained outstanding in Cool Valley.“I wouldn’t want to see anybody else be treated like me and those females when we were in that cage,” Tucker said. “I don’t have a problem with the law. They have a right to pull us over and make sure we’re right. But if you going to lock me up, lock me up for something major ― not just a ticket.”Jailing a human being places them in danger, and hundreds of people die in U.S. jails each year. A system that confines individuals not because they pose a threat to public safety, but simply because they owe the government money, should not be accepted, said ArchCity’s Strode.“I think we have a tendency and a sort of instinct to rationalize these systems that we all come to rely on, and to think that they must be operating in a way that is just and fair, or that it makes some sort of rational sense,” said Strode. “On the most basic level, what we have here is a system in which when you receive a traffic ticket, if you have money, there’s one system. If you don’t have money, there’s another. It’s only if you don’t have money that sitting in jail for days on end ― sometimes weeks on end ― is on the table. And that is fundamentally unjust.”Read the lawsuit:Mariah Stewart reported from St. Louis. Ryan J. Reilly reported from Washington."

His remark echoed a comment by the head of the Police Executive Research Forum, who said the “dysfunctional” system in St. Louis County was unlike anything he’d seen. The suit, which also named the cities of Edmundson, Normandy, Cool Valley, Velda City, Beverly Hills, Pagedale, Calverton Park, St. John, Bel Ridge, Wellston, Velda Village Hills, and Bellefontaine Neighbors, alleges:Defendants have abused the legal system to bestow a patina of legitimacy on what is, in reality, extortion. If private parties had created and implemented this scheme, enforced it by threatening and imposing indefinite incarceration, and milked poor families of millions of dollars, the law would punish them as extortionists, or even racketeers, and the community would take steps to prevent them from exploiting the most vulnerable of its members. These predatory practices are no more legitimate ― and indeed, are more outrageous ― when perpetrated under color of law.The lawsuit accuses the municipalities of operating “de facto debtors prisons” used “as a tool to cow poor people into financing municipal government.” The system places poor defendants into a “Kafkaesque web of indignities and incarceration that plunge the victim ever deeper into poverty,” the suit says.Inmates incarcerated by St. Ann, the suit alleges, are held under horrific conditions that include overcrowded cells, “reused” blankets, “disgusting and unsanitary” mattresses, and “unhealthy and nearly inedible” food. Inmates were not allowed to shower until they had been held at the jail for a week, the lawsuit says, and trash piles in cells gave off a “very pungent odor.” One legally blind plaintiff alleges officers refused to allow her to keep her glasses. Another says she was denied her medications, and that guards called her “crazy” and an “African child.” Yet another says she was held in a cell with a schizophrenic inmate announcing she wanted to kill someone.Blake Strode, a St. Louis native who attended Harvard Law, interned at the Justice Department and now works for ArchCity Defenders, said there’s been a misconception in recent months that the problems in St. Louis County municipal courts have been addressed. In reality, he said, it’s been “business as usual” for many cities in the region.“This is really a widespread, structural problem in the region, and so we thought we needed a more widespread, systematic attack on that practice,” Strode said in an interview. “Our goal is not to bankrupt every city in St. Louis County, but our clients have suffered serious constitutional violations, and they’re owed something for that. So our priority is to make the case for our clients, to push for the policy changes, and to make sure that they are compensated for the losses they’ve suffered.”By imprisoning those who can’t afford to pay fines, the municipalities have violated rights of due process and equal protection guaranteed under the 14th Amendment, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit also alleges violations of the Fourth Amendment because the municipalities issued warrants without probable cause, as well as violations for the Sixth Amendment due to failure to provide for effective assistance of counsel.ArchCity Defenders recently reached a settlement of nearly $5 million with the city of Jennings in a similar lawsuit filed on behalf of an estimated 2,000 people who had been jailed over unpaid debt. Jennings also agreed to significant changes, including an end to the cash bail system. A lawsuit against Ferguson is still pending. A plaintiff in the new class-action case, Donya Pierce, was previously part of a lawsuit against the tiny city of Velda City, which agreed to end its fixed cash bail system in 2015. An organization called Equal Justice Under Law has filed lawsuits against debtors’ prison practices in several other states and had success in stopping unconstitutional bail practices.Several municipalities named in the lawsuit have imprisoned the lead plaintiff, Quinton Thomas, a 28-year old factory worker, in connection with minor driving-related offenses like running a stop sign, lacking proof of insurance, and improper vehicle registration. Thomas was issued hundreds of dollars in fines in Normandy, a city neighboring Ferguson that shares many of the same issues with using its municipal court to generate revenue. More than 40 percent of Normandy’s revenue came from fines and fees.  Thomas was fined more than $600 from a traffic stop in Normandy. He said he tried to explain to a judge that he could neither afford to pay the full amount, nor the minimum payment of $100 the city was demanding. When he asked if he could pay $50 toward the fine, the judge said no, he said. “They told me if I couldn’t do $100, they were going to put a warrant out for me,” Thomas said in an interview. When Thomas was pulled over in 2013, he was arrested on that outstanding warrant from Normandy, as well as on warrants from other cities. Officers took him to jail in St. Ann, where Thomas said everything ― the mattresses, the walls, the floors ― were so dirty he didn’t want to touch anything.“It was just nasty,” he said. Meals, the lawsuit alleges, consisted of a “bologna sandwich (with greenish meat and hard bread), apple sauce, and black coffee.”Thomas said he once had to sit in jail for several days just to wait for a direct deposit into his bank account that would allow him to pay the court. He said he lost two jobs because of the time he spent behind bars. He said he was seldom allowed to appear before a judge after being arrested.“I lost my job and they impounded my vehicle,” Thomas said. “I couldn’t go to work. I couldn’t get a job because a lot of jobs be so far out and you need a car.” Thomas is employed again, but said he fears being pulled over and thrown into a cage every time he gets inside his car. He’s currently paying the city of St. John, which claims Thomas owes more than $500 on what started out as a ticket for less than $100. His offense? A parking violation.“I got it down to like $300, but it was all the way up to $560 all for a parking ticket,” he said.Although the White House and Obama administration have tried to put a spotlight on excessive fines and fees, organizations like ArchCity Defenders and Equal Justice Under Law have been effective in using federal lawsuits to force change. Some advocates have called for the Justice Department to prosecute judges and public officials who have engaged in conspiracies to deprive people of their constitutional rights en masse as part of an effort to raise revenue.Earlier this year, the Justice Department reminded local courts that some practices that they may consider a “routine administrative matter” ― like forcing defendants to pre-pay a bond or bail before they can schedule a court date ― are unconstitutional. Locking up someone simply because they aren’t able to afford paying a fine, without taking their financial circumstances into account, is a blatant constitutional violation, yet continues to happen with regularity. That won’t change, some advocates say, until the feds start locking up municipal judges. Missouri lawmakers attempted to rein in municipalities that relied heavily upon municipal court revenue last year, passing bipartisan legislation that lowered the percentage of their budgets that cities were allowed to fund through court fines and fees. That percentage was trimmed from 30 percent to 20 percent statewide, and to 12.5 percent in St. Louis County. But several cities in St. Louis County filed suit challenging the limits, and a circuit judge struck down the county cap because it targeted specific municipalities.St. Ann kept its revenue flowing after a major mall closed by operating a highway speed trap near the St. Louis airport. St. Ann earned 37 percent of its revenue from court fines and fees in 2013, according to a 2014 report from state-appointed research group Better Together.Black drivers in St. Ann were nearly 10 percent more likely than whites to get arrested in traffic stops, a disparity similar to the other cities named in the lawsuit.Nicole Hudson, who worked with the Ferguson Commission, said the lawsuit has the potential to force change rather than wait for those in power to move at their own speed.“Having a lawsuit like this that is swinging for the fences in this way is going to move the needle on what change looks like and what the universe looks like for everybody,” Hudson said.Bradley Jiles, 24, said he was strip-searched and forced to sit in a restraint chair for 24 hours while in the Hillsdale jail. Jiles has been jailed more than 10 times in five years for municipal ordinance violations.Meredith Walker, a 47-year-old mother of two, has been jailed at least 10 times and said she paid more than $15,000 in fees over five years ― even though she said she hasn’t been ticketed for a moving violation in more than 15 years. Walker even changed her appearance, according to the lawsuit, “because she discovered that she was stopped by the Defendant Municipalities’ police officers more often when she had dreadlocks in her hair and appeared more masculine.”Ronald Tucker, 51, was pulled over in 2014 because his car was smoking. The officer ran his name, discovered old traffic warrants from Cool Valley, and took him into custody.Cool Valley covers less than 0.5 square mile, with a population of just over 1,000 people. A few years back, it disbanded its 10-person police department in part because it ate up more than half of the city’s entire budget. Tucker, who said he skipped court dates on the old case after he lost his job and feared a judge would lock him up, was incarcerated in Cool Valley for three days in what he called a “dog cage.” Left unsupervised in a holding cell without a bathroom, he sometimes got desperate. “I was in a cage with no restroom and had two more females in the cell with me and I had to use the restroom real bad,” Tucker said. “I urinated on the floor. I mean, I wasn’t going to do it on myself. I’m a grown man.” Tucker said he spent several hours locked to a bench before he was booked, which he said was one of the worst experiences of his life. Later, when he suffered an asthma attack, he said jail attendants refused to allow his girlfriend to bring him an inhaler.While bail is supposed to be set by a judge who evaluates an individual’s circumstances, there was no judicial involvement in Tucker’s incarceration. Tucker said police officers tried to negotiate with him.“They said if someone come up with $150 or $175, we’ll let you go,” Tucker told HuffPost. Tucker said he couldn’t reach anyone for money because he only was allowed one five-minute phone call per day.Tucker spent three days at Cool Valley before being transferred to the St. Louis County Justice Center, where he finally received an inhaler and was bonded out for almost $400. But Tucker’s time served was never applied to his outstanding fines, and a warrant for him remained outstanding in Cool Valley.“I wouldn’t want to see anybody else be treated like me and those females when we were in that cage,” Tucker said. “I don’t have a problem with the law. They have a right to pull us over and make sure we’re right. But if you going to lock me up, lock me up for something major ― not just a ticket.”Jailing a human being places them in danger, and hundreds of people die in U.S. jails each year. A system that confines individuals not because they pose a threat to public safety, but simply because they owe the government money, should not be accepted, said ArchCity’s Strode.“I think we have a tendency and a sort of instinct to rationalize these systems that we all come to rely on, and to think that they must be operating in a way that is just and fair, or that it makes some sort of rational sense,” said Strode. “On the most basic level, what we have here is a system in which when you receive a traffic ticket, if you have money, there’s one system. If you don’t have money, there’s another. It’s only if you don’t have money that sitting in jail for days on end ― sometimes weeks on end ― is on the table. And that is fundamentally unjust.”Read the lawsuit:Mariah Stewart reported from St. Louis. Ryan J. Reilly reported from Washington."

As of Tuesday, no arrests have been made in that case. Early said Monday that there is “nothing at this point” to connect Marcotte’s death to Vetrano’s, the Boston Globe reported.Marcotte was working as an account manager for Google, according to her LinkedIn profile. In a statement, a spokesperson for the tech company expressed shock and sadness over her tragic death.“Vanessa Marcotte was a much loved member of the Google team, working in our New York office for the last year and a half, and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work, and love of Boston sports,” the statement obtained by the Associated Press read. “We are deeply shocked and saddened, and our thoughts are with her family and friends.”Authorities are urging the public to report anything suspicious to the Massachusetts State Police Tipline at 508-453-7589; State Police Detectives assigned to the Worcester County District Attorney’s Office 508-832-9124 or the Princeton Police at 978-464-2928."

It’s an absurd, incredibly dangerous argument to make, CNN’s Brian Stelter pointed out Sunday, adding that journalists must do a better job of questioning Trump about his claims.“Interviewers, even ones who support the person they’re interviewing, have an obligation to probe further and push back when a candidate says something dangerous,” Stelter said. “And this is dangerous.”Stelter specifically called out Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity for failing to press Trump on the matter when they had the chance. “Journalists cannot just play these soundbites, quote these claims, and then move on to the next subject,” Stelter said. “We can’t just let it seep into the discourse like it’s normal. We have to stop and fact check and contextualize.”That burden falls on all journalists, regardless of which candidate they personally support, he added. Unsupported claims that seek to undermine our entire political process must be countered.Perhaps Trump could learn a thing or two from Al Gore, who gracefully conceded in 2000, amid an historically anomalous vote, ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, for the sake of American democracy.“Let there be no doubt: While I strongly disagree with the court’s decision, I accept it,” Gore said at the time. “And tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

But in a scripted message, he offered a few variations on his previously proposed economic policies, along with a milder version of the dire message about a declining America that he’s been serving up for months.Trump’s campaign on Monday pulled down his old tax plan from his website, and replaced it with the text of his Detroit speech. The original plan would have capped income taxes at 25 percent and long-term capital gains and dividends at 20 percent, while adding $12 trillion to the national debt.In its place, Trump offered the same basic ideas, with some slightly shifted details. More details, he said, would be provided “in the coming weeks.” He also offered some of his usual refrains: Trump lamented that the country had strayed from an “America First” policy; bemoaned that skyscrapers had been built in Beijing and refugees had been accepted into the U.S.; and called the unemployment rate a hoax.“All of our policies should be geared towards keeping wealth inside the United States,” he said.Trump is struggling in the polls after spending the last several days insulting the Gold Star family and refusing to endorse prominent Republicans for office. On Friday, he rolled out an economic advisory team that was full of white men named Steve, ardent free trade advocates and campaign donors. While the group lacked the actual economists and tax experts you’d expect to develop a typical Republican presidential candidate’s policy plan, it had people who could at least be trusted to deliver a pretty good imitation of one.The campaign hoped Monday’s economic policy announcement would offer something of a turning point. Trump’s speech contained plenty of good news for millionaires: He called for eliminating the estate tax, cutting regulations “massively,” halting any new federal regulation and cutting the business tax rate to 15 percent from just under 40 percent.Trump did seem to offer a tiny concession to fiscal sanity by saying he would lower individual tax rates to a simplified system of 12, 25 and 33 percent. The 33 percent would be a big break for top earners, who are currently taxed at a rate of 39.5 percent. But it’s also a tax increase from Trump’s initially proposed rates of 10, 20 and 25 percent, which were far beyond what any Republican presidential candidate was proposing.For good measure, Trump tossed in a child care deduction that would help wealthy people lower their tax bills, while not actually helping people who can’t afford child care. In other words, for all the talk of Trump’s unique appeal to disaffected white men without college degrees, his new economic policy offers a heaping dose of what purportedly alienated them.Trump’s speech didn’t include some of his most common rhetoric: racist and xenophobic threats that have engaged his base. He left out his trademark promise to implement huge new tariffs on goods imported from China and Mexico by American companies, as well as his astronomically expensive plans to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants, ban Muslims from entering the country and build a wall across the nation’s southern border.Why would Trump fail to talk about his core economic policies in a speech that was supposed to morph his campaign into something more moderate and acceptable? A Bloomberg News section headline provided a terse explanation: “Donors Watching.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

A friend told BuzzFeed News that Gaitan was no longer comfortable with “the indefensible things being said about immigrants.”Trump’s offensive comments about the Hispanic community, which began on day one of his presidential campaign, have put Latino Republicans in a bind. For years, the GOP has tried to bring more Hispanic voters into the party. The party’s post-2012 “autopsy report” recommended strategies to help the GOP become more inclusive of people of color.But Trump’s regular attacks on Latinos, immigrants, Muslims and other groups have jeopardized those efforts, with his approval rating among Hispanic voters hovering at an abysmal 13 percent, according to a recent survey from the Latino Victory Fund, a group that mobilizes Hispanic voters and political candidates. That same survey found that 85 percent of respondents believe that Trump’s candidacy has worsened Latino voters’ perception of the GOP. Because of this, many top Latinos within the Republican Party have been reluctant to support Trump. Some, like Gaitan, have left their leadership positions because they can’t tolerate Trump as the party’s standard bearer and refuse to defend him in an official capacity.Earlier this year, Ruth Guerra resigned as the Republican National Committee’s director for Hispanic media relations because she became increasingly frustrated with Trump’s remarks. Her replacement, Helen Aguirre Ferré, had also denounced Trump, but still took the job.Gaitan’s new role will be at the LIBRE Initiative, an organization funded by the billionaire Koch brothers that woos conservative Latinos through its focus on free markets. The organization has also been critical of Trump’s rhetoric and tone. Director Daniel Garza told NPR that he worries the GOP presidential nominee has made his group’s efforts more difficult.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The two other officers who shot Johansen testified against Cagle and were cleared of all wrongdoing.It is rare for officers to be convicted on any charge related to an on-duty shooting. But there has been an uptick in the number of officers charged nationwide, with 15 charged for murder or manslaughter in 2015. Over the last decade, the average hovered around five cases per year. At least five officers have been convicted on murder or manslaughter charges in state courts for on-duty shootings this year, compared to a running average of two convicted per year over the last decade. Zero officers were convicted in 2014 and 2015. Cagle’s case turned out remarkably different than those against the six officers charged in the April 2015 death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, a black man who was killed in Baltimore following a “rough ride” in a police van.Baltimore Police officers Caesar Goodson Jr., Edward Nero and Lt. Brian Rice were each acquitted of all charges in Gray’s death. On July 27, Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby dropped charges against the three officers waiting to stand trial. “Reporting misconduct, now absolutely required by our new use-of-force policy, is something that the community has a right to expect from all police officers in Baltimore,” Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said during a Monday press conference. “My team and the State’s Attorney’s team are here today to support the vast majority of police officers who routinely do the right thing day after day, and call after call.”Last year, the Baltimore Police Department received over 800 complaints dealing with excessive force, abusive language, harassment, false arrest and false imprisonment, according to the city’s Office of Civil Rights and Wage Enforcement. Kisha Brown, its director, told The Huffington Post in April that she only received 80 complaints, despite requirements that the police department send all complaints to the office. In the press conference Monday, Mosby echoed Davis, saying the department is moving toward upholding the “sacred oath” of policing. “We believe under this police commissioner, this will become the rule rather than the exception, and this case highlights our commitment together to work with one another,” she said. “Commissioner Davis and his staff are working extraordinarily hard to create the kind of police department that Baltimore residents deserve, and I thank him and all of the men and women that uphold that sacred oath.”"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) walked offstage at the GOP convention in Cleveland last month without endorsing Donald Trump, the Texas conservative and former presidential primary rival appeared to have made a grave miscalculation.The latter part of his speech, in which the senator pointedly urged delegates to “vote your conscience,” was completely drowned out by angry boos and chants in Quicken Loans Arena. Trump, the party’s nominee who had seen an advance copy of the speech, made a surprise appearance in the stands, stepping on Cruz’s big moment and whipping supporters into an even bigger frenzy.Pundits and politicians quickly pronounced that Cruz’s gambit had failed and that he had done serious damage to his political career. A CNN poll released after the speech showed his favorability rating within his own party cut nearly in half. Even his longtime billionaire benefactors, Robert Mercer and daughter Rebekah Mercer, said they were “profoundly disappointed” with his decision not to support the GOP nominee.But after a week of Trump repeatedly setting himself on fire (declining even to wait for the previous fire to go out), politicians who endorsed Trump, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), have found themselves feeling the heat, while Cruz’s decision is starting to look like the better long-term bet. The panic within the party spread so much last week that several high-profile Trump supporters reportedly began contemplating staging an “intervention” with the candidate.And Cruz, in rare fashion, has let the fire rage without adding his own gasoline. “He’s doing a remarkable job staying quiet and letting people come to that conclusion on their own,” said Amanda Carpenter, a longtime adviser to Cruz. While those close to Cruz were confident the decision not to endorse would be the right one in the end, the quickness with which it’s panning out has been a bit of a surprise. “Trump blew his own convention. While predictable, it still boggles the mind it happened,” Carpenter said. “Trump is like a tornado. You know it’s going to be devastating when it rips through your house but the aftermath is still shocking.” Cruz is well-positioned for a 2020 presidential bid should he succeed in resuscitating his image ― he took home nearly 600 delegates this cycle with the aid of an impressive grassroots organization. But he must first win re-election in 2018, and Trump has threatened repeatedly to try to take him out in a primary. CNN reported on Monday that some GOP donors have urged Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas) to jump in the race. Rep. Joaquin Castro (Texas), a prominent Democrat who represents San Antonio, has also signaled interest in running for the seat.Cruz’s anti-Trump stand got some backup on Monday, after a little-known GOP staffer announced an independent bid for president. Evan McMullin, 40, a former CIA agent and House Republican Conference policy director, isn’t expected to mount a serious candidacy ― but he could cost Trump some votes in Utah, a state that has been uniquely resistant to the brash businessman.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S. "

And a new Pew Research Center poll might help explain why.According to Pew, 6 in 10 voters say that their conversations about the 2016 election have focused on candidates’ personalities and comments, while only 32 percent say they’re talking more about policy positions. That’s not great news for Trump. After all, 67 percent of respondents say the real estate mogul does not have “the kind of personality and temperament it takes to serve effectively as president,” according to a ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sunday ― while 6 in 10 respondents say Clinton does.A Monmouth poll had similar results, finding that 67 percent of registered voters polled believe Trump lacks the right temperament to be president ― up from 61 percent in July. Once again, Clinton’s numbers show the exact opposite: Sixty-one percent say she does have the right temperament to be president, up nine percent from July.The ABC News/Washington Post and Monmouth polls are particularly significant in light of the Pew study ― perception of a candidate’s personality and temperament matters to voters.Despite Trump’s claim that he possesses “one of the great temperaments,” his consistent (and seemingly more frequent) outbursts reflect poorly on his disposition and could affect voters’ decisions.Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort says the real estate mogul is now attempting to “pivot” his campaign strategy (again) and start focusing on policy. The success of that reorientation remains to be seen.

When asked by a reporter about the African-American viewership of the comedy’s audience, Barris responded: “I will be so happy when diversity is not a word. I have the best job in the world and I am constantly having to talk about diversity. It’s ridiculous,” he said, according The Hollywood Reporter.The show-runner added that it doesn’t matter who’s watching the show, “the fact is that they’re watching it.”Yes, Barris has had to talk about diversity frequently thanks to his show. In August 2014, before the show even premiered, Barris responded to critics who questioned if the show’s title would resonate with viewers.“I think some of the controversy has been around the idea that some people think that we’re trying to define what ‘black’ is, and it couldn’t be further from the truth,” he said in an interview with The Huffington Post. “I think it’s a really inclusive word much less than an exclusionary word, in terms of [how] it really speaks towards the homogenized society we’re living in today.”During the panel discussion, Barris alluded to his previous statements and reiterated that the ABC series isn’t solely about race, and should be viewed as a family sitcom. “We’re so divisive as a community and we always have to box everything in, and I kind of feel like, isn’t it just a good family show?” he said.“It’s specifically about a black family, but don’t you see yourself in it? Don’t you see your family reflected in it? Why is that important who watches the show? Why does it matter? Why do we have to keep having these conversations? Why can’t we just look at the show for what it is and celebrate these actors?”Well said, Kenya."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a89de72a00002e004f8ee0.jpeg?ops=crop_0_163_2000_1620%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In 1981, after accepting a job offer from then-NBC producer Roger Ailes, Shelley Ross found herself in a seriously uncomfortable position. “When did you first discover you were sexy?” Ross recalls Ailes asked her, before suggesting that the two partake on what he called a “sexual alliance.”Decades later, Ross, now a television executive, is coming out as yet another woman who’s been harassed by recently ousted Fox News CEO Roger Ailes in a detailed, must-read essay on Monday for The Daily Beast.Ross’s essay is about so much more than one man’s abuse. It details the ingrained sexism and harassment that has persisted for decades in the workplace, and focuses mainly on the frequency of the issue in the media industry.Ross, whose resumé includes conducting the first televised interview with Charles Manson and various executive producer roles for ABC and CBS, wrote about the complexity of workplace harassment, as well as the complexity of the relationships amongst perpetrators and victims. Her relationship with Ailes, for example, has lasted more than three decades in both personal and professional capacities. She wrote: During the summer of 2012, Roger phoned me to say he was recommending me for a big job—to run CNN. (The job went to Jeff Zucker who then quickly took over the job of the man who hired him.) That same year, when Roger learned I was battling cancer, he sent me a giant basket from Rao’s containing six pastas and six different sauces.But, as she writes in the essay, throughout her decades-long career she was harassed by many men who she says had no idea that what they were doing could be considered “hostile.” She recalls one summer work party for which she’d gotten dressed up and done her makeup. “Suddenly, I was picked up off the ground, whirled around and thrown into a muddy pond by a staff photographer. I didn’t realize until years later that was a hostile act...I doubt if the photographer understood it was a hostile act either; we were friends,” she wrote. She also discussed the way that “sexual harassment” itself didn’t even enter the nation’s lexicon until the early ‘90s with the Anita Hill trial, before which the term was barely used, and the behavior it described was pretty much always overlooked. In October 1991 Diane Sawyer and I watched a 35-year-old law professor, Anita Hill, testify live under oath before the Senate Judiciary hearing that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her. This lack of awareness that “sexual harassment” was ― and is ― a very real issue makes the act of seeking any recourse after a powerful man has commited it that much more difficult. In her essay, Ross writes that, “it takes a lot of courage to stand up against sexual harassment.” And when we consider the way that women, like Hill, have been treated after speaking out about sexual harassment, it really doesn’t come as a surprise that women often keep their heads down and say nothing about inappropriate workplace behavior. “Much of the time, harassment has too many faces to even recognize when it is happening,” Ross wrote. “Whisper campaigns, false accusations, holding women executives to impossible standards not expected of men.”Over the last few years, though, women in the public eye have begun speaking out and even taking legal action against workplace harassment ― like the dozens of women who have accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault, pop star Kesha (who “will not just f**king be quiet and hide” from Sony producer Dr. Luke), and most recently, former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson.Carlson made waves in July by filing a sexual harassment lawsuit against Ailes. When Carlson went public with the allegations, she received a barrage of criticism. But since her lawsuit, more than 20 women have come out with similar stories about Ailes, and this morning, Carlson tweeted in support of Ross and her essay. Even as more and more women are speaking out, Ross still believes that much more needs to be done to combat sexual harassment. “No one has yet nailed the pervasiveness, the bigotry, the diminishing and oppression of over half the population in the workplace,” she wrote. “No one has nailed the ideas lost, the creativity missing, the damage done.”But it is absolutely essential that we continue to try. Read Ross’s entire piece at The Daily Beast here.If you have experienced harassment and need help, call the National Street Harassment Hotline at 855-897-5910 or the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-HOPE (4673)"

It sounds like the start of a bad joke ― and in a way, it was ― but three Green Party activists actually did walk into a McDonald’s on Saturday; specifically the McDonald’s in the University of Houston’s student center, where the far-left party had convened to nominate physician Jill Stein and human rights activist Ajamu Baraka as its presidential and vice presidential candidates. “I try not to buy things from Walmart and eat at McDonald’s,” one said, frowning, his politics laid bare by his T-shirt: “WHAT’S WRONG WITH THE USA? Capitalism and Greed | Racism (White Supremacy) | Religion.” However, most of the center’s dining options were closed for the weekend, meaning attendees faced the unappetizing option of going hungry or stomaching a tray full of corporatist, anti-worker, GMO-laden bile washed down with a McFlurry.So the attendee and a number of his compatriots cast aside their McSkepticism and made do with what was at hand ― the salad wraps appeared to be the move. It was just about the only time this weekend that members of the Green Party reconciled themselves with reality, and if the party’s convention is any indication, the Greens are not only unprepared to wage a national campaign, they can’t even get their act together enough to craft a coherent and resonant message.That’s a shame: In an election cycle where the pressing matter of global warming is an afterthought; where both candidates mostly support hydraulic fracking; where one candidate is threatening to kill the families of terrorists and the other is lobbying Henry Kissinger for an endorsement; where one is deeply indebted to Wall Street and the other is proposing a moratorium on all financial regulation, having a highly visible third-party ticket clearly articulating a progressive message wouldn’t be the worst thing for the polity.But the disorganization, borderline paranoia and participation-ribbon mentality (literally, if the press badges were to be believed) on display left little hope that the Green Party will be anything more than an unproductive nuisance through November. Even when one calibrates one’s expectations ― it’s a given that the Green Party convention will more closely resemble a gathering of nursery school music teachers than hardened political operators ― what transpired was dismaying.There was the convention’s agenda. It allotted ample time for privilege-checking and inventorying of everyone’s contributions to the dominant paradigm, but very little attention for nuts-and-bolts organizing, get-out-the-vote plotting and press strategizing. During one of the first gatherings of party officials Saturday morning, delegates spent nearly an hour on breathing exercises and aimless discussion about their “anti-oppression skills.” Participants came away knowing how to locate the “deep blue indigo tunnel” at the “throat center,” but not how to write an effective fundraising email.There was the roll call vote, a disorderly and poorly managed process that, even by the standards of this year’s sometimes raucous and discordant conventions, was an utter shit-show. When the very first delegate, a white gentleman from Alabama, stood up to deliver his state’s votes, many in the crowd booed him. “THE GREAT WHITE HOPE, HUH?” one delegate yelled.There was the convention’s disproportionate focus on America’s Native peoples ― which is not a bad thing, but most of that attention was focused on broken 19th-century treaties and not on the urgent issues that beset many Native American communities today, such as widespread drug addiction, violence against women and crumbling schools. Many contended that there is intersectionality between the oppressions of yesteryear and, say, the disproportionate number of Native peoples subject to overzealous policing. Once the country finally learns what “intersectionality” means, it’ll be sure to let President Trump know all about it.Then there was Sedinam Kinamo Christin Moyowasifza-Curry, a long-shot Green Party presidential candidate who regularly interrupted the proceedings to proclaim that the primary had been rigged against her. Anytime someone mispronounced her name or refused to repeat it in full, she would halt the proceedings with a yell. Rather than shut her down, the party secretaries typically yielded to pressure from the crowd not to muffle anyone’s voice, no matter how out of order they were. They made Reince Priebus seem like an exemplar of command and control. The ticket didn’t acquit itself terribly well during a press conference held after the convention gaveled out of session. As the convention chugged along Saturday, photos emerged on Twitter of Stein appearing beside Russian President Vladimir Putin at a dinner last December marking the anniversary of Russia Today, an English-language news outlet with close ties to the Kremlin. Video of Stein praising the event also resurfaced. It wasn’t a great look, and it wouldn’t be far-fetched to assume that the campaign, or Stein herself, would prep an answer, yet when The Huffington Post asked Stein about a Tweet in which she compared the Democratic National Committee activity depicted in the WikiLeaks dump to hackers possibly allied to the Russian government, Stein was caught off guard. “I think all of this is underhanded and sneaky,” she stammered, before proceeding to blame the media for not covering the leaks enough. Baraka added that the media was too quick to blame Russia, despite plausible evidence supporting the country’s involvement.Stein rightly criticized Hillary Clinton for not holding a press conference in over seven months, but the journalists convened that afternoon were primarily from amateur and activist outlets sympathetic to her agenda, and their questions dominated the proceedings. One attendee asked about the “unbelievable election fraud” in the Democratic primary and another was heard loudly cheering the convention proceedings earlier in the day. Stein dropped her criticism of the mainstream media when asked about her upcoming town hall on CNN.A reporter from the progressive “Democracy Now!” program quizzed Stein about her views on vaccination policy ― specifically California’s move to limit vaccine exemptions. Though Stein has publicly affirmed the efficacy of vaccines, she has continually shrouded her answers in criticisms of the pharmaceutical industry and government regulators, a tactic common to anti-vaccine activists. Not surprisingly, Stein dodged the question, calling it the “birther issue” of the 2016 campaign, and proceeded to lambast the pharmaceutical industry. When the Green Party’s candidate is being tripped up by “Democracy Now!,” you know it has problems. For these reasons and more, it rang hollow when Stein tried to tie her campaign to Bernie Sanders’ primary bid. “The Green Party has been ready for Bernie from the start,” she said, going so far to claim that the two campaigns had “merged.” Stein told reporters that she and Green Party officials had been reaching out to Sanders since the middle of last decade, though neglected to elaborate on how Sanders had rebuffed their entreaties. But Bernie Sanders had a mostly disciplined campaign behind him, one that filled his campaign coffers and helped his proclamations, in his rich Brooklyn accent, about the mill-yuhn-aires and bill-yun-aires become household slogans. There was no such discipline on display this weekend in Houston. It recalled a prophecy made by Vladimir Lenin nearly 100 years ago: “Under socialism, all will govern in turn and will soon become accustomed to no one governing.” Lenin couldn’t have been more right, but not in the way he anticipated. He never met Sedinam Kinamo Christin Moyowasifza-Curry."

As the convention chugged along Saturday, photos emerged on Twitter of Stein appearing beside Russian President Vladimir Putin at a dinner last December marking the anniversary of Russia Today, an English-language news outlet with close ties to the Kremlin. Video of Stein praising the event also resurfaced. It wasn’t a great look, and it wouldn’t be far-fetched to assume that the campaign, or Stein herself, would prep an answer, yet when The Huffington Post asked Stein about a Tweet in which she compared the Democratic National Committee activity depicted in the WikiLeaks dump to hackers possibly allied to the Russian government, Stein was caught off guard. “I think all of this is underhanded and sneaky,” she stammered, before proceeding to blame the media for not covering the leaks enough. Baraka added that the media was too quick to blame Russia, despite plausible evidence supporting the country’s involvement.Stein rightly criticized Hillary Clinton for not holding a press conference in over seven months, but the journalists convened that afternoon were primarily from amateur and activist outlets sympathetic to her agenda, and their questions dominated the proceedings. One attendee asked about the “unbelievable election fraud” in the Democratic primary and another was heard loudly cheering the convention proceedings earlier in the day. Stein dropped her criticism of the mainstream media when asked about her upcoming town hall on CNN.A reporter from the progressive “Democracy Now!” program quizzed Stein about her views on vaccination policy ― specifically California’s move to limit vaccine exemptions. Though Stein has publicly affirmed the efficacy of vaccines, she has continually shrouded her answers in criticisms of the pharmaceutical industry and government regulators, a tactic common to anti-vaccine activists. Not surprisingly, Stein dodged the question, calling it the “birther issue” of the 2016 campaign, and proceeded to lambast the pharmaceutical industry. When the Green Party’s candidate is being tripped up by “Democracy Now!,” you know it has problems. For these reasons and more, it rang hollow when Stein tried to tie her campaign to Bernie Sanders’ primary bid. “The Green Party has been ready for Bernie from the start,” she said, going so far to claim that the two campaigns had “merged.” Stein told reporters that she and Green Party officials had been reaching out to Sanders since the middle of last decade, though neglected to elaborate on how Sanders had rebuffed their entreaties. But Bernie Sanders had a mostly disciplined campaign behind him, one that filled his campaign coffers and helped his proclamations, in his rich Brooklyn accent, about the mill-yuhn-aires and bill-yun-aires become household slogans. There was no such discipline on display this weekend in Houston. It recalled a prophecy made by Vladimir Lenin nearly 100 years ago: “Under socialism, all will govern in turn and will soon become accustomed to no one governing.” Lenin couldn’t have been more right, but not in the way he anticipated. He never met Sedinam Kinamo Christin Moyowasifza-Curry."

While attending Karlie Kloss’ joint birthday party with oil industry heir Mike Hess in the Hamptons, the rapper pulled Swift up onstage to help sing his 2002 hit “Dilemma.” Swift sang and danced her way through Kelly Rowland’s parts while wearing a tiny black top, a black skirt (which, of course, covered her belly button) and white sneakers. Wearing her hair with curls for the first time in a while, Swift took us back to her “Tim McGraw” days. The singer caused a bit of a stir online when she kissed birthday boy Hess on the cheek during the performance (you can see the video here). Boyfriend Tom Hiddleston has no need to freak out, though, as it looked like a simple friendly peck. "

Broadcaster ABS-CNN put the number at over 800, though this includes executions by anonymous vigilantes.On Monday, 27 mayors and 31 police officers, including a colonel, went to the national police office in the capital, Manila, to clear their names, fearing the president’s order to hunt them down if they failed to surrender within 24 hours.Several local officials reported to regional police offices to beat the deadline set by Duterte, who won the elections in May on a single platform of fighting crime and drugs.On Sunday, he identified about 160 officials in a name-and-shame campaign.“I want to change,” a Cebu-based businessman tagged as a top-level drug trafficker told reportersafter he met national police chief Ronald dela Rosa.Nicknamed “the punisher” and “Duterte Harry” for his brutal fight on crime, Duterte has hit back at activists incensed by the surge in the killings of suspected drug traffickers.Alarmed human rights groups have urged the United Nations to condemn the rise in extrajudicial killings. The Philippine Senate is to hold a legislative inquiry.Dela Rosa reprimanded the police officers on Duterte’s list, threatening to kill them if they continued to protect drug traders and resell seized drugs. At one point, he challenged them to a fistfight.“I am mad with what is happening,” Dela Rosa said in a speech to local officials and police. “I am ashamed. We should be the ones arresting these people, but we are protecting them. I will kill you if you will not change.”All police officers linked to the drug trade were disarmed, investigated and could face criminal and administrative cases if there was strong evidence, said national police spokesman Dionardo Carlos.“They will be accorded due process,” he added.Besides local officials and police officers, Duterte’s list included two retired police generals, soldiers, paramilitary members, judges and a former lawmaker.In a letter, Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno on Monday told the president the court alone had the right to discipline judges. One judge named by Duterte died eight years ago and two others have already been removed.In his maiden speech to the Senate, boxing icon Manny Pacquiao supported Duterte’s drug war and proposal to restore the death penalty for drug crimes, and advocated execution by hanging or by firing squad."

Erdogan vowed to keep Turkey’s promises on the migrant deal as recently as July 26.“The European Union is not behaving in a sincere manner with Turkey,” Erdogan said in comments published by Le Monde on Monday, noting that the visa waiver for Turkish citizens was supposed to kick in on June 1.“If our demands are not satisfied then the readmissions will no longer be possible,” Erdogan said.Ankara agreed in March to stop migrants from crossing into Greece in exchange for financial aid being revived, the promise of visa-free travel to much of the EU and accelerated membership talks.However, the reciprocal visa-free access has been delayed due to a dispute over Turkish anti-terrorism legislation and concern in the West about the scale of Ankara’s crackdown following a failed coup.Criticizing the response of Washington and European leaders to the attempted putsch, Erdogan said the Turkish people had been abandonned by the West.“The whole world reacted to the attack against Charlie Hebdo. Our prime minister joined a rally in the streets of Paris,” Erdogan said, referring to the deadly militant attack on the office of the French satirical magazine in January 2015.“I would have hoped that the leaders of the Western world would have reacted (to the coup attempt) in the same way and not have contented themselves with a few cliches.”In Berlin on Monday, a spokeswoman for the German foreign ministry repeated that reinstatement of the death penalty in Turkey would end its bid to join the EU.Erdogan, speaking to German television station ARD last month after the coup attempt, said the Turkish people wanted the death penalty bringing back and those governing the country should listen to them."
