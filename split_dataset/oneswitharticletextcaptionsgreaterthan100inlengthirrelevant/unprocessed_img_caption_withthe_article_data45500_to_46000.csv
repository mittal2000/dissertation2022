0,CRIME,Fugitive Caretakers Allegedly Steal WWII Veteran's Life Savings,Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wwii-veteran-life-savings-stolen_us_57e1b0abe4b0e80b1b9ee159,But a friend from church is helping Dennis Ferk get back on his feet.,2016-09-21,"A fundraiser is underway for decorated WWII veteran Dennis Ferk (pictured with his daughter, Denise) after two of his caregivers allegedly stole all of his savings and retirement money.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e2b3ce130000930639d8fc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After surviving two World War II battles and earning two bronze stars and three purple hearts, Dennis Ferk is now battling to restore his livelihood.The 95-year-old retired staff sergeant is recovering emotionally and financially after two former caregivers allegedly stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from him and are now on the run and wanted by police in Santa Fe, New Mexico.“He lost over $340,000,” Ferk’s friend Gil Martinez, who is now handling Ferk’s finances and running a fundraising campaign on his behalf, told The Huffington Post Tuesday.That figure includes the war hero’s monthly Social Security and Department of Veterans Affairs checks, as well as accumulated debt from a dozen maxed-out credit cards taken out under Ferk’s name, seven life insurance policies that were cashed in and a $50,000 loan against his home. Funds that had been set aside to care for Ferk’s handicapped adult daughter after his death were also wiped out, Martinez said.“I thought they were my friends but what they were after was taking care of themselves,” Ferk, who sold his home to cope with the financial blow, told KOB-TV. According to Martinez, this spiraling nightmare began shortly after the death of Ferk’s wife in 2010. Ferk hired Dian Zeemin, 69, and Joe Rosko, 62, as caretakers and gave them the legal ability to access his funds. Last November, Ferk approached him after services at their Santa Fe church and asked for a ride, Martinez said. Martinez agreed to give him a lift, but when Ferk didn’t get up, he asked, “Is there anything else?”That’s when Ferk said he couldn’t afford groceries for himself or his daughter. He opened his wallet to show it was empty inside, Martinez recalled.The two went to Ferk’s bank and looked through his account records, Martinez said. There, Martinez uncovered numerous purchases made by Zeemin and Rosko, who had been living on Ferk’s property free of charge.Ferk’s accounts had been wiped clean. And Ferk said he was scared for his life after Rosko allegedly physically threatened him, Martinez recalled. Ferk also told him the license plate on his car had been removed and his car blocked in by the couple’s cars.“He said to me, ‘Gil, will you protect me?’” Martinez recalled. “I said, ‘Sarge, no one’s ever going to touch you again.’”After obtaining power of attorney, Martinez said he confronted Zeemin, who denied any wrongdoing. By late January or February, Martinez said he had the caretakers evicted from Ferk’s property. In April, Santa Fe police issued a warrant for their arrest. But the couple managed to skip town and remains wanted by local police for three counts each of exploitation and one count each of forgery.“The two individuals named have fled the city of Santa Fe, however we believe they are still in the state and continue to search for them,” Santa Fe Police spokesman Greg Gurule told HuffPost via email.But there has been some good news for the veteran of late.Martinez has been able to eliminate almost all the debt the couple allegedly racked up, mostly by negotiating the purchases and reporting other ones as fraudulent. He moved Ferk in with his daughter, but is still trying to raise money for her care. As of Wednesday, a GoFundMe page set up for the veteran has raised more than $3,600 of a $50,000 goal.“People say, how can you do it?” said Martinez, who’s a grandfather of nine, “and I tell Sarge that I’m his long-lost son.” Martinez said he hopes Ferk’s story sends a message about the importance of compassion.“There are people out there that are in need of help. It’s just that these people who are in need of help, it’s too hard for them to ask for help because they feel too proud,” Martinez said. “If you have this inclination of anyone, that you just feel has needs of some kind, go up to them and ask them, ‘Are you OK, is there something I can do?’ And that’s when things will open up.”According to the Department of Justice’s Elder Initiative, 1 in 10 seniors is abused each year in the U.S.. though only about one out of every 23 cases is reported to authorities.Anyone in need of help, or who knows someone who is, can access local and national resources through the DOJ’s website.CORRECTION: This article originally said that Martinez was able to recover almost all the money that was stolen from Ferk; in fact, he has been able to eliminate fraudulent debts under Ferk’s name, but has not recovered any funds."

Amy Peterson and Diana Russell aren’t most people. Their Detroit-based company Rebel Nell repurposes fallen graffiti into beautiful pieces of wearable art. Peterson moved to Detroit in 2007 to pursue a career in sports law, and happened to live near a well-known shelter in the area. “I would have conversations with the residents, mostly the women. Hearing their stories was inspiring because of how courageous they were. These are women who have suffered a lot of physical, emotional and financial abuse, that recognized a bad situation and left in search of a better opportunity,” she told The Huffington Post. It was then, she said, that she had an “aha moment that I need to do something to help my neighbors.” She and Russell decided they wanted to start a business that would give back to the community ― and they decided to start a business and employ women who are transitioning out of shelters . Both having a little bit of of background in the jewelry business, Peterson and Russell decided to start making jewelry out of old graffiti that had fallen off wall near Peterson’s home.“There was a piece of graffiti that was on the ground as I was running by,” Peterson recalled. “I picked it up and thought it looked kind of groovy, and I turned it on its side and saw it was made up of all these different colored layers. I wondered if there was a way to expose that.”And so Rebel Nell was born. The self-sustaining company uses its profits to fund programs in legal aid, housing resources, life wellness, business education and financial literacy. But not one to stop at just having a social impact, Peterson explains how important the environmental aspect is, too. “We don’t touch the graffiti until it falls on the ground, so the fact that we are able to repurpose this stuff that would otherwise seep into the ground is something I’m very proud of. To give it a new home and make it wearable art and give graffiti another life is pretty cool,” she said.And, in a way, she says the entire process of repurposing the graffiti can be linked to the women working for the brand, too.“These are things that would otherwise be discarded, and I feel like the women we hire are often thought of that way in society,” she said. “If you pick [the pieces of graffiti] up, you realize all the beautiful and intricate layers that make up that piece of something that otherwise would be discarded. With love, finish and repurposing it turns into these beautiful works of wearable art, and thats what our ladies evolve into as well.” Rebel Nell’s pieces range in price between $40 and $175 and can be purchased on Rebel Nell’s website.

The event, which took place at New York City’s Museum of Modern Art, celebrated the second anniversary of the UN Women’s initiative HeForShe, which launched in 2014 when Watson gave her now-iconic speech galvanizing men to join the fight for gender equality.Watson gave another riveting speech Tuesday night in honor of HeForShe’s new Impact 10x10x10 initiative, which aims to achieve gender parity in universities around the world. The initiative is part of HeForShe’s campaign Impact 10x10x10 which partners with governments, corporations and universities in different capacities to fight for gender equality. One of the commitments in the initiative is to stop sexual violence on university campuses around the world. “In the last two years if I have learned anything, it is that nothing is impossible,” the 26-year-old actress told the crowd. Listen to Watson’s full speech from Tuesday night speech below. (She even quotes Michelle Obama!)To launch the University Impact 10x10x10 Parity initiative, HeForShe published a report Tuesday morning outlining the gender breakdown of undergraduate and graduate students, full-time faculty, tenured professors and senior leadership of 10 universities around the world representing 8 countries on 5 continents.The gender gap in academia has been a persistent problem not only in the U.S., but also around the world. In the U.S., men out-rank women in faculty positions and out-earn women at higher levels. Women of color are also greatly under-represented in tenured positions. The participating universities, which include Georgetown University, the University of Oxford, Nagoya University and the University of São Paulo., each made three underlying commitments as part of the campaign. These commitments include: implementing gender sensitization education for students, faculty and staff; developing programs to address gender-based violence on campus; and championing IMPACT 10x10x10 at their own university. Each university also made individual commitments to achieve by the year 2020, including closing the gender gap in academia administration and creating university centers that focus on gender equality. Four of the 10 universities committed to end sexual violence on their campuses.Below is the gender breakdown of the 10 universities included in the Impact 10x10x10 University Parity Report. Sexual violence on college campuses is a rampant problem around the world. In the U.S., one in 5 women and one in 16 men are sexually assaulted at college. Transgender students are even more vulnerable to sexual assault and often experience sexual assault at higher rates. “Across all IMPACT Universities, tackling gender-based violence is regarded as an absolute priority,” a HeForShe press release reads. “Charting a path for other universities to follow, the models under creation at IMPACT universities are central to the global campaign to eradicate gender-based violence.”As Watson said in an earlier HeForShe speech at the UN headquarters Tuesday morning, every student on university campuses around the world needs to know they are safe from sexual violence. “The [university] experience must make it clear that the safety of women, minorities and anyone who may be vulnerable is a right and not a privilege,” she said. “A right that will be respected by a community that believes and supports survivors and that recognizes that when one persons safety is violated, everyone feels their own safety is violated.” Head over to HeForShe to read more about the initiative.

5,POLITICS,Senate Permits $1.15 Billion Arms Sale To Saudi Arabia,Max Greenwood and Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-permits-saudi-arms-sale_us_57e2cb6ee4b08d73b82f07c1,The sale had become a flashpoint in the debate over the decades-long alliance between the Kingdom and the U.S.,2016-09-21,Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) urged lawmakers Wednesday to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia. The measure was ultimately defeated.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e2e2351b00002e00ef140f.jpeg?cache=xzAlKbowDU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Senate has rejected a measure that would have blocked a $1.15 billion weapons transfer to Saudi Arabia, disappointing critics of the Kingdom and tacitly endorsing President Barack Obama’s policy of record arms deals to the Saudis and other U.S. partners in the troubled Middle East.A handful of lawmakers from both parties backed the bill, describing it as a way to begin putting necessary limits on the U.S.-Saudi alliance. The bill’s supporters say the Kingdom has threatened American interests by committing war crimes in its brutal U.S.-backed campaign to restore the government in Yemen, and by spreading a radical strain of Islam that some terror groups, like al Qaeda and the self-described Islamic State, have partially co-opted.Another arms deal would solidify the impression that the U.S. is tied to the worst Saudi excesses, according to the measure’s co-author, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).“There is a U.S. imprint on every civilian death inside Yemen, which is radicalizing the people of this country against the United States,” Murphy said.But the bill failed 71-27 on Wednesday after its opponents argued that it would be interpreted as a dangerous, disloyal message to an ally that has embraced U.S. policy at great cost to itself.“Were this resolution of disapproval ever to be adopted, it would further convince the world that the United States is retreating, not only from its commitments, but also as a guarantor of the international order we worked to create after the Second World War,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said.The vote appears to mark the end of a spat that began in August, when the Obama administration informed lawmakers that despite the growing controversy over Yemen, it had approved another weapons sale to the Saudis. Members who had been raising the Yemen issue then began to try to kill the deal. Others on the Hill argued that Saudi Arabia and other U.S. partners in the Persian Gulf need to arm themselves against an increasingly aggressive Iran. Iran has supported Houthi forces in Yemen that ousted a pro-Saudi government last year. It’s also used its allies to expand its influence and weaken Saudi proxies elsewhere, particularly in Lebanon and Syria.On Wednesday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, suggested that this is not the right time or the right way to begin a broad conversation about U.S.-Saudi relations.“If militias were attacking our borders and launching missiles into our territory and our friends refused to help us defend ourselves, we would certainly question the value of that friendship,” McCain said. “This is why the sale is more important than just a sale. It is a message.”Murphy and others skeptical of Saudi Arabia ― like resolution co-sponsors Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Al Franken (D-Minn.), and the supporters of the equivalent measure in the House, Reps. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) ― aren’t likely to drop the issue.“I knew from the beginning that this was not becoming law,” Murphy told Politico. “My point here is to raise a discussion about the war in Yemen and Saudi behavior in the region that isn’t happening.”The fact that public criticism of U.S.-Saudi relations has become so popular has the Saudis worried about how much they can count on traditional support from Washington. The Kingdom has responded by bolstering its charm offensive among “thought leaders” in the U.S. and pumping up nationalism at home ― suggests that it might actually become more aggressive in response to international condemnation because it feels isolated and betrayed.Other recent news from the Hill is adding to the Saudis’ anxieties. The House has approved a bill that would allow sovereign governments to be sued in the U.S. over allegations of terror. That measure was championed by some families of victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks who believe Saudi Arabia had a role in those events, even though years of investigations by the U.S. government have found no evidence for that claim.Obama plans to veto this measure, with the White House citing concerns for the security of U.S. personnel abroad. Administration sources argue that other governments would pass similar laws that would open up America to suits and fraught, as well as potentially unfair processes of discovery and trial. They also note that the legislation would affect all countries, not just the Kingdom. European Union countries, for example, strongly oppose the bill as well, arguing that sovereign immunity is essential to foreign policy and international law.Still, Congress could override the veto ― which lawmakers appear to be seriously considering, presumably in part because siding with Sept. 11 families would likely bolster their political prospects in an election year."
6,POLITICS,Members Of Congress Rip Into Mylan CEO,Lauren Weber,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-mylan-ceo-epipen_us_57e2d2b4e4b0e28b2b51cbfa,"“They raised the prices ... to get filthy rich at the expense of our constituents,” Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said.",2016-09-21,"Mylan CEO Heather Bresch holds up Mylan's EpiPen medication while speaking during a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing in Washington on Sept. 21, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e2f9b01700002a00ac6410.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a blistering hearing on Wednesday, members of Congress went after Mylan CEO Heather Bresch amid uproar over the soaring price of EpiPens.Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, kicked off the proceedings by stressing the importance of being able to access EpiPens ― auto injectors of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic shock from a severe allergic reaction.“[An EpiPen] is not optional for someone that has severe allergic reactions ... They have to have this,” Chaffetz said.Mylan has raised the price of EpiPens from $100 for one pen in 2007 to $608 for a set of two pens, leaving many Americans struggling to afford the life-saving medication. There is no generic auto injector of epinephrine currently on the market, nor is there a major competitor for the EpiPen.Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) called for a change in drug pricing, citing controversial former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli’s blatant disregard for the committee’s last call for a reduction in skyrocketing drug prices.“Yet another drug company, Mylan, has jacked up the price of a life-saving product for no discernible reason,” Cummings said. “They raised the prices, for the reason being, I believe, to get filthy rich at the expense of our constituents.” Here’s what parents of kids with life-threatening allergies think of the EpiPen price increases.Responding to the lawmakers, Bresch laid out the changes Mylan has instituted in the past weeks to address the uproar.The company is releasing a generic version of its product for $300, which is about half the cost of the version sold today. Bresch said the generic product will be the same as the EpiPen, but without the brand name, and will be available by direct ship from the company.Coupons available through the company’s brand savings program have increased from $100 to $300, Bresch said. She also described how free EpiPens can be provided through a patient assistance program for a family of four that makes under $97,200 a year and does not have commercial insurance.Bresch said she is also submitting a version of the product that would last for 24 months, instead of 18 months, to the FDA over the next few days. When Bresch argued Mylan’s introduction of a generic is unprecedented, Chaffetz retorted that raising the price of a medication by over 500 percent is also unprecedented.“To have companies like yours take advantage of the situation, take advantage of these people who are really in need of this medication, I think it speaks to something that we are better than that,” Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) said. “How did we get to this point that we have a culture like this in corporate America that wants to stick it to consumers?” Members of Congress also pointed to Bresch’s salary of $18.9 million a year. Rep. Eleanor Norton, who represents the District of Columbia, asked what Bresch had done to deserve a 671 percent pay increase while the price of EpiPens also increased.Bresch replied that Mylan had increased children’s access to EpiPens by giving over 700,000 EpiPens to schools across the country.She also said the public didn’t understand Mylan’s profit margins and stressed that the company makes a $50 profit off each pen sold in a two-pack for $608.“We believe it was a fair price,” Bresch said, citing the complexity of the pricing in the pharmaceutical system. “I truly believe the story got ahead of the facts.”Mylan’s stock price has dropped about 15 percent since the furor broke out in late August.Watch the full hearing here.Members of Congress also asked Bresch about the role of her mother, Gayle Manchin, in encouraging schools across the country to stock EpiPens. Manchin was the head of the National Association of State Boards of Education in 2012. Bresch denied that her mother exerted undue influence, calling a USA Today report on the topic a cheap shot. Bresch’s father, Sen.

7,POLITICS,Over 100 Education Groups Want To Kick Cops Out Of Schools,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/police-in-schools_us_57e01ac5e4b0071a6e0897b2,They say school-based police do much more harm than good.,2016-09-21,Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott speaks about police brutality at Spring Valley High School in October 2015.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e16d941300002b0039d477.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Law enforcement officers were regularly stationed in 10 percent of schools in 1997. By 2014, school resource officers were stationed in about one-third of schools. Now, two decades since the number of school-based police officers started to explode, a coalition of over 100 education and social justice organizations are calling for a course correction.The Dignity in Schools Campaign ― a coalition of organizations, parents and students from 27 states ― wants heavily policed campuses to be a thing of the past. It released a set of recommendations on Wednesday to promote alternatives to harsh school discipline and youth criminalization. DSC members plan to present the guidance to lawmakers during congressional briefings later in the day. The new recommendations are the strongest that DSC member organizations ― groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund ― have ever made collectively on the issue of school policing.“Many organizations have been saying for a long time to limit the role of cops at schools, but that varied across communities,” said Nancy Treviño, the communications coordinator for DSC. “Officially we’re coming out as a large body of folks from around the country and collectively saying we want see cops out of school.”The number of school-based police officers, or school resource officers (SROs), ballooned during the 1990s and 2000s, amid the implementation of tough-on-crime Clinton-era laws and incidents of school violence like the Columbine High School massacre. Since then, school police officers have successfully thwarted armed intruders in a handful of high-profile incidents. However, they have also been at the center of a number of controversies regarding police brutality. In the last year alone, videos have caught SROs hurling a female student across a classroom in South Carolina, body-slamming a student in Texas, and slapping a teenager in Baltimore. An Huffington Post investigation found that SROs have Tasered students at least 84 times since 2011. Critics also argue that school resource officers contribute to what is known as the school-to-prison pipeline ― the idea that harsh school discipline practices, including suspensions, expulsions and school-based arrests, help push kids out of education and into the criminal justice system. Evidence indicates that police in schools exacerbate these issues. Just the presence of a police officer in a school significantly increases the likelihood that a student will be referred to outside law enforcement for even minor misbehavior, according to research. The DSC recommendations call on school districts and state and federal policymakers to “remove any law enforcement personnel that are assigned to be present on a regular basis in and around a school or set of schools.”“This would prohibit a regular presence, such as being stationed full or part-time in a school or set of schools, making daily or weekly visits, or the inclusion of a school in an officer’s regular beat,” the recommendations continue. Schools should employee peacekeepers, restorative justice coordinators or intervention workers instead of SROs, according to DSC guidance. Staff members should be trained in positive approaches to school climate and discipline, de-escalation techniques and conflict resolution. Schools should intentionally recruit administrators and teachers of color to make sure staff demographics accurately mirror the community they serve. Officers should have restricted roles in the rare, extreme instances where it is necessary to call police to schools, the guidelines say. Schools and local police departments should adopt Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) that ensure officers do not intervene in matters of school discipline. Ideally, MOUs should prevent police from intervening in vague, minor misbehaviors like insubordination or disorderly conduct, according to the DSC. The campaign is trying to shift the conversation surrounding police in schools, according to Harold Jordan, the senior policy advocate for the ACLU of Pennsylvania. It wants to question the assumption that police have any business working schools at all. School-based police officers are less regulated than police officers who are called into schools for emergencies, said Jordan. “With school resource officers, there’s a complete lack of clarity about who’s in charge. ... These are municipal police officers who are basically working in schools. Their activity is somewhere between lightly regulated and completely unregulated.”The issue of the school-to-prison pipeline is near and dear to the heart of Marika Pfefferkorn, another DSC member and the director of the Minnesota Education Equity Partnership. Pfefferkorn’s brother was repeatedly suspended for various behavioral issues as a child. The family later learned that he had dyslexia. “The behavior was a reaction to something not being addressed. But after you get named a certain type person, you start to become that person. He kept getting pushed out of school,” said Pfefferkorn, who thinks police officers can contribute to this type of treatment of students. “When he was out of school, he started getting caught up in situations he shouldn’t be in. He didn’t graduate from high school.”Organizations like the National Association of School Resource Officers, which is the main body that trains police officers to work in schools, encourage SROs to both protect and mentor students. Pfefferkorn finds this troublesome.“Folks say, ‘Oh, we’re really great and developing relationships with students,’” she said. “We believe it should be a counselor saying that, not police officers. With counselors, your information is safe, it’s in confidence. But you could have the same relationship with a school resource officer, and when you admit or say something, it could become a crime or used against you. That’s an abuse of the relationship.”The DSC recommendations come just a few weeks after the Departments of Education and Justice released the Safe School-based Enforcement through Collaboration, Understanding, and Respect ― a tool designed to curb the influence of police in schools. It’s a rubric that encourages schools that employ police officers to develop MOUs and continuously evaluate their SROs. An earlier statement from the DSC says those recommendations do not go far enough.“While we agree that any SROs or law enforcement that come into contact with schools should receive proper youth development training, the real solution is for school districts to invest in alternatives to SROs, allocating funds towards hiring and training restorative justice practitioners, counselors, social workers and peace builders,” the statement said. NASRO, however, issued a statement praising the federal recommendations.“We believe that administering formal school discipline belongs solely in the hands of educators, and that educators should be well trained to address behavioral issues through a variety of interventions that do not involve law enforcement officers,” NASRO Executive Director Mo Canady said in a statement. “We also believe that not every law enforcement officer is well-suited to a school-based assignment and that SROs should be carefully selected based on criteria designed to ensure their success.”Canady feels strongly that NASRO should specifically train officers on how to work in schools, he told HuffPost in July. Sometimes in high-profile cases ― like when an SRO hurled a student across the room at Spring Valley High School ― they haven’t been. “Any school who doesn’t have a true SRO, doesn’t yet know what they’re missing. ... I think a good SRO has trust from the majority of students, I’ve seen it myself,” Canady said at the time. “SROs are all about relationship building. The #1 goal of the SRO should be to bridge the gap between the law enforcement officer and youth.” CLARIFICATION: This article has been updated to clarify the type of police officers Jordan compared to school resource officers. ______Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e17ee1180000c706315e14.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As “Law & Order: SVU” approaches its Season 18 premiere, fans are getting antsy about Lieutenant Olivia Benson’s return and what jaw-dropping events the series will cover this year. To answer a few questions about the upcoming episodes, The Huffington Post sat down with the cast of “SVU” and its showrunners to discuss all kinds of possibilities. The first episode ― which viewers are going to love ― rips from more than a few newsy cases and buzzy topics. Given the show’s tendency to pull cases from the zeitgeist (like last season’s handling of a controversial Terry Richardson-like figure and a show based on “The Bachelor”), we couldn’t help but wonder if the show will cover Brock Turner’s highly publicized case in some way this season.For reference, the former Stanford student was convicted of three felony sexual assault charges in March after he sexually assaulted an unconscious girl behind a dumpster. His case became national news in June after the victim wrote an open letter about the assault, which went viral. Turner’s extraordinarily lenient punishment (he only served three months of his six-month sentence, though he originally faced 14 years in prison based on charges) was thoroughly criticized. “It is a phenomenon,” Julie Martin, executive producer of “SVU,” told HuffPost of Turner’s case. “Unfortunately, there have been several cases like that over the spring and the summer.” While that hints that a possible Turner-inspired issue might be covered within the broader context of various campus sexual assault cases, Mariska Hargitay imagined a different scenario: one where Detective Benson might get a case ― much like Turner’s ― and make it right on the show, even if law enforcement can’t make it right in real life. “Can you imagine if Brock Turner ― that makes me cry ― happened with me [Benson]?” Hargitay said, her voice breaking and eyes welling up. “Like if I was the detective on that case? It could be healing to somebody to see what should happen.” “[Seeing] justice,” the actress added, “If a judge would do a different sentence. You know that’s healing for people to see the right thing, the just thing happen.” When the real world does not provide the type of punishment we’d like to see for certain cases or people, “SVU” always makes sure the show’s victims (and its viewers) see the right people penalized for their wrongdoings. One of the most popular episodes of last season was based on a family of 12 with a pregnancy secret and a hit TV show, aka the Duggar family’s molestation scandal. Though the characters were different than the Duggars (as was the sexual assault case), viewers got to witness what they’d always wanted the Duggars to do: put their daughters first and say they don’t care about their TV show. It was a perfect example of how the show can reinterpret current events. Justice is served swiftly on “Law & Order.” And hopefully, if we do get a Turner-like character on the show, he’ll receive a suitable punishment (aka something longer than three months in prison). Tune in to the season premiere of “Law & Order: SVU” on Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET on NBC. Watch a preview of the premiere below: "
10,POLITICS,The Courthouse Door Is Shut To Immigrant Children Who Need Lawyers,Cristian Farias and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigrant-children-lawyers-9th-circuit_us_57e2e872e4b0e80b1ba000a0,"An appeals court basically told the kids, ""Good luck!""",2016-09-21,"Children climb on the border fence between Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and El Paso, Texas, during a bi-national Mass in support of migrants in February.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e2ecfc1700002900ac63d4.jpeg?cache=uiJ0HsmInP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Immigrant children who are alone in their legal battle to stay in the United States can’t even turn to the federal judiciary to ensure they have a lawyer along the way.A federal appeals court on Tuesday sided with the Obama administration in holding that migrant children in immigration proceedings don’t have a constitutional or statutory right to ask the regular courts to force the immigration courts to appoint counsel for them.This was purely an issue of jurisdiction. That means the judges were drawing lines about procedure, not ultimate justice for the kids.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit did not decide whether these children ― who may range in age from 3 to 17 and who can’t afford legal representation ― should have lawyers appointed for them. (In fact, two of three judges on the panel made pretty clear they think lawyers are a good idea.)What the 9th Circuit focused on was the distinction between the federal courts, which constitute the judicial branch of government, and the immigration courts, which are overseen by the executive branch ― and how Congress has erected barriers between those two sets of courts.“Because the children’s right-to-counsel claims arise from their removal proceedings, they can only raise those claims through” administrative channels in immigration courts, U.S. Circuit Judge M. Margaret McKeown wrote for the unanimous panel.Still, justice can hinge on procedure.“We would be naive if we did not acknowledge that having an unrepresented minor in immigration proceedings poses an extremely difficult situation,” McKeown added.The circuit judge noted that the administrative process, as it stands, provides a few procedural safeguards for the children: An immigration judge, for example, cannot just accept an unrepresented child’s word that he or she agrees to be deported.And the 9th Circuit held that the children may turn to the federal courts for help with that lack of legal counsel after they’ve exhausted all administrative efforts.McKeown took great pains to sympathize with the children’s situation, acknowledging in a separate concurrence ― joined by one other judge ― how unsatisfactory her court’s technical language might seem.“Jurisdictional rulings have an anodyne character that may suggest insensitivity to the plight of the parties, particularly in a case involving immigrant children whose treatment, according to former Attorney General Eric Holder, raises serious policy and moral questions,” she wrote.She then called on Congress and the White House to take steps to remedy what the federal government has deemed a “crisis at the southern border” ― with more than 60,000 unaccompanied minors entering the country in just 2014 and overwhelming the immigration courts.“The net result is that thousands of children are left to thread their way alone through the labyrinthine maze of immigration laws, which, without hyperbole, have been termed second only to the Internal Revenue Code in complexity,” McKeown wrote.She faulted current efforts by the executive branch to provide legal representation for the children as “a drop in the bucket.”“The stakes are too high,” she went on. “To give meaning to ‘Equal Justice Under Law,’ the tag line engraved on the U.S. Supreme Court building, to ensure the fair and effective administration of our immigration system, and to protect the interests of children who must struggle through that system, the problem demands action now.”The judge’s sympathy was of no consolation to immigration advocates, who expressed frustration at what the ruling will mean for the migrant children ― and at a legislative process that has failed for decades to make needed reforms.“We’re very disappointed. The decision effectively closes the courthouse doors to thousands of children,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. He said the ruling essentially requires the minors “to litigate their own appeals” before they can even claim they have a right to a lawyer.“The court points to Congress and the president, and it’s certainly true that they can solve the issue as well, but that’s also been true for the last 20 years and they haven’t done anything,” said Matt Adams, an attorney with the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.The U.S. Department of Justice, which opposed the children in court, said through a spokeswoman that it’s reviewing the ruling but declined further comment.Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) suggested that he wouldn’t hold his breath waiting for Congress to take up McKeown’s call to arms. But in an email to The Huffington Post, he also didn’t seem to buy the court’s reasoning.“Do you think a 5 year old or a 15 year old is going to get a fair day in court?When they don’t understand a lick of English? They are fleeing violence and are asking us for safety,” he said.In February, Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill, the Fair Day in Court Act for Kids, which would provide migrant children with a lawyer in immigration proceedings.“A child’s deportation hearing can have a profound impact on their lives; for some, deportation could place them in mortal jeopardy,” said Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.), who supports the House version of the bill. “If our government truly cares about building a just immigration court system, it is imperative for every child in that system to have counsel.”Cristian Farias reported from New York. This article has been updated to include a response from the Department of Justice."

But there is still work to do,” Clark said in an email. “The secretary of state’s office and local election officials have a history of making intimidating statements that could scare legitimate voters away. These can’t stand in a democracy.”Read Judge Ramos’ ruling:"

He sent out the invitation, a copy of which was obtained by Right Wing Watch, to evangelical leaders around the state asking them to come “meet with Donald Trump in an intimate setting.”Trump tapped Amedia in May to be a liaison to the Christian community. In a 2012 interview on TBN, a Christian network, Amedia tells a story of the time he prevented waves from the 2011 tsunami in Japan from smashing into a Hawaiian island his daughter was visiting. He says the power of his prayer caused the waves to change direction and move to another island.“I stood at the edge of my bed and I said, ‘In the name of Jesus, I declare that tsunami to stop now,’” Amedia says in the interview. “And I specifically said, ‘I declare those waters to recede’ ... It was actually on the news that the tsunami stopped 200 feet off of shore. Even after having sucked the waters in, it churned and it went on and did devastation to the next island.”The tsunami caused minimal damage in Hawaii. The island Amedia’s daughter was on was spared, as were all the other islands.Here’s a video of Amedia’s interview:Amedia has said and done some other questionable things. He’s blamed AIDS on “unnatural sex,” and was once accused of helping to bribe a prosecutor into dropping a case against a friend who’d allegedly been rolling back car odometers at an Ohio car dealership.A Trump campaign spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on how the Republican presidential nominee is comfortable associating himself with Amedia, given his past claims and record.Trump’s meeting with Ohio pastors is part of his campaign’s aggressive push to win over evangelical leaders before November. Last month, he shared the stage with a mix of Florida evangelicals who have said God is preventing an AIDS cure and have warned of “militant homo-fascism.*”*Apparently, the term refers to gay people trying to “take over our land and make it Sodom.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The majority leader has indicated he’s not going to put it on the floor,” Hoeyer concluded. “It’s not coming to a vote.”Callahan interviewed Hoyer on behalf of online progressive heavyweight CREDO Action and We Act Radio, a Washington-based liberal media production house.CREDO, which has been active in efforts to block TPP’s passage, posted the video of the exchange to its Facebook page Wednesday afternoon, along with a message encouraging activists to keep up the pressure.The TPP, a trade agreement between the U.S. and 11 Pacific Rim nations, already faced steep political odds. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have both said there will not be a vote on TPP in the lame-duck session of Congress.The comments from Hoyer, who typically represents the more pro-business wing of the Democratic Party, suggest that TPP’s prospects are even dimmer. Some progressive activists have fretted that Hillary Clinton’s appointment of Ken Salazar, a prominent TPP supporter, as head of her transition team suggests she is prepared to reverse her opposition to the deal. Clinton refused TPP critics’ entreaties to publicly call on Congress not to vote on it. That Hoyer pointed to her opposition as a reason not to bring the deal up for a vote indicates that her stance is firmer than skeptics might have thought. If TPP were to come to a vote, the fast-track authority Congress voted to grant the president would ensure that the deal would not be amended or filibustered.President Barack Obama claims TPP is essential to countering China’s influence in the Asia-Pacific region and insists it has the highest human rights standards of any trade pact in U.S. history.The deal’s critics argue it will exacerbate income inequality, harm the environment and empower corporations to challenge domestic laws using an opaque international arbitration system."

Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told Reuters.“We will advise on the exact locations once the convoy has actually reached those locations.”Elizabeth Hoff, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Syria, told Reuters on Wednesday that the U.N. health agency planned to deliver medical supplies on Thursday to the rebel-held besieged Damascus suburb of Moadamiya, subject to the normal security risk assessments.“It’s important to understand that the security situation in Syria is not one situation, it’s a patchwork of different levels of security or insecurity, it’s a patchwork of multiple actors and armed groups, and we need to take that into account when we evaluate on a case-by-case basis,” Laerke said.“So that is what we do, whether we send it to rural Damascus as we do today, or hopefully in the near future we can resume deliveries in Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria,” he added."

It did not immediately respond to Wednesday’s flight.The U.S. Air Force said the Wednesday flight was the closest ever to North Korea by a B-1 bomber.“Today marks the first time the airframe has landed on the Korean peninsula in 20 years, as well as conducting the closest flight near North Korea ever,” the U.S. Air Force said on its website which also showed a B-1B bomber landing at the base in South Korea.The South’s Yonhap news agency said the aircraft flew over a U.S. live-fire training site in the Pocheon area bordering the North.North Korea has ignored global condemnation of its fifth nuclear test on Sept. 9, and this week said it had successfully tested a new rocket engine that would be used to launch satellites, again in violation of U.N. sanctions.The leaders of the United States and China, which is the North’s main diplomatic ally and economic benefactor, condemned the latest nuclear test and pledged to step up cooperation at the United Nations and in law enforcement channels.CHINA URGES RESTRAINTU.N. diplomats say the two countries have begun discussions on a possible U.N. resolution in response to the latest nuclear test, but China has not said directly whether it would support tougher steps against North Korea.China, which has objected to a planned U.S. deployment of a THAAD missile defense system in the South to counter the North’s missile threat, called on “all parties to exercise restraint and to avoid any actions that could further escalate tensions”.South Korea’s prime minister, Hwang Kyo-ahn, told parliament South Korea wanted existing U.N. sanctions against the North tightened by removing loopholes that allow it to trade in minerals if it is for subsistence.North Korea has been testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles at an unprecedented rate this year, beginning with its fourth nuclear test in January and including the launch of a satellite in February that was widely seen as a test of long-range ballistic missile technology.The North’s test of a new rocket engine for satellite launchers this week was believed to be part of a long-range missile program, according to the South’s military.North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, ordered preparations for the launch of a satellite “as soon as possible” on the basis of the successful test, its state media reported.North Korea this month fired three missiles that flew about 1,000 km (600 miles), and in August tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile that experts said showed considerable progress.It also launched an intermediate-range missile in June that experts said marked a technological advance for the isolated state after several failed tests.South Korean Defence Minister Han Min-koo told parliament the North was developing all types of missiles, from short- to long-range, and its advances were “considerable.”"

General Assembly as national leader, Myanmar’s former political prisoner and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi defended her government’s efforts to resolve a crisis over treatment of the country’s Muslim minority.Suu Kyi, who has been criticized for doing too little to address the plight of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, said the government did not fear international scrutiny, but asked “for the understanding and the constructive contribution of the international community.”“We are committed to a sustainable solution that will lead to peace, stability and development for all communities within the State,” she said.“Our government is taking a holistic approach that makes development central to both short- and long-term programs aimed at promoting understanding and trust.”Suu Kyi pointed to the establishment of an advisory commission for Rakhine State chaired by former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, with a mandate covering basic rights and security issues.Suu Kyi said there had been “persistent opposition from some quarters” to the establishment of the commission. She said the government would persevere in its efforts to achieve peace in Rakhine.“By standing firm against the forces of prejudice and intolerance, we are reaffirming our faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person.”Increased freedom of speech since the military stepped back from direct rule in 2011 has allowed for the unleashing of long-held anti-Muslim sentiment in Myanmar. More than 100 people were killed and some neighborhoods were razed to the ground in 2012 when ethnic Rakhine Buddhists clashed with Rohingya Muslims.Some 125,000 people are still displaced, the vast majority of them Rohingya, who are prevented from moving freely.The Rohingya have long been persecuted, being seen by much of the majority Buddhist population as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, even though many have lived in the country for generations. Most were stripped of their ability to vote in last year’s election, which brought Suu Kyi to power as de facto leader.In Washington last Thursday, Suu Kyi urged businesses to invest in Myanmar as a way to advance its democratic transition, a day after U.S. President Barack Obama pledged to lift long-standing sanctions on the country.(Reporting by David Brunnstrom; editing by Grant McCool)"

Worsening haze conditions in parts of Indonesia prompted schools to close this week.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e246e31b00002d00ef1110.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SINGAPORE —The Pollutant Standards Index hit almost 2,000 in Palangkaraya last September, as thick, choking smoke shrouded the capital of Central Kalimantan in Indonesia. Anything over 100 on the air pollution estimate is considered “unhealthy.” A number above 300 is “hazardous.” Last year’s haze across Southeast Asia, an annual concern in this region, was particularly gruesome and a powerful El Niño weather pattern intensified the problem. Thousands fled their homes in Indonesia; schools were shuttered in Singapore and Malaysia; and diplomatic tensions escalated as the thick haze persisted for weeks, a result of forest fires raging mostly on the Indonesian island of Sumatra and in Kalimantan.But the human impact of the haze was far more devastating than these issues, according to a new study from Harvard and Columbia universities. Researchers found that last year’s haze crisis may have caused more than 100,000 premature deaths in the region — more than 90,000 in Indonesia, 6,500 in Malaysia and over 2,000 in Singapore. The researchers, experts in public health, climate change and atmospheric chemistry modeling, focused only on adult mortality for the study. Yet the estimate is far higher than the official death toll. Indonesian authorities had said that the haze had caused just 19 deaths in 2015. Indonesia and its neighbors have suffered under a haze blanket during the dry season for years. The 2006 haze, which was also particularly bad, may have caused more than 37,600 deaths in the region, according to the same Harvard and Columbia study, which was published in the journal Environmental Research Letters on Monday.The region’s haze is caused mostly by the illegal but widespread burning of forests to clear them for agriculture, such as palm oil plantations. The burning spews enormous quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, along with a cocktail of toxic substances like formaldehyde and cyanide and particulate matter, which can get lodged deep into human lungs and enter the bloodstream.It can be “extremely hazardous for your health,” said a London-based researcher who took measurements of the haze in Kalimantan last year. It’s been linked to a slew of health effects, from eye and nose irritation and asthma aggravation, to diseases of the lungs and heart.The haze has recently returned to Southeast Asia. Singapore’s air quality deteriorated into the unhealthy range in August. Worsening haze conditions in parts of Indonesia prompted the closure of some schools this week.“More than 100,000 are estimated to have died prematurely last year. Now fires are back again. If nothing changes, this killer haze will carry on taking a terrible toll, year after year. Industry and government must take real action to stop forest clearing and peatland drainage for plantations,” said Greenpeace Indonesia’s forest campaigner Yuyun Indradi this week. “Now that we know the scale of the death toll, failure to act immediately to stem the loss of life would be a crime.”Indonesia admitted last October that at least 43 million people were exposed to haze across the country and that half a million had suffered acute respiratory infections as a result of the smoke.Yet, when giving the official death toll from the haze, the country only cited 19 people ― and that included the deaths of firefighters. The Indonesian government, along with those of Singapore and Malaysia, reacted strongly this week to the claims of the new study, insisting the death toll estimate was far off the mark.Indonesia, which has repeatedly promised to crack down on land burning but has been accused of half-hearted law enforcement, said the figure was much too high.“I’m not sure these figures describe the real situation. If it’s only a statistical count, I don’t think it is appropriate to conclude such a huge death toll,” Mohamad Subuh, a director-general at the health ministry, told Singapore’s The Straits Times.Malaysia’s health ministry’s deputy director-general said there were “no deaths last year directly related to the haze,” while Singapore’s Ministry of Health said the study “is not reflective of the actual situation.”However, at least one of the study’s authors, Jonathan Buonocore, has said the death toll estimate is actually “conservative,” the environmental news website Mongabay.com notes. This is because it only accounted for adults and only those who died within one year of exposure to the haze.

The haze returned to much of Southeast Asia this year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e245251b00002e00ef110c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SINGAPORE —The Pollutant Standards Index hit almost 2,000 in Palangkaraya last September, as thick, choking smoke shrouded the capital of Central Kalimantan in Indonesia. Anything over 100 on the air pollution estimate is considered “unhealthy.” A number above 300 is “hazardous.” Last year’s haze across Southeast Asia, an annual concern in this region, was particularly gruesome and a powerful El Niño weather pattern intensified the problem. Thousands fled their homes in Indonesia; schools were shuttered in Singapore and Malaysia; and diplomatic tensions escalated as the thick haze persisted for weeks, a result of forest fires raging mostly on the Indonesian island of Sumatra and in Kalimantan.But the human impact of the haze was far more devastating than these issues, according to a new study from Harvard and Columbia universities. Researchers found that last year’s haze crisis may have caused more than 100,000 premature deaths in the region — more than 90,000 in Indonesia, 6,500 in Malaysia and over 2,000 in Singapore. The researchers, experts in public health, climate change and atmospheric chemistry modeling, focused only on adult mortality for the study. Yet the estimate is far higher than the official death toll. Indonesian authorities had said that the haze had caused just 19 deaths in 2015. Indonesia and its neighbors have suffered under a haze blanket during the dry season for years. The 2006 haze, which was also particularly bad, may have caused more than 37,600 deaths in the region, according to the same Harvard and Columbia study, which was published in the journal Environmental Research Letters on Monday.The region’s haze is caused mostly by the illegal but widespread burning of forests to clear them for agriculture, such as palm oil plantations. The burning spews enormous quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, along with a cocktail of toxic substances like formaldehyde and cyanide and particulate matter, which can get lodged deep into human lungs and enter the bloodstream.It can be “extremely hazardous for your health,” said a London-based researcher who took measurements of the haze in Kalimantan last year. It’s been linked to a slew of health effects, from eye and nose irritation and asthma aggravation, to diseases of the lungs and heart.The haze has recently returned to Southeast Asia. Singapore’s air quality deteriorated into the unhealthy range in August. Worsening haze conditions in parts of Indonesia prompted the closure of some schools this week.“More than 100,000 are estimated to have died prematurely last year. Now fires are back again. If nothing changes, this killer haze will carry on taking a terrible toll, year after year. Industry and government must take real action to stop forest clearing and peatland drainage for plantations,” said Greenpeace Indonesia’s forest campaigner Yuyun Indradi this week. “Now that we know the scale of the death toll, failure to act immediately to stem the loss of life would be a crime.”Indonesia admitted last October that at least 43 million people were exposed to haze across the country and that half a million had suffered acute respiratory infections as a result of the smoke.Yet, when giving the official death toll from the haze, the country only cited 19 people ― and that included the deaths of firefighters. The Indonesian government, along with those of Singapore and Malaysia, reacted strongly this week to the claims of the new study, insisting the death toll estimate was far off the mark.Indonesia, which has repeatedly promised to crack down on land burning but has been accused of half-hearted law enforcement, said the figure was much too high.“I’m not sure these figures describe the real situation. If it’s only a statistical count, I don’t think it is appropriate to conclude such a huge death toll,” Mohamad Subuh, a director-general at the health ministry, told Singapore’s The Straits Times.Malaysia’s health ministry’s deputy director-general said there were “no deaths last year directly related to the haze,” while Singapore’s Ministry of Health said the study “is not reflective of the actual situation.”However, at least one of the study’s authors, Jonathan Buonocore, has said the death toll estimate is actually “conservative,” the environmental news website Mongabay.com notes. This is because it only accounted for adults and only those who died within one year of exposure to the haze. Babies and children, medical experts say, are especially vulnerable to the health impacts of haze.Some experts this week have called for more research into haze’s health effects since the study findings were revealed.Rajasekhar Balasubramanian, an environmental engineer from the National University of Singapore, told The Associated Press that the “preliminary study” had faced a “very challenging” task of parsing through a lot of complex data.

Two others, his former deputy chief of staff and policy adviser while he was speaker, left for Squire before Boehner retired from the House in 2015.Last week, Reynolds American, the tobacco giant, announced Boehner would be joining the company’s board of directors."

Adelson and his wife alone gave $20 million, according to the Federal Election Commission. On the Democratic side, Senate Majority PAC, which is tied to both Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) and his potential heir Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), pulled in $11.6 million last month.The money from Adelson, the most prolific donor to the GOP, provides Republicans with a major boost in the final months before Election Day, as they seek to maintain their hold on the Senate. Democrats are likely to pick up seats in the upper chamber, but are hoping to win enough to actually seize control. They had been leading in the super PAC money race up until Adelson’s August donation.The casino magnate isn’t the only donor to give big to the Senate Leadership Fund last month. Chicago hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin contributed $2 million, and New York hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer chipped in $1 million. Petrodome Energy, a company owned by Texas donor Ed Bosarge Jr., contributed $1 million. American Crossroads, the once mighty super PAC founded by Karl Rove and run by the exact same staff as the Senate Leadership Fund, gave $1.3 million.Across the aisle, the largest donor in August to Senate Majority PAC was Alexander Soros, a son of hedge fund billionaire and Democratic megadonor George Soros, with $1.25 million. Hedge fund billionaire S. Donald Sussman, real estate and casino magnate Neil Bluhm, and the Greater New York Hospital Association Management Corporation each donated $1 million.These weren’t the only two super PACs working at the congressional level to report their finances on Tuesday. Granite State Solutions, which seeks to re-elect Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), received $4.8 million from the Senate Leadership Fund, $1.5 million from Adelson and $100,000 from James Davis, chairman of the New Balance shoe and athletic wear company.House Majority PAC, which works to elect Democrats to the House, raised $7.1 million in August. Media mogul Fred Eychaner, one of the biggest Democratic Party donors, gave $3 million, and Sussman gave $2 million. The Oneida Indian Nation chipped in $500,000.Labor unions were also major contributors to Senate Majority PAC and House Majority PAC. The United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing, Pipefitting and Sprinkler Fitting Industry donated $250,000 each to both super PACs. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers PAC gave $350,000 to Senate Majority PAC and $100,000 to House Majority PAC. The American Federation of Government Employees and the United Food and Commercial Workers union both gave $250,000 to Senate Majority PAC."

Senators still have an opportunity to block the bill, as it faces one more procedural vote during which it could be filibustered.The holdup appears to be over various add-ons Republicans want, although the status of those items in the ongoing talks was not immediately clear. One rider is a bill to stop the federal government from enforcing new rest rules for truck drivers. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said earlier Tuesday that another obstacle was McConnell trying to block a new Securities and Exchange Commission rule that requires the disclosure of campaign donations.One Democratic source said the negotiations are far from over, which echoed Reid’s insistence earlier that Democrats want a clean bill that funds defense and domestic priorities evenly.“We should have no vexatious poison-pill riders,” Reid told reporters on Capitol Hill.“We are not going to have a [government spending bill] loaded with riders. One is too many, and that’s what they’re trying to do. We’re not going to have this bill be a pin cushion for McConnell’s desire to have nothing ― nothing ― reported dealing with campaign spending,” he said, referring specifically to the SEC provision. He said there were other problems as well.For the Zika funding ― totaling about $1.1 billion ― the riders that Democrats opposed appeared to have been removed. The funding bill would last only until Dec. 9, leaving the lame-duck Congress the task of passing money to run the government until next September."

Scott Walker and his Republican allies in the state legislature faced challenging recall elections in 2011 and 2012 after enacting legislation gutting public employee union rights. To fight those recalls, Walker and his closest campaign aides devised a scheme to collect as much money as possible through a series of nonprofit groups to help hold control of the levels of power in the state.That scheme is shown in detail in leaked documents from a squashed investigation into illegal campaign coordination between Walker and those nonprofit groups provided to the Guardian. These documents, including numerous emails between Walker and the aides working for his nonprofit groups, reveal the internal workings of America’s broken system of funding campaigns in the post-Citizens United world.The Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010 that corporations and unions could spend unlimited sums on elections so long as they remained independent from candidates. The decision, which Justice Anthony Kennedy penned, found that independent election spending could not be limited because it could not lead to quid pro quo corruption. This was determined because of the supposed independence of the spender from any particular candidate. “By definition, an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate,” Kennedy wrote. This was not the first court decision that opened the door to Walker’s scheme, but it has been the most widely known and consequential.The leaked documents reinforce the argument from opponents of the Citizens United ruling that the court majority was woefully naive about how politics actually plays out. These emails show Walker’s top campaign aide commanding an interlocking network of nonprofit groups to help Republicans maintain the governor’s mansion and legislature. To fund it all, Walker is sent from city to city to plead for money from billionaires and corporations for these supposedly independent nonprofits.R.J. Johnson, Walker’s chief campaign aide, sat at the center of the Pro-Walker hydra. At the same time he ran Walker’s recall campaign, Johnson directed the independent efforts of the Wisconsin Club for Growth, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit. The Wisconsin Club for Growth was the central hub spreading money and instructions to a network of nonprofit groups to help nine state Senate recall campaigns, a state Supreme Court race and Walker’s recall campaign.As the state Senate recall elections came into view in the spring of 2011, Johnson emailed to explain that he had “locked in” Wisconsin Club for Growth chief Eric O’Keefe “to head up our national fundraising operations with donors we know from the Koch seminar and across the country as we discussed at the residence.”“I need the Governor on probably 7-8 trips to get us where we need to be along with some in-state stuff,” he said.Kate Doner, Walker’s chief fundraising consultant, said in an April 2011 email, “The Governor is encouraging all to invest in the Wisconsin Club for Growth. Wisconsin Club for Growth can accept Corporate and Personal donations without limitations and no donors disclosure.”The note explaining that donors to Wisconsin Club for Growth becomes a common refrain throughout the emails. Citizens United allowed certain nonprofit groups, which do not have to disclose their donors, to be more open in their electoral appeals, particularly when using corporate funds. This led to a rise in undisclosed or dark money helping to elect candidates across the country.The source of the nonprofit spending supporting Walker and his allies was not disclosed publicly, but the governor knew very well who gave money.“Stress that donations to WiCFG are not disclosed and can accept Corporate donations without limits,” Doner wrote to Walker when he was sent to raise money from Chris Lofgren, head of Schneider International, a Green Bay, Wisconsin large trucking company.Doner echoed this talking point in another email when Walker was to plead for money from Mark Schwabero, president of Mercury Marine engine and parts manufacturing plants, based in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. “Let him know that you can accept corporate contributions and it is not reported,” she wrote.In August 2011, after raising millions to help protect his state Senate majority, Walker asked Doner in an email, “did I send out thank you notes to all of our c(4) donors?”As it appeared likely Walker would face his own recall election, Doner presented an action plan in September 2011 built off of the coordinated campaign they ran to protect the Senate. “Take Koch’s money,” she wrote. “Get on a plane to Vegas and sit down with Sheldon Adelson. Ask for $1m now. Corporations. Go heavy after them to give. Didn’t give much to the recall effort this summer. Create a new c4. Club for Growth name has issues.”Team Walker did not create a new nonprofit. They doubled down on the strategy that worked for them. Walker traveled the country, asking wealthy donors to give to Wisconsin Club for Growth. Of course, he would remind them that corporate contributions were accepted and their identity would remain hidden.He flew to New York City and met with Donald Trump, who gave him $15,000 (and later lied about how much he donated). He solicited money from Adelson, the Koch brothers, TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts, coal baron Joseph Craft, former Ambassador Mel Sembler, Morgan Stanley’s John Mack, Steve Forbes, hedge fund billionaire Louis Bacon, Stanley Herzog, Harlan Crow and countless other executives and corporations or corporate lobbying groups.Johnson was seen in several emails directing spending decisions and coordinating with other groups supporting Walker, including Americans for Prosperity-Wisconsin.Walker won his recall and the Republican maintained control of the legislature thanks to the efforts of this supposedly independent network his top aides ran.Donors, some revealed in previous reporting, included benefactors seeking or even getting beneficial policy changes from Wisconsin politicians.The scheme detailed in the leaked emails is the first real behind-the-scenes look at the obvious coordination occurring between independent groups and politicians. The Huffington Post has previously reported on independent groups linked to political leaders including Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).The leaked documents came from the John Doe II investigation by a bipartisan group of prosecutors, with support from the state’s nonpartisan elections agency, which a state judge initially approved. But the Wisconsin Supreme Court shut the investigation down. It claimed that the prosecutors had overstepped their bounds as the supposedly independent groups did not have an overt electoral message and, thus, were not bound by anti-coordination rules. That is to say that the spending Johnson directed through Wisconsin Club for Growth and other nonprofit groups stopped short of calling for the election of Walker or the defeat of his Democratic rival Tom Barrett.These are called issue ads. The emails, however, demonstrate that the Walker aides running the nonprofit network saw their efforts as explicitly electoral and designed to help elect their favored candidates.Keith Gilkes, a top Walker advisor, sent the governor a list of talking points that Johnson crafted for Walker to use when selling donors on giving to the Wisconsin Club for Growth for his recall race. “Wisconsin Club for Growth raised 12 million dollars and ran a soup to nuts campaign,” the talking points read, referencing the state Senate recall races in 2011. Walker was supposed to tell donors that the seemingly independent nonprofit ran a targeted advertising and get out the vote campaign that successfully protected the Republican majority.Walker was also routinely sent informational emails about the donors he would be meeting. These would include short biographies, political interests and business holdings. They would also include clearly explicit requests for the governor to press them to donate “in support of the recall.” That support would flow to the Wisconsin Club for Growth and its supposedly independent, supposedly issue-based campaign.The conservative federal district court judge Rudolph Randa upheld the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s ruling by citing Citizens United and analogizing the investigation to “the Guillotine and the Gulag.” Randa applauded Walker and Johnson for finding a way to subvert campaign finance laws. “The plaintiffs have found a way to circumvent campaign finance laws, and that circumvention should not and cannot be condemned or restricted,” Randa wrote.The prosecutors have since filed an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking it to review the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s ruling and clarify whether past legal judgments allow the kind of coordination the state’s court approved in the Walker case. Time will tell if the evidence laid out in the leaked documents will force the court to take the case and reexamine the decisions that made Walker’s scheme possible."

I will never let money from anyone affect what I do. I’m proud of my office. I’m proud of the work that we do.”Bondi has said her office did not drop an investigation into Trump’s fake university. Rather, she says no formal investigation ever existed.In September 2013, the Orlando Sentinel reported that Bondi’s office was evaluating claims against Trump Institute, a local affiliate of Trump University, which sold real estate seminars and was not, as the name suggested, an accredited academic institution. Instead, consumers paid thousands of dollars to learn about real estate investing and got very little, if anything, in return. Three days after the story was published, a group supporting Bondi’s campaign received a $25,000 contribution from Trump’s charity.The New York Times reported that the check from Trump’s foundation, which he signed, was dated four days before the Sentinel article was published. Ultimately, Bondi did not join New York’s case and did not pursue a formal investigation of Trump University.Trump recently paid a $2,500 IRS fine for making the gift from his charity ― nonprofits are prohibited from making political contributions. The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold reported that Trump’s charity did not list the political donation on its annual tax filings. Instead, the disclosure form listed a donation to a Kansas charity with a similar name. A Trump Organization spokesman, Jeffrey McConney, told the Post three weeks ago that the incorrect listing “was just an honest mistake... It wasn’t done intentionally to hide a political donation, it was just an error.”Bondi said she never thought to return the donation, because “if I had returned it, you would have reported, ‘Bondi accepted bribe, got caught, and returned it.’”Trump’s financial support of Bondi did not stop with his improper $25,000 gift in 2013. The Huffington Post reported last week that Trump hosted a $3,000-per-person fundraiser for Bondi at his Palm Beach mansion, Mar-A-Lago, in March 2014. Trump and his daughter Ivanka also gave $500 each to Bondi’s campaign in fall 2013. And in 2014, the pair donated another $125,000 to the Florida Republican Party, which was Bondi’s single biggest source of campaign funds.Trump has openly bragged that he uses campaign contributions to get favors from politicians and has a long history of giving gifts to officials who make decisions that are helpful to him and his businesses. “I’ve got to give [campaign contributions] to them, because when I want something, I get it,” Trump said in January.But in this case, Trump says he donated money to support Bondi’s campaign simply because he likes her. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
31,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Pledges To Protect Elizabeth Warren's Consumer Agency In Letter To Wells Fargo Customers,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-wells-fargo_us_57e08b5ae4b0071a6e093458,"""I’ll fight hard to make sure that Wall Street is working for Main Street – not the other way around.""",2016-09-20,Hillary Clinton wrote an open letter to all Wells Fargo customers in the wake of the company's phantom account scandal.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e08d3c1800002f00315ae4.jpeg?cache=l8oqR2QjaP&ops=crop_0_130_4868_2931%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton is out with an open letter to Wells Fargo customers, pledging to protect the consumer watchdog set up by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) that uncovered the bank’s massive scam.“Our economy depends on a strong and safe banking system to help keep it moving,” Clinton writes in her letter. “But even after Americans spent years working hard to recover from the Great Recession, the culture of misconduct and recklessness that preceded that crisis too often persists.”This month, Wells Fargo was slapped with a $185 million fine for using customers’ personal information and money to sign them up for online banking services that the customers never asked for. Over at least the past five years, bank employees created more than 1.5 million sham checking accounts and applied for 565,000 credit cards. Many customers found out about the new accounts after they started accumulating fees. The largest part of that penalty, $100 million, was imposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which led the investigation of the bank. Elizabeth Warren proposed the agency in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Republican senators blocked her from becoming the agency’s full-time head; they now have the privilege of serving with her in the Senate. In a speech on Sept. 8, CFPB Director Richard Cordray explained that Wells Fargo allowed a culture to flourish where bank employees could misuse customer information to inflate their sales figures. Workers were under intense pressure to meet quotas.“Unchecked incentives can lead to serious consumer harm, and that is what happened here,” Cordray said. CFPB ended up being that final check. And in her letter to Wells Fargo customers Tuesday, Clinton said she will preserve the agency that Republicans are constantly trying to get rid of. “The unfair and abusive practices at Wells Fargo remind us that we need tough watchdogs looking out for customers,” Clinton states. “The CFPB worked with local authorities and enforced the law – assessing its highest penalty ever, and bringing the bank’s illegal activity into the national spotlight.”GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has promised to dismantle the 2010 financial regulatory law known as Dodd-Frank ― which created CFPB. “I won’t let them put the CFPB under their thumb,” Clinton writes. “I’ll protect the CFPB and make sure it can continue its essential work on behalf of the American people.”Wells Fargo, both the bank and its foundation, have given generously to the Clinton Foundation over the years. The bank has given between $10,001 and $25,000, and the foundation has given between $100,001 To $250,000. In 2011, former President Bill Clinton gave a speech to Wells Fargo for $200,000. “This is classic Hillary Clinton: publicly criticizing a company because it’s good politics while the Clinton Foundation quietly accepts hundreds of thousands of dollars from that same company,” said Jeff Bechdel, communications director of the conservative America Rising PAC. “If Clinton truly meant what she wrote, her letter would have been accompanied by a check from her family foundation returning the money from the company she is hypocritically complaining about.” Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf, along with Cordray and other officials, will testify before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday at 10 a.m. In his testimony, published by The New York Times, Stumpf says he is “deeply sorry” and takes “full responsibility” for the scandal.Read Clinton’s full letter:Dear Wells Fargo Customers,This piece has been updated with comment from America Rising."
