They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied ManbijMilitary Council told Reuters.“The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations,” Darwish said, adding militant sleeper cells in the city were still a threat.The SDF, with heavy air support from a U.S.-led coalition, said last week they had taken almost complete control of Manbij, where a small number of IS fighters had been holed up.The SDF’s offensive, which began at the end of May, aims to remove Islamic State from areas it controls along the Turkish border.The Manbij operation in which U.S. special forces have played a significant role on the ground marks the most ambitious advance by a group allied to Washington in Syria since the United States launched its military campaign against Islamic State two years ago.Manbij’s loss to the militants is a big blow as it is of strategic importance, serving as a conduit for transit of foreign jihadists and provisions coming from the Turkish border.Earlier the alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters grouped in the SDF said Friday’s operation was “the last operation and the last assault.”Darwish said earlier roughly 100 Islamic State fighters were left in the city center using civilians as human shields, some of whom were killed trying to flee.Reuters pictures showed residents being released from an Islamic State-held neighborhood on Friday and being welcomed by SDF forces.Kurdish sources and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors Syria’s five-year-old conflict, later said around 500 cars had left Manbij carrying Islamic State members and civilians. They were heading northeast towards Jarablus, a town under Islamic State control on the Turkish border, the Observatory said.The convoy carried the final Islamic State members leaving the city, under an agreement between the fighting parties that would not be announced officially, Kurdish sources and the monitor said, marking the end of the operation.The SDF’s campaign quickly captured the countryside surrounding Manbij, but slowed once fighting entered the city. The SDF said it had been avoiding a large-scale assault inside Manbijout of concern for civilians.Dozens of civilians, including children and women from Manbij who had fled the city at the height of the aerial strikes, were killed in suspected U.S. coalition air strikes last month, residents and monitors said.U.S. officials have said once the Manbij operation is completed, it would create the conditions to move on the militant group’s de facto capital of Raqqa. U.S. officials anticipate a tough battle.(Additional reporting by John Davison; Editing by Robin Pomeroy and James Dalgleish)"

Well, the covers may provide some vital clues.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ae1ba91700002600c72df5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Remember “The Baby-Sitters Club” series? Me too! Baby sitters! A club! A girl named Stacey! The very essence of ‘90s childhood.Okay, fine, I never read “The Baby-Sitters Club.” Somehow, in all my Scholastic Book Fair–attending, middle-grade library section-rummaging, Barnes and Noble gift card–using adolescence, it never occurred to me to crack one of those babies open. And now, when I see “Baby-Sitters Club” cover outfits ranked, or speculation on where the gals would be now, I feel like a real chump. Fortunately it’s way easy to fake having read the books. Look at those covers! A picture is worth a thousand words, and a “Baby-Sitters Club” cover design might be worth 10,000 words, so meaningful is every detail. (I assume.)This week, in celebration of the series’ 30th anniversary, I finally committed to catching up with all of my generational lady cohort. That’s right: I looked at every single cover of the original 35 books penned by Ann M. Martin herself, and guessed each plot. I now feel confident that I can hold my own with the biggest “BSC” superfan out there. Looking for a cheat sheet? Read on for the plot of every original “Baby-Sitters Club” book, based solely on their covers:Plot: Kristy has a ~super great~ idea to turn all of her friends’ chill group hangs into work instead. Everyone plays along because tbh, Kristy is the Blair Waldorf of this book cover (I think) and no one wants to piss off a chick with that level of headband game.Plot: To cope with the crushing emotional burden of acting as a mother figure to an apple-cheeked toddler who would definitely be the focus of a national news frenzy if she left the stroller in Blockbuster by accident, Claudia starts calling into a singles phone line called GhostLines. She develops a huge crush on the mysterious boy on the other end of the call — but she has a sneaking suspicion that he for real is a ghost! Uh oh. Hijinks ensue.Plot: Stacey seems like a nice golden-haired girl who doesn’t remotely require the flesh of prepubescent children to nourish her ravenous body and her wicked, wicked soul. But actually, she has been fattening up unsuspecting kids on bonbons and cinnamon rolls before devouring them to satisfy a cannibalistic hunger she alone can understand. It’s a very lonely life.Plot: Mary Anne wanders in from an American Girl book, specifically Molly Saves the Day. In “BSC” world, she has to win the Camp Gowonagin Color War without the benefit of her prescription glasses. She has to squint real hard to see anything, even objects right in front of her.Plot: Dawn thought she’d be baby-sitting, but instead she’s taking care of three young kids who present her with challenges like “having facial expressions” and “standing next to her.” Finally, realizing only inhuman monsters would do such things, she bravely slaughters them and restores the world’s equilibrium.Plot: Someone is getting married, maybe, but no one cares because the only reason anyone even wanted to have a wedding is so Kristy could wear a bridesmaid dress and a flower crown. Everyone wants to grow up to be just like Kristy, especially the bride.Plot: Claudia cusses out her sister Janine in front of a small boy, but it’s totally her sister’s fault because Janine was being so, like ugh, am I right? Plot: Stacey will do anything to get boys to notice her ― even kidnap small children she’s supposed to be baby-sitting to offer to the cutest boys as tribute. It totally works. Aww!Plot: There’s a ghost at Dawn’s house.Plot: Mary Anne is into a guy who ... dun dun DUNNN ... is somehow a baby sitter himself, a super-suspicious choice of male after-school jobs. She ignores the red flag because he’s got the fluffiest hair, but he turns out to be a total perv. I mean, just look at what he’s doing to that poor kid.Plot: There are girls with even sweeter headbands than Kristy, and they own the sidewalks every day when they take their noble hound and their fluffy cat (hmm) for a stroll. Kristy needs to walk her dog too. FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!Plot: There’s a new girl in town, and she doesn’t allow baby-sitting. Claudia defies this decree, but the new girl’s threat of painful arm twists are too much.Plot: Stacey is leaving forever, but also she’ll be back soon. Everyone is super bummed and smiling. This book is very, very short.Plot: Baby sitters have a private club, and for some reason a girl named Mallory wants in. They try to pull her hair out. Middle-schoolers are little sociopaths.Plot: A bunch of little girls have gathered for some innocent, if gender-normative, fun by dressing up in tiaras and pretending to be beauty queens. But an ominous figure lurks behind the curtain ... ready to strike. A little trivia: This book was later adapted into a movie called “Drop Dead Gorgeous”!Plot: Jessi is a secret agent, and she’s learning a secret language to secretly report back to other operatives about the very important little boy she’s baby-sitting. Why? IT’S A SECRET.Plot: Mary Anne is a mysterious curse on helpless people around her, who are mysteriously injured in her presence. Why? IT’S A MYSTERY. And maybe she’s not a very good baby sitter.Plot: Before the big museum field trip, Stacey has been telling everyone that her favorite dinosaur is the triceratops. When she finally arrives at what she thinks is the triceratops exhibit, the sign says that it’s a brontosaurus. YIKES. Stacey is humiliated in front of all her friends.Plot: Oops! Claudia breaks her own leg to make her friends LOL, but in the process she makes herself vulnerable to velociraptor attacks after a nearby “Jurassic Park”-style laboratory suffers a security breach.Plot: This instructional book helps young readers learn about “walking disasters” by quizzing them on which person in a series of tableaux is the “walking disaster.” Which one is the walking disaster on the cover scene? You’ll have to read the book to find out!Plot: Mallory has twins. Her life becomes a hellscape of vomit, soiled diapers, tantrums and regret.Plot: A day in the life of a pet sitter, who cares for pets such as dogs, fish, bunny rabbits, human toddlers, ferrets and cats while their owners are out of town.Plot: Being at the beach has changed Dawn. Sun-kissed skin so hot, she’ll melt your popsicle, especially after she becomes best friends with Snoop Dogg!!Plot: Kristy forgot about Mother’s Day and goes to a carnival instead. Plot: Mary Anne is close friends with Tigger from Winnie the Pooh. When he runs away, Mary Anne leads the search party until Tigger is found in a big city flophouse, high on cocaine. That’s just the kind of friend she is.Plot: Claudia is halfway to being an adult and no one has told her about death yet, nor has she managed to figure it out on her own. This is pretty embarrassing. Fortunately Claudia’s grandma, probably, is able to sit her down and say “goodbye forever” before she dies. Warning for sad emotions!Plot: Eek! Jessi’s perfectly nice game of badminton is ruined when a TV star comes to town and she’s distracted by swooning over his hot bod. Thanks to the resulting leadership void, her badminton team falls into utter disarray, and they lose the tournament. Having caught the eye of the TV star, Jessi realizes too late that he’s a total narcissist ― after she’s run away with him to Thailand. How’s she gonna get out of this mess?Plot: Stacey has returned home to die.Plot: Mallory and the other baby sitters show a total lack of respect for other people’s privacy: A cautionary tale.Plot: Someone is getting married, maybe, but no one cares because this is Mary Anne’s big day. Plot: This book was later adapted into a Disney animated film, “Cinderella.”Plot: Susan plays piano. What a dweeb.Plot: Claudia suffers a delusive break from reality in which she becomes convinced she is the biological descendent of a wealthy and powerful royal family. Her parents are forced to send her to an in-patient psychiatric center for intensive treatment. It’s very painful for everyone.Plot: Mary Anne knows a place where the grass is really greener. Warm, wet and wild, there must be something in the water ... and all the boys are trying to sneak a peek at her. Except for the two very young boys she is acting as a primary caretaker for. Mary Anne has a crazy and sexually liberated spring break, which IS NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF, but her employers do relieve her of her baby-sitting duties for making out with too many dudes while she’s supposed to be on amateur lifeguard duty.Plot: Stacey has been Nancy Drew this whole goddamn time.Hit Backspace for a regular dose of pop culture nostalgia."

Saudi Arabia and its allies have launched thousands of air strikes against the Houthis since they drove the internationally recognized government into exile in March 2015.“@MSF received today 21 injured & 10 deaths in Haydan #Saada. All were under 15 years old,”said the medical aid group, also known as Doctors Without Borders, on its official Twitter account.Mohammed Abdul-Salam, a senior official from the Houthi movement whose main support base is in Saada, blamed the attack on the mostly Gulf Arab military coalition that has been at war with the group for over a year.At least 6,400 people have been killed in the conflict, around half of them civilians.The armed Houthis and their allies in the General People’s Congress (GPC) party headed by powerful ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh control the capital Sanaa and have so far withstood the coalition campaign.President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his internationally recognized government view them as putschists after they took the capital by force in September 2014 and have warned them against seeking to legitimize their rule through parliament.In a statement carried on the state news agency Saba, Hadi called the parliament session illegal and warned that MPs attending it could be prosecuted as criminals.After U.N.-backed peace talks to end the war collapsed last week, the Houthis and the GPC set up a governing council to rule the country despite U.N. and government opposition.The assembly convened within earshot of bombings by Saudi-led warplanes on military bases several miles away"

I stand by it and I really look forward to giving blood.”",2016-08-13,"ORLANDO, FLORIDA - JUNE 12: People wait in line to donate blood at the OneBlood Donation Center for the victims of a terror attack on June 12, 2016 in Orlando, Florida. 50 people are reported dead and 53 were injured at a mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in what is now the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The suspected shooter, Omar Mateen, was shot and killed by police. (Photo by Gerardo Mora/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ae05ed1800002100bca77d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Twenty-one year old Jay Franzone wants to donate blood. Yet as a gay man, he’s legally banned from doing so because of a policy he calls “crazy” and “archaic” that unfairly discriminates against queer men. So, in order to do so ― and to take a stand against the the policy ― he’s taken a vow of abstinence for an entire year. That one-year marker is because of a 2015 Federal Drug Administration policy that bans any man from donating blood for 12 months since the last time they had sex with another man (it also bans any woman who has had sex with a man who has had sexual relations with a man in the last year). Prior to that, a lifetime ban against these men had been implemented in the 1980s near the start of the AIDS epidemic.“The FDA’s definition of sexual contact is oral, anal or vaginal sex, so it’s so overly-inclusive based on what we know HIV to be transmitted through,” Franzone told HuffPost’s Noah Michelson. “And so most high school gay people, they can never donate blood and they can’t go to Six Flags and get the free ticket. And so it’s that stigma there but it’s also then you can’t give blood, you can’t save lives and it kind of hurts.”In January, shortly after the FDA changed its policy, Franzone embarked on his year of abstinence. It’s not something he wants to do by any means, but it’s what men who have sex with men are forced into if they want to donate blood. “For me, I have friends who are always like, ‘Oh I want to go to the Himalayas’ or ‘I want to go climb Mt. Everest,’” he said. “And I want to give blood.”At the time of his decision, Franzone wasn’t in a relationship but he started dating someone in March. The conversation about his decision to abstain from sex organically came up between the two of them while at a TED Talk about health care. Franzone’s boyfriend “was fully supportive and really encouraging.”“It was kind of like ‘Well then why are we going to have sex? You should keep doing this,’” Franzone said, recalling the conversation with his then-boyfriend. The two have since broken up, but removing sex from their relationship was a “powerful” experience, Franzone said. It enabled them to get to know each other in a different capacity. “It wasn’t us trying to run to each other’s rooms,” Franzone said. “It was us exploring the city and knowing each other and getting to know each other’s lives, which was really really cool and something that I think I can take away from this experience and hopefully bring to future relationships where I’m not staying abstinent for a year.”Public outrage and conversations over queer men’s ineligibility to donate blood were reignited in June after a massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida left 49 people dead and 53 people injured. There was a massive need for blood donations to help the wounded but so many within the LGBTQ community were banned from giving. “It’s like a terrible irony that our community’s hit and then we can’t give blood to help them,” Franzone said. Franzone, who will graduate from Lasell College in the fall with a political communications degree, is focused on ending the ban in a professional capacity as the director of communications for the National Gay Blood Drive. Members of Congress and lawmakers have also called on the FDA to change its policy to make it less discriminatory.Franzone said there needs to be more public awareness and outrage about the “archaic” policy and how current technology can test for HIV in just 10 days. “Once you’re infected, you can get a result in 10 days and that’s fully accurate with nucleic acid testing so we’re testing for the DNA of the virus,” he said. “Before in the ‘80s, it took months, 56 days, for an HIV test to come back. So looking at the science and also realizing this is about risk. This isn’t about sexual orientation.”Over his coming months of abstinence, dating isn’t out of the cards for Franzone, who went public about his decision after the Orlando shooting. “There’s so many other things you can do,” he said. But for now, Franzone is thinking big picture until the year is up. “I’m kind of putting it on my forehead and being very upfront with this because this isn’t something that I want to hide,” Franzone said. “I’m proud of my decision. I stand by it and I really look forward to giving blood.”Watch the full conversation with Jay Franzone below:"

But it made no mention of the other highly intelligent cetaceans — beluga whales and dolphins — that live at SeaWorld parks.Critics of SeaWorld, spurred by the 2013 documentary “Blackfish,” have largely focused on the park’s iconic orcas, saying that life in a tank is cruel and stressful for such large and intelligent animals.But animal advocacy groups note that beluga whales and dolphins — both of which are kept at SeaWorld parks — suffer similarly when kept in captivity for human entertainment. In 2014, conservationist Jane Goodall called captive beluga whale breeding programs “no longer defensible by science.” She wrote in an open letter to the Vancouver Aquarium that the highly social, intelligent species cannot “thrive and achieve good welfare” in an aquarium environment.The father of the newborn calf at SeaWorld San Antonio is a male named Imaq who was transported to the Texas park from Vancouver, Canada. The nonprofit Whale and Dolphin Conservation has noted that transportation is highly stressful for belugas.Former SeaWorld employee Sarah Fischbeck painted a chilling picture of SeaWorld’s beluga breeding protocol in a December interview with The Dodo.Fischbeck said the park repeatedly bred a female beluga named Ruby, even though she repeatedly tried to kill her own offspring. When a miscarriage caused Ruby to become fatally ill in 2014, Fischbeck alleges the park put her out in a small pool alone, out of sight.The current state of beluga and dolphin breeding programs SeaWorld — and whether the company has any plans to phase them out — is unclear and they did not immediately reply to a request for comment from The Huffington Post. A dolphin calf was born at SeaWorld San Diego in October, and a 3-week-old beluga born prematurely at SeaWorld San Antonio died in July 2015.This article has been updated to indicate that the beluga whale calf born in July was born last year."

Most of the time, we provide our own rant at the end of the column, on a subject too big to be contained in talking points. This week, we provide a number of rants from Republicans about their very own party's presidential nominee. Yes, it's only August and the Republican Party is coming apart at the seams. Which, of course, makes for great summertime reading for all!Before we get to all the Republican-on-Republican violence, though, we've got to cast an eye over the week that was. If there's one thing that is unmistakably true about Donald Trump it is that he just can't help himself. You can read that literally -- nothing he seems to do ever improves his standing with the general electorate -- or as a metaphor for Trump's inability to stop saying silly and outrageous things in public. Either way, Trump certainly does pack a lot into a single campaign week, and can probably be expected to continue doing so right up to Election Day.This was (as were many other previous weeks in the campaign calendar) supposed to be the week when Donald Trump successfully ""pivoted"" and turned everything around. To say that didn't happen would be an understatement. Hillary Clinton had a mini-scandal break that even involved emails, and yet it was barely a story in the political world (the emails weren't all that damning, even to anti-Clinton types) -- because Trump was, once again, sucking up all the oxygen.Trump started the week off with a serious, read-from-a-TelePrompTer speech on the economy. This was the big pivot, folks! Everyone look -- Trump's being serious. Right up until he mispronounced the word ""cities,"" inexplicably replacing the ""c"" with a ""t."" So much for being serious.Later in the week, Trump claimed that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton got together a few years ago and said to each other: ""Hey, we've got some free time, why not start a jihadist group in Iran and Syria?"" No, really -- Trump claimed both Obama and Clinton were not only ""founders"" of the Islamic State, but apparently also that the Islamic State has somehow become a sports league who hands out ""most valuable player"" awards -- which would, of course, go to Obama and Clinton. Got all that? When gently asked to perhaps rephrase his statement a bit, Trump (of course) declined.Trump also proposed during the week that U.S. civilians accused of terrorism either be sent to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or be tried in military tribunals. This remark, while shockingly unconstitutional, kind of got lost in the whirlwind, though.Much more attention was paid to Trump using the ""Second Amendment people"" dog-whistle to a crowd, suggesting that perhaps guns would be the best answer if President Hillary Clinton ever started trying to appoint federal judges.Once again, any one of these statements would have been a career-ender for just about any political candidate imaginable, but then Donald Trump is beyond ""imaginable"" and always has been.Trump utterly blew his planned pivot to seriousness, pretty much all week long. He even blew a chance to rip into Clinton for having the Orlando shooter's father behind her at a rally -- while congressional-page-enthusiast Mark Foley was sitting right behind Trump. It's like we've all fallen into a bad Hollywood script that would never have been greenlighted for a movie, or something.While Trump continues to absolutely tank in the polls (including all of the swing states he would need to claim victory), the Republican National Committee is apparently getting a wee bit nervous. They're holding what is being described as a ""come to Jesus"" meeting with Trump campaign staffers today, so who knows what will happen next? Some prominent Republicans are already publicly calling for the R.N.C. to direct all its money away from Trump and instead towards desperately trying to hold onto some Senate and House seats, but we'll get to that in the talking points section.Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's campaign has pulled all advertising out of Virginia and Colorado, because they consider those two swing states in the bag for Clinton. Instead, they're expanding operations in (are you sitting down?) Arizona and Georgia. No wonder some Republicans are already darkly muttering about the impending landslide that's going to bury Trump. Hillary Clinton even wrote an op-ed for a Utah paper, a formerly reddest-of-the-red state that could also flip for her.Team Clinton is almost gleeful in their triangulation plans, at this point. Hillary is reaching out to Republican voters everywhere, but in doing so she risks generating some backlash among progressives, who already mistrust her. But the confidence being exuded by the Clinton campaign is palpable, and today Hillary released her 2015 tax return while taunting Trump to do the same (with a new ""What's he trying to hide"" ad).All that, in one week. Whew! And it's only August... things will undoubtedly speed up even further in the coming months. But for now, let's move right along to the awards.Senator Bernie Sanders gets a Honorable Mention this week, for clearly denouncing the decision made this week by the Drug Enforcement Agency to keep marijuana on Schedule I, a definition that includes the phrase ""has no currently accepted medical use"" -- even though half of the United States have now legalized medicinal use. Sanders is also co-sponsor in the Senate of a bill that would throw the legal issue to the states once and for all. See my column from yesterday for more details about this backward-facing decision, but it's good to see a politician who isn't afraid to get on the right side of history in such fashion.But the Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week this week goes to none other than President Obama. What with everyone intensely watching all the polling surrounding the presidential race, Obama's job approval numbers haven't been in the news of late. They should be, however.This week, on the Real Clear Politics tracking page, Obama sits at 51.9 percent approval from the public, with only 44.2 percent disapproval. Those are better numbers than he's seen since the second month of his second term, three-and-a-half years ago. Obama not only has been rising all year long, but he also got a convention ""bump"" in the polls on top of it. This should cheer up Hillary Clinton, because presidential job approval polling is very predictive of who will win in November. If Obama keeps his numbers above 50 until then -- as now seems entirely possible -- then Clinton might just be a shoo-in.There's a simple explanation for this trend. It's not because of some big legislative victory Obama just won in Congress (Congress has barely done anything this year). It's not because of some dramatic foreign or domestic policy win, either. Obama is rising in the public's estimation because people are now being seriously confronted with the two candidates who might be our next president. In other words, the more the public pays attention to the 2016 campaign, the better they think of the job Barack Obama is doing.One of the most amusing moments at the Democratic National Convention was hearing, during President Obama's speech, several shouts of ""Four more years!"" (even though this is constitutionally impossible). It seems a whole lot of other people are going to miss Obama when he's gone, and his spike upwards in the polls to almost 52 percent approval wins President Obama this week's Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week.[Congratulate President Barack Obama via the White House contact page, to let him know you appreciate his efforts.]We almost didn't have anyone to give this week's Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award, but one really stupid gaffe caught our eye at the last moment.Congressman Patrick Murphy is running in the Democratic primary in Florida to be the Democrat to take on Marco Rubio. While criticizing Donald Trump (and his ""hatred and fear-mongering""), Murphy had the following to say, to Jorge Ramos:We are stronger as one, as a united country. That's what makes this country so beautiful and so unique. You know, you think of the Statue of Liberty, right? And all of us. I'm an immigrant. We're all basically immigrants here. And you think of that beacon of hope, of opportunity, and Trump is tearing that apart. And that is scary to me.Except that he's not actually an immigrant. From his own official biography page, he was ""born and raised in Florida, spending most of his childhood along the South Florida coast."" He's also already gotten into trouble about exaggerating his own history during his campaign -- which would tend to make you a lot more careful about what you say, you would think.Reasonable people can interpret this as a weak attempt at a sweeping statement. ""I'm an immigrant,"" Murphy says, in the same spirit that we were all Charlie Hebdo, in other words. ""Most Americans are,"" Murphy might have said, ""if you go back far enough in their family, immigrants."" Unfortunately he didn't say that. He said ""I'm an immigrant"" when he most decidedly is not one. In Florida, where a lot of people care about that particular distinction.This was a stumble, not an enormous fall. As we said, it almost doesn't even reach the level of the MDDOTW award, but for his political misstatement he was more disappointing than any other Democrat this week, so we decided to go ahead and give Murphy the award anyway.[Contact Representative Patrick Murphy on his House contact page, to let him know what you think of his actions.]Volume 403 (8/12/16)It is extraordinarily rare for prominent members of a political party to publicly denounce their chosen presidential nominee. It's so rare in normal elections that it becomes big news immediately. This election, however, it has become almost commonplace for Republicans to repudiate Donald Trump's candidacy. As a mark of how commonplace it is, we had not just one scathing indictment of Trump and his campaign this week, but three.The first is from Republican Senator Susan Collins, of Maine, who penned an op-ed piece in the Washington Post, explaining why she cannot bring herself to vote for or support her party's nominee. The second was from a group of 50 national security professionals stretching from the Nixon administration to the Cheney administration (whoops, we meant to say the ""Bush administration,"" obviously). Kidding aside, these are the serious foreign policy types on the right, and they not only stated they weren't going to vote for Trump, they predicted that if he wins he will be ""the most reckless President in American history."" And the third public evisceration of Trump came from 70 Republicans who called on the Republican National Committee to ""immediately halt all support for Donald Trump and invest its resources in a real and winnable campaign to save the Republican Senate and House.""So with that wealth of anti-Trump material coming from his own party, it seems almost redundant to come up with Democratic talking points this week. There is plenty of material available -- just in the past week alone -- that badmouths Trump worse than we could hope to do. So we're just going to provide excerpts from these three documents, with a bonus quote at the end, just for the heck of it.Senator Susan CollinsSenator Collins started her opinion piece off with a flat statement: ""I will not be voting for Donald Trump for president."" She explains how she struggled with this decision, but Donald Trump just made it harder and harder for her to explain away his own behavior.With the passage of time, I have become increasingly dismayed by his constant stream of cruel comments and his inability to admit error or apologize. But it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing -- either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level -- that revealed Mr. Trump as unworthy of being our president.Collins then lists her three incidents -- Trump mocking a reporter for his disability, Trump stating that a judge born in Indiana couldn't possibly be fair to him because of his ""Mexican heritage,"" and Trump's attacks on the Gold Star parents who appeared at the Democratic National Convention. Each time, says Collins, she ""waited in vain for Mr. Trump to retract his words."" Then she begins painting a larger picture.I am also deeply concerned that Mr. Trump's lack of self-restraint and his barrage of ill-informed comments would make an already perilous world even more so. It is reckless for a presidential candidate to publicly raise doubts about honoring treaty commitments with our allies. Mr. Trump's tendency to lash out when challenged further escalates the possibility of disputes spinning dangerously out of control.Pretty harsh, but this was actually the kindest towards Trump of the three documents released this week. Which brings us to the next one, from the foreign policy experts.National security officials' letterThis extraordinary letter also starts off (after an introductory paragraph explaining who the group is) with a blanket statement: ""None of us will vote for Donald Trump."" Once again, these are all Republicans, not some partisan sniping by Democrats. This letter minces no words whatsoever.From a foreign policy perspective, Donald Trump is not qualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief. Indeed, we are convinced that he would be a dangerous President and would put at risk our country's national security and well-being.The letter ends by first explaining all the qualities and temperament necessary for any president (willing to listen to advisors, acknowledge errors, be disciplined, etc.). Then it tears into how far Trump falls short:In our judgment, Mr. Trump has none of these critical qualities. He is unable or unwilling to separate truth from falsehood. He does not encourage conflicting views. He lacks self-control and acts impetuously. He cannot tolerate personal criticism. He has alarmed our closest allies with his erratic behavior. All of these are dangerous qualities in an individual who aspires to be President and Commander-in-Chief, with command of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.C'mon, guys, tell us what you really think! Sorry, but at some point you just have to laugh at the language fellow Republicans are using against their own candidate. This letter lays out one targeted idea -- Trump being unfit to handle foreign policy -- while the next brings a very different focus.Begging the RNC to bail on TrumpThe third letter is entirely political in nature, since it was addressed to Reince Priebus and the Republican National Committee. It begs the R.N.C. to ditch Trump in no uncertain terms, from the second paragraph onwards.Given the catastrophic impact that Donald Trump's losing presidential campaign will have on down-ballot Senate and House races, we urge you to immediately suspend all discretionary RNC support for Trump and focus the entirety of the RNC's available resources on preserving the GOP's congressional majorities.They have already given up on winning the White House, obviously, and are now terrified that they are facing a disastrous landslide in November.We believe that Donald Trump's divisiveness, recklessness, incompetence, and record-breaking unpopularity risk turning this election into a Democratic landslide, and only the immediate shift of all available RNC resources to vulnerable Senate and House races will prevent the GOP from drowning with a Trump-emblazoned anchor around its neck.""Evaporating by the day"" -- that has a nice ring to it, don't you think? The letter then lists all the reasons why Trump has already ""alienated millions of voters of all parties,"" most of which are specific but also including a few catchall items on the list, such as: ""Exposing his total ignorance of basic foreign policy matters,"" and: ""Deliberately and repeatedly lying about scores of issues, large and small."" They even slam Trump for not releasing his tax forms, then continue in the same vein.Those recent outrages have built on his campaign of anger and exclusion, during which he has mocked and offended millions of voters, including the disabled, women, Muslims, immigrants, and minorities. He also has shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies, including threats to ban an entire religion from entering the country, order the military to break the law by torturing prisoners, kill the families of suspected terrorists, track law-abiding Muslim citizens in databases, and use executive orders to implement other illegal and unconstitutional measures.Since it's a letter with a political focus, it then turns to the dismal polling they've been seeing:[C]urrent polling gives Trump barely a 15 percent chance of being elected president in November. That polling projects a potential 350 electoral vote blowout for Hillary Clinton, including a sweep of every battleground state from Florida to Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Colorado, Virginia, and North Carolina. Trump's across-the-board collapse has put even Republican bastions like Georgia and Arizona in play.That's a pretty apocalyptic statement for the beginning of August! It's understandable when people get nervous a few weeks out from an election, but the general election has barely begun, and these Republicans are already worried about Hillary Clinton getting 350 electoral votes.The letter then itemizes Trump's refusal to support members of the Republican Party, which includes things like calling an ""incumbent Republican Senator a 'loser' to his Senate peers,"" and ""Repeating his false and outlandish claims that yet another Senator's father played some role in the Kennedy assassination."" This leads them to an extraordinary conclusion -- again, it is only early August.In summary, every dollar spent by the RNC on Donald Trump's campaign is a dollar of donor money wasted on the losing effort of a candidate who has actively undermined the GOP at every turn. Rather than throwing good money after bad, the RNC should shift its strategy and its resources to convince voters not to give Hillary Clinton the ""blank check"" of a Democrat-controlled Congress to advance her big government agenda.Rick Wilson minces no wordsAll of that was pretty scathing, we've got to admit. Republican-on-Republican violence is never pretty to watch, to put it mildly. But when reading an article in Salon which detailed how many extreme rightwing strategists and media types have denounced Trump, the following really stood out. We close today with the thoughts of Rick Wilson, ""GOP strategist.""I have opposed Trump from the first day of his wretched, crapulous campaign. I have opposed Trump when his clownish minions called my clients seeking to have me fired. I have opposed The Donald when his slavish of Trumpbart stooges ran story after story attacking me, and unleashed their fever-swamp yokels on my email, my phone and my family.Chris Weigant blogs at:Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"
9,POLITICS,"EPA Fracking Report Needs Some Big Revisions, Says Science Advisory Board",Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/epa-fracking-study-science_us_57ae3dfbe4b0718404118678,"This letter is pretty scathing, for scientists at least.",2016-08-12,The Environmental Protection Agency's Science Advisory Board told Administrator Gina McCarthy that it has concerns about several of the findings in an agency report on hydraulic fracturing.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ae3f9f170000ae02c72eae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Environmental Protection Agency’s Science Advisory Board released a review of a major agency report on hydraulic fracturing’s potential impacts on groundwater, and it took to task the way the report’s findings were framed.Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a process used to extract oil and gas from rock formations using a high-pressure stream of water, sand and chemicals. The EPA’s draft report, which was released in June 2015, found “specific instances” of groundwater contamination from fracked oil and natural gas wells or wastewater disposal sites, but the agency concluded that there are no “widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources.”Of course, everyone who has an opinion on fracking thought that report said what they wanted it to say: Fracking opponents pointed to the documented instances of contamination, while its boosters said that the lack of systemic effects shows the technology is generally safe.But the EPA’s Science Advisory Board, an independent body that exists to review the agency’s research programs and provide the administrator with advice, said in a letter to Administrator Gina McCarthy Thursday that it has concerns about the “clarity and adequacy of support” for several of the report’s major findings.The SAB is concerned that these major findings as presented within the Executive Summary are ambiguous and appear inconsistent with the observations, data, and levels of uncertainty presented and discussed in the body of the draft Assessment Report. Of particular concern in this regard is the high level conclusion statement on page ES-6 that “We did not find evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States.” The SAB finds that the EPA did not support quantitatively its conclusion about lack of evidence for widespread, systemic impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, and did not clearly describe the system(s) of interest (e.g., groundwater, surface water), the scale of impacts (i.e., local or regional), nor the definitions of “systemic” and “widespread.” The letter notes that the public could interpret that particular line in many different ways, and in fact already has. It suggests that the EPA revise how the findings are described in the report’s executive summary, and more clearly link them to the actual evidence provided in the full report. The board also wants the agency to better describe the limitations on the data collection and uncertainties in the findings. And it recommends that the agency more clearly lay out the places where it did find evidence of local impacts on groundwater and any conclusions that can be reached about them.Of course, environmental groups say the advisory board’s report reaffirms what they’ve been saying all along ― “The EPA’s own analysis shows that dirty oil and gas fracking contaminates drinking water, confirming what millions of Americans already know,” as Lena Moffitt, director of the Sierra Club’s Dirty Fuels initiative, said in a statement. And energy groups say it’s no big deal ― the scientific advisory board agrees with them that it’s safe. "
10,POLITICS,Mitch McConnell Issues Sternest Warning Yet That GOP Is In Danger Of Losing Senate,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-gop-danger-losing-senate_us_57adeb37e4b069e7e504d9aa,He said the party’s chances of keeping control of the Senate are “very dicey.”,2016-08-12,Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is not confident about the GOP's chances of controlling the Senate after the November election.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57adeb941700002c00d1e662.jpeg?cache=0H5FWGahTj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is not optimistic that he will be in charge of the Senate come November ― and Donald Trump, he implied, is not helping matters.McConnell told a civic group in Kentucky on Thursday that the chances of the GOP retaining control of the Senate were “very dicey,” the Associated Press reported. The party’s Senate majority was always going to be tenuous this year, according to McConnell, with 24 Republican-held seats up for grabs, compared to just 10 Democratic-held seats.Losing the Senate would severely limit Republicans’ power “to impact judicial appointments,” McConnell cautioned. It was a clear warning that the Senate must remain a priority regardless of the outcome of the presidential race.McConnell did not explicitly blame the GOP presidential nominee for harming the party’s Senate candidates, but he did criticize Trump’s campaign tactics and said he hopes he “settles down and follows the script.”It’s clear neither Trump nor Hillary Clinton is “widely appealing to the American people,” he added. Trump is tanking in the polls after a miserable few weeks that have been riddled with offensive remarks and other blunders, including a chaotic Republican National Convention in July.The latest Trump-related controversy came this week, when the candidate insisted President Barack Obama was a “founder” of ISIS. On Friday, Trump claimed the statement had been sarcastic.Earlier in the week, the real estate mogul drew widespread condemnation for saying “Second Amendment people” could stop Clinton from appointing judges, a remark may interpreted as a veiled threat of violence.Many Republicans in contentious congressional races are openly distancing themselves from Trump. McConnell has criticized Trump’s most outrageous comments but ― like other top Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) ― continues to endorse him. However, The New York Times reported in February that McConnell had a contingency plan in place should Trump win the nomination ― and become a liability for Republicans down the ballot. In such a scenario, McConnell argued, the GOP could limit its losses by keeping the candidate at arm’s length.“We will drop him like a hot rock,” McConnell reportedly told Senate colleagues at the time.Of course, Republicans losing control of the Senate may be even more dire for the party partly because of a decision McConnell made earlier this year: He refused to consider Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.Garland is widely considered a centrist. If Clinton wins the general election and Republicans lose the Senate, the next nominee may be far more liberal."
11,ARTS & CULTURE,This Hallucinatory 1970s Sculpture Garden Brings The Tarot Deck To Life,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/niki-de-st-phalle-tarot-garden_us_57acedbee4b007c36e4de29e,"All hail Niki de Saint Phalle, feminist artist and a true goddess.",2016-08-12,"Museum worker Rainer Hinriksen adjusts the sculpture ""Le Temoin"" (The Witness) by French artist Niki de Saint Phalle (1930-2002) in the museum at Gottorf Castle in Schleswig, northern Germany, on Thursday, Feb.19, 2009.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57add20e170000d002d1e602.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you walk into the Italian village of Capalbio in Tuscany, you may have the strange sensation that you’ve suddenly shrunk. Massive, globular forms of divine goddesses and strange beasts tower overhead, made from ceramic tiles, mirror and glass. Sprawling women with glittering blue hair and heart-shaped nipples gossip with a tree with coiling serpents for branches. There are 22 works in artist Niki de Saint Phalle’s ambitious sculpture garden, each representing a Major Arcana card in the tarot deck. Out of the 78 total cards in the Tarot, the Major cards represent the formative experiences of life ― those that rip the individual out of their banal, daily existence and thrust them into incidents of transformation, growth, and understanding.There’s the Empress, the embodiment of fertility and sensuality, who wears the universe as her jewelry. There’s the Hermit, who symbolizes one who escapes the social world to gain inner knowledge and wisdom. And there’s Death, the symbol for transformation, leaving an old self behind. The artist underwent a major transformation herself before embarking on the Tarot Garden. She was born to an aristocratic family in Paris, who relocated to the Upper East Side when she was a toddler. At 11, Saint Phalle was molested by her father. At 17, she was recruited to become a fashion model. At 18, she was married. Soon after, she was in a mental asylum, wanting a fresh start. Saint Phalle embarked on the Tarot project in the late 1970s, 20 years after her stay in a psychiatric hospital. Her husband committed her after she’d attacked his mistress and swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. Art healed her, and Saint Phalle wanted to spread the gift of creative healing to others. Determined to change the course of her life, Saint Phalle left her husband and children to make a career for herself as an artist. A member of an aristocratic family with her fair share of wealthy friends, Saint Phalle dreamed big. Really big. “I’m following a course that was chosen for me, following a pressing need to show that a woman can work on a monumental scale,” she wrote in a letter describing her vision. The artist’s signature artistic tropes were what she dubbed Nanas ― gigantic, bulbous, colorful women with small heads and big curves, towering divas, dancing and posing joyfully with psychedelic rainbow garb. “I think that I made them so large so that men would look very small next to them,” Saint Phalle once told an interviewer. The Nanas appear in the Tarot Garden, along with a variety of other monstrous forms that defy easy categorization. The garden was finally completed in 1998, after almost 30 years of work and $5 million. Saint Phalle enlisted various volunteers to assist her throughout her process, though the vision remained inexorably hers. The hallucinatory vision wasn’t initially popular in the idyllic countryside village in which it popped up, rather strangely. But now people travel the world to cohort with the chromatic Nanas and whispering snakes, to feel the overwhelming power and healing presence of art."
12,POLITICS,Conservative Legal Scholars Prefer A Liberal Supreme Court To A President Trump,Michelle Fields,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservative-legal-scholars-prefer-a-liberal-supreme-court-to-a-president-trump_us_57ade55fe4b069e7e504d4d3,"“The court is important, to be sure -- but not nearly that important.""",2016-08-12,Conservative legal luminaries distancing themselves from Donald Trump could potentially undermine one of the few remaining threads tying him to the GOP establishment.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57adeaf6170000d002d1e65f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some Republicans have argued that conservatives skeptical of Donald Trump should vote for him anyway, if only to prevent Hillary Clinton from nominating liberals to the Supreme Court. But the right’s leading legal scholars reject that idea: the risks of a President Trump would outweigh his influence on the high court.“The only glimmer of hope in the Trump fiasco” is the list of 11 judges the candidate put forward as suitable Supreme Court nominees, said Richard Epstein, a Hoover Institution Fellow and professor at both New York University School of Law and the University of Chicago Law School. But that is based “on the questionable assumption that a man of his mercurial temperament and intellectual ignorance will keep to his word,” he said.Even if a President Trump did honor that promise, “influence on the courts take time, and foreign affairs and domestic crises come up immediately,” Epstein said. And that’s not a risk the highly respected conservative legal scholar thinks is worth taking. “He is wholly unfit to deal with either of these two areas. In all other matters he is deficient,” Epstein added.In May, Trump’s campaign released the list of judges he would consider nominating to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. It was an attempt to appease conservative critics (though he later said he reserved the right to nominate someone not on the list). The list included six federal appeals court judges that then-President George W. Bush appointed and five state supreme court judges Republican governors selected. Conservatives in the media and in Congress roundly praised Trump’s list. Yet many right-leaning legal scholars tell The Huffington Post that, as important as the Supreme Court may be, it does not override all other issues when considering his candidacy. “The Supreme Court—and judicial appointments more broadly—is probably the single best reason to vote for Trump,” said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute. “But even then, there’s a lot of uncertainty. How hard would Trump push to get a nominee confirmed? What would he do if his first choice were rejected? Would he make a ‘fabulous deal’ to trade judicial appointments for other priorities?”“Trump put out a genuinely excellent list of potential appointees, but how much can we trust that list?” Shapiro continued. “Even Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, who were committed to appointing principled originalists and textualists, made mistakes; how would a president who knows nothing about the Constitution and thinks that judges ‘sign bills’ fare?”These conservative legal luminaries distancing themselves from Trump has the potential to undermine one of the few remaining threads tying the candidate to the Republican establishment. For some senators, it may give an additional push to allow consideration of President Barack Obama’s nominee to the court, Merrick Garland, based on the belief that he would be better than any potential Clinton pick.Trump, however, remains confident that skeptical Republicans will inevitably vote for him out of concern for the ideological makeup of the Supreme Court.“Even if people don’t like me, they have to vote for me. They have no choice,” Trump said in July. “Even if you can’t stand Donald Trump, even if you think I’m the worst, you’re going to vote for me. You know why? Justices of the Supreme Court.”Some conservatives, like radio host Hugh Hewitt, agree with Trump. Hewitt, who himself teaches constitutional law, argued in July that voting for Trump is a no-brainer because, “It’s the Supreme Court, stupid.” He suggested that if conservatives have “any doubts at all,” they should “take a course in con law.” “If Hillary wins, the casebook you use to do so will simply be a history book, not a guide to how the Supreme Court should decide things based on precedent,” he wrote in his column for The Washington Examiner.Prominent theology professor Wayne Grudem, of the Phoenix Seminary in Arizona, made a similar point. He wrote that a Clinton presidency would lead to an America that would, “no longer be ruled by the people and their elected representatives, but by unelected, unaccountable, activist judges who would dictate from the bench about whatever they were pleased to decree.”But many of the country’s top right-leaning legal scholars ― the people who understand the importance of the Supreme Court more than anyone ― just don’t find that argument compelling. “The court is important, to be sure ― but not nearly that important,” said retired Temple University Law School Professor David Post, who now writes for the conservative website the Volokh Conspiracy. “With all due respect to my colleagues who might feel differently, this one strikes me as a no-brainer.” The next president might end up only filling a single seat on the court, Post said. “The idea that it makes sense to trade a single justice for all of Trump’s terrible baggage ― his bullying, his ignorance, his appalling tendency to shoot his mouth off without thinking, and all the rest of it ― strikes me as thoroughly preposterous,” he added.Ilya Somin, who teaches law at George Mason University and also blogs for the Volokh Conspiracy, argues that a Trump presidency might even be worse for the courts than a Clinton one.“Trump has a terrible record on constitutional issues,” he said. “He seeks to gut freedom of speech and constitutional property rights, and undermine constitutional constraints on executive power even more than Bush and Obama have.”“Moreover, over the long term, a Trump victory increases the likelihood that the GOP will become a big-government xenophobic party hostile to civil liberties and opposed to most constitutional constraints on government power ― much like the far-right nationalist parties of Western Europe, whose platforms are very similar to his,” he continued. “Such a party is likely to do far more to undermine the Constitution than even a Hillary Clinton victory.”Epstein believes that most of his fellow legal scholars aren’t buying the argument that conservatives must support Trump for fear of Clinton’s potential Supreme Court nominees.“I am beginning to think that my views are now mainstream among serious defenders of any version of the conservative or classical liberal traditions,” Epstein said.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
13,POLITICS,Why Progressives Are Celebrating Hillary Clinton’s Populist Economic Speech,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/progressives-hillary-clinton-economic-speech_us_57ad1cd7e4b069e7e5049619,The Democratic nominee said she'd never support the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.,2016-08-12,"Hillary Clinton cast herself as a champion of working people during a speech in Warren, Michigan on Thursday, Aug. 11, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ad1d4c1700002c00d1e49d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Progressive groups encouraging Hillary Clinton to run on a platform of bold economic change are hailing the Democratic nominee’s economic policy speech on Thursday.Clinton, casting herself as a champion of working people, appeared to assuage liberal concerns that her campaign’s attempt to attract moderate Republicans turned off by GOP nominee Donald Trump would weaken her attention to progressive priorities.“Today’s speech shows that getting some Republicans to say Donald Trump is unfit to be president is not mutually exclusive with Clinton running on bold progressive ideas,” Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Campaign Change Committee, said in a statement.Speaking at an advanced manufacturing facility in the Detroit suburb of Warren, Michigan, Clinton tried to dispel the image of Trump as a so-called blue-collar billionaire looking out for working-class people.“There’s a myth out there that he’ll stick it to the rich and powerful because, at heart, he’s really on the side of the little guy,” Clinton said. “Don’t believe it.”She highlighted Trump’s proposed tax cuts to individuals and large corporations ― which would go disproportionately to wealthy people like him ― and her own plans to boost incomes and provide Americans with greater economic security. Clinton touted her proposals to invest $275 billion in infrastructure, expand Social Security benefits, and enable debt-free college.And in explaining why many of those “common-sense solutions” had not been passed already, Clinton described a rigged system in terms familiar to followers of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) ― or for that matter, Trump.“Powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress,” Clinton said.Felicia Wong, president of the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank, and Stan Greenberg, co-founder of the Democratic polling firm Democracy Corps, applauded Clinton’s remarks.“With this economic speech, Secretary Clinton has made this election a choice about whether our economy works for all, not just the few, and that allows progressive economics to win a mandate in November,” the progressive heavyweights wrote in a joint statement.Democracy Corps published research on behalf of the Roosevelt Institute during the Democratic National Convention showing that key constituencies were more responsive to a message that characterizes the economy and government as fundamentally broken, rather than just promising to build on existing progress.The two organizations’ work is part of a broader effort by the progressive wing of the Democratic Party to ensure that their agenda takes precedence ― both on the campaign trail and in a Clinton White House.  Clinton’s most significant remarks, however, were on international trade, an issue on which Trump has relentlessly attacked her as an unreliable guardian of American workers’ interests. It is also an especially salient topic in manufacturing-heavy Michigan, where Clinton lost a primary fight to Sanders, in no small part due to voter opposition to trade agreements.Clinton, who once praised the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, offered her firmest promise yet that she would not allow the accord to pass.“I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,” Clinton said, drawing cheers. “I oppose it now. I’ll oppose it after the election. And I’ll oppose it as president.”The Obama administration argues that the 12-nation Pacific Rim trade accord will open doors to economic growth and raise human-rights standards.But labor unions, environmental groups, and many Democratic lawmakers claim it will result in massive manufacturing job losses, greater ecological destruction and higher drug prices.Anti-TPP activists said they fear Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress will make a deal with congressional Republican leaders to pass the accord during the lame-duck session of Congress after the election.Democracy for America, a digital progressive activism outfit that endorsed Sanders in the primary, launched a petition campaign with CREDO Action on Wednesday asking Clinton to urge the White House and Democratic congressional leaders not to pass the TPP. CREDO Action also bought digital ad space promoting a video ad with a similar message.Charles Chamberlain, Democracy for America’s executive director, praised Clinton’s remarks on Thursday, but also used them as an opportunity to ratchet up the pressure.“It’s now more important than ever that the country and President Obama hear specifically from Secretary Clinton that a vote on the job-killing TPP during a lame duck session of Congress must not happen,” Chamberlain said in a statement."

But by the end of the third event, the beam rotation, Biles held a commanding lead of more than 1.5 points. She sealed it with an impressive floor routine.Biles’ celebratory comments come on the heels of several high-profile sexist headlines to emerge in Brazil. An NBC commentator this week compared one of the three-time world champion’s uneven bars routines to that of a man’s.Other women’s accomplishments have been linked to their husbands and coaches, or celebrated because of their age or recent pregnancies.While Biles has already made Olympic history, there are still a lot of medals to be won. The gymnast is still favored to take home a few more golds in three individual events later this week. Viewers can expect to see absurd levels of difficulty and routines packed with skill-after-skill many of her peers won’t even attempt in competition.As her teammate Raisman said, “Simone’s just in her own league. Whoever gets second place, that’s the winner.”"

Clinton has often been criticized for avoiding press conferences, and the exclusives with Linsky only fan the flames.Last week, the Clinton campaign described her speech and short Q&A at the National Association of Black Journalists/National Association of Hispanic Journalists as an official press conference―to the disapproval of many journalists."

Now, Hill is watching the recent allegations of sexual harassment unfold against former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes ―and, like the rest of us, she’s not happy with the way Fox handled Ailes’ departure. In a recent interview on NPR’s “Morning Edition,” Hill discussed the culture of sexual harassment in the U.S. and what kind of impact the allegations against Ailes could potentially have.“I think it makes clear that even though the men are more powerful, even women who are perceived to have some power have trouble coming forward,” Hill said, referring to TV commentator Gretchen Carlson who was the first woman to accuse Ailes of harassment.One factor that often makes it hard for women to come forward with their stories is a lack of protocol within companies to deal with issues such as these, Hill said. She told NPR: I also think that it makes people aware that how, in these situations where there is extreme hierarchy and you have an individual who is well-regarded on many levels, that it is very difficult for women to come forward because in many ways they don’t have anyone to report to who can actually do anything about it, who can change the behavior of this powerful person. I’m talking about companies where you do have this fairly iconic figure, and companies are prohibited from stepping outside the chain of command, even talk to people who are above them in rank.And what’s one thing Hill would do to change this culture of extreme hierarchy? Take back that $40 million Roger Ailes received from Fox News after he was let go from the company. “One thing I would have the Fox News network do is to take back the $40 million [severance package] that Roger Ailes reportedly has received,” she told NPR. “It seems to me that that sends a very bad signal, and in fact if the allegations are proven to be true, then certainly not only has he violated the law but I would also say that he has actually injured the company in a way that would keep him from being entitled to a severance pay.”Hill said it’s important to acknowledge the different obstacles women face when reporting their assailant. “We also need to look at how different women are evaluated [when they report harassment],” she said. “It may be women are evaluated differently because of their race or religion, status in the workplace. There are a whole lot of things that go into the mix.”Fortunately, women are still stepping up and telling their stories. “One thing that I am very sure of is if we look at 1991 and think about what happened, even though from the outside observer it seemed that in fact I’d lost, I was treated very badly, women continued to come forward and they came forward in record numbers,” Hill said. “And that I believe is a good sign.” Listen to the full NPR interview below.

20,BLACK VOICES,Simone Manuel's Olympic Win Is Huge Considering Swimming's Racist Past,Zeba Blay,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/simone-manuels-olympic-win-is-huge-considering-swimmings-racist-past_us_57add79ae4b071840410de1d,Black people weren't always welcomed in pools.,2016-08-12,"Protesters demonstrating in the swimming pool of the Monson Motor Lodge in Saint Augustine, Florida, scream as motel manager James Brock dumps ""muriatic acid"" into the water.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ade3ac170000ae02c72cec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are levels to Simone Manuel’s epic Olympic win on Thursday. The 20-year-old has become the first black woman to win a gold medal in an individual swimming competition in the history of the Olympics. Tying for the gold medal with Canadian swimmer Penny Oleksiak, Manuel also set an Olympic record with a time of 52.70. What the Texas native has managed to accomplish during her time in Rio is most definitely historic ― but it’s also weighted with meaning that extends far beyond the Olympics.There is an infamous photo from 1964, of a motel manager named James Brock pouring acid into the swimming pool of his Saint Augustine, Florida, motel. Below him, black and white protestors attempting to integrate the segregated pool scream in shock and fear. The photo is a visceral reminder of the everyday realities of segregation in the United States. Black people weren’t even allowed the dignity of cooling off in a pool or at the beach without being segregated and denied access.According to The Guardian, during the 1920s and ‘30s thousands of luxurious public pools were opened all over America. All of them were segregated. When desegregation began in the ‘50s and ‘60s, government officials withdrew funding for desegregated pools. White pool-goers ultimately fled for the perceived comfort and “safety” of private, segregated pools and the rundown public pools left over for black people were gradually closed down. Today, there’s a stereotype that many people, including some black people, subscribe to: “Black people can’t swim.” Of course, that isn’t completely true. Many black people, throughout the diaspora, know how to swim. But what is true is that white people in America are two times more likely to know how to swim than black people. What is true is that black children are three times more likely to die in the water than white children. What is true is that many black people over the course of America’s history have been unable to learn to swim because they have had to contend with a lack of access to safe places to swim, the stigma of swimming being a so-called “white” sport, and generations of older black people passing on their fear of the water to younger generations. Is it any wonder, then, that in the professional sports world, so few black people (and especially black women) have made it to the Olympic level in swimming? After all, it was only 12 years ago, in 2004, that Martiza Correia McClendon became the first black woman on the U.S. swim team. “I’m proud to be the first, but I don’t want to be the last,” McClendon said at the time. What’s a little jarring about Manuel’s historic victory in Rio is the fact that some media outlets have seemed to downplay or ignore its overall significance. As many black Twitter users pointed out on Wednesday, Manuel’s first place position in the 100-meter freestyle semifinal was completely passed over by NBC, with very little acknowledgement (there was an obligatory tweet). The media was criticized for making light of Manuel’s win, focusing more on her opponents and Australian swimmer Cate Campbell. The athletic accomplishments of young black women like Simone Manuel, like Lia Neal and Ashleigh Johnson (the first black woman to compete in water polo at the Olympics) are vital, their presence in Olympic swimming competitions even more so. They serve as a palpable and important reminder of how far black people have come in the United States after something as simple and necessary as being able to swim was denied to us. Today, we’re not just swimming ― we’re slaying the game. "
