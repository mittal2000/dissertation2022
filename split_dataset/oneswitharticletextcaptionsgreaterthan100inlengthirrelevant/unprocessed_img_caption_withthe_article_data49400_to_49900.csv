A group of Paris restaurants is turning food scraps into biogas and compost ahead of a new law that will force thousands of French food outlets to recycle their organic waste. Some 80 restaurants, caterers and hotels, signed up for a pilot project to collect their food waste, which is used to generate biogas and produce electricity and heat, as well as compost for farms around Paris. Martinez, who took the initiative for the project, said the collection anticipates the law but that participating restaurants are happy that someone collects their waste and puts it to good use.

We couldn’t believe all this excellent food would simply get wasted,” he said, still in disbelief.De Sanctis felt compelled to act. With his friends, two lawyers and a web designer, he set up Equoevento, a Rome-based non-profit that collects uneaten food from events and delivers it to charities for distribution to the hungry.“On one side you have so much leftover food, and on the other side there is no food at all. We saw every day that there were so many people that didn’t have enough food,” de Sanctis told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, explaining that “equo” means “equal” in Italian.Between 30 percent and 40 percent of food produced around the world is never eaten because it is spoiled after harvest and during transportation, or thrown away by shops and consumers.Yet almost 800 million people worldwide go to bed hungry every night, according to U.N. figures.The problem has become so serious that halving world food waste by 2030 was included as a target for global development goals adopted by world leaders in 2015.From Italy to Germany and Brazil to Kenya, a growing number of enterprises are rescuing food that would otherwise go into landfills to feed those in need - a trend some experts say may be the answer to the mountains of food waste created daily.Equoevento has so far distributed 200,000 meals from food collected from some 400 events. Entirely run by volunteers, the organisation may soon need to seek office space as it expands, de Sanctis said.Experts say reducing food waste is not only a moral imperative but a way of curbing emissions of planet-warming gases linked to agriculture which accounts for about 20 percent of overall greenhouse gas emissions.The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has calculated that global food waste would be the world’s third-largest greenhouse gas emitter if it were treated as a country.UGLY VEGThousands of miles away in Kenya, a different kind of initiative is taking root - one that uses produce deemed too ugly for Western supermarket shelves, such as wonky carrots, curved cucumbers and dimpled apples.Nairobi-based enterprise Enviu aims to turn some 5 tonnes of “imperfect” produce into 78,000 school meals a day under a pilot programme it is developing with the World Food Programme’s (WFP) new innovation hub.According to the FAO, about a third of all food, by weight, is spoiled or thrown away worldwide as it moves from where it is produced to where it is eaten, costing up to $940 billion per year globally.“Around 10 percent of the European Union’s fresh fruits and vegetables come from Kenya, and when produce makes it to the airport it gets sorted there for the cosmetic standards,” said Robert Opp, head of innovation at WFP.“An estimated 25 percent of that food, about 75 tonnes a day, is rejected,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Using rejected food would mean farmers no longer losing income and more children getting fed, he added.“There’s a massive amount of food wasted every year and there’s still hunger, so if we can make the food systems more efficient, reduce the wastage and improve distribution - that’s a good thing for the fight against hunger,” Opp said.OLYMPIC LEFTOVERSAs efforts to cut food waste spread around the globe, athletes at this month’s Rio Olympics will play a part, perhaps without even knowing it.Refetto-Rio, an initiative by two chefs, Italian Massimo Bottura and Brazilian David Hertz, aims to turn excess food from the Olympic Village into meals for the hungry.While initiatives like Equoevento or Refetto-Rio are on a relatively small scale, experts say every little helps.Brian Lipinski, food programme associate at thinktank World Resources Institute (WRI), said piecemeal approaches combined with national policies on food waste were necessary to achieve a meaningful reduction in food waste.“Maybe the impact from one of these non-profits that are picking up some excess food and donating it is small on its own, but it’s really one of the only ways to go about addressing this sort of waste right now,” he said.Lipinski also said it was time to stop focusing on how to produce more food for the world’s growing population and instead concentrate on efforts to reduce food waste.EUROPE TAKES LEADIn Europe, the European Commission has proposed that member states develop national strategies to prevent food waste by at least 30 percent by 2025.Germany has been a leader on the issue. In 2012, the German government launched a “too good for the trash” campaign and the country has also pioneered “food-sharing”, using the internet to distribute produce recovered from store rubbish while still in good condition.In 2015, France introduced legislation banning big supermarkets from destroying unsold but edible food. Failure to comply could expose supermarket managers to two years in jail and fines of 75,000 euros ($83,850).And last week Italy passed a law that makes it easier for supermarkets to donate unsold food to charities, in an effort to reduce waste.“There’s still too little awareness about food around the world,” said de Sanctis while checking his phone to see which of his volunteers had signed up for the next food pick-up.“People don’t plan what to eat and there’s a lot of waste in people’s homes. We have to educate people about food waste because it’s a real problem.”(Reporting by Magdalena Mis; Editing by Katie Nguyen; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, corruption and climate change.

1,BLACK VOICES,South African Politician Proclaims A 'Non-Racial' Era After Vote Wins,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/south-african-politician-proclaims-non-racial-era-after-vote-wins_us_57a8dfaee4b0aae2a5a0c8d7,Mmusi Maimane isn't liked by many ANC members who say he is a puppet of a white elitist movement.,2016-08-08,"Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane gestures as he speaks to members of the media at the result center in Pretoria, South Africa.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a8e4912a0000fa01fb566a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"South Africa’s main opposition leader proclaimed the dawn of an era of ‘non-racial’ politics envisioned by the late Nelson Mandela on Monday, saying a bid by the African National Congress to highlight divisions at last week’s local elections had backfired.Mmusi Maimane, whose leadership of the Democratic Alliance (DA) since last year has helped overturn its image as a party for wealthy whites, called the vote a historic break with the past that could bring the DA into national government in 2019.The ANC lost its majorities in Johannesburg, the symbolic Nelson Mandela Bay and the municipality that is home to the capital Pretoria, in its biggest ever election losses.The party that has dominated South Africa since the end of apartheid led the overall count, but the result dealt a significant blow to President Jacob Zuma ahead of the next parliamentary vote in three years’ time.The DA is now expected to lead coalition governments in two of these electoral districts and also boosted its majority to more than two thirds in Cape Town, which it has run since 2006, a vote of confidence in its ability to govern.Angry about corruption, unemployment and poor basic services, many ANC supporters turned to the DA - making a switch that was unthinkable only a few years ago.“It’s a incredible moment for our country,” part-time preacher Maimane told Reuters, dressed top-to-toe in the DA’s blue, from his leather jacket to designer shoes.The ANC campaign focused on reminding voters of its role in ending apartheid 22 years ago, and of the DA’s white roots, even comparing the party to the former apartheid regime.Some black voters were also told they would be “black Boers” if they chose the DA, a derogatory reference to Afrikaans-speaking white farmers.DA election posters featured images of 36-year-old Maimane in poor townships around South African cities, symbolizing his role in broadening the appeal of the Alliance, rooted in a white campaign in the 1960s against white minority rule.“HISTORIC”“The most historic thing about this election is people rejected the racial divisions and said its possible for black and white South Africans to work together,” Maimane said.“In 1994, the choice was between freedom or apartheid. The ANC has always sought since then to make the choice about black or white. The ANC misread South Africa.”A Christian who developed his rousing speaking style in the pulpit, Maimane is more popular with businesses than Zuma and is open to engaging with Western governments in a way that has made the ANC uncomfortable due to colonial legacies.Zuma has dismissed Maimane’s threat due to his youth and lack of experience on a continent where age is often considered an important factor in choosing a leader.“The assessment for any leader in any political environment is the scoreboard,” Maimane said, adding that Zuma should consider following Britain’s David Cameron in standing down following a defeat at the ballot box.Maimane’s age, charisma and speaking style - punctured with dramatic pauses and deliberate hand gestures - have drawn comparisons with U.S. President Barack Obama.“You could have worse tags,” Maimane said, smiling.“The Obama project was about hope, about change, and there is something about my project that could be ascribed to that.”Maimane, who has a white South African wife, came under personal attacks during campaigning from ANC members who say he is a puppet of a white elitist movement.One insult included calling Maimane a ‘coconut’, implying he is black on the outside but white on the inside.“I had to endure a barrage of racial insults. What you’ve got to do is to steel your back and carry on,” Maimane said.“I recognize that they wanted to do everything in their power to win, to a point when you recognize it’s a tactical thing to divide the nation along racial lines.”NATIONAL ELECTIONSMaimane said he believes it is now possible to bring the ANC’s share of the vote in national elections in 2019 below 50 percent, opening up the chance of the DA ruling in a coalition.With solid support in rural areas, the ANC still has majority support across the country, a reflection of its liberation struggle history and the significant improvement in basic living standards for poor South Africans since apartheid.The ANC won 62 percent of the vote in 2014 national elections but only 53 percent in the local vote last week.If the DA is to govern nationally it will need to drastically reduce inequality and convince poor black South Africans that it represents all races.Black people make up 80 percent of the 54 million population yet, two decades after apartheid, most of the economy in terms of ownership of land and companies remains in the hands of white people, who account for 8 percent of the population.Maimane has promised voters the DA will provide jobs, better services and eradicate corruption in the cities it runs.“Momentum building going toward 2019 is about good governance. It’s about proving to the public that we can govern nationally one day,” Maimane said.“Where we’ve governed, we’ve grown everywhere. Where the ANC has governed, they’ve gone down.”The DA will now go into a difficult negotiating period over coalitions, possibly having to link up with the radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), whose firebrand leader Julius Malema wants to nationalize mines and take land from whites.“The initial phases have started,” Maimane said of coalition talks, adding that local governments were about delivering services and not national policy shifts.“It doesn’t mean I endorse the EFF’s view on white South Africans or that I endorse their philosophy on nationalization.”(Editing by Philippa Fletcher) "

In 2010, the Dream Act failed. In 2012, the president implemented deferred action for undocumented childhood arrivals. In 2013, the Senate passed immigration reform legislation. That legislation went nowhere ― so in 2014, the president announced deferred action for undocumented parents of Americans.In 2016, the Supreme Court stalled the president’s executive actions on immigration.Latinos had high hopes for the last 10 years, but have been left with no substantive policy wins for their community and are witnessing an election cycle that began with a candidate for the Republican nomination calling Mexicans “criminals” and “rapists.”In July, Republicans formally nominated that candidate for the presidency of the United States.“Right now these forces are knocking on our door and they’re knocking on our door saying ‘we are not afraid of you’ ― it’s kind of like a teasing,” said Maria Teresa Kumar, head of Voto Latino, a nonprofit focused on mobilizing Latinos.Donald Trump is the one knocking, and with him comes the promise of a border wall, a reversal of all of President Barack Obama’s executive actions, mass deportations and a leader who incites racist vitriol toward Latinos ― those born in the U.S., those immigrating and those who are undocumented.For Latinos at the Democratic National Convention, one thing was clear: This is a moment unlike any before in American politics. A moment to prove to those running for the presidency ― and other levels of office ― that they won’t win unless they prioritize the Latino voter. They have the power: 27.3 million Latinos are estimated to be eligible to vote on election day. But it remains to be seen whether they’ll use it. Out of those eligible voters, nearly half will be millennials, a notoriously difficult group to get to the polls. But if primaries like Nevada’s are any indication, where a record number registered to vote this year, Latinos are priming themselves for this moment.“Most people don’t realize that Latinos from now on will make the difference in who the president is,” Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.) said at a Poder PAC event during the DNC honoring Latinas in politics. “We will choose. Most people don’t know that in a lot of these statewide races, we will choose.”That’s what Amanda Renteria, national political director for Hillary Clinton’s campaign, is betting on. Speaking at the same fundraiser event in downtown Philadelphia, Renteria, a daughter of farm workers in California’s Central Valley, told the influential Latinos in attendance that the stakes couldn’t be higher.“The world has actually seen Donald Trump disrespect and devalue us,” she said to cheers from the small crowd. “We need to show everyone in this country that once and for all, this is not how we’re going to be treated. So I need everyone in this room, we need to do everything we can to not just defeat Donald Trump in November but to absolutely overwhelmingly reject him.”Later, in an interview with The Huffington Post, Renteria recalled past battles like the mass marches calling for immigrant rights, and the failed attempts by Congress to pass immigration reform, admitting that Latinos have learned some hard lessons along the way.But there’s no doubt in her mind that this time is different.“We’ve never had someone that has disrespected the community as much as Donald Trump has,” she said. “Not just immigrants but first, second, third, fourth generations. That really has united the Latino community in a way, that even if you are born here, you know he looks at your kids a little differently.” It’s not enough to be anti-Trump, however ― people have to actively be pro-Clinton. Some immigrant rights activists are holding out for deeper commitments and remain wary of the former secretary of state.Renteria acknowledged this. Clinton will move on immigration reform in her “first 100 days,” Renteria said, repeating the Democratic nominee’s frequent pledge. “This is real.” And her campaign won’t rely on Trump’s failures alone. It’s also about proving to Latino voters that the Democratic nominee is on their side. She has vowed to alleviate naturalization costs, close immigration detention centers run by private prisons and add to Obama’s DACA and DAPA actions. Having run an unsuccessful bid for Congress herself, Renteria knows that getting communities of color involved is “much harder than a good commercial” highlighting the opponent’s awful rhetoric. Voters need to make a deep connection with the candidate.“I don’t want to underestimate the importance of proving to Republicans that if you have a candidate like Trump we will turn out against you,” Renteria said. “That pushes Republicans to say, ‘If I am not a part of what Latinos need ― whether it’s comprehensive immigration reform, or education or the economy ― if we ignore this community, we lose time and time again.’”That will trickle down the ballot, she added. Not only this year, but for years to come on the local, state and national election map.“This is literally he does not want you if you have any Mexican heritage whatever generation you are,” continued Renteria, who is of Mexican descent herself. “And she wants to give you a voice in the White House.” “My parents and so many parents came here for a better life, and to think that [Trump] will get elected and that notion no longer exists, it’s a big deal,” Renteria added.The disparity between what Republicans and Democrats are offering for Latinos was on full display during the conventions. Hector E. Sanchez saw it.Sanchez attended both conventions in his capacity as chair of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a coalition representing the nation’s leading Hispanic organizations. It’s a nonpartisan network focused on policy and doesn’t endorse anyone for the presidency. (Sanchez is also the executive director of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO.)At the RNC, he recalled, “It’s unbelievable, they had the most anti-immigrant voices in the nation... some people from the KKK, and the general messaging was anti-immigrant, anti-welcome, anti-integration, anti-everything of values we should have as a nation.”At the DNC, by contrast, he was relieved to see immigrants and Latinos given a platform on the convention stage. He noted the importance of the symbolism behind speeches like one given by Karla Ortiz, a U.S. citizen who fears that her undocumented parents will be deported.“We are under such horrible attack that it is affecting the quality of life of families,” Sanchez said. “Hate crimes against Latinos are increasing; racial profiling against Latinos is increasing.”That’s why, he added, if Clinton is elected, his organization will push for solid representation of Latinos in her cabinet ― he wants four ― and for her to demonstrate a serious commitment to immigration reform.And if Clinton doesn’t deliver? That’s not possible, said Catherine Pino, co-founder of the Poder PAC.“She can’t do that, you know why?” Pino asked. “If she wants to run again and be elected in four years, it won’t work. She knows.”Pino has supported Clinton since 2008. When she lost, Pino was depressed. Drinking a margarita with close friends as they watched Clinton concede to Obama, Pino realized something needed to change. That’s when the Poder PAC was formed. Up until 2015, its mission was to fund Latinas running for all levels of elected office. Now, they’ve tailored their approach to focus on Latinas running for Congress.If Latinos want their voices heard and their expectations met, Pino knows it’s not enough for Clinton to win the presidency. And since the Democratic establishment had a history of ignoring Latino candidates, Pino wanted to fill that gap.“It’s been one of our frustrations,” Pino said. “We’re in D.C., we have a government relations firm and do a lot of work with [the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee], and we’ve taken them to task about supporting our candidates.”Sayu Bhojwani is trying to fill the void as well. Bhojwani, the former New York City commissioner of immigrant affairs, kicked off an effort during the DNC to have what she calls new American caucuses established in legislatures nationwide.Bhojwani, who heads the New American Leader Project along with a team of immigrant and first-generation elected officials, immigrated to the U.S about 30 years ago from Belize and is of Indian descent. One in five Americans are immigrants or children of immigrants. So the key to passing immigration reform, Bhojwani said, lies in getting first-generation Americans and newly naturalized citizens into office.“There’s a big gap between us being asked to tell our stories and us being told, ‘This is what we commit to doing in order to make immigration reform happen,’” Bhojwani said.While she knows the immigrant community’s animosity toward Trump runs deep, she doesn’t think it’s enough to create a true movement. Down-ballot races need to be a part of the strategy, she said.“It can only be a political moment if we can show that we can flex our political muscles beyond the top of the ticket,” she said. “Otherwise we become heavily reliant on one person, who, because of the way American democracy works, is only one arm of our government. The fact that we keep making that mistake every election cycle, it just blows my mind.”"

U.S. officials said Amiri had been free to come and go as he pleased, and that he may have returned because of pressures on his family in Iran.Amiri had denied this, saying “my family had no problems.” In a video aired by Iranian state TV in 2010, Amiri said he had fled from U.S. agents.Iran, the United States and five other world powers reached a landmark deal last year, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in such a way as to ensure it cannot develop nuclear weapons in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions."

The heavy fighting and air strikes reported from the area seemed to indicate any passage that may have been opened would be far from secure enough for civilians to travel through.Rebels have been trying to break through a thin strip of government-controlled territory to reconnect insurgent areas in western Syria with their encircled sector of eastern Aleppo, in effect breaking a government siege begun last month.The offensive against the government’s Ramousah military complex, which contains a number of military colleges, began on Friday. Taking control of Ramousah and linking up with eastern Aleppo would isolate government-held western Aleppo by cutting the southern route out toward the capital Damascus.It would also give rebels access to armaments stored in the base the Syrian army has used in the five-year conflict as a strategic platform from which to shell opposition targets.Two rebel groups and a monitor said on Saturday they had broken the siege, but pro-government media outlets denied the claim and said the Syrian army was in fact regaining recently taken territory from rebels.“We’ve seen reports but the situation is fluid and we aren’t going to provide battlefield updates,” the State Department official told Reuters.Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, formerly the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, said in an online statement: “Fighters from outside the city met their brother fighters from inside the city, and work is under way to establish control over remaining positions to break the siege.”A commander from more moderate rebel group also told Reuters the siege had been broken but said it was early days and matters were “not easy.”The United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war, said intense fighting and heavy air strikes meant no secure corridor had yet been established between the two rebel-held territories. WORST MONTH FOR HOSPITAL ATTACKSIn another report, the Observatory said an air strike near a hospital in northwestern Syria on Saturday killed 10 people including children and damaged the hospital. July was the worst month yet for attacks on medical facilities in the war-torn country, a medical charity said, with 43 recorded attacks on healthcare facilities in Syria.The hospital is in Meles, about 15 km (9 miles) from Idlib city in rebel-held Idlib province. Syrian government and allied Russian warplanes operate in Syria but it was not known which aircraft carried out the strike.The Observatory, in its report on the Aleppo fighting, said rebels had taken control of the Weaponry College, the main Artillery College, the Air Force Technical College and the Ramousah Garage area. Government forces still control the cement factory and some military housing.“This is the biggest military and symbolic loss sustained by the regime, the Russians, the Iranians and Lebanon’s Hezbollah since the start of 2013,” the Observatory said, adding that heavy air strikes, thought to be from Russian planes, hit Aleppo on Saturday.The Syrian military news agency said later on Saturday the Syrian army had restored control over the Artillery College and had made the rebels withdraw from the Weaponry College.A witness said people in the streets of a part of eastern Aleppo briefly celebrated reports of the siege being broken before the sight of warplanes in the sky scattered them.A live Syrian state TV report from the outskirts of the artillery base in Ramousah, in southwestAleppo, broadcast the sound of gunfire, explosions and warplanes flying over.Videos released by rebel groups claim to show gun battles as insurgents moved into buildings in the complex.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad wants to take full control of Aleppo, pre-war Syria’s most populous city, which has been divided between rebel and government-held areas. Such a victory would be a crushing blow to the insurgents.CIVILIAN SUFFERINGA quarter of a million civilians are thought to still live in Aleppo’s opposition-controlled eastern neighborhoods, effectively under siege since the army and allied militia cut off the last road into rebel districts in early July.Residents on both side of the city are suffering. Government areas frequently come under attack from rebel shelling, and rebel-held areas are routinely shelled and come under air attack from Syrian and allied Russian forces.Humanitarian groups say the situation in eastern Aleppo is very worrying. The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) charity group said that already depleted medical facilities were targeted by strikes 15 times in July.Only 35 doctors remain in the city and over 100 people are in need of medical evacuation, SAMSAleppo Coordinator Dr Abo El-Ezz said in a statement.The multi-sided civil war in Syria, which has been raging since 2011, has drawn in regional and global powers, caused the world’s worst humanitarian emergency and attracted recruits to Islamist militancy from around the world.Some rebel groups refer to the Aleppo battle as the “Ibrahim al-Youssef Offensive,” a reference to a Sunni army officer said to have led a massacre of cadets at the Artillery College in the late 1970s. The cadets were predominantly from the Alawite sect of Bashar al-Assad and his late father and predecessor as president, Hafez al-Assad."

The International Paralympic Committee on Sunday announced Russia’s suspension due to a widespread doping scandal. The IPC board’s decision was unanimous. “This decision has placed a huge burden upon all our shoulders, but it’s a decision we’ve had to take in the best interests of the Paralympic Movement,” IPC President Sir Philip Craven said in a statement. The ban was anticipated before the announcement as part of the fallout from Team Russia’s massive Olympic doping scandal. A World Anti-Doping Agency panel last November released an explosive report that accused the Russian government of helping its athletes cheat doping tests. The WADA later hired Toronto lawyer Richard McLaren to conduct an independent investigation into Russia’s program; the so-called McLaren Report, released in July, concluded that Russia’s ministry of sports helped manipulate doping tests so that drug-enhanced athletes would be sure to pass them. Russia’s Paralympic athletes have historically been among the top contenders in the world games. During the 2012 Paralympic Games in London, Russia ranked second overall in the gold medal count, placing only behind China. Russia has three weeks to appeal the IPC’s decision. If the ban is upheld, it will mark the first time an entire country’s delegation has been barred from the games, according to The Wall Street Journal.Other Russian athletes competing in Rio narrowly managed to escape the fate now facing their Paralympic counterparts. Just weeks before the start of the Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee announced there would be no blanket ban on Russia’s athletes. Athletes were tested on an individual basis and 271 of 387 were ultimately cleared to participate in the games. “Ultimately, as the global governing body for the Paralympic Movement, it is our responsibility to ensure fair competition, so that athletes can have confidence that they are competing on a level playing field,” Crave said. “This is vital to the integrity and credibility of Paralympic sport, and in order to achieve this it is fundamental that each member abides by the rules.”The Rio Paralympics, in which athletes with disabilities compete in sports that include wheelchair fencing, swimming and taekwondo, start Sept. 7."

Together, they present the choices that seem available to Asian Americans: to be white or to be black. The alternative is to be a perpetual foreigner. Reeves was born in Beirut when it was a resort destination. His biological father was predominantly Hawaiian Chinese; his mother, English. The leading man reportedly is estranged from his father, having been raised by his mother in Canada. His given name is inspired by a Hawaiian term for wind over the mountains.As one of his characters might proclaim, “Whoa.”He is not only white, he is archetypal.

If anything, ironically he was inscrutable (as Asians are reputed to be). Surface was substance. In Point Break, a Zen surfing heist thriller with a deserved cult following, he portrayed a former football star turned law enforcement officer, called “Johnny Utah,” a moniker that signifies arch-assimilation (maybe it could be outdone by “Johnny Kansas”). In Street Kings, a first-class “B” movie, he is a conflicted cop who in the opening scenes busts Asian criminals, replete with ethnic epithets.Woods was cast as a reluctant spokesperson for the mixed race movement. Transforming golf literally single-handedly as when he bounced a ball off his club repeatedly and nonchalantly, he joined Oprah Winfrey to discuss his parents: a father who was a black American Army Green Beret, who boasted white and Native ancestry; a mother who was Thai albeit similarly diverse. Woods called himself “Cablinasian,” a portmanteau term he invented for himself. His given name of “Tiger” honored a Vietnamese soldier who had saved his father’s life. His greatness set off a surreal dispute among Asians and African Americans. They each wished to own him, as if they were picking teams. Blacks approved of Woods, with his father, recalling the segregated courses of his youth, respecting his forebears in the sport, subtly calling out racial discrimination that had prevented them from receiving due awards. They lamented the tendency of some upwardly mobile African Americans to disassociate themselves from the community from whence they had come. Asians asserted that mathematically he was Asian to a greater degree than anything else, he believed in Buddhism, and he had spoken about feeling Asian.The matter was resolved when an older competitor made clear that Woods, for all the talk of being mixed and the Thai maternal line, was indelibly, not positively, black. Fuzzy Zoeller, asked for his opinion of the young phenom, made a casual remark. The winner of the Masters tournament is allowed, in one of those rituals of the game, to select the menu for the group dinner of the players. As the field was being vanquished by Woods, Zoeller told a camera crew trailing behind him that they should tell the boy not to serve fried chicken and collard greens “or whatever the hell it is they serve.” (It would have been equally inapt if he had said, “curry chicken and lemongrass soup,” but the actual quip was a dismissive stereotype of “black” food.)The general response to these examples is, “Yes, of course, because that is how those individuals look.” What is interesting about this reaction is that it reveals our perceptions of race are about appearance. They are not affected by data. A person who is told that Reeves or Woods is part Asian might say, “Oh, yes, around the eyes,” but their general impression is not altered. We are beholden to what we see. There is hardly ambiguity.Even that most quintessential Asian, Bruce Lee, was in that quaint phrase, “Eurasian.” His public persona was exotic. Yet his actual heritage was common enough where he grew up.When the terms “Oriental” and the less polite “Chinaman” were still in common use, Lee achieved fame that was unprecedented and global. Despite having been passed over for the Kung Fu television series, a role that went to a Caucasian who was accomplished as a dancer, the martial arts expert went on to star in his own stories on the big screen, establishing himself as masculine, powerful, and virile.He also was at least one-quarter European in lineage. He was a member of a prominent house in Hong Kong. His genealogy led to controversy within the then-closed society of Eastern fighting schools. He insisted, to the further indignation of his peers, on training people of all origins, boasting a star student who was African American. As a consequence, he was challenged to prove his right to continue practicing his trade. The battle with Wong Jack Man in Oakland has become myth.His death at an early age of a brain hemorrhage, as he was developing what would have been the first big-budget Hollywood martial arts picture, was attributed by conspiracy theorists to a curse for sharing kung fu secrets with outsiders. He has become all the more a legend since then. His appeal is universal. His counsel was, “Be like water, my friend.”All but forgotten is that he was a native-born American, coming into the world in that most Chinese of cities, San Francisco, California. Thanks to the Supreme Court case affirming birthright citizenship, brought by one Wong Kim Ark of the same hometown, son of immigrants who could not naturalize due to a racial bar, Lee, like others who can claim roots on this soil, was legally an equal.Asian Americans have sought to appropriate the term “hapa” to cover these persons. A Hawaiian word, it originally was derogatory. It has been taken over as celebratory.There are many examples, beyond Asians and Asian Americans, of public race and private identity being mismatched. The phenomenon harkens back to the “one drop” rule reflecting a philosophy that any “black” blood taints the purity of whiteness. “Passing” has been practiced likely from the first encounter of populations with differing statuses correlated to color.Salma Hayek, for example, is internationally admired as a Mexican movie star. She is as Mexican as could be. Yet she has become an American citizen. In terms of ancestry, she is only half what she is regarded as; her father is Lebanese. For that matter, Frida Kahlo, whom Hayek portrayed in a hit biopic, is revered as a Mexican painter and feminist heroine. Yet Kahlo was like Hayek. her father was German, and, in the narrative Kahlo herself promoted, Jewish — though later investigation has suggested he was German but not Jewish.The point is that racial categories are social constructs. They correlate only approximately to their supposed biological basis. And racial blending is neither new nor rare. The possibility is what makes us all human."

Yet his actual heritage was common enough where he grew up.When the terms “Oriental” and the less polite “Chinaman” were still in common use, Lee achieved fame that was unprecedented and global. Despite having been passed over for the Kung Fu television series, a role that went to a Caucasian who was accomplished as a dancer, the martial arts expert went on to star in his own stories on the big screen, establishing himself as masculine, powerful, and virile.He also was at least one-quarter European in lineage. He was a member of a prominent house in Hong Kong. His genealogy led to controversy within the then-closed society of Eastern fighting schools. He insisted, to the further indignation of his peers, on training people of all origins, boasting a star student who was African American. As a consequence, he was challenged to prove his right to continue practicing his trade. The battle with Wong Jack Man in Oakland has become myth.His death at an early age of a brain hemorrhage, as he was developing what would have been the first big-budget Hollywood martial arts picture, was attributed by conspiracy theorists to a curse for sharing kung fu secrets with outsiders. He has become all the more a legend since then. His appeal is universal. His counsel was, “Be like water, my friend.”All but forgotten is that he was a native-born American, coming into the world in that most Chinese of cities, San Francisco, California. Thanks to the Supreme Court case affirming birthright citizenship, brought by one Wong Kim Ark of the same hometown, son of immigrants who could not naturalize due to a racial bar, Lee, like others who can claim roots on this soil, was legally an equal.Asian Americans have sought to appropriate the term “hapa” to cover these persons. A Hawaiian word, it originally was derogatory. It has been taken over as celebratory.There are many examples, beyond Asians and Asian Americans, of public race and private identity being mismatched. The phenomenon harkens back to the “one drop” rule reflecting a philosophy that any “black” blood taints the purity of whiteness. “Passing” has been practiced likely from the first encounter of populations with differing statuses correlated to color.Salma Hayek, for example, is internationally admired as a Mexican movie star. She is as Mexican as could be. Yet she has become an American citizen. In terms of ancestry, she is only half what she is regarded as; her father is Lebanese. For that matter, Frida Kahlo, whom Hayek portrayed in a hit biopic, is revered as a Mexican painter and feminist heroine. Yet Kahlo was like Hayek. her father was German, and, in the narrative Kahlo herself promoted, Jewish — though later investigation has suggested he was German but not Jewish.The point is that racial categories are social constructs. They correlate only approximately to their supposed biological basis. And racial blending is neither new nor rare. The possibility is what makes us all human."

Had you not, I don’t know if I would have extended a hand.When I first saw you in the neighborhood, I avoided eye contact. I couldn’t see pass the hijab. Your headscarf represented to me a religion of extremes, a culture of anti-Semitism and a stifling of the modern woman. I quickly concluded we were from different worlds and hence, unable to find common ground - until we did.Our sons’ fast friendship led to ours. Several conversations, a few CrossFit WODs and a shared hookah later, my eyes shifted their focus.Your commitment to Islam is rooted in a spirituality that transcends all religions.When asked, “What did you learn from making pilgrimage to Mecca?” you told the young people at the local mosque that in light of the experience, both positive and negative, you returned grateful for the gifts God gives us as free, healthy human beings and with an understanding that He loves us, imperfections and all.At home, you demonstrate your love for God through modesty, daily prayer, study and diet. But that love is also deeply evident in the thoughtful way in which you respect yourself, interact with others, approach parenting, nurture relationships and care for patients.Your words and actions remind me we are all connected. You have an open, accepting and generous heart.  As a Christian woman raising Jewish children married to a man with a strong connection to Israel, I was worried my friendship with someone of Palestinian descent might be tricky. I was wrong. From day one, you welcomed my family into your home. You taught us about your culture, answered questions, appreciated our traditions, and even joined us for holidays. When my son swallowed a marble, you were at my door despite having worked a full day. When I had jury duty, you spent the afternoon with my boys even though your children had busy schedules of their own. You think of my family whenever you cook or travel and thanks to your charming sweet tooth, my children affectionately refer to you as “The Candy Fairy.” The goodness that emanates from you inspires me be better.You are an advocate for women; a role model for your son and daughters.Your dress may be traditional, but your ideas are progressive, willful and strong. I was moved when in an effort to understand practices, question inequities and evoke change, you approached Muslim women in the streets of Mecca and asked how they felt wearing a khimar, a long garment covering their head, neck, and shoulders, ran errands in pants to encourage dialogue and questioned local leaders about the sanitation of the city.Every day I watch you work tirelessly to support your family, use your education to help others, handle conflict and struggle with grace and perseverance, tackle new adventures with uncanny energy, act zany, be fun and simply love life.You are an exemplary, modern American woman who I feel proud to call friend.Connection and communication helped me confront prejudice, challenge stereotypes and understand a culture I knew only through media, politics and hearsay. I have renewed hope for future generations when I see our sons playing, laughing and treating each other as brothers.The hijab is but a frame for the beautiful person you are outside and within.

14,POLITICS,The Party Of Honest Abe Now Stuck With Dishonest Don,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-historic-liar_us_57a72edce4b03ba680129d06,Historians see in Trump the biggest liar in presidential politics. Ever.,2016-08-07,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump amps up his attacks on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as a ""liar"" at a New Hampshire rally Saturday. Some historians, though, see Trump as the most dishonest presidential candidate in American history.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – Win or lose this November, Donald Trump is headed for the record books regardless, presidential historians say, albeit with an admittedly dubious achievement: the most falsehood-prone candidate in the two centuries of the republic.“In American history, we’ve never had a major presidential candidate who fabricated facts with the regularity of Donald Trump,” said Douglas Brinkley, a history professor at Rice University. “He just simply makes up things.”In the span of a few days last week, Trump falsely claimed that the NFL had sent him a letter complaining about this autumn’s debate schedule, when in fact it had not. He claimed that the Koch brothers had tried to meet with him about offering their support, when in reality they had no interest in doing so. And, most astonishingly, he claimed he had seen a video showing hundreds of millions of dollars being unloaded from a plane in Iran, fabricating embellishments about the video’s provenance, even after his campaign conceded that no such video existed.Theda Skocpol, a government and sociology professor at Harvard, agreed that Trump’s dishonesties have set a new standard. “Trump lies constantly and shamelessly. I do think he is in new territory,” she said.GOP leaders trying to attack Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over her problems with honesty, meanwhile, are growing increasingly frustrated with their own candidate’s near-daily false statements. “What can I say? We nominated a fabulist,” said one top Republican official privately. “There’s no defending that.”Trump’s willingness to say things that are provably untrue, of course, is not something that began with his campaign. The 70-year-old has been known for his exaggerations and outright fabrications for decades.When he bought the Eastern Airlines Washington-to-New York shuttle in 1989 and renamed it Trump Airlines, he claimed, without any facts, that the other carrier operating that route did not maintain its planes as well as he did.Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, he claimed stakes in properties in which he had no ownership interest, but was merely licensing the use of his name or was in line to collect a percentage of future profits. When confronted by lawyers in a 2007 deposition about this, he at first insisted that he was correct, but then replied that not having ownership was actually smarter because it was not possible for him to lose any money should the investment tank.In 1991, at the age of 45, he invented a pseudonym for himself, called a gossip columnist and told her that “his boss,” Donald Trump, was dating Italian model Carla Bruni, when in fact he’d met her only once, a year earlier.Last summer, in the early stages of his campaign, he told a Rolling Stone reporter riding aboard his private jetliner that it was larger than Air Force One – even though his Boeing 757 is nowhere near the size of the modified 747 used by the president.And this spring – still stinging from former GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s speech ridiculing his various failed branded businesses – Trump pointed to a table of raw steaks and declared them “Trump Steaks,” even though that product has not been available for close to a decade.A Republican consultant close to the Trump campaign, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said Trump’s behavior is typical among wealthy candidates he has worked with.“All those years in public life, nobody cared about the veracity of statements they made outside their business, which is the only place truth matters to them,” the consultant said. “Many people ― close staff, family ― let him go on about things for years and just roll their eyes, some afraid to say, ‘Stop it.’ Because it’s a sideshow, doesn’t matter. Then, suddenly, it matters. But the habit is there, set in stone.”Falsehoods For The Sake Of FalsehoodsIn Trump’s case, whether the word “lie” technically describes his falsehoods is unclear. By definition, “lying” means knowingly and purposefully misrepresenting facts. In Trump’s case, he often appears not to understand the difference between what he is saying and actual reality.“I can’t think of any presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, in recent American history who wasn’t accused of lying. It’s the nature of the job, almost, to skew facts toward a political end,” said University of Memphis historian Aram Goudsouzian. “But Trump lies more frequently, and on a larger scale. Most important, even when confronted with contrary evidence, he still insists that he is right. It is a special kind of delusion.”“There have been candidates who embellished reality. Ronald Reagan sometimes remembered things that he actually remembered from a movie,” Rice University’s Brinkley said. “Nixon lied on purpose. He was lying to advance an idea forward. Donald Trump doesn’t even know he’s doing it, it’s so much part of his modus operandi.”He added: “There’s something psychologically warped with someone who sees no distinction between facts and fiction at all. The sign of crazy is when someone believes his own bullshit. And he believes his own B.S.: Everything he says is true because he said it.”Reagan’s confusion, as it turned out, may have been an early symptom of the Alzheimer’s diagnosis that was revealed in 1994, nearly six years after he left the White House.If Trump is afflicted with any form of dementia, though, it’s something that has been going on for quite some time. In 2006, at age 60, Trump held a fundraiser for Florida’s Charlie Crist, then running for governor as a Republican, at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. Trump spoke for close to 45 minutes, talking about all the redecorating he had undertaken to the various rooms there, about his reality TV program, about all sorts of things related to Trump ― but said nothing about Crist. The candidate, in fact, was not even offered the opportunity to speak.Trump’s need to invent facts about his own success appears to be a trait associated with narcissistic personality disorder, according to mental health professionals who have studied his public remarks, with the possibility that the malady may be antisocial personality disorder ― formerly known as sociopathy.That certainly was the assessment of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R), who, on the day he lost the critical Indiana primary in May, lashed out at Trump’s relationship with facts. “This man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies,” Cruz said. “I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory. And he’d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it.”Whether Trump’s behavior is actually a sign of mental illness is something only a professional assessment could determine, and it’s unknown whether Trump has ever sought one. His campaign did not respond to queries, and the physician who wrote a letter attesting to Trump’s health ― which closed with the line: “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency” ― declined to speak to The Huffington Post.Clinton’s Honesty Harder To Challenge With TrumpWhatever the reason behind Trump’s falsehoods, they have complicated the Republican Party’s efforts to use Clinton’s low scores for honesty and trustworthiness against her.For 25 years, Republicans have characterized both former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton as fundamentally dishonest, and the party has been working to make that case against her presidential campaign since it began last year.Even as Clinton prepared to accept the nomination last month in Philadelphia, the RNC staged a news conference that afternoon accusing her of lying. “Deception and dishonesty are all second nature to Hillary,” said Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge. “Hillary will lie even when the truth would serve her better.”But, later, Rutledge seemed at a loss to explain Trump’s falsehoods. “I’m not saying that Donald Trump ― everything he has said, I would advise him to say,” she said.Indeed, an analysis by PolitiFact showed Trump scoring the worst among the major party candidates running for president this election, with 77 percent of his checked statements rated as false. Clinton, in contrast, had 28 percent rated false.Andy Puzder, a top fundraiser for Trump and chairman of the company that owns the Hardee’s restaurant chain, said the comparison was not fair, as Clinton’s dishonesties were worse. Her 2008 statement that her airplane had come under sniper fire upon landing in Bosnia a dozen years earlier, her blaming the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks on an anti-Muslim YouTube video, and her much-criticized claims about her use of a private server for her government emails, Puzder said, were far more serious than Trump’s falsehoods.“These are large and material things, and they matter,” he said.But Shawn Steel, an RNC member from California and another fundraiser for Trump, conceded that Trump’s willingness to lie made it much harder for his side to attack Clinton on that front. “Any of the other 16 candidates would have had a much easier time of it,” he said, adding that it didn’t help that Trump’s falsehoods were so obvious and easily refuted. “She’s a far better liar. The quality of a lie from Hillary is on a much more sophisticated level.”And the GOP consultant worried that Trump will be unable to control what’s become part of his lifestyle. “Truth hasn’t mattered for decades, so when it does matter it’s too late to change bad habits,” the consultant said. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

We will see who we have in the military, who we have in the judiciary, and throw the others out of the door.”The parade ground, built to hold more than a million people, was overflowing, with the streets of surrounding neighborhoods clogged by crowds. One presidency official put the numbers at around five million and the event was broadcast live on public screens at smaller rallies across Turkey’s 81 provinces.Since the coup bid, Turkish authorities have suspended, detained or placed under investigation tens of thousands of people, including soldiers, police, judges, journalists, medics and civil servants, prompting concern among Western allies that Erdogan is using the events to tighten his grip on power.Erdogan vowed to rid Turkey of the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whose followers in the security forces, judiciary and civil service he accuses of orchestrating the attempted power grab and of plotting to overthrow the state.Erdogan said he would approve the restoration of the death penalty if parliament voted for it, a move which would sink any hopes of European Union membership. Shrugging off EU concerns, he said much of the rest of the world had capital punishment.Gulen - an ally of Erdogan in the early years after his Islamist-rooted AK Party took power in 2002 - has denied any involvement in the coup, which came at a critical time for a NATO “frontline” state facing Islamist militant attacks from across the border in Syria and an insurgency by Kurdish rebels.In a rare appearance at a public rally, military chief Hulusi Akar said the “traitors” behind the plot would be punished and he thanked civilians for their role in putting it down. Many of the more than 240 people killed on July 15 were civilians who tried to prevent the takeover of power.The leader of the main secularist opposition, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said a “new door of compromise” had been opened and that politics must be kept out of the mosques, courthouses and barracks. “There is a new Turkey after July 15,” he said.“FREEDOM OR DEATH”Erdogan, a polarizing figure seen by opponents as intolerant of dissent, invited the heads of the secularist and nationalist opposition parties to address the crowds in a display of national unity in defiance of Western criticism.“We’re here to show that these flags won’t come down, the call to prayer won’t be silenced and our country won’t be divided,” said Haci Mehmet Haliloglu, 46, a civil servant who traveled from the Black Sea town of Ordu for the rally.“This is something way beyond politics, this is either our freedom or death,” he said, a large Turkish flag over his shoulder and a matching baseball cap on his head.Turkey’s top Muslim cleric and chief rabbi also attended. But the pro-Kurdish HDP, the third-largest party in parliament, was not invited due to its alleged links to Kurdish militants, prompting anger on social media from its supporters.The brutality of July 15, in which rogue soldiers commandeered fighter jets, helicopters and tanks, shocked a nation that last saw a violent military power grab in 1980. Even Erdogan’s opponents saw his leadership as preferable to a successful coup renewing the cycle of military interventions that dogged Turkey in the second half of the 20th century.“Erdogan has been brutal and unfair to us in the past, but I believe he has now understood the real importance of the republic’s values,” said Ilhan Girit, 44, a musician and CHP supporter, carrying a flag of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founder of the modern secular republic.A convoy of nationalists on motorbikes passed as he spoke.Such solidarity may not last. There are already opposition concerns that the restructuring of the military lacks parliamentary oversight and is going too far, with thousands of soldiers discharged, including around 40 percent of generals.WESTERN CRITICISMThe extent of the purges in Turkey, which has NATO’s second largest armed forces and aspires to membership of the European Union, has drawn criticism in the West.In comments published on Sunday, the leader of Germany’s liberal Free Democrats said he saw parallels between Erdogan’s behavior and the aftermath of the Reichstag fire in 1933, portrayed by the Nazis as a Communist plot against the government and used by Adolf Hitler to justify massively curtailing civil liberties.Turkish officials have angrily rejected suggestions that the purges are out of proportion, accusing Western critics of failing to grasp the magnitude of the threat to the Turkish state and of being more concerned about the rights of coup plotters than the brutality of the events themselves.Amid the cooling of ties with the West, Erdogan is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday in St Petersburg for talks intended to end a period of tension after Turkey downed a Russian fighter jet near the Syrian border last November.“At the talks with my friend Vladimir, I believe, a new page in bilateral relations will be opened. Our countries have a lot to do together,” Erdogan told the TASS news agency in an interview published on Sunday.In Washington on Sunday several hundred people clad in red and waving Turkish flags gathered in front of the White House in support of Erdogan and to demand that U.S. President Barack Obama deport Gulen to Turkey.“He (Erdogan) has made some mistakes but he is not a dictator,” said Okan Sakar, 35, a Turkish tax inspector currently studying in the United States."

17,COLLEGE,Law Professors Defend Use Of Preponderance Standard In Campus Rape Cases,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/preponderance-of-evidence-college-sexual-assault_us_57a4a6a4e4b056bad215390a,"Arguing for a higher standard of proof would mean sexual harassment is treated differently than any other type of discrimination, they assert.",2016-08-07,"Three lawsuits accuse the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights, led by Catherine Lhamon, pictured above, of inappropriately telling schools to use the preponderance of evidence standard in college sexual assault cases.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a4bf5d2a0000fa01fb4f53.jpeg?cache=zMXg4y5e3r&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of more than 90 law professors from at least 50 different universities signed onto a white paper, released Sunday, defending the U.S. Department of Education’s guidance on how colleges should handle sexual assault cases.Specifically, the law professors focus on how much proof is needed to determine whether a student accused of sexual assault is guilty in the eyes of their college or university. A “Dear Colleague” letter released by the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights in April 2011 was considered a wake-up call for schools to honor their obligation to handle sexual violence involving students under the gender equity law Title IX.However, some groups have said a portion of the letter ― which told schools to use the “preponderance of evidence” standard in adjudicating sexual assault allegations as code of conduct violations ― amounted to issuing new regulations without going through a legally required process. It’s currently the subject of three federal lawsuits against the Education Department. The preponderance standard essentially means an accused person can be found guilty if the adjudicator or panel believes there’s a 51 percent chance the allegations against the individual are true. In other words, a jury would rule based on whose side they believe more.“The national debate over campus sexual assault often deals with pretty deep and complicated legal issues, even for lawyers,” said Nancy Chi Cantalupo, a Barry University School of Law professor who organized the white paper.“I wanted to help provide a resource to the public about one of those deep and complicated issues, to put the issue in the context of Title IX’s legal history and of our legal system as a whole,” Cantalupo said. “Many people seem to think of the law as just one kind of law: the criminal law, but there are many other kinds of law, including civil rights law.”The preponderance standard is used in civil lawsuits. In criminal courts, there’s a higher standard to establish someone’s guilt: “proof beyond a reasonable doubt,” meaning there’s hardly any chance the accused person isn’t guilty. Organizations like the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, the American Association of University Professors and national fraternity groups have argued the preponderance standard is too low and doesn’t provide enough protection for accused students. But the white paper from the law professors argues that this is a civil rights issue, and the preponderance of the evidence standard is one that’s always used to adjudicate discrimination claims under other civil rights statutes, like the portions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibit discrimination based on race and harassment in the workplace.If the Dear Colleague letter had expressed permission for other standards of evidence, the professors say, it would’ve “approved treating sexual violence and harassment victims differently from all other victims of all other discrimination prohibited under our nation’s anti-discrimination civil rights laws, and done so without any justification for that differentiation.”There appears to be no concern about “the use of the preponderance standard of evidence in handling allegations of racial harassment on campus,” the professors wrote. And students accused of sexual assault who are suing their universities, claiming they were treated unfairly, will have their lawsuits determined under the preponderance standard, should they go to trial. Chicago-Kent College of Law’s Katharine Baker, one of the organizers of the white paper, said the professors wanted to speak out because of the confusion caused by media coverage of sexual violence on campus. “There is a mistaken tendency to assume that the Department of Education is policing rape on college campuses and should therefore use the background norms of criminal law as an appropriate model for adjudication procedures,” Baker told The Huffington Post. “In fact, the department is responding to the overwhelming evidence that a culture of male sexual entitlement permeates college campuses and that women suffer disproportionately from having to live, study, and try to learn in that environment.” At least 90 law professors from more than 50 schools signed the paper as of Sunday evening, but the organizers expect more to add their names.

And while it’s really none of our business, many ― including his former girlfriend Julianne Hough and apparently Britney Spears ― assumed the TV personality was gay. Over the weekend, an old clip of Seacrest interviewing Spears and Black Eyed Peas member Will.I.Am went viral, with many claiming it shows the exact moment the “Piece of Me” singer realized Seacrest is straight. In the clip, Will.I.Am and Seacrest are talking about cologne and Will asks, “You spray cologne on your girl?” A seemingly dumbfounded Spears appears to react by mouthing “girl?” to no one in particular while looking extremely confused. It’s priceless. Check out the funny moment below:"

It's easy to understand. It covers the mental, emotional and physical aspects of depression, and even quantifies just how depressed you might be, dependent on your answers.Often, people who are moderately depressed don't realize how slowly the lights have gone down on the joy or satisfaction with their life. They can't see how much they are struggling with negativity, irritability or sadness. They are blind to the many ways they're isolating from others, or beginning to pull into themselves.Depression can happen so slowly you don't realize how hard life has become.Then it's shocking one day when you start to imagine your own death -- or some kind of escape from the world you're living in. If given an inventory, your answers surprise you as they reveal how dark your life has become.Depression has entrenched itself into who you are and how you think.It's taken you away from the ability to see opportunity, realize options or focus on others.The disease of depression robs you of your vitality.It's all you can do to function. But you do. You make yourself. You have responsibilities.You take your kids to school, but go back to bed.You go to work, but can't focus. So you give people excuses why you're not meeting a deadline.You are constantly berating yourself for what you aren't, what you haven't accomplished, or who you could have been, if given the chance.This is depression. If severe enough, you lose your desire or ability to function at all.The good news is that often you can get better. With exercise, therapy, medication, mindfulness, and hard work, many can lift the veil that has cut them off from the enjoyment of life.Some struggle more than that, and have to learn to manage chronic symptoms. That's a very tough way to live.So how is Perfectly Hidden Depression (PHD) different from any of this?One man recently answered that question. ""The inventory is asking the wrong question for me. I would answer a resounding 'no' to the statement, 'I often feel hopeless.' I wouldn't admit feeling hopeless, to anyone, ever. The question should be, 'If you could admit feeling hopeless, would you?' The answer again would be ""no,"" but it would reveal PHD.""  Perfectly Hidden Depression is a syndrome, or a set of characteristics and behaviors that enable people to hide or detach from emotional pain. That doesn't mean the pain isn't there, or that it's not having an effect.Doing all things to the best of your ability, all the time, every day. Pushing yourself to the limit. Putting others before yourself, always, believing that a focus on self is selfish. Living very deliberately, getting things done, accomplishing the seemingly impossible.Ignoring the memories of hurt. Avoiding revealing too much about yourself. Laughing off extreme fatigue.You don a mask of happiness every day, that you may even have come to believe is the real thing. Others admire and tell you what a great life you have. You're extremely invested in maintaining that image.The Beck Depression Inventory would never reveal PHD. Because whoever was taking it, would know someone else would see their answers.That's not acceptable, or so they have told themselves.While someone with classic depression may struggle to admit it, or may fear they will be stigmatized if they do, they're more likely to be honest about what they're experiencing. They have to -- the symptoms are choking the life out of them.Someone with PHD?Only when life starts becoming too complicated, when their sense of panic about things getting out of control starts rising, are they likely to consider revealing who they are, or attempt to confront what they've been telling themselves.Let's change that.Because sometimes, someone with PHD will wait too long. You will want to end your life, and no one even knows you need help. The loneliness can become unbearable.Because showing vulnerability does not equate with lack of strength. It simply doesn't.Because although many of the things that someone with PHD focuses on are admirable, being invisible hurts.You don't need to hide.Thank you for your help in reading and sharing this message.

No firearms were found on O’Neal, who was shot in the back, according to police.Johnson was named in March to lead the department, which is facing accusations of racism and a federal investigation into its practices after the city waited more than a year to release video of a separate 2014 fatal shooting by officers.On Saturday, he said the ongoing investigation prevented him from discussing details about the O’Neal shooting.“I was concerned by some of the things that I saw on the videos and that is why we took such a swift action that we did last week to relieve the three officers of their police powers,” Johnson said.The video footage released on Friday shows two officers firing at a stolen car driven by O’Neal after it sped past them, the car crashing into a police car, and O’Neal running into a backyard where he was shot. It does not show the shooting.Johnson said the lack of a body-camera video of the O’Neal shooting is under investigation, though he noted that the officers in that police district had the cameras for only about a week before the shooting.Civil rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson said the lack of a complete video accounting of O’Neal’s shooting showed a cover-up and a lawyer for O’Neal’s family called for a special prosecutor to investigate the killing.The union representing Chicago police officers urged the public not to rush to judgment.Dozens of protesters demanding swift action against the officers involved in O’Neal’s shooting demonstrated outside Chicago police headquarters on Friday night.A string of high-profile killings of black men by police in various U.S. cities in the past two years has renewed a national debate about racial discrimination in the criminal justice system and given rise to the Black Lives Matter movement.(Reporting by David Bailey; Editing by Leslie Adler and Paul Simao)"
21,POLITICS,The Green Party Picks Its Presidential Ticket,Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-party-presidential-ticket_us_57a64585e4b03ba680128f32,"Jill Stein is hoping to attract disillusioned Sanders supporters, but she has a tough road ahead.",2016-08-06,"Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein courted Bernie Sanders supporters at the Democratic convention in July before being formally nominated at the Green Party convention in Houston on Saturday, Aug. 6, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a6717b13000029007c360a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"HOUSTON ― The Green Party officially nominated Massachusetts physician and progressive activist Jill Stein as its presidential candidate on Saturday, also selecting human rights activist Ajamu Baraka as her running mate.“We are what democracy looks like and we are what political revolution looks like,” Stein said accepting her party’s nomination. Stein also served as the party’s standard-bearer in 2012, when she received .9 percent of the national popular vote.The radically progressive ticket faces a near-impossible climb electorally, as the Green Party only currently appears on ballots in 21 states and territories, though that number may grow as ballot registration deadlines are reached over the next month. However, the party has already been excluded from the ballot in Indiana, North Carolina and Oklahoma. Green Party officials hope that historically high disapproval ratings of the two major parties’ candidates, buoyed by disillusioned supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign, will give the party its highest turnout yet. However, party officials and activists readily admit they don’t expect to win in November. In a questionnaire submitted to the party by Stein, the candidate wrote that she hoped to “Multiply the Green Party vote totals several-fold over 2012” and “Establish the Green Party as the preeminent progressive opposition party to the bipartisan establishment in Washington.”Recent polling suggests Stein is poised to fare better in 2016 than in her first run and she is averaging roughly 4 percent in polls. However, her numbers have trailed the other major third-party candidate, Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, who has averaged around 8 percent. Perhaps more notable for Green activists, a recent survey from McClatchy finds Stein pulling more support from voters under 30 than GOP nominee Donald Trump, coming in third with 16 percent. “I want to recognize the people coming out of the Bernie Sanders campaign who helped launched a revolutionary political movement,” Stein told the assembled delegates on Saturday morning during remarks by the party’s presidential candidates. “[T]here will be no stopping you and no stopping us until we have achieved that change that we have all put on the platform together.”“On the day that Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton, the floodgates opened on our campaign,” Stein said in her acceptance speech.“Now that they got Bernie Sanders out of the way, they’re going to focus on us!” Iowa delegate Wendy Barth contended. Officials with the Stein campaign and Green Party spent far more of the convention appealing to Democrats disillusioned by Hillary Clinton’s campaign than Republican disillusioned by Donald Trump’s, a not very surprising development given the party’s liberal platform.Convention speakers directly criticized Clinton far more often than Trump, attacking the Democratic nominee for her support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and ties to Wall Street. “We are hungry for a woman president,” said one delegate during the party’s roll call vote, “but not a war-hungry corporate criminal.” Other speakers at the convention made more pointed appeals to wayward Sanders supporters. “The leader of your revolution has sold you out to a corporate shill warmonger,” one Green presidential candidate, Kent Philip Mesplay, told the crowd Saturday morning. YahNe Ndgo, a progressive activist and former Sanders supporter, accused the Vermont senator of “sheepdogging for Hillary and the Democrats in 2016.” “We cannot be beholden to Bernie Sanders,” Ndgo told the convention. In addition to selecting the party’s presidential ticket, the Green delegates also codified the party’s platform, which includes planks on dramatically ramping up efforts to combat global warming, ending mass incarceration and reducing domestic and foreign surveillance. It also features platform items that fall well to the left of the Democratic Party, including calling for reparations for descendants of slaves and condemning Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory.The Green Party has not been without its share of controversy this election cycle. Stein has come under fire recently for comments that affirmed the science of vaccinations but echoed language used by anti-vaccine activists, as The Huffington Post’s Anna Almendrala noted earlier this month. “Like any medication, [vaccines] also should be — what shall we say? — approved by a regulatory board that people can trust,” Stein told the Washington Post in July.Looking ahead, party officials say one of Stein’s best hopes to gain traction will be to appear in the presidential debates this fall. A lawsuit brought by the Stein and Johnson campaigns against the Commission on Presidential Debates, the body that sets the number of debates and the rules governing them, was thrown out by a federal judge on Friday. Currently, the commission requires candidates to receive at least an average of 15 percent in five nationwide polls in order to participate."

The president then humiliated Trump in a devastating roast at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner later that month.From the start, the birther movement was widely viewed as a thinly veiled attempt to delegitimize the president by racists outraged that a black man with foreign heritage was elected to the country’s highest office.As if to confirm these perceptions, Trump persisted in his quixotic quest to expose Obama as a fraud even after the White House released his “long form” birth certificate.In addition to challenging the birth certificate’s authenticity, Trump announced in October 2012 that he was offering $5 million for Obama’s college transcripts and passport records. The businessman refused requests to release his own transcripts and passport records.Nothing came of the former reality TV personality’s very public efforts, not only because of how patently offensive they were but also because his claims were clearly not true.Yet Trump has not disavowed his past crusade. He deployed similar tactics against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during the Republican primary, questioning whether he was eligible for the presidency since he was born in Canada.He also insinuated that Obama has terrorism ties in the wake of the massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June.Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski revived the original birther claims on Tuesday during an appearance on CNN, where he is now a commentator. Lewandowski ignored the birth certificate proof that had already been released and suggested that Obama hadn’t released his Harvard transcripts because they might show he wasn’t a U.S. citizen. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
23,POLITICS,North Carolina Governor Is Ready To Take Voter ID Fight To The Supreme Court,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-governor-voter-id_us_57a51504e4b056bad215a0c2,"An appeals court found the state's voting law harkened back to ""the era of Jim Crow.""",2016-08-06,"Gov. Pat McCrory (R) calls North Carolina's voter ID law ""common sense,"" but an appeals court called it ""discriminatory.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a5153f1300002a007c3489.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the states with the most restrictive voting rules in the nation will ask the Supreme Court to step in and let it enforce them in time for the presidential election.North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) said on Friday he’s ready to ask the justices to block an appeals court ruling issued last week that said the state’s omnibus voting law targeted blacks “with almost surgical precision.”“Changing our state’s election laws close to the upcoming election, including common sense voter ID, will create confusion for voters and poll workers,” McCrory said in a statement, adding that he expects to file an emergency petition with the Supreme Court “by early next week.”On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit refused to put on hold its earlier ruling, which made waves for decreeing that the state’s legislature had passed “the most restrictive voting law North Carolina has seen since the era of Jim Crow” ― and found that lawmakers acted with the intent to disenfranchise African-American voters.To remedy those violations, the court enjoined the law in full, ordering the restoration of early voting, out-of-precinct voting and same-day registration, as well as non-enforcement of the voter ID provision. In response, the state reassured the appeals court that it had the means to comply with the ruling ahead of the election.“Because of these assurances, we are confident that North Carolina can conduct the 2016 election in compliance with our injunction,” the appeals court said in its follow-up order on Thursday.But McCrory didn’t seem convinced, insisting that allowing last week’s ruling to take effect does a disservice to North Carolina.“The court should have stayed their ruling, which is legally flawed, factually wrong, and disparaging to our state,” he said in his statement.It is unlikely that McCrory will fare much better at the Supreme Court. Under its rules, he would need to convince five justices that he has a strong enough case to merit an order allowing North Carolina to once again enforce its multiple voting restrictions.As the 4th Circuit explained on Thursday, the justices themselves may be reluctant to intervene given the conflict contrary orders may cause for poll workers and voters so close to the election.“Court orders affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls,” the court said, quoting from a 2006 Supreme Court case. “As an election draws closer, that risk will increase.”"
