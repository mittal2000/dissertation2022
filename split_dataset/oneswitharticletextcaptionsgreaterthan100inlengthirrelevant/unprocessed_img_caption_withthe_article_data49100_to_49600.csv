He served as city councillor after his time as mayor.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57acabb71700001e01c729b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A publication ban on the infamous video of former Toronto mayor Rob Ford smoking crack cocaine was lifted on Thursday, allowing for the first public airing of the footage that sparked a political scandal and media circus in 2013.In the short cell phone video, Ford, who died earlier this year, appears in a disheveled state as he sits with a lighter in one hand and glass pipe in the other. He largely mumbles in agreement as an unseen friend, Elena Basso, talks animatedly about Ford’s achievements and denounces his detractors with some explicit language. At one point, Ford calls current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a “fat dick.”The tape has had a long and bizarre journey to public view. Ford, who died of a rare form of cancer in March, was the mayor of Canada’s largest city when reporters from the Toronto Star newspaper and Gawker wrote, in May 2013, that they had viewed a tape of him using crack. Gawker raised $200,000 to buy the tape from their unnamed source but the deal ultimately fell through.In October that year, Toronto police made a surprise announcement that they secured the footage from a hard drive during a series of raids targeting drugs and weapons. Canadian authorities also charged Ford’s driver and friend, Alexander Lisi, with extortion for trying to retrieve the tape of Ford from a gang member. The charges against Lisi were dropped this week, allowing a judge to lift the publication ban on the video ― which was held as evidence ― and resulting in its public release. Ford was already an outsized figure in the city for his bombastic persona and controversial populist politics, but the reports of his drug use and subsequent denials briefly turned him into something of an international celebrity. He became a frequent punchline of late-night comedians and even appeared as a guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live.Ford refused to resign through the scandal, but eventually took leave to enter rehab. He dropped out of the mayoral re-election race after doctors diagnosed him with cancer in September 2014. Ford died of his illness 18 months later. He never faced any criminal charges in relation to the tape."

Certainly some have made false allegations.”Under its hardline immigration policy, asylum seekers intercepted trying to reach Australia by boat are sent for processing to Australian-funded camps on Nauru, which holds about 500 people, and on Manus island in Papua New Guinea. They are told they will never be settled in Australia.The harsh conditions and reports of systemic child abuse at the camps have drawn wide criticism at home and abroad. Australia, however, has vowed there will be no change to the policy, which has been pursued by successive governments.Australia says the policy is needed to stop asylum seekers dying at sea on the dangerous boat journey from Indonesia to Australia. Hundreds of people died attempting the trip in the years before the policy was put in place.Refugee advocates said the leaked reports show the urgent need to end Australia’s offshore detention policy and that asylum seekers must be given medical and psychological support."

John McCain (R-Ariz.).“I implore Senator McCain ... I continue to implore all of the good Republicans who either support or are going to vote for their party’s candidate, this will be a historic moment in the Republican Party,” Khan said in an interview with Cronkite News, the news division of Arizona PBS.“If you publicly rebuked him, you will look back and you will stand tall in front of the nation and you will say you were not for this, we were for [a] better America,” he said.Khan, whose son, Humayun, was a U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq while protecting his troops, is a big fan of McCain’s. He called the Arizona senator “my and my family’s hero” and said one of the last talks he had with his son was about McCain’s book, Why Courage Matters.How can McCain say no to this guy?McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero declined to comment on whether the senator would un-endorse Trump. Instead, she pointed to a lengthy statement he put out last week praising the Khan family and dismissing Trump’s proposed ban.“He has suggested that the likes of their son should not be allowed in the United States ― to say nothing of entering its service,” McCain said in his statement. “I cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump’s statement. I hope Americans understand that the remarks do not represent the views of our Republican Party, its officers, or candidates.”He’s still endorsing Trump for president, though.It’s not the first time Trump’s critics have singled out McCain as the guy they think has the gall to publicly reject his party’s presidential nominee. Military veterans from around the country flew into Washington, D.C., last week to deliver a petition with 100,000 signatures to McCain’s office, urging him and other GOP leaders to yank their support for Trump. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.), who is running for McCain's Senate seat, knocked the senator for standing by Trump no matter what he says.“John McCain has changed so much after 33 years in Washington that he’s now willing to ignore a Gold Star father and continue clinging to Donald Trump because he believes it will help save his political career,"" she said in a statement. ""McCain’s failure to answer Mr. Khan proves the straight talk is gone and it’s McCain and Trump first, not country first.""McCain is currently leading Kirkpatrick by about 5 percentage points, according to HuffPost Pollster.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S. This article has been updated with a comment from Ann Kirkpatrick.

The RCMP had said on Wednesday that he was fatally shot by police, but at Thursday’s news conference the police could not say if he died as a result of the detonation, or as a result of being shot by officers.“The outcome if we have not been able to apprehend him, based on his actions when he was confronted, could have been significantly more dreadful,” said Deputy Commissioner Mike Cabana. “It was a race against time.”The incident was the first security test for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was elected in October 2015 and who in February fulfilled a campaign pledge to withdraw Canada from the combat mission against Islamic State and to increase its mission training local fighters against the group in northern Iraq.The video provided by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation allowed the RCMP to identify Driver and raid his home in Strathroy, about 225 km (140 miles) southwest of Toronto. In Washington, an FBI spokeswoman referred questions to Canadian authorities.In the video, which was shown at the news conference, a man in a black balaclava cites a phrase from the Koran, refers to crimes against Muslims and pledges an imminent attack on a Canadian city.“Oh Canada, you received many warnings, you were told many times what would become of those who fight against the Islamic State,” the man says in the video, pledging allegiance to the militant group.The video indicated that the attack was planned for the next 72 hours, during rush hour. Police said there was no indication that Driver, a 24-year-old Muslim convert, had any accomplices in his plans.“If he had gotten out of that residence before we got there, the scenario would have ended a lot differently,” said RCMP Assistant Commissioner Jennifer Strachan.Driver, who also used the alias Harun Abdurahman, was arrested last year for openly supporting the militant Islamist group Islamic State on social media.He had not been charged with a crime. But in February he was placed on a peace bond, a court order that restricted his movements, required that he stay away from social media and computers and not have contact with Islamic State or similar groups.Police said at the news conference that Driver had not been under constant surveillance, but had been monitored.Strathroy is a town of about 21,000 inhabitants in the heart of Ontario’s farmland. Driver’s house was on a tranquil street lined with detached two-storey homes, near a baseball field and a swimming pool.WARNING TO TRANSIT OPERATORSPublic transit operators in Toronto, Canada’s largest city, were warned by police of potential security threats hours before officers killed Driver, they said on Thursday.The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), which serves the city, and the regional operator GO Transit confirmed they were contacted by police early on Wednesday.A representative from the local Leo’s Taxi Transportation Ltd. said a cab had been dispatched to Driver’s address on Wednesday night at the time of the police raid.The representative, who declined to be identified, said the taxi driver was injured in the incident, but has since recovered. “He’s shaken up a bit, but he’s OK,” the representative said. “It was a shock, right?”Aaron Driver was a troubled child who converted to Islam in his teens some time before his support for Islamic State attracted the attention of Canadian police.Amarnath Amarasingam, a researcher at Dalhousie University who studies the paths individuals take towards extremism, said on Twitter that he had received an email from Driver on April 17 that expressed his satisfaction with his life.Amarasingam suggested that a call to action from an Islamic State spokesman and recent attacks by other lone actors pushed him from holding radical views to acting on them.In 2014, Canada was stunned by two deadly attacks that police said were the work of homegrown radicals and that led to tougher new anti-terrorism measures. A gunman killed a soldier at Ottawa’s national war memorial before launching an attack on the Canadian Parliament in October 2014 while, in the same week, a man ran down two soldiers in Quebec, killing one.Driver had expressed support for the Parliament gunman, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, on Twitter, which was how he first came to the attention of security officials.Driver’s former lawyer, Leonard Tailleur, said he was surprised by the incident as he had had an expert assess Driver and had found no signs of violence, despite his sometimes extreme views.In March last year, Canada said it had foiled a plot by a self-proclaimed Islamic State supporter to bomb the U.S. consulate and other buildings in Toronto’s financial district.(Additional reporting by Ethan Lou in Toronto, Andrea Hopkins in Ottawa; Writing by Frances Kerry; Editing by Alan Crosby)"
6,POLITICS,Experts Reject Trump's Claim That Obama Founded ISIS,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-barack-obama-isis_us_57ace92fe4b007c36e4dd7a3,Maybe it's time for Trump to beef up his team of foreign policy advisors.,2016-08-11,Donald Trump refused to back down from his claim that President Barack Obama is the founder of ISIS. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ace9b41800002100bca497.jpeg?cache=DSCT69ayIj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump’s latest attempt to weigh in on foreign policy discourse is his claim that President Barack Obama founded ISIS. With the president currently overseeing a far-reaching air war against ISIS in multiple countries, Trump’s claim is one that clearly doesn’t need fact-checking. But, for the sake of argument, The Huffington Post asked several experts who have followed the rise of ISIS and asked them to explain who actually founded the infamous jihadi group.It was a complex question, they said, and their answers varied. But no one said it was Obama.The most straightforward answer came from Bruce Riedel, a veteran CIA analyst, who now heads the Brookings Intelligence Project. “ISIS is the descendant of al Qaida in Iraq founded by Abu Musaib al Zarqawi in 2003. Zarqawi remains the group’s martyred founder hero, lauded in ISIS propaganda,” Riedel wrote in an email.Zarqawi, who was killed in a 2006 airstrike, wasn’t the type of guy you’d expect to head a jihadi organization, said Jessica Stern, a terrorism expert who co-wrote a book on ISIS and its tactics. “He was a secular thug whose mother wanted to save him from a life of crime and urged him to study Islam, to save him. He studied Islam, removed his tattoos, which are forbidden. He was virulently anti-Shiite, he beheaded his victims.” Zarqawi initiated the practices now employed by the group headed by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Stern said.The experts polled have apparently heard enough of Trump’s explosive claims to guess that what he meant to say is that Obama’s policies created an environment in which ISIS could thrive. (Trump defender Hugh Hewitt tried, in vain, to get the candidate to admit as much on Thursday, but Trump stuck to his initial response.)While some who have studied ISIS extensively agree that Obama’s policies in Iraq and Syria worsened an already chaotic situation, there was near unanimous agreement that the 2003 invasion of Iraq most directly triggered the rise of ISIS.“If there is an American President who bears responsibility for creating what is today ISIS it would be George W. Bush for invading Iraq and thus producing [Al Qaeda],” Riedel said.The rise of ISIS can be traced back to the civil war between Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq, sparked by the U.S. invasion, which toppled Saddam Hussein’s regime, said Vali Nasr, the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “Sunnis in Iraq were not reconciled to losing power ― to the rise of a Shiite government in Iraq,” Nasr said. It was in the subsequent insurgency that Sunnis who went on to join ISIS “honed their ideology and political relevance in the region,” he continued. “We fired all of the Baathists who had been working with Saddam,” Stern added. “Suddenly there are military personnel and intelligence operatives who don’t have jobs, but have guns. … They were ripe for recruitment.”But Stern also faults Obama for being too eager to distance himself from Bush’s ill-fated war, without fully considering the consequences of pulling military and diplomatic resources from the country.“Obama was elected on a mandate to get of Iraq. … But just because it was a mistaken policy doesn’t mean that it’s easy to rectify the situation. We left Iraq in the hands of a sectarian leader,” Stern said, referring to former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite leader whose leadership ignited widespread resentment within the country’s Sunni community. “And that did create an opening for jihadis.”Shadi Hamid, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, cited Obama’s restrained policy in Syria as more consequential to ISIS’s rise than the withdrawal from Iraq. “I’d argue that Obama’s unwillingness to confront the Assad regime was a boon for ISIS because Assad’s atrocities made ISIS more appealing. ISIS was able to present itself as a defender of Sunnis,” Hamid said. “But it’s unclear how much of that Trump is aware of.” Hamid said he would welcome closer scrutiny of the foreign policy decisions made by both Bush and Obama ― and the ways in which they directly or indirectly allowed jihadism to expand in the Middle East. “But we’re not having that conversation, because you have stupid, simplistic arguments which don’t really even make any sense from someone like Donald Trump. It’s kind of a missed opportunity for the Republicans.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Such an escalation could be used by Putin to demand better terms in the Ukraine peace process, or to inflame nationalist passions at home ahead of Russian parliamentary elections next month.The Russian leader met his top military and intelligence service brass on Thursday and reviewed “scenarios for counter-terrorism security measures along the land border, offshore and in Crimean air space,” the Kremlin said.Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said he had ordered all Ukrainian units near Crimea and in eastern Ukraine onto the highest state of combat readiness. He was seeking to urgently speak to Putin, the leaders of France and Germany, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and European Council President Donald Tusk.Oleh Slobodyan, a spokesman for the Ukrainian border guards, said Russia had massed troops on Ukraine’s border with Crimea in recent days following an uptick in Russian military activity in northern Crimea and heavier fighting in eastern Ukraine.“These troops are coming with more modern equipment and there are air assault units,” he told a news briefing in Kiev.The Russian Defence Ministry said its navy - whose Black Sea Fleet is based in Crimea - would start to hold exercises in the area to practice repelling underwater attacks by saboteurs."

But where they vary is how effective they are at actually implementing those laws,” said Channer.

But where they vary is how effective they are at actually implementing those laws,” said Channer.

It was claimed by both a faction of the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ur-Ahrar, and also by the Islamic State militant group, which has been seeking to recruit followers in Pakistan and Afghanistan.Targeted killings have become increasingly common in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province that has seen rising violence linked to a separatist insurgency as well as sectarian tension and rising crime.Later on Thursday, Bugti told Reuters that security at all potential targets was being beefed up around Baluchistan.A Chinese-funded trade corridor with promised investment of $46 billion is due to pass through the gas-rich province and the government has promised to boost security.“We have already done (added security) for our schools, educational institutions and universities ... Watchtowers have also been constructed,” he said.“But obviously this new threat against hospitals has emerged - we are checking that and will beef up.”(Writing by Kay Johnson; Editing by Paul Tait, Robert Birsel)"

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and their party win back control of Congress.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ab8cad1800001701bca0fd.jpeg?ops=crop_8_16_1929_1464%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Democratic Party won’t need to worry about a shortage of campaign money this year as it seeks to regain control of both the Senate and the House this November. That’s because its candidates in key competitive races are already posting strong fundraising numbers.According to a pair of analyses of campaign finance data through June 30 by the Campaign Finance Institute, Democratic challengers are in one of the strongest fundraising positions of the past decade for either party at this point in an election. The fundraising totals posted by these candidates puts the party where it wants to be months before the election. Democrats need to win five Senate seats for a majority and a far more difficult 30 in the House.Who has the most money by no means determines which party will win an election. For House races in the 2016 election, the strength of fundraising by Democratic challengers, especially in comparison to poor fundraising by Republican challengers, is partly related to the fact that the large Republican majority means that there are few remaining Democratic-held seats for them to contest. That being said, the numbers put up by Democratic challengers show a strong effort by the party to win, especially in the Senate.Republican Party incumbents may hold the advantage in House races, as is normal for incumbents running for election, but Democratic challengers are putting up high numbers. These Democratic challengers report, on average, $240,669 in receipts, the highest average for Democrats in any election since 2004. Democrats running against 24 of the most vulnerable Republican incumbents posted an average of $1.2 million raised. That might be short of the $2.2 million average raised by Republican incumbents, but signals a high level of competition in those races.The strength of Democratic House candidate fundraising is even more evident in the 40 races in which no incumbent is running. Of the 40 open seat races, 17 seats are currently held by Democrats and 23 by Republicans. Democrats running for these seats raised an average of $635,418, compared to the Republican average of $368,158, which is equivalent to the party’s ten year average. The Democratic average, meanwhile, is nearly double the average amount the party’s open seat candidates raised from 2004 through 2014.That disparity increases when looking at the 11 most competitive open seat races. In these contests, the Democratic candidate boasts an average $1 million raised, compared to about $500,000 for the Republicans.The positive fundraising outlook for Democrats gets even sunnier when looking at Senate challengers. According to the Campaign Finance Institute, “The average Democratic challenger raised more than one-third as much as the average Republican incumbent through June 30. This was the highest challenger percentage for either party at this stage of the race going back through 2004.”In four of the six most competitive Senate races, the Democratic candidate holds the fundraising advantage. Democratic candidates lead in fundraising in Illinois, New Hampshire, Nevada and Wisconsin, while Republicans lead in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, no Republican challenger to a Democratic incumbent has raised more than $700,000. And Democrats’ fundraising numbers don’t even include the $9 million cash on hand that former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh will bring into the Indiana Senate race."

Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) has had several months to figure out whom to vote for in the presidential election and how to defend his choice.Kirk, who faces a tough re-election challenge from Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), initially pledged to support Donald Trump if he were to become the Republican nominee. But in June, he became the first Republican senator to rescind support for the bombastic candidate, evidently sensing that being tied to Trump would hurt his own chances of hanging on to his Senate seat. Since then, Kirk’s waffled between various write-in options, including former CIA Director David Petraeus and former Secretary of State Colin Powell. The Illinois lawmaker appeared to have settled on writing in Powell’s name rather than voting for the viable alternative to Trump, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But his reason for doing so, which he explained to CNN’s Brooke Baldwin on Wednesday, suggests he hasn’t fully thought this one through.Brooke Baldwin: So, since you were the first, let me begin there. Un-endorsing Trump, but not endorsing Clinton, correct?One problem: Powell also supported the Iran agreement, breaking with his party to defend the accord.Last September, just days before Kirk and his fellow congressional Republicans failed to tank the nuclear agreement, Powell praised it as “a pretty good deal.”“I say, we have a deal, let’s see how they implement the deal. If they don’t implement it, bail out. None of our options are gone,” Powell said at the time.Duckworth’s campaign offered a blunt assessment of the apparent contradiction in Kirk’s remarks. “Once again, Republican Mark Kirk can’t keep his facts straight and doesn’t know what he’s talking about. In the era of Trump, deciding who should be the next President is serious business, and this is deeply unserious from Senator Kirk,” Matt McGrath, Duckworth’s campaign spokesman, said in a statement.Asked why Kirk would support Powell but not Clinton when they both defended the Iran deal, Kirk’s campaign tried to downplay the significance of the nuclear agreement in the senator’s calculus. “Sen. Mark Kirk has given several reasons why he could not support Sec. Clinton, including her careless actions regarding the handling of classified information, conflicts of interests and her position on key national security issues, including her work to negotiate the Iran deal,” said Kirk’s campaign manager, Kevin Artl.It’s worth remembering that Powell, as secretary of state, also used a personal email address to conduct official business ― and that Petraeus, Kirk’s previous pick for a write-in candidate, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified materials last year.

People are grasping at straws,” Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist unaffiliated with Trump, told Reuters.The best moves for Trump’s detractors may be withholding their endorsements, refusing to raise money for his campaign, throwing their weight behind Clinton or holding out hope that he voluntarily quits.PROMINENT DEFECTIONSClinton’s campaign now has a website for Republicans and political independents to sign up to pledge their support. It lists 50 prominent Republicans and independents who have endorsed her so far, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE.N) Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.John Negroponte, former director of national intelligence under President George W. Bush, and former Republican U.S. Representative Chris Shays of Connecticut were among those that announced their support on Wednesday.“Donald Trump lost me a long time ago,” Shays told MSNBC in an interview. “He does and says everything my mom and dad taught me never to say and do. He doesn’t understand the basic requirements of being president of the United States. And, frankly, he’s dangerous.”Earlier this week, 50 Republican national security officials had signed an open letter questioning the real estate mogul’s temperament, calling him reckless and unqualified.Other top Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine this week, have disavowed Trump but said they cannot back Clinton, either.Trump has dismissed the defections and criticism as an unsurprising reaction of the so-called Washington elite to his drive to change the status quo.“He has dug himself a deep hole overall because he’s allowed the race to become a referendum on his fitness to be president,” said Republican strategist and Trump supporter Ford O’Connell. “If he’s going to win this, he has to make it a referendum on Hillary Clinton and the ‘rigged system.’”RESET ABANDONEDTrump, a New York businessman, was seeking to reset his campaign this week with an economic policy speech after a series of missteps that included a prolonged clash with the parents of fallen Muslim American Army Captain Humayun Khan.But Trump’s remark at a Tuesday rally about gun rights activists sparked a torrent of criticism on social media that he was effectively calling for Clinton’s assassination.“If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,” Trump said at the rally at the University of North Carolina. “Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know,” he continued. The U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment guarantees a right to keep and bear arms.Clinton’s campaign called Trump’s remark “dangerous.” Trump’s campaign said the comment was misinterpreted and that he was encouraging gun activists to use their political power.“What he meant by that was you have the power to vote against her,” former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said late on Tuesday when introducing Trump at another rally.Trump’s comment and the resulting backlash occurred as Reuters/Ipsos polling showed some 44 percent of 1,162 registered voters believe he should exit the race and that as of Tuesday, Clinton led Trump by more than 7 percentage points, up from a 3-percentage-point lead late last week.Republican Party rules and state laws would make it difficult at this juncture to replace Trump on ballots ahead of the Nov. 8 election.The party would have to host another nominating convention or have delegates vote following the same process used at a formal convention. In addition, some states require that nominee names on ballots be certified earlier than others. The deadline in Ohio is Aug. 10; Florida is Sept. 1. Both are critical battleground states.A more likely scenario would be a replay of the 1996 presidential race, when Republican nominee Bob Dole was badly trailing President Bill Clinton. The party essentially deserted Dole by urging its congressional candidates to cut ties and concentrate on maintaining a Republican majority in the U.S. Congress.(Additional reporting by Susan Heavy, Doina Chiacu, Grant Smith and Jonathan Allen; Editing by Bill Trott and Jonathan Oatis)"

Even better is when Republicans and independents come out to say they not only oppose him, but also support her ― and the Clinton campaign is launching a new effort to court them. The campaign announced its new “Together for America” drive on Wednesday to reach out to Republicans and independents who oppose Trump. A campaign aide said the effort will vary by person, but could include Republicans and independents joining Clinton at events, urging others to support her, speaking about her in the media, fundraising and contacting voters.The “Together for America” campaign includes a website where Republicans and independents can enter their name and contact info. It asks them to “Tell us your story” about why they support Clinton and directs visitors to a list of her more prominent backers who aren’t Democrats.“Americans are looking to the next president to help bring us together to tackle the big challenges facing the country and Hillary Clinton’s bipartisan support is the latest proof that she can work across the aisle to make us stronger together,” Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said in a statement.The list of non-Democrats supporting Clinton is growing. The Clinton campaign also announced on Wednesday endorsements from former Reps. Chris Shays (R-Conn.) and Connie Morella (R-Md.); Carlos Gutierrez, a Commerce secretary under President George W. Bush; John Negroponte, a longtime diplomat and Bush’s director of national intelligence; and Carla Hills, a Housing and Urban Development secretary under President Gerald Ford.Separate from the campaign’s announcement, former Sen. Joe Lieberman (Conn.), who labels himself an “independent Democrat” and runs the group No Labels to push for politicians to work across party lines, told Fox Business on Wednesday that he plans to vote for Clinton. No Labels labeled Trump a “problem solver” earlier this year and there was speculation as recently as Tuesday that Lieberman might back the Republican nominee.“I’m an independent Democrat ― I never changed parties ― I’m going to vote for Hillary Clinton,” he said. “She’s strong, she’s smart, she understands national security and what I was most impressed about in the years in the Senate together, she reached across party lines to try to build coalitions to get something done,” he said later, adding that his focus for the election will be No Labels. Trump has had an especially disastrous few weeks since accepting the Republican presidential nomination in mid-July, including his remark Tuesday suggesting violence against Clinton: that “Second Amendment people” could do something about her if, as president, she nominated judges they disagreed with.Many of the latest Clinton endorsements from Republicans and independents refer specifically to temperament.“I think many Republicans know Donald Trump could cause great damage to our country and the world at large, and still plan to vote for him,” Shays wrote in an op-ed on CNN that also praised Clinton. “But not me. He represents practically everything I was taught not to be, and everything my wife and I taught our daughter not to be.”Gutierrez said in a statement that he supports Clinton “because she has the steady temperament and the experience to serve as president.” Clinton’s Republican endorsers had previously knocked Trump without explicitly endorsing Clinton. Gutierrez told NPR in June that the turning points for him were when Trump said a judge of Mexican descent was biased toward him and when he told a crowd to “look at my African-American.” Negroponte was among the 50 Republican intelligence officials who released an open letter on Monday saying Trump “would be a dangerous President and would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Maybe there is. I don’t know.”Here are some of the excuses:He didn’t mean that. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Trump meant voters “have the power to campaign against her.” According to CNN’s Jeremy Diamond, Giuliani continued to say the media spun out a nonexistent thread toward shooting Clinton.“I saw it, I heard it, I know what it meant,” Giuliani said. “I know how the crowd reacted to it.”He was talking about gun control. Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson said the comments weren’t at all an endorsement of violence, but rather a statement about Clinton and the Second Amendment.“He was talking about Hillary Clinton and gun control ... Hillary Clinton is a gun grabber,” Pierson told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “Mr Trump was clearly pointing that out as he does every day on the campaign trail.”Tapper noted that Trump appeared to be talking about voters’ responses after Clinton were elected. But Pierson said her boss was talking about what “could happen” and how voters should get out and vote to protect their right to bear arms.He was just saying go vote. Trump communications adviser Jason Miller said his boss’ comments were meant to spur “American voters who are passionate about their Second Amendment rights ... to use that power at the ballot box.” Any suggestion otherwise, Miller told CBS News’ Major Garrett, was “desperate,” “outrageous” and “ridiculous.”He uses metaphors all the time. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) said Trump’s comments were simply a play on words. “What he meant was we can stop Hillary Clinton from being elected,” he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. Blitzer noted that Trump was talking about a future when Clinton was already in office, but Hunter responded that Trump sometimes “says things that the way they come out are not the way he means.”Clinton lies more than Trump is outspoken. Former GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich simply pointed a finger at Clinton in an email response to Trump’s comments. “Trump goes off script less often than Hillary lies,” he wrote.On Tuesday evening, the U.S. Secret Service, tasked with protecting the president and leading presidential candidates, tweeted that the agency was aware of Trump’s comments.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

The allusion to violence at Trump’s rally on Tuesday ― which some defenders said was a joke and others said was misconstrued ― quickly led to requests by members of Congress that the Secret Service look into it. The Secret Service offers protection to both Trump and Clinton. The Secret Service has been tight-lipped on the matter publicly, tweeting that it was “aware of the comments.”But a Secret Service official told CNN on Wednesday that “there has been more than one conversation” between the law enforcement agency and the Trump campaign, according to the network. The official also said the Trump campaign told them he did not mean to incite violence, CNN reported. Not so, Trump tweeted. The Secret Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters, citing an unnamed federal official, reported later Wednesday that “there had been no formal conversations with the campaign regarding the comment made to supporters the day before.” The Trump campaign has offered multiple defenses of his comments, but mostly argued that he was not referring to violence at all, and instead urging pro-gun rights advocates to vote (a matter complicated by the fact that he was talking about after the election rather than before it). Trump said Tuesday that the entire controversy was a good thing for him. “I have to say, in terms of politics, there is few things, and I happen to think that if [the media] did even bring this up, I think it’s a good thing for me,” he told Sean Hannity. “Because it’s going to tell people more about me with respect to the Second Amendment ... because Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment.”This article has been updated to include the Reuters report that there had been no formal conversations with Trump’s campaign.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
