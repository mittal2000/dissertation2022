",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There’s a full-fledged political debate going on in France over, well, proper swimming attire.On Sunday, a small town on the island of Corsica became the third city in France to outlaw burkinis, a form of modest swimwear worn by some Muslim women. The town’s mayor imposed the ban after violent clashes erupted between villagers and three Muslim families, leaving several injured. The details of what caused the brawl are unclear, but officials determined that somehow, someway a burkini was to blame.In fairness, the fight was likely a tipping point in France’s longstanding crusade against religious attire ― the brunt of which Muslim women have experienced most intensely in recent years.Arguments against the burkini range from upholding women’s rights to curbing terrorism ― both of which many Muslims reject and find blatantly offensive.Laurence Rossignol, the French government’s minister for women’s rights, defended the burkini bans in the three cities on Tuesday saying, “The burkini is not some new line of swimwear, it is the beach version of the burqa and it has the same logic: hide women’s bodies in order to better control them.”The head of municipal services in Cannes, one of the three cities that have banned the burkini, told AFP: “We are not talking about banning the wearing of religious symbols on the beach... but ostentatious clothing which refers to an allegiance to terrorist movements which are at war with us.”But as Muslim scholar Huda Jawad pointed out in The Independent, such bans end up “singling out the most visible and vulnerable group in society,” and blaming them for larger societal ills. “Since when did wearing a burkini, in most cases a loose fitting nylon version of a wetsuit, become an act of allegiance to terrorist movements?” Jawad wrote. “Do Marks & Spencer or House of Fraser know that their attempt to raise profits and exploit a gap in the over-saturated clothing market is selling and promoting allegiance to Isis? “The logic of proponents’ arguments is that women who wear burkinis are either a) oppressed or b) terrorists. And such is the reductive stereotyping Muslim women have become all too familiar with in recent years.Several Twitter users and media outlets managed to find some humor in the burkini uproar ― and point out its hypocrisy: "

ABC News reported on Tuesday that Flynn, along with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, would accompany Trump to his first top-secret briefing, heightening critics’ fears that the Trump camp would gain access to secrets it could potentially leak to contacts in the Kremlin. But former intelligence officials familiar with the briefings process said it’s unlikely that the presidential nominees or their advisers will be looped in on critical secrets until after the election in November.It’s not unusual for presidential nominees to bring national security aides to classified briefings. The candidates are automatically eligible for briefings after receiving their party’s nomination, but aides must first be vetted and granted an expedited security clearance, David Priess, author of The President’s Book of Secrets, said in a phone interview. Priess, a former CIA analyst and briefer, said he was not aware of any nominee’s adviser ever being barred from attending a briefing. A spokesman from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the classified meetings, declined to elaborate on the vetting process for the aides who accompany nominees. If the intelligence community isn’t alarmed by Flynn’s post-government connections with Russia and its propaganda outlet, it could be an indication of the limited information that will be provided in Wednesday’s briefing.Intelligence officials brief presidential nominees because one will end up serving in the White House. But one won’t, so officials don’t share sources, intelligence-gathering methods or details of ongoing covert operations, Priess said. “It’s intended to be an overview of the hotspots around the globe,” he said. “It’s not intended to be absolutely comprehensive.”Michael Morell, former acting director of the CIA, echoed this assessment in an interview with The Cipher Brief.When classified briefings for presidential candidates began in 1952 under then-President Harry Truman, the goal was to prepare potential commanders in chief for the array of threats facing the U.S. The reason for the briefings has since evolved, according to Priess, into an effort to prevent candidates from inadvertently saying something that may reduce their options in the future or undermine current national security policy. Because the briefings are rooted in tradition rather than law, the sitting president has final say on who will be briefed and what information they receive. Typically, the president delegates full control of the briefings to the intelligence community ― which makes a deliberate effort to ensure that the nominees receive the same information. Morell, who has endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s candidacy, said the briefings could differ simply because of Clinton’s experience on national security issues. “I would expect the briefing for Secretary Hillary Clinton to delve into issues more deeply and to be more of a dialogue than the briefing for Donald Trump, which I would expect to be more of a tutorial, more of a first cut at the issues, with the need to provide the history and background on issues,” Morell said in the interview with The Cipher Brief. If Clinton gains access to new information as a result of a back-and-forth with intelligence officials, said Priess, the briefers would likely feel obliged to share that information with Trump to avoid “even the perception of bias.” The intelligence community’s discretion to withhold especially sensitive information from nominees and their advisers ends Nov. 8, when the next commander in chief is chosen.Trump appears increasingly aware of the poor optics of his past praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his decision to stock his small foreign policy team with outspokenly pro-Russia advisers. On Monday, the Trump team assembled a list of news clips into a press release accusing Clinton of having close ties to Putin that deserve scrutiny. The timing of that accusation makes Trump’s decision to bring Flynn to his first briefing a dubious political move. The explanation for that decision was offered through anonymous sources to Fox News reporter John Roberts on Tuesday, who said Flynn was coming to “interpret the reports” because “the Trump campaign is not confident of the quality of the intelligence they will receive.”Trump announced a policy Tuesday evening that further muddied the optics of Flynn receiving payment from a Russian-funded media outlet.“I’m going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office or from any entity tied to a foreign government,” Trump said at a rally in Wisconsin, criticizing Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, for accepting large speaking fees since leaving government.

3,PARENTS,Does The Lulla Doll That Promises To Help Babies Sleep Actually Work?,Sarah DiGiulio,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/does-the-lulla-doll-that-promises-to-help-babies-sleep-actually-work_us_57b1cdeae4b007c36e4f470e,It depends who you ask.,2016-08-16,"Straps hidden inside the Lulla doll can be used to secure the doll to a crib, bed, shelf or car seat, so that younger children can safely sleep near the doll.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b2337d180000ad02bcae83.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When a doll hit the market that promised it helps babies get more and better-quality sleep, parents everywhere noticed. The first 5,000 Lulla dolls sold out immediately. Bidding wars broke out on eBay with people shelling out hundreds of dollars for a single doll. The dolls had initially retailed for $71 a piece.“Max was a dreadful sleeper,” Rebecca Ilie, a mother from Australia, told The Daily Telegraph. But after sleeping with the doll, “His sleep was dramatically improved within days and by three weeks he was sleeping through the night.”The doll’s secret is a sound box in its chest that plays a recording of a real mother’s breathing and heartbeat on an eight-hour loop. “The Lulla doll design is based on scientific research on closeness, kangaroo care, the effects of heartbeat and breathing sounds and the effects that smell, sight and touch have on babies and small children,” Eyrún Eggertsdóttir, founder and CEO of RóRó, the Icelandic company that makes the doll, previously told The Huffington Post U.K.“Research tells us when babies hear these sounds, they tune into them and start following the rhythm that they hear,” said Eggertsdóttir, who is also a mother of two. “When babies feel more stable and calm, it helps them to fall asleep and stay asleep for longer at a time,” she said.The dolls were created with the intention of helping babies and young children sleep, but there’s no defined age limit, Eggertsdóttir said.The dolls also come with a set of velcro straps, so that they can be attached to a crib, bed, shelf or car seat so that newborns and infants can sleep near the doll without it being loose in the crib with them (as current guidelines recommend, soft toys should not be placed in a baby’s crib because of risks of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and other injuries). Today Show editor and mother Meena Hart Duerson was not convinced that the Lulla doll would work.“Was this really the magic bullet?” she wrote in an article for Today. So, she decided to put the plush “miracle worker” to the test for a Today Show segment, which you can watch above. “I tried it out on my baby who’s super cute, but a nightmare when it comes to taking naps,” Hart Duerson said. “I was willing to try anything.”And just to make sure her son wasn’t an outlier, she recruited a few babies from the neighborhood to try out the doll, too.Her conclusion: “The Lulla doll didn’t turn out to be magical for me, but that doesn’t mean it won’t be for you.”Watch the video to see what Hart Duerson’s son and other babies do with the doll.Sarah DiGiulio is The Huffington Post’s sleep reporter.

Pace’s new solo show, “Naked Brazilian,” premiered Aug. 12 as part of the New York International Fringe Festival. Directed by Stephen Brown-Fried, the show is largely autobiographical, exploring Pace’s “hilarious and heartwarming” journey toward self-acceptance after leaving his native Rio de Janeiro for New York.“Everyone thinks Brazil is the place of freedom and Carnival, but being gay is not accepted in many families,” Pace told The Huffington Post. “Naked Brazilian,” he added, “discusses challenges and risks to fight for dreams at the expense of a safe, comfortable and uneventful life.”Describing his younger self as a boy who “wanted nothing more than to entertain others,” Pace said his show will examine the various obstacles he faced as he came to terms with living an authentic life ― including a homicidal landlord, an alcoholic father and a therapist who once attempted to set him up with a woman. “One day, she said, ‘Oh, no ― you don’t like boys, you’re afraid of women. You are afraid of the vagina. But you shouldn’t be – you’re a good-looking guy. I would date you,’” Pace recalled. “Was that really a therapy session?” Saying the show is “dedicated to those who have a life dream and work hard to achieve it,” Pace said he hopes people will find personal inspiration in his journey. “The aim of the play is to motivate the audience to take more risks to achieve their life dreams,” he said. Pace performs in “Naked Brazilian” at the New York International Fringe Festival on Aug. 17, 19 and 21. Head here for more details. "
5,POLITICS,Social Security Just Turned 81. This Is Its Impact.,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-security-birthday-reports_us_57b1de34e4b069e7e505ee07,New reports highlight the social insurance program's benefits for some 60 million people.,2016-08-15,"President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the law creating Social Security on Aug. 14, 1935. It is one of the country's most popular and successful social programs.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b1dfee1800002100bcaccc.jpeg?cache=0RbuJrigXK&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Exactly 81 years ago on Sunday, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law, creating the country’s first national pension program.In subsequent decades, the program evolved to cover all on-the-books workers and provide benefits to severely disabled workers and their dependents, as well as the spouses and dependent children of deceased workers.Social Security is credited with reducing elderly poverty from 50 percent prior to its creation in 1935 to roughly 10 percent today. The program enjoys the rare distinction of enormous popularity with both Republicans and Democrats.While most headlines about Social Security nowadays typically focus on the program’s long-term shortfall, two reports released last week in honor of Social Security’s anniversary chronicle the extent of its successes. The Democratic staff of Congress’ Joint Economic Committee published a report on Social Security’s increasingly important role as a source of retirement income.Social Security lifts 14.5 million people out of poverty, according to the JEC. In 2014, the analysis found, 41.5 percent of Americans aged 65 or older would be living in poverty without Social Security, compared to the current 10 percent.Due to the decline of defined-benefit pensions once commonly provided by employers and the challenge of amassing personal savings amid stagnant wage growth, Social Security will only become more significant as a source of retirement income, the analysis argues.Another series of reports by Social Security Works, a progressive group fighting for the expansion of benefits, documents Social Security’s impact across the country. The organization has produced individual reports showing how the program works in each state, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.Social Security provided benefits to nearly 60 million Americans in 2015, according to Social Security Works ― nearly 1 in 5 total residents. The median benefit for retired workers was just under $15,000 in 2015, the report notes. Yet these modest sums constituted the majority of income for over 60 percent of beneficiaries aged 65 or older in 2014, according to Social Security Works.West Virginia is the state with the highest percentage of residents who depend on Social Security. More than one-quarter of state residents received the program’s benefits in 2015, according to Social Security Works.Social Security Works also highlights Social Security’s lesser-known role as an anti-poverty program for children. It provided benefits to some 4.3 million children in 2015, many of whom receive the program’s survivors insurance benefits for a deceased working parent. In total, the program lifted 1.1 million children out of poverty in 2014.Social Security has become a prominent issue in this year’s presidential race. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, has promised not to cut the program’s benefits and has said she would increase benefits for vulnerable groups. Donald Trump, casting himself as an economic populist, has bucked conventional Republican orthodoxy on Social Security, assuring voters he would shield them from benefit cuts. In a 2011 interview, however, Trump claimed he supported cutting the program, but said Republicans should not discuss their plans to do so to avoid the political fallout.Clinton congratulated Social Security on its 81st birthday on Sunday.

6,BLACK VOICES,Milwaukee Declares Curfew After Violent Protests Over Police Shooting,"By Brendan O'Brien, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/milwaukee-police-shooting_us_57b15f76e4b071840411cb56,Police rescued one shooting victim. An officer was also injured when a rock smashed a patrol car windshield.,2016-08-15,"Seventeen people were arrested, and four officers were injured, after violence broke out during demonstrations on Saturday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b160411800002100bcabab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The city of Milwaukee imposed a 10 p.m. curfew on Monday in an attempt to quell rioting that erupted the previous two nights in response to the police shooting of an armed black man in one of the most segregated cities in the United States.Mayor Tom Barrett also renewed his call for state officials to release a video of the Saturday night shooting in hopes it convinces angry protesters that deadly force against Sylville K. Smith, 23, was justified.“There is a curfew that will be more strictly enforced tonight for teenagers,” Barrett told a news conference. “So parents, after 10 o’clock your teenagers better be home or in a place where they’re off the streets.”Milwaukee has become the latest American city to be gripped by violence in response to police killings of black men in places such as Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 and Baltimore last year.Famed for its breweries, Milwaukee is also one of the most segregated cities in America, with a large concentration of unemployed black men in the inner city separated from the mostly white suburbs.Such inequality has afflicted many U.S. cities as a result of the loss of manufacturing jobs over the past three decades, sometimes stoking unrest when police use deadly force.Police say Smith was stopped on Saturday afternoon for behaving suspiciously and that he then fled on foot between two homes. Smith was carrying a stolen handgun which he refused to drop when he was killed, police said.The shooting led to a first night of protests over his death in which gunshots were fired, six businesses were torched and 17 people were arrested. Police reported four officers were injured and police cars were damaged before calm was restored.On Sunday night, when police in riot gear faced off with protesters throwing bottles and bricks, four officers were injured and one other person suffered a gunshot wound, police said. Three police squad cars were damaged and 14 people were arrested, authorities said.Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker had activated the National Guard on Sunday in case more trouble flared, but despite the violence, police said the guardsmen were not called in.This weekend’s shooting in Milwaukee was distinct in that the deceased was armed, according to the police account. The officer who fired the deadly shot was also black.The mayor would like Wisconsin state officials to release the video to the public in order to corroborate the police account. State law requires all police shootings to be investigated by an independent state agency, giving the state control over such evidence.“I want the video released. ... I’m going to urge that it be released as quickly as possible,” said Barrett, who has yet to see it.Police Chief Edward Flynn said on Sunday that video from the officer’s body camera showed Smith had turned toward the officer with a gun in his hand.The video appeared to show the officer acting within the law, Flynn said, but because the audio was delayed it was unclear when the officer fired his weapon.Police had stopped Smith’s car, leading to a chase on foot.Police said Smith’s car was stopped because he was acting suspiciously, raising skepticism within largely African-American neighborhoods where people report racial discrimination from police. Smith also had a lengthy arrest record, officials said.Asked at the news conference why officers had stopped the car on Saturday, Police Chief Edward Flynn said the officers had not been interviewed yet and that they would be interviewed later on Monday.(Additional reporting David Ingram in New York; Writing by Daniel Trotta; Editing by James Dalgleish)"

The killings in the borough of Queens had shocked the neighborhood’s Bangladeshi community.Morel was charged with two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of Imam Maulama Akonjee, 55, and Thara Uddin, 64, the police spokesman said.He also was charged with two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon. The spokesman did not disclose any possible motive for the shooting.Morel had been questioned by police following his arrest on charges related to a hit-and-run traffic accident on Saturday, the day of the shootings.Akonjee and Uddin were shot in the head at close range after Saturday prayers at the Al-Furqan Jame Mosque in Queens’ Ozone Park section.Police told a briefing before the charges were announced that a suspect being questioned was an Hispanic man from Brooklyn.Police said there was still no known connection between the man being questioned and the murder victims.“We believe because of the evidence we have acquired thus far that ... this is the individual,” New York City Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said when asked if he could reassure the rattled community.Speaker after speaker at the funeral had implored authorities to investigate the murders as hate crimes and to step up efforts to protect mosques and parts of the city like Ozone Park where many Muslims live and work.“We want justice,” Badrul Kahn, founder of the Al-Furqan mosque, shouted to the crowd in the service’s opening speech.“We want justice,” responded the mourners, most of them men dressed in Islamic garb.Mayor Bill de Blasio, addressing the funeral, promised the city would bolster the police presence in the neighborhood even though the motive behind the killings was still unclear.Police had said earlier that there was no evidence the men were targeted because of their faith but nothing was being ruled out.Residents of Ozone Park were shaken by the brazen daylight killings and said such a crime was rare in the normally quiet neighborhood.(Additional reporting by Ian Simpson in Washington and David Ingram in New York; Writing by Frank McGurty; Editing by James Dalgleish, Toni Reinhold and Paul Tait)"

Jim captured Chavez in a pose that suggests the vision and leadership that he truly embodied. I believe in what Chavez stood for as an activist and civil rights leader. He fought for the rights of people doing some of the most difficult work for some of the lowest wages so they could unionize and advocate for themselves to earn a dignified wage. In my art piece, I included articles that reflected the struggles of people who are on the lowest rung of the economic ladder.

Instead, he’s been working on a project that transforms iconic photographs of the past into potent reminders of the injustices Americans ― no matter their party preference ― face on a regular basis. He’s used the work of Jim Marshall, well-known music photographer and lesser-known advocacy artist, as the basis of his red-and-black prints, tackling everything from mass incarceration to gun rights.Fairey hopes the work, dubbed “American Civics” and on view as part of HuffPost’s “If This Art Could Vote” project, highlights something oft-overlooked in heated political debates: the humanity behind America’s enduring social justice issues. We checked in with the artist to talk about Jim Marshall’s legacy, the lack of “hope” today, and why he’s voting for Hillary Clinton.Can you tell me a little bit about the “American Civics” series? What inspired the project?When was your first encounter with Jim Marshall or his work? What was your first impression?The pieces you created span five topics: Voting rights, mass incarceration, workers’ rights, gun culture and the concept of two Americas.

9,POLITICS,This Democrat Isn't Challenging Her Opponent To A Debate. She's Challenging A Donor To His Super PAC.,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zephyr-teachout-paul-singer-debate_us_57b21d62e4b0718404126567,Zephyr Teachout is cutting out the middleman.,2016-08-15,Democrat Zephyr Teachout is competing against Republican John Faso to represent New York's 19th District in the U.S. House of Representatives.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b21f02170000d002d1ee4e.jpeg?cache=SBi5TOAwrp&ops=crop_897_200_1823_938%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In May, billionaire Paul Singer fundamentally changed one of the most interesting political contests of 2016. The vulture fund manager wrote a $500,000 check to a super PAC supporting John Faso, a Republican trying to fill an open congressional seat in New York’s Hudson Valley. Overnight, Faso became a serious contender in a race that had been dominated by progressive Democrat Zephyr Teachout.Teachout is popular in New York’s 19th District. The counties sandwiched between Albany and New York City formed the backbone of her support during her 2014 primary challenge to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), and the district leans narrowly Democratic. Teachout’s fundraising in the first quarter of the year was off the charts. Her $530,000 haul was driven by small-dollar donations and some help from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and she barely spent anything during the primary.Faso had been relying on super PAC funding from another hedge fund billionaire, Robert Mercer, to get through a much tighter primary contest on the Republican side. When Singer signed on in May, Faso had the firepower to challenge Teachout in the general election.On Monday, Teachout decided to bypass Faso himself and go after his donor. In a video posted to her Facebook account, she criticized Singer and challenged him to a debate.“This is very serious,” Teachout says in the ad. “Paul Singer, I challenge you to come here and have a debate with me … I think the people of the 19th District deserve to hear your actual voice when you’re putting so much money into trying to buy up representation.”Watch the ad below:Teachout is an academic corruption expert who is building her campaign message around curbing the influence of large corporations and money in politics. So highlighting Singer isn’t just an attempt to dismiss Faso as a tool of big money interests ― it also draws attention to Teachout’s strongest issue. But the ad itself is also an example of the degree to which political donors are increasingly taking up campaign space that was previously reserved for actual politicians. In the run-up to the 2014 elections, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D) relentlessly attacked the Koch brothers from the Senate floor, making their involvement in conservative politics an issue. During the Democratic presidential primary, Sanders assailed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton’s paid speeches to Goldman Sachs. While Goldman Sachs tried to stay out of the limelight, Charles and David Koch have become political celebrities and subjects of multiple biographies and interviews on cable news. Singer and Faso did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Huffington Post spoke with Teachout on the latest episode of its politics podcast, “So, That Happened.” Listen to the interview, embedded below: "

(Both children’s names have been spelled differently in various news reports; police would not confirm the spellings to The Huffington Post.) Thomas also has a 12-year-old son who has not been harmed, police told local media.Thomas allegedly told police that she killed her two younger children Friday morning and put their bodies, wrapped in bedsheets, in a trash can behind her house.The next day, she allegedly tried to bury them near the side of her house but was unable to dig a hole deep enough. Police say she then moved the bodies to an area beneath her neighbor’s home.A man who knows Thomas reportedly spotted her throwing trash in a vacant lot near her home on Sunday. Thomas told the man that she was moving, and he offered to help her pack, police told WFAA.When the man asked Thomas about her children, she allegedly replied that she killed them, which the man initially took for a joke. After he asked again and Thomas gave the same answer, the man drove her to the police station, where police say she confessed to authorities.“She was very matter-of-fact in terms of what she stated she had done,” Kesc Smith, a spokesperson for the Houston Police Department, told WFAA.Kita Thomas-Smith, who identified herself as the children’s aunt, said the kids’ father is incarcerated and doesn’t yet know what happened.“How am I going to tell my brother about his kids?” she cried.Thomas-Smith said she’d previously helped take care of Thomas’ children and would have done it again if asked.“I’m just a phone call away,” she said. “I would have come and got these kids.”A spokeswoman for Houston’s Child Protective Services confirmed to the Houston Chronicle that the agency had previously dealt with Thomas. She declined to provide details.Thomas-Smith told the Chronicle that Thomas had no mental health issues that she knew of.Thomas’ neighbors told local media that she had seemed to take good care of her kids, and that the family had appeared happy.“She made sure she kept the kids clean,” neighbor Shirley Baines told KHOU of Thomas. “She takes care of them. She goes to the store... To me she was like, a real nice person.”As of Monday morning, a GoFundMe page reportedly set up by Thomas-Smith had raised over $1,000 to pay for the children’s funeral services."

Fortunately, a team of emergency responders in Enfield, Connecticut, came to its rescue.Enfield EMS confirmed to The Huffington Post that the object was a yogurt container. Although they no longer had the cup, they said it appeared to be one sold by Yoplait.The same observation was made by some animal lovers who viewed the video and expressed concern on social media and in at least one news outlet’s comment section.Yoplait’s yogurt containers have a notably small opening and a history of getting stuck on animals’ heads.Earlier this month, a skunk found itself in a similar pickle with its head caught in a yogurt container. Michigan state troopers were able to rescue it, MLive.com reported.Just days before that, first responders in Ontario, Canada, were recorded suiting up in protective gear to free another skunk whose head was stuck in a plastic cup. Skunks often fall victim to Yoplait containers, according to Laura Simon, a Connecticut-based wildlife ecologist and skunk specialist with the U.S. Humane Society.“This is really a terrible source of peril,” she told The Huffington Post last year, in the wake of yet another video of a skunk with its head caught in a Yoplait cup.A quick search on YouTube found more than a dozen similar videos.Simon explained that the danger lies in the container’s shape: a narrow opening combined with an inner rim that makes it easier for animals to get caught.There’s at least one online petition calling on Yoplait to redesign its containers, as well as a Facebook page where fans vow to boycott the General Mills-owned brand until they see change.A Yoplait spokesman said Monday that the company has no plans to change its design.“Because wildlife will try to eat from containers of all shapes and sizes for a variety of products, changing the cup design will not solve the overall issue,” Mike Siemienas, manager of General Mills’ brand media relations, said in a statement. “We urge consumers to crush containers before disposal and to dispose of all containers properly where animals cannot gain access. We print the message ‘protect wildlife, crush before disposal’ on our cup for that reason.” "

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned an air strike on a school in northern Yemen that killed 10 children and called for an investigation, while the Saudi-led coalition said the attack had targeted a training facility run by the Houthi group.Aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres said 28 other children were wounded in Saturday’s attack on the school in the Saada province. The United Nations Children’s Fund said the facility was a religious school in Juma’a Bin Fadil village in the province’s Haydan district.Dozens of air strikes have hit civilian facilities in Yemen since a coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia began military operations in March 2015 to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power and roll back gains by the Iran-allied Houthis.A spokesman for Ban said he condemned the attack and urged parties “to prevent further violations of international humanitarian law and human rights and do everything in their power to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure.”A spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition did not respond to requests by Reuters for a comment on the reports. But Saudi media quoted General Ahmed al-Assiri as telling media that the coalition had targeted a center used by the Houthi militias as a training camp.The coalition accuses the Houthis of recruiting children to fight in the conflict that has claimed more than 6,400 people, half of them civilians, according to U.N. figures and displaced 2.5 million people.The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen after the Houthis advanced on Aden in 2015, forcing Hadi and his government to flee the country.The coalition and Hadi’s forces have made some gains, driving the Houthis out of a few cities but have so far failed to achieve a victory against the group."

These sites have been reclaimed as sacred places in recent decades as the open practice of Pagan faith has resurfaced in a substantial way.”Scroll down to see a selection from Jack Pidduck’s “Divination” photo series, with captions from the photographer: "

Wadianti is only 19 years old and her shy smile reveals a set of braces, like that of many teens. Her husband, 21 years old, is a university student in the nearby college town of Yogyakarta.“I was worried how to keep the baby healthy for the entire nine months,” says Wadianti, who goes by one name. “I was afraid she might get sick.” And, just like many teenagers, Wadianti says she missed her favorite foods: junk food and soda.When the baby arrived, her worries disappeared for a bit. “When I first saw my baby, I cried because I was so happy,” Wadianti says. “But, I cried again when breastfeeding because it was painful.”She had just graduated high school in Jakarta when she met her then-boyfriend Anggit Bayu Saputro. She was on vacation with her friends in the popular central Indonesian college town of Yogyakarta, where Saputro was studying. They exchanged phone numbers and soon began dating. Before she knew it, she was pregnant.Stories like Wadianti’s are common in the socially conservative villages around Yogyakarta. While dating among youth has become acceptable, premarital sex is not, especially among devout Muslim families. That’s made it hard for young, unmarried couples to access contraception.“We had planned to wait another four or five years to have a child,” Saputro says. “But, we miscalculated on the calendar, so Wadianti got pregnant.”While Indonesia has long advocated family planning, and the nation has seen its fertility rate drop significantly over three decades, unmarried youth are still not privy to information about family planning. Saputro is like many young men in his rural area who have had very little education on reproductive health, leading to many misconceptions about birth control.“I thought that if she took injections or pills, she would become infertile later,” he says. “I thought if I used condoms frequently, it could cause me infertility.”Saputro’s mother says one day she got a call from her son saying he wanted to get married. “At first, I thought it was a joke,” she says. “But then, he confided that his relationship had gone too far. A few days later, Wadianti called me and said she is pregnant.”Some teenage girls in this rural area don’t even tell their families about their pregnancies, for fear of the cultural stigma. Ana Trisuprapti became pregnant as a high school student at age 17, but kept it a secret from everyone until the day she delivered the baby.“I knew the truth, but I forced myself not to think about it,” Trisuprapti says. “In my mind, I just pretended that I wasn’t pregnant. Since I was scared to talk to anyone about it, I didn’t let my thoughts waver to my pregnancy. I just ignored it. And I didn’t know how pregnant mothers are supposed to act or be treated.”At that time, six years ago, she had nowhere to turn during her pregnancy. Soon after she gave birth, Trisuprapti had to care for her baby and dropped out of school.“I was sad to have to leave school in the second year of high school,” she said. “My father already had plans for me to graduate and to go on to higher education. That was so disappointing for my parents.”Advocates are hoping that soon girls in rural Indonesia won’t have to choose between a baby and an education, as they launch efforts to promote contraceptive use and family planning education among young people in the area. The U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) in Indonesia supports a network of rural clinics, named UNALA, that encourage young women and men to participate in discussion groups where they can talk frankly about sex.

She says unplanned pregnancies have led to a high rate of early marriage in the area. In many cases, couples get married to satisfy their parents and neighbors, who frown on unwed mothers. “Some young people in the village aren’t aware that sex can cause pregnancy,” she says. “Or, they know, but they’re ashamed to get contraception because of cultural taboos.”Through her efforts, more and more adolescents are learning how to avoid unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.

16,POLITICS,GOP Operatives Aren't So Sure That Trump Even Wants To Win,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-lose_us_57b2033de4b007c36e4f91f2,The Republican nominee's recent antics suggest that he's looking for an exit.,2016-08-15,"There is mass confusion within GOP circles about why Trump continues to employ Katrina Pierson, a spokeswoman with a penchant for telling falsehoods.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What used to be a playful question tossed around by Republican operatives about Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is now being taken far more seriously: Is it possible that he is trying to lose? The notion, on the surface, seems preposterous. What politician would put himself through the crucible of a presidential campaign with the hope of falling short? But as Trump has stumbled badly on the trail and in the polls, and as his reaction to both has proven increasingly erratic, the theory of self-sabotage has gained traction among Trump critics.“I think he has psychologically collapsed and is both consciously and unconsciously looking for an exit,” said Rick Wilson, a longtime GOP operative who rarely holds back in his disdain for Trump.“It’s either that [he’s trying to lose] or it’s complete and utter incompetence in every facet of his campaign,” said Brian Walsh, another veteran Republican hand and Trump critic. “When you look at how he’s conducting every aspect of the campaign it seems entirely fair to ask if he’s purposefully trying to lose because the only alternative answer is complete arrogance and incompetence. And I’m not ruling out complete arrogance and incompetence.”The sense that Trump desperately wants to avoid the responsibilities of being president hasn’t been plucked from thin air. Rather, it’s been fueled by a series of decisions made by both Trump and his campaign that have left even favorably disposed operatives baffled.Trump reportedly raised $80 million in July. But he brags about not having run television ads and a Democratic ad tracker said his frugality extends to the radio airwaves too. He’s campaigned in places where he stands little chance of winning and been slow to open offices in critical battlegrounds. He’s insisted he can “act presidential” but has refused to do so. He’s forsworn campaign-like tours in favor of big rallies followed by flights back to New York and nights in his own bed. And recently, on the trail, he told supporters he didn’t want them to donate to his campaign. His closest advisers are his children. But they have been traveling during these critical weeks. (His daughter, Ivanka, is currently vacationing with Vladimir Putin’s rumored girlfriend Wendi Deng ― a jaunt to Croatia that suggests a complete disregard for the optics of being too cozy with the Russian strongman.) And then there’s the state of the rest of his staff.“That’s the thing that bothers me. So let’s suppose he is a smart businessman, just for this argument’s sake. He has marketing and communications and advertising and finance people in his resort, golf courses, real estate ventures and other things. He moves almost none of them over, save a lawyer and a digital/policy guy, both of whom are unhinged?” said Rory Cooper, who was a top operative to former Majority Leader Eric Cantor.He noted that Katrina Pierson, a Trump spokeswoman, has what could most charitably be described as a difficult relationship with history and a strong penchant for hyperbole. “I just don’t believe he doesn’t appreciate the need for help. Yet he hires nobody, and when he does bring on anyone who knows their field, they’re gone in weeks,” Cooper said.Trump’s campaign didn’t return a request for comment. Sources close to him say the enormity of winning has indeed weighed on him ― as it would on anyone else. But they also note that his candidacy has been unconventional from the beginning, often by design. One oft-repeated story, several people have told The Huffington Post, is that upon entering the race, Trump told his campaign team that he didn’t expect to win the primary, anticipating instead that he would finished second or third and the publicity of a run would boost his business ventures.Associates say that isn’t true. They expected to trail the top tier of Republicans during the early stages of the primary and make a big push as voting neared, relying, if need be, on Trump’s personal resources. What caught them off guard was both how quickly he moved to the front of the pack and how reluctant his fellow Republicans were to go after him once he was there.When explaining the current state of the campaign, these associates point to that relatively bruise-free primary ― not some nascent desire to extricate himself from the path to the presidency ― as a contributing factor.“No one really went out and attacked Trump during the primary season, for the most part,” said a source close to the Trump campaign. “And if you look at this reaction when his poll numbers did slip, when Ben Carson showed strength in Iowa, Donald Trump did the belt buckle speech and Carson didn’t really push back. The difference now is it is much harder to take down Hillary Clinton with one speech.” While Trump may be unaccustomed to ― and rattled by ― sustained attacks from a political opponent, it remains unclear why he hasn’t adjusted his tactics amid evidence that those attacks are taking a toll. The aforementioned source argued that Trump has been let down by his aides. “Nobody is naive enough to think this campaign is going well,” the source said. “The fundamental problem is that the people now running this campaign don’t give a shit if he wins or loses.”But Trump’s Republican critics say blame lies with the candidate himself. One Wall Street-based GOP fundraiser referred to Trump as “an immature, juvenile, self-indulgent narcissist” who “wants to win but as an adolescent has no impulse control.”“It’s not self-sabotage,” the longtime fundraiser said, “it’s self-delusion.”Others, with less biting adjectives, echoed the idea that, far from trying to lose the election, Trump has proven psychologically incapable of winning it.“When it turned out that he in fact won, and had to have a different strategy for a general election, he was not ready for it and his entire candidacy is not really premised on it,” said Avik Roy, a top policy adviser to Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign and a senior adviser to Rick Perry’s 2016 campaign. “It was an intentional strategy on his part to exploit free media, and by being unpredictable and unscripted that they would cover him. He understood that. That was a strategy. And it worked in the primary but it won’t in a general, where people are saying, ‘Wait, this guy can be president.’”In recent weeks, as his polling numbers have dipped, Trump has begun hinting that he knows he will lose ― whether he wants to or not. Complaining that the election will be rigged implies that he anticipates a Hillary Clinton win. Lashing out at the media for its coverage, and attacking his Republican detractors, show he's clearly searching for a scapegoat. He’s even openly discussed what he will do as a private citizen after the election ― the type of hypothetical no typical candidate would ever discuss.It all portends an inglorious end to an improbable campaign, whose underlying purpose and goal will probably confound people long after it’s over.“Just when I’m convinced that all signs of control of Trump’s actions point to Moscow, I’m jerked back to reality that only Bill Clinton could really devise this madness from a GOP nominee,” said John Weaver, who spearheaded John Kasich's presidential campaign. “Seriously, even someone trying to throw the race wouldn’t go to these lengths, even out of self-respect.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

He was 93. Finkel died early Sunday morning in Manhattan, his son Ian told The Associated Press. The actor had reportedly been suffering with heart problems for months. “He did everything,” Ian Finkel told the AP. “That seems to be a trait of the old-time performers. They could all sing and dance and act and everything. It’s so wonderful.”Stars like Rosie O’Donnell and Jeri Ryan, who appeared with Finkel on “Boston Public,” took to Twitter to share their condolences. The actor, born Philip Finkel, got his start in 1930 when he sang in a small production in his Brooklyn neighborhood. Just before he turned 18, he accepted a job with Yiddish theater in Pittsburgh, saying, “I thought, ‘This is where I belong.’ And I’ve been in the theater ever since,” according to the AP. Eventually, he would become an icon of the Yiddish theater community on Second Avenue in Manhattan. Throughout high school, Finkel continued performing and established himself as a comedian. He began using the stage name Fyvush, a Yiddish translation of his first name. In 1947, the actor married playwright Gertrude Lieberman.Finkel continued working in Yiddish theater into his 40s and went on to join the touring cast of Jerome Robbins’ “Fiddler on the Roof.” He played various roles in the production before eventually getting the lead of Tevye the Dairyman when the musical appeared on Broadway. “I went to do ‘Fiddler’ for less money than I was getting in Yiddish theater, but I had to make the move. And it was the best move I ever made,” he said of his decision, according to the AP. Finkel would go on to appear in more plays, including “Little Shop of Horrors” and the “Cafe Crown” revival, for which he won an Obie Award. By the mid-’80s, Finkel had begun transitioning into the world of TV and film, with appearances on the NBC miniseries “Evergreen” and the 1986 PBS movie “Seize the Day.” Following his role as an attorney in the 1990 film “Q&A,” Finkel caught the attention of producer and screenwriter David E. Kelley, who tapped the actor to play Douglas Wambaugh on the 1992 drama series “Picket Fences.” Finkel’s work on the series, which ran for four seasons, earned him a supporting actor Emmy nomination in 1993. The following year, at the age of 71, he won the award.Throughout the ‘90s, Finkel starred in plenty of roles on TV and the big screen, such as “For Love or Money” (1993) and Oliver Stone’s “Nixon” (1995), the latter of which won him a Screen Actors Guild Award. He also lent his voice to animated series “Rugrats” and “The Simpsons” and played history teacher Harvey Lipschultz on “Boston Public.” In more recent years, Finkel appeared in the Oscar-nominated film “A Serious Man” (2009) and had a guest-starring role on NBC’s “Harry’s Law.”During his successful career on screen, Finkel maintained his career on the stage with roles in productions like “Finkel’s Follies” in the early ‘90s and “Fyvush Finkel — From Second Avenue to Broadway” in 1997. Finkel was married to Lieberman for 61 years until her death in 2008. The couple is survived by their two sons, Ian and Elliot, both of whom continue to work as musicians. The actor is also survived by five grandchildren.Finkel was no doubt a talented actor with an impressive career. His impact on the world of stage and screen will live on. "
