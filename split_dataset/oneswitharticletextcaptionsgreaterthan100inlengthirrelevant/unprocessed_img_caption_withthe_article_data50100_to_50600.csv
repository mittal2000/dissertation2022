Their remote region is ground zero for many of the world’s most vexing problems, including an Islamic militant insurgency, crippling poverty, and the devastation wrought by climate change.Now, the United Nations warns that the area may face a new calamity: famine.People in the region “are used to coping with extreme hardship, exploiting every and any option they can to keep their families going,” U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Stephen O’Brien told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday. “But … this suffering has pushed them to the absolute limit ― it is unlike anything they have felt before.” He called it “a humanitarian catastrophe.”The hunger crisis has been growing since militant group Boko Haram captured swaths of northeast Nigeria in 2014, crippling agriculture and the local economy and displacing more than 2 million people. The insurgency by Boko Haram extremists, who in recent years have killed more people in terror attacks than the Islamic State, has left more than 20,000 people dead.The fighting has further isolated the region from the rest of the world. That means the humanitarian crisis brewed mostly out of sight until Nigeria and its allies began pushing Boko Haram out of camps, villages and towns over the last year.Aid groups are just beginning to reach areas that were recaptured, and representatives said they’ve been horrified by what they’re finding. In mid-June, more than 1,000 people were evacuated from the Nigerian town of Bama so they could receive medical treatment. Aid group Doctors Without Borders said 39 percent of the town’s children were severely malnourished.“When we saw that, we realized the severity, and it was a shock,” said Isabelle Defourny, Doctors Without Borders director of operations. A week later, the aid group’s staff reached the town for the first time with a military escort and found more than 1,200 graves, including 480 for children, had been dug in the past year. Humanitarian officials with decades of disaster experience said the situation was among the worst they’d ever seen. “What we have uncovered and assessed is deeply, distressingly alarming, even for those of us who have witnessed such depths of humanitarian need before,” O’Brien told the U.N. Security Council. “I have been traveling throughout this region on and off for the past 37 years [and] I have never heard such fear and desperation. This is a new terrible.”Bruno Jochum, Doctors Without Borders general director, called it “a large-scale humanitarian disaster” and urged the U.N. to set up an emergency food pipeline. “Probably the medical and epidemiological indicators are the worst we are facing today in the world,” he said.“This is about as bad as it gets,” Toby Lanzer, U.N. assistant secretary general in the Sahel, told The Guardian this month. “There’s only one step worse ― and I’ve not come across that situation in 20 years of doing this work ― and that’s a famine.”The numbers are daunting. The U.N.’s Children Fund estimates that nearly a quarter-million children in the region are severely malnourished, and some 50,000 will die without immediate treatment. That warning, stark as it may seem, may not capture the full extent of the crisis. Only half of the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 people in displacement camps in northeastern Nigeria’s Borno state are reachable by aid agencies, Defourny said. Most of them are living in isolated towns destroyed by fighting, taking shelter in the remaining structures while under military guard. In the town of Bama, for example, 15,000 people, mostly women and children, are living in a hospital compound with no latrines, poor access to water, and little food, Defourny said.Outside the camps, aid groups have no clear picture of how many people are still trapped in their villages, or how bad their situation is. Thousands continue arriving in urban areas, many in poor health recounting stories of ongoing fighting and starvation back home.How did the situation get so bad? First, the Boko Haram insurgency destroyed the local economy. Farmers couldn’t farm, markets shut down, and millions fled to escape the fighting.Second, neither Nigerian authorities nor international aid agencies have yet mobilized a humanitarian response robust enough to meet the need. This is partly due to ongoing fighting. The U.N. on Thursday temporarily suspended aid operations in Borno state, with the exception of Maiduguri, after Boko Haram militants attacked a humanitarian convoy, injuring a UNICEF employee and a contractor.But some aid workers criticize humanitarian organizations, including U.N. agencies, for being too slow to recognize the extent of the crisis and to respond. Additionally, the Nigerian government didn’t make clear its need for aid, claiming that Boko Haram had been defeated and the displaced population could return home.Some ex-government officials say Nigerian authorities deliberately covered up the extent of the crisis to avoid international embarrassment.“We were not aware of the gravity of the situation. We were not fast enough,” Defourny said. “People in this region have already lost a lot of life due to political violence, and today they are dying because of something else, malnutrition, that is avoidable.”Nigerian officials in recent weeks have sounded the alarm with more urgency. Last month, Nigeria’s minister of health declared a nutrition emergency in Borno state, and the local government has appealed for international assistance.Aid groups have urged the government to lift bureaucratic barriers in order to facilitate the entry of aid, as reports begin to circulate that corruption ― soldiers demanding protection money, or government workers pilfering aid supplies ― is slowing the response. “Taking from these people is like stealing from a corpse,” said one police officer in a Nigerian displacement camp, according to Foreign Affairs.With limited aid, people in northeast Nigeria are doing all they can to help their community survive. About 90 percent of displaced people in the region are staying with extended families or community members, and schools and empty buildings in Maiduguri have been repurposed to house displaced families. Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., on Wednesday recalled a university security guard she met in northeast Nigeria, who had taken in more than 50 relatives displaced by the violence. “He is a national hero and there are tens of thousands of such heroes across the region,” Power told the U.N. Security Council. “I think we of greater means should all be inspired by these heroes to do much, much more.”"

We cleared all 23 floors of the building,” he added. A spokesman for Rio’s fire department declined to comment.Kitty Chiller, the head of the Australian delegation, had complained on Sunday about exposed wiring and blocked toilets, saying accommodation at the Village was “not safe or ready” for the Games, which open on Aug. 5.Chiller had initially refused to let her team stay in the Village, but moved athletes in this week after organizers deployed a task force of 600 workers to tackle repairs.(Reporting by Paulo Prada and Daniel Flynn; Editing by Mary Milliken)"

An air operation was launched, killing 23 of them, the officials said.Four more were then killed in a ground operation, they said. The remaining eight were killed in clashes in Hakkari’s Cukurca district.Friday’s clashes in Cukurca also left 25 soldiers wounded, the officials said.Turkey’s military - NATO’s second-largest - is grappling with the insurgency in the mainly Kurdish southeast as its senior ranks undergo a major shake-up in following a July 15-16 coup attempt.On Thursday, Turkey announced an overhaul of the armed forces, with 99 colonels promoted to the rank of general or admiral and nearly 1,700 military personnel given dishonourable discharges over their alleged roles in the coup.About 40 percent of all generals and admirals in the military have been dismissed since the coup.In the southeast, the military has frequently carried out air strikes after a 2 1/2-year ceasefire and peace process between the government and the PKK broke down last summer.Thousands of militants and hundreds of civilians and soldiers have been killed since then. Some cities in the predominantly Kurdish southeast have been engulfed in the worst violence since the 1990s.More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict since the PKK - designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union - began its insurgency in 1984.(Reporting by Seyhmus Cakan and Humeyra Pamuk; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Larry King)"

The state's agriculture lobby is fighting a lawsuit that could set a new national precedent for farming-related water pollution.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587c4e33170000850192a3fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Earlier this month, the Iowa Soybean Association had a big announcement to make.The group, which represents some 11,000 growers of the state’s second-most-lucrative crop, pledged $150,000 in support for three highly agricultural counties — Buena Vista, Calhoun and Sac — named in a controversial lawsuit brought by the Des Moines Water Works. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2015, claims that nitrogen-rich water flowing off the area’s farms pollutes the Raccoon River, which, along with the Des Moines River, provides drinking water for half a million people. The water authority wants the counties to pick up the dramatically higher treatment costs for the water. The counties, who want the case dismissed, counter that there’s no proof that agriculture is directly responsible for the nitrates.The case has thus far been upheld, though it won’t be brought to trial until next June. Meanwhile, both sides are digging in for a pivotal Iowa Supreme Court hearing on the matter set for September. If the water utility wins the suit, it would mark the first time in the U.S. that agribusiness is forced to pay for water pollution, potentially setting a precedent with nationwide ramifications.The ISA, which previously contributed $65,000 for the counties’ legal expenses, considers the case a “must win.” Meanwhile, it says, the lawsuit is an “unfortunate distraction” from the voluntary approaches to solving the state’s nutrient runoff issues that it has been touting. ISA CEO Kirk Leeds said the suit is affecting the progress the state has made over the past 15 years in encouraging farmers to implement practices to mitigate runoff, like putting cover crops and conservation tillage in their fields.“The lawsuit does not identify one tangible tactic or strategy that would actually improve water quality,” Leeds told The Huffington Post in a statement. “Without the lawsuit, labor and financial resources could be focused on deploying more practices across the state to improve soil and water resources.”The ISA pointed to the over 970,000 acres Iowa farmers have enrolled in the federal conservation reserve program — more than any other state — as further signs the state’s industry is on the right track toward addressing the problem. (The program removes environmentally sensitive lands from agricultural production, which helps improve water quality and wildlife habitat.)But the ISA’s efforts are “nothing more than greenwash” to Des Moines Water Works CEO Bill Stowe. “They’re sprinkling money and acting like they have some kind of environmental awareness when, in fact, they’re undermining public health and environmental protections,” Stowe told HuffPost. The ISA isn’t the only group supporting the defending counties in the lawsuit, but it’s hard to know who’s been paying the rest of the bill. As the Des Moines Register has reported, the donors picking up 90 percent of the counties’ $1.1 million legal tab are anonymous and likely to remain that way, thanks to a state law regulating private foundation contributions to government groups.Stowe’s utility has been spending a lot of money, too — seven figures’ worth of extra treatment costs to ensure the drinking water he delivers to their customers is safe, he said.The DMWW is home to what he calls the “world’s largest” nitrate removal facility. The plant is in need of repairs and expansion, he said, thanks to the historically high amount of nitrates they’ve had to remove from the drinking water they provide to their customers.Excessive nitrate exposure is most dangerous for infants and pregnant women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infants who are exposed can develop what’s called blue baby syndrome, which can be fatal if left untreated. For these reasons, the EPA sets a maximum contaminant level for nitrates of 10 milligrams per liter. Anything higher needs to be removed by water providers. In 2013, when nitrate levels in the source water reached a record high, the utility’s tab for additional treatment costs and lost revenue totaled $900,000, DMWW said. Last year, it spent $1.5 million on denitrification efforts.Stowe argues that tile drainage systems used by the upstream farms to reduce crop flooding should be identified as “point sources” of pollution under the federal Clean Water Act, from which they traditionally have been exempt.The Iowa lawsuit could drastically change how the Clean Water Act can be used to remedy nutrient pollution, which is having a severe impact on communities throughout the U.S. For this reason, the suit carries national significance. John Rumpler, senior attorney at Environment America, a Boston-based nonprofit, called it a “huge, precedent-setting” matter.Rumpler authored a report last month linking nutrient runoff from agribusiness to the growth of algal blooms and dead zones that have devastated ecosystems and damaged local economies in places like Lake Erie, the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. The EPA has also linked nutrient runoff to acid rain and air pollution.He sees what is happening in Iowa as one example of runoff issues bubbling up nationwide, like South Florida’s “guacamole-thick” algal blooms that prompted Gov. Rick Scott (R) to declare a state of emergency earlier this summer. Environmentalists have largely blamed agriculture, and particularly the powerful sugar industry, for the pollution.“The overriding story here is that the corporations that are producing our food in an industrializing fashion are now threatening our water,” Rumpler said. “America should not have to choose between healthy food and safe water.”Some Iowa farmers have already changed their ways ― before the lawsuit was even filed.One of them is 62-year-old Tim Smith. Smith has been farming his whole life and currently grows 800 acres of corn and soybeans in Eagle Grove, Iowa, not far from the three counties named in the suit. Five years ago, Smith signed up through a USDA program to start planting cover crops on some of his fields, as well as installing a woodchip bioreactor with the aim of reducing the nitrogen runoff from his farm.It wasn’t long before he observed, through sampling, that the amount of nitrates flowing off his farm had been cut in half. Seeing the results made him acknowledge he’d had a runoff problem he wasn’t aware of.“I thought I was doing everything right on my farm prior to this,” Smith told HuffPost.Still, Iowa’s estimated 470,000 acres of cover crops planted as of 2015 pale in comparison to the 26 million acres of statewide cropland. Though the Iowa Farm Bureau notes, accurately, that this is a 35 percent increase over the previous year, that number still represents less than 2 percent of the state’s overall cropland. This is evidence, Smith believes, that many farmers in the state don’t realize they are contributing to the problem. He anticipates that, with time, more of his colleagues will come around to the idea of conservation and see that the practices accomplish what they are designed to do.But the lawsuit, he says, could hinder that progress.“It’s kind of a slap in the face to agriculture. It does throw a little insult,” Smith said. “If they lose or the case is thrown out, farmers are going to say, well, you’ve already sued me, so what’s the big deal? I’m going to keep doing things the way I used to do them. There’s a danger in that.”For his part, Stowe is confident the utility will win, but he’s not limiting that to mean a win in the courtroom. He believes the suit, regardless of its outcome, challenges the state’s political status quo, which he says has favored agricultural interests for too long.“If we were to lose and continue to pass on this cost to our consumers, there will be a political impact,” Stowe said. “Our customer base will more clearly understand why they are paying more, so we think we win anyway. We will be the long-term winners no matter what happens in our legal case.”"

He made the bizarre remarks in response to an advertisement Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign that attacked him for mocking a reporter with a disability. Trump has been widely criticized for contorting his arms at a November campaign event, in an apparent attempt to mock New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a chronic joint disease that limits his arm movements. “They do the commercial, like I’m mocking a person with disability. I’m not, I’m not,” the businessman told supporters.“I spend millions a year, or millions of dollars on ramps, and get rid of the stairs and different kinds of elevators all over and I’m gonna mock? I would never do that,” he continued.“Number one, I have a good heart. Number two, I’m a smart person.”Trump made the same argument on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” on Thursday morning. And he also cited his buildings as evidence of his fairness to people with disabilities in an interview with The Washington Post in May.His remarks imply that building ramps for handicapped people are a reflection of his personal generosity and compassion for people with disabilities. In fact, the Americans with Disabilities Act, a federal law passed in 1990, requires Trump to provide accommodations in his buildings for people with disabilities.A Trump campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the former reality TV personality meant to imply that he has gone beyond what he’s legally required to do. And as Think Progress notes, Trump was not even being completely truthful about his compliance with that law. People with disabilities have successfully sued a Trump property company and production firm in recent years for unfair treatment that violated the ADA.The controversial incident that is the subject of the Clinton campaign ad occurred when Trump ripped Kovaleski for disavowing the businessman’s interpretation of an article the journalist wrote for The Washington Post a few days after September 11, 2001 attacks. It stated that law enforcement were investigating people “allegedly seen celebrating the attacks.” But Trump had used the article in an effort to substantiate his claims that “thousands and thousands” of Arab Americans in New Jersey had cheered the terrorist event.Trump said at the time that he had no intention of mocking Kovaleski’s disability, claiming he did not even remember who the reporter was. The real estate mogul repeated that excuse on Friday night as well. Kovaleski has said that he and Trump were actually on a first-name basis in the 1980s when the reporter was regularly covering the businessman for the New York Daily News. A colleague of Kovaleski’s at the time has confirmed this account. Trump’s remarks doubling down on these implausible defenses of his behavior are all the more remarkable because of their timing ― in a week that disability rights took center stage at the Democratic National Convention.Disability rights advocates hailed Clinton’s acceptance speech on Thursday night for putting virtually unprecedented emphasis on the struggles and rights of people with disabilities.In her speech, Clinton recalled her work for the Children’s Defense Fund securing access to education for people with disabilities.“We gathered facts. We built a coalition,” Clinton said. “And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities.”Anastasia Somoza, a disability rights advocate, spoke at the convention on Monday night, praising Clinton’s record and savaging Trump for his mockery of Kovaleski.“Donald Trump has shown us who he really is, and I honestly feel bad for anyone with that much hate in their heart,” she said. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S. "

(Khan's son Humayun S. M. Khan, a U.S. Army soldier, was killed in Iraq.

Humayun Khan, stood out. The younger Khan, an American Muslim, gave his life in Iraq to save the lives of his fellow soldiers. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.The speech simultaneously conveyed a father's love for his lost child and pride in his country, punctuated by a direct repudiation of Donald Trump. ""Have you ever been to Arlington Cemetery?"" Khan pointedly asked the Republican nominee, referencing the site of his son's burial. ""You will see all faiths, genders, and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing. And no one.""Khan's speech has since gone viral, with #KhizrKhan trending on Twitter. His powerful appeal shows how to win over fair-minded Americans bombarded by anti-Muslim fear-mongering. In the space of six minutes, Khan--a U.S. citizen who resides in Charlottesville, VA--offered a rhetorical roadmap for combating Islamophobia in the United States.First, Khan's story overcame what psychology refers to as ""cognitive dissonance,"" in which individuals simultaneously hold incompatible ideas or conflicting emotions. When thinking about Muslims, research shows that some non-Muslim Americans experience cognitive dissonance because they value the ideas of religious freedom and tolerance, but also fear terrorism and harbor a suspicion that American Muslims aren't necessarily loyal to the U.S. Khan's poignant remembrance of his son's military service obliterated the notion of disloyalty. Neutralizing doubts about the patriotism and loyalty of American Muslims creates the space for an appeal to tolerance: Anyone who puts their life on the line for our country deserves to be treated fairly. The message research and development team at Hattaway Communications created the ad below featuring American Muslims who gave the ultimate sacrifice for their country. As one person who saw the ad in a focus group put it, ""This throws the prejudice out the window."" Beyond the power of his son's story, Mr. Khan and other convention speakers also used powerful language by referring to his family as ""American Muslims"" rather than ""Muslim-Americans."" While the order of the words may seem meaningless, our work has shown that these two constructs evoke surprisingly different reactions. Focus group participants discussing this topic associated the term ""Muslim-American"" with words such as ""foreign"" and ""strict,"" and raised concerns about a perceived mistreatment of women. With the order of the words switched, however, the same people responded with phrases such as ""came to America for a better life"" and ""contribute to society.""These reactions illustrate the importance of the first word in a message, which colors the reactions to every word that follows it. This experiment also showed the power of the word ""American"" to help counter negative portrayals and perceptions of Muslims who are part of the fabric of our diverse society.Mr. Khan's speech showcased a powerful way to tell the story of Muslims in America, with examples of their contributions to and sacrifices for our country--and language that reminds people we're all on the same team. It's a powerful lesson for anyone interested in countering anti-Muslim fear-mongering--or battling prejudice against Americans of any race and background."

REUTERS/Scott Audette (L), Javier Galeano (R)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb822e92200005700dd404a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After back-to-back Republican and Democratic conventions, the stage is set for a 100-day mad dash to the November presidential contest. There were telling differences between the two events.To begin with, the conventions revealed the state of play within each party. Both Republicans and Democrats confronted insurgencies with dramatically different outcomes. On the Republican side, one of the insurgent candidates, Donald Trump, vanquished the establishment leaving the party in some disarray. Many national GOP leaders boycotted the convention and refused to endorse Trump. Those who endorsed the victor did so either because they felt they had no choice or because they retained a vague hope that should he win, their congressional leaders would be able to limit the damage that might occur in an unrestrained Trump presidency. Adding to the fractiousness of the GOP's situation, significant components of another insurgent group, prominent leaders of the religious right, also refused to endorse the nominee creating negative press with a walkout on the first day followed by a prime time rejection by Ted Cruz on day three.The Democrats fared somewhat better since their establishment candidate, Hillary Clinton, won. Because Clinton embraced a good number of her opponent's progressive proposals, Bernie Sanders' felt comfortable enough to give her a full-throated endorsement on the convention's opening night. This display of unity appeared to be enough to mollify many of Sanders' supporters, though a number of movement activists who had embraced the Sanders' cause left the convention unsatisfied. Nevertheless, the Democrats concluded their four-day meeting with the appearance of greater unity than had been found at the GOP gathering.There was another key difference between the two parties' quadrennial events. Modern conventions have been largely stripped of their political functions, reducing them to over-produced infomercials. While Trump had promised a ""blockbuster"", the Republican convention was a lack-luster affair bringing together a strange collection of minor ""celebrities"" and drew headlines for a series of unforced errors.On the first day, there was a contentious rules fight leading to a mass walk-out. This opening sour note was later eclipsed by revelations that the initially well-reviewed speech by Trump's wife had been, in part, plagiarized from a speech given by Michelle Obama, 8 years earlier. On the next night, Trump inexplicably decided to call into one of the networks to complain about an unrelated issue in the midst of an emotional speech by the mother of a victim of the embassy attack in Benghazi. Then, of course, there was the pay back speech by Ted Cruz. With most GOP luminaries not in attendance, the key Trump endorsement speeches were given by his children.In contrast, the Democrats' event was well produced and, despite moments of tension and controversy, was a nearly flawless affair. Clinton was able to receive validation and support from President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice-President Biden, her main opponent Senator Sanders, leading progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren, and most of the Democratic party's Senators and Members of Congress. In addition, there was a host of major celebrities who performed at or addressed the event.The Democrats were also able to dodge a few potentially disruptive bullets caused by concerns among Sanders' supporters that the establishment had unfairly tipped the scales of the election in favor of Clinton. The Clinton team did this by agreeing with Sanders to form a commission to write new rules for party operations and for the next election and by forcing the party's controversial chair to resign in advance of the convention.The Sanders and Clinton campaigns did compromise on the party platform with Clinton accepting more progressive positions that had been put forward by Sanders. Nevertheless some movement activists who had embraced the Sanders' campaign remained unsettled by concerns like: the absence of strong and clear opposition to unfair trade agreements; a commitment to no more war and universal health care for all; and a firmer position in defense of Palestinian rights. This resulted in a few demonstrations inside the convention and larger protests outside the hall. But while these efforts served as reminders of work that remains to be done, none ultimately disrupted the thematic orchestration of the Clinton convention.A final major differences between the two conventions were in the themes they conveyed. Trumps' insurgency has been predicated on the personality of Trump, hatred of all things Clinton, and the frustration, fear, and anger of those who have felt they are losing ground in today's economy and changing world. They resent the ""other""--Mexicans, Muslims, and groups whom they feel benefit from affirmative action programs. They fear crime, terrorism, loss of American power and prestige, and changes in the world and society that have feeling left out and adrift. Sensing this, Trump and his convention preyed on this anger and fear--focusing it on the person of Hillary Clinton. The convention was an angry affair with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani ranting about crime and Clinton, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie leading a shocking anti-Clinton floor chant of ""lock her up"". For his part, Trump's acceptance speech was well-crafted and well-delivered. But it was an anger-filled dark litany of the nation's ills. It was a far-reaching indictment of all that is wrong with America with his solution being to elect him with the vague assurance that he alone knows how to get it right.Clinton, on the other hand, developed a more positive message. She acknowledged that problems exist, to be sure, but she proposed specific fixes that involved bipartisan compromise, and communities working together with government to create and expand opportunities and improve the quality of life for all. It was an upbeat message conveyed not only by Clinton but by a stream of speakers--citizens from every walk of life who told of their struggles and how action had been to taken to address their needs. As political and policy events, the Democrats' convention had the clear advantage. Both parties spent considerable time in attacking the others' nominee. But Democrats were better at telling their story, presenting their candidate and their programs, and creating optimism that they had made progress in the last 8 years and would continue to make positive change in the years to come.If anything, the two conventions established was that just as the primary season has been raucous and contentious, the general election promises more of the same. It will be an election like no other. Follow @AAIUSA for more. "

The buried implication is that you have no other choice, that it's a binary decision. Which comes as news to cord-cutters and bundlers, OTA antenna buyers and people who find other ways to watch TV and video. The choice isn't as binary as it's made to seem.I bring all this up in the context of the current presidential campaign, in which it's equally in the interests of the two major parties to convince us that the choice in November is starkly, irremediably binary. Otherwise, it's suggested, our vote is wasted or, worse yet, electing the ""wrong,"" ""other"" candidate. The name of Ralph Nader is hissed threateningly.Another comparison comes to mind: TINA, the acronym for what the EU has told the ""periphery"" countries about their forced regimen of austerity. ""There Is No Alternative."" The Brits, however, just figured one out.That's a bit stark, but the aim of the binary choicers and the TINAists is the same: to foreclose further thought. So, in defiance of that planned foreclosure, I offer, without advocacy, a thought experiment.Newly-elected presidents like to bask in the afterglow of their ""mandate."" A larger majority gives them a rhetorical club with which to, at least during the first 18 months, batter opponents into cowed silence. Republicans always tormented Bill Clinton for having won ""only"" by a plurality in both 1992 and 1996, thanks to the meddling third-party candidacy of Ross Perot. Did it have an effect on Clinton's governing? We'll wait for his memoir to find out.But squeakers are nothing to brag about. Yeah, you won, but if it hadn't rained in the Carolinas...So, given a binary choice between two of the most disliked (per the polls) major-party candidates this side of Zimbabwe, what is one to do? Voting against one just gives a bigger mandate to the other. Not voting just depresses the overall turnout. Voting for a third, or fourth party candidate, especially in a battleground state, could help depress the ultimate winner's majority to a plurality. Especially if voters displeased with the parties' offerings, also voted angrily enough, not returning incumbents, e.g., to produce a tightly divided Congress.When the lesser of two evils can still, by the logic of the sentence itself, be regarded as kinda evil (both have proudly named, as one of their foreign-policy advisers, a certain Dr. Kissinger), a squeaker might be the best outcome available. It would encourage all the anti-Executive power gears built into our system to work at full strength, dampening the ability of the eventual winner to do his or her worst.We've heard political journalists and politicians and interest-group leaders bemoan for years the tendency toward paralysis in the federal government. This could be the year that looks like the best alternative--to borrow a Bill Clintonism, a third way in a supposedly binary universe.There could even be a slogan: ""I'm With Gridlock."""

My address today is entitled ""Our America"" and my name is Brian Levin. For almost two decades I have directed the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University in San Bernardino, a community that has endured the evil scourge of violent hatred by extremists who distorted your faith and claimed to be Muslim. But, as his holiness Mirza Masroor Ahmad explained, ""If a person does not follow a particular teaching properly whilst claiming to subscribe to it, then it is he who is in error, not the teaching."" Indeed, for over a century your community has been a shining star in our twinkling constellation of American faiths, from veterans on foreign battlefields, to scientists and medical doctors, and of course your incredibly outsized contributions to the uniquely American art form of jazz music. The Ideal of Religious Liberty Most importantly, though it is our common embrace of two core American values that brings me here today: the divinity of human life and the centrality of individual liberty, particularly in the area of religious freedom--not only for our individual lives, but our collective ones as well. To appreciate the centrality of religious liberty in Our America, one need look no further than the words of our foundational texts and those of our founding fathers. Pluralism and religious freedom transcend contemporary politics, and are critical to the moral framework that dates back to our genesis and makes America truly exceptional. Our American Constitution's Article 6 bans religious tests for any office or public trust; the first amendment prohibits the establishment of religion, as well as laws impeding the free exercise of it; and the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection of the laws. Of the myriad accomplishments of his life, Thomas Jefferson, America's second president, who interestingly died on July 4, picked only three for the epitaph on his tombstone:Author of the Declaration of American Independence And of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom & Father of the University of VirginiaLike our current President, Jefferson's detractors, exploited the prejudices of the time by falsely accusing him of being a secret Muslim. The words of America's first president, George Washington, over two and one quarter centuries ago to the Touro Synagogue in Newport Rhode, Island still ring true today for all of us in our America: [F]or, happily, the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support....May the children of the stock of Abraham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants--while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall be none to make him afraid.His Holiness, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, embraces this very ideal ""All people should have fundamental freedoms, such as religious, political, national and civil freedom.""Muslim American Heroes Yet, the extraordinary mosaic of Muslim Americans, of which you are a proud part, has produced numerous unique American heroes. One, sports legend Muhammad Ali, who we lost just this June, counseled in the months before his passing:I am a Muslim and there is nothing Islamic about killing innocent people in Paris, San Bernardino, or anywhere else in the world. True Muslims know that the ruthless violence of so called Islamic Jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion...But perhaps Ali's greatest strength lay not in his punch, but in his faith, which inspired pacifism and tolerance: ""When you believe in God, you should believe that all people are part of one family. If you love God, you can't love only some of his children."" Just two nights ago in Philadelphia, we heard about another Muslim-American hero, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan. His grief stricken father, Khizr Khan while holding a copy of the Constitution, told America how Humayun lost his life in Iraq while valiantly protecting other American soldiers under his command. Mr. Khan's eloquence moved the nation, when he noted that had bans on Muslims actually been enacted, his son would never have been able to serve our country.[Video added for column only]Our Embrace of Pluralism Is A Bulwark Against Extremism These messages stand in stark contrast to the deafening cacophony of gunfire that struck my beloved community and later Orlando. While these killers severed the lives of family members from loved ones, in Our America we will simply not allow radical killers the additional harm of defeating American pluralism, by severing communities of good will from one another. This counterfeit violent hatred, which represents the most prominent terror threat since 9/11, for all its notoriety is nothing more than an apocalyptic death cult in religious giftwrap, that has both Muslims around the world, as well as Europeans and Americans in its crosshairs. At a mosque in Baltimore this spring President Obama observed: America rejects bigotry. We reject every act of hatred against people of Arab background or Muslim faith America values and welcomes peaceful people of all faiths -- Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu and many others. Every faith is practiced and protected here, because we are one country. Every immigrant can be fully and equally American because we're one country. Oh, excuse me for a second, that was President George W. Bush, speaking in my home state of California in 2002. President Obama actually said this:[Y]ou've seen too often people conflating the horrific acts of terrorism with the beliefs of an entire faith. And of course, recently, we've heard inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim Americans that has no place in our country.....We're one American family. And when any part of our family starts to feel separate or second-class or targeted, it tears at the very fabric of our nation.Over the past year, candidates have boldly argued for, and sometimes backtracked on, temporarily banning entry to all Muslims, irrespective of who they are; shuttering mosques, registering Muslims in databases, killing relatives of terrorists, denying entry to America even to a five year old orphan refugee child, torture beyond waterboarding, as well establishing a religious test for refugee admission and the presidency. One candidate likened Muslim refugees to rabid dogs, while another proclaimed ""I think Islam hates us.""Our Center's study found that in the non-calendar month following the November 13 Paris terrorist attack, hate crimes against Muslim Americans tripled from the monthly average of the previous five years. Two criminals struck mosques in our area, an Ahmadiyya Muslim mosque in Hawthorne was vandalized, while a mosque in the Coachella Valley was set ablaze.  Liberty, In Our America, Shines on All  When contemporary terrorists attack, they make no distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims. But more importantly when God's light shines down from the stars over our American heroes in national cemeteries from Arlington, Virginia to Riverside, California, he makes no distinctions, between Muslim and non-Muslim either, and neither should we. In Our America, our religious liberty fulfills the dreams of our ancestors, but only if we work together to sustain it. My departed refugee Russian grandmother and World War II era POW father, after facing the violent scourge of anti-Semitism in Europe, were cradled by a welcoming nation that they in turn loved so very much. Now we all must work to extend the promise of Emma Lazarus' prose inscribed on the Statue of Liberty to embrace yet a new generation of Americans, who come here for the promise of religious freedom. Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door!My fellow Americans, and friends watching this around the world, it is such a heartfelt privilege to share the blessings of Our America with you on this special day. Salam Aleikum and God bless the United States of America."

As many observed, the Democrats were smart to occupy the upbeat, patriotic, American-exceptionalist, morning-in-America space that Trump's GOP abandoned with its fear-mongering dark picture of the state of the nation. Those chants of ""U.S.A! U.S.A.!"" may help some Republicans and Independents, unhappy with Trump, feel comfortable turning to the Democratic Party for at least a temporary home. That's good politics, and whatever is good politics for the Democrats this year is good for America.And I am not criticizing expressions of love of country. Such love is probably a healthy thing for anyone in any country. But in particular, I am glad to say that I love America. The older I get, the more frequently I feel gratitude that my grandparents came to these shores. In part it is because I know that had they not, my ancestral line might have been cut short -- years before my birth -- in that ditch at Babi Yar, or some such place. And I've also come to appreciate my good fortune to have had the opportunities and comforts that being born in this country in these times has given me.But feeling such love and gratitude for one's country is one thing. Insisting on declaring our being superior to everyone else is quote another. While it may be good politics for speaker after speaker at the DNC to declare that we're ""the greatest nation on earth!"" the nation would be greater if the American people had less need for this kind of collective narcissism.It has been said (by a Swiss social thinker, Denis de Rougemont more than half a century ago) that patriotism isegotism, but so broadened as to become a virtue... It is accepted that every form of pride, every form of vanity, and even the most stupid boastings are legitimate and honorable so long as they are attributed to the nation in which one has taken the trouble to get born. What nobody would dare to say of his me, he has the sacred duty of saying for his us.The Republicans, of course, have just nominated someone who does dare to make such stupid boastings of his ""me."" And many of us find it a turn-off. Do you suppose that our friends in other nations find it appealing how often we Americans shout about how our nation is greater than all the others?People of psychological acumen understand that Donald Trump's endless boasts are anything but a sign of a truly secure and healthy sense of self-worth. Can it be all that good a sign about the collective state of the American psyche that we are so eager to tell the world that ""We're # 1""?Even if we are.But are we indeed the greatest nation on earth? The matter is not so easily judged: there are so many dimensions to evaluate that scoring the matter would be more complex than calculating points for the decathalon.We are indeed the greatest military power on earth-- as well we should be, spending as we do more than the next many countries combined.Our role in the world as a hegemonic power may be more benign -- or perhaps one should say less malignant -- than any of the previous dominant powers.It remains true that this nation has the world's dominant economy-- though by some calculations the Chinese economy is now bigger in aggregate, and on a per capital basis there are some other nations richer than we.Historically, the U.S. has indeed served as a beacon to the world, representing the values of liberty, and providing opportunities to those willing to work hard.But we're also number 1 of all the nations on earth in how many of our people are in prison; number 1 among the 20 major advanced nations in the rate of infant mortality; in income inequality; in the proportion of our people, especially our children, who live in poverty; in how much we spend per person on health care, while also having the most people who go without health care because of cost.But even if our claims to be the greatest are valid, we would be greater still if we as a people did not have so powerful an appetite for the narcissistic gratification of asserting our greatness.Our religious traditions teach us that a degree of humility is necessary for being able to receive some of the blessings of the spirit. Is there any reason to believe that to be less true for the collectivity of a nation than it is for us as individuals?Narcissistic needs do not come out of a healthy place. And they do not foster healthy outcomes.The Republican Party of recent years has combined two elements that might at first seem in contradiction to one another. On the one hand, the Republicans have been the ones to make a big issue out of ""American exceptionalism,"" which in their hands becomes a boast about our superiority to all others. On the other hand, they have acted -- first under the Bush presidency and then in their obstructionist role as the disloyal opposition -- as a wrecking crew upon the nation, degrading just about everything about America that has made it great.Which all points to why I wish that ""We're the greatest!"" weren't such good politics: if we collectively were less attached to our being superior, we would be more capable -- psychologically and spiritually -- of making America still better."

The economy was previously reported to have grown at a 1.1 percent pace in the first quarter.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP growth rising at a 2.6 percent rate in the last quarter.While the drop in inventories weighed on GDP growth last quarter, that is likely to provide a boost to output for the rest of the year. The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that near-term risks to the economic outlook had “diminished.”The government also published revisions to data going back to 2013 through the first quarter of 2016. The revisions partially addressed measurement issues, which have tended to lower first-quarter GDP estimates. GDP growth in the first quarter of 2015 was revised sharply higher to a 2.0 percent rate from the previously reported 0.6 percent pace.Consumer spending was responsible for almost all of the rebound in GDP growth in the second quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 4.2 percent rate. That was the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014.That rate of growth is probably unsustainable, but economists say a tightening labor market, rising house prices and higher savings should underpin spending for the rest of 2016. Inventory accumulation by businesses fell $8.1 billion in the second quarter, the first drop since the third quarter of 2011, down from a $40.7 billion increase in the first quarter.As a result, inventory investment subtracted 1.16 percentage points from GDP growth in the last quarter. It was the fourth straight quarter that inventories weighed on output.But the smaller inventory build is a good signal for growth in the coming quarters.Despite the lingering effects of the dollar’s rally and weak global demand, exports rose in the second quarter, helping to narrow the trade deficit. Trade added 0.23 percentage point to GDP growth."

And either way, the virus -- which causes birth defects -- has made its way to U.S. soil.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579bb86d2a00002c00fb3aa4.jpeg?cache=kgkYJB7jp2&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democrats in Congress called on leaders Friday to interrupt a seven-week vacation and return to Capitol Hill after the first local outbreak of the Zika virus was reported in Florida.Congress failed to pass emergency legislation to fund the nation’s response to Zika before legislators departed earlier this month, first to attend the party conventions and then to take time off.But with news that at least four people had contracted Zika locally in Southern Florida and the conventions over, Democrats were quick to say it’s time to come back to work.“I call on Republican Congressional leadership to bring us back into session so that we can immediately address this public health crisis,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). “Congress breaking for a historic summer recess without doing its job to protect Americans from Zika is incomprehensible and unconscionable.”“The Republican Congress has left town for seven weeks having failed to provide the resources needed to protect the American people,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), noting that more than 5,000 Americans – including nearly 800 pregnant women – were already infected with Zika from traveling abroad. “A stronger America requires real leadership in moments of crises, yet Republicans are continuing their dangerous recklessness in the face of this public health threat.”Similarly, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) took to Twitter to demand Congress deal with the spreading mosquito-borne virus. President Barack Obama asked for $1.9 billion to fund the Zika response back in February. The Senate eventually passed a bipartisan measure in May that would have provided $1.1 billion. But that measure differed from a version taken up in the House, and Republicans ultimately modified the bill to add provisions targeting Planned Parenthood, preserving the Confederate flag, taking money from Obamacare and weakening the Clean Water Act regarding pesticides.Democrats objected to the added riders and voted against the bill just before Congress left, saying that Republicans should ditch the ideological additions and just use the original Senate bill that had gotten 89 “yes” votes. Republicans declined.Representatives for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not directly answer whether they were considering bringing lawmakers back, but suggested there would be no point if Democrats would again block the Republicans’ modified bill.“We wonder if Senator Reid’s comment suggests Senate Democrats are ready to end their filibuster of the House-passed $1.1 billion package to fight Zika,” said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong.McConnell’s spokesman, Don Stewart, also pointed to recent reports that suggest the White House has enough money to do what it needs. Earlier this year the administration agreed to transfer some $589 million from other programs to deal with Zika. But according to data provided to news outlets by Obama’s Office of Management and the Budget, at least $384 million of that remains unspent. Stewart said the White House has “not explained why they’ve been so slow in using the funding they already have.”Still, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned Friday that money is indeed urgently needed.“What could happen is ... we’ll have to delay the vaccine,” Fauci said at a forum of the Bipartisan Policy Center, according to a report in Modern Health. “So we haven’t delayed anything up to now, but if we don’t get money soon, it’s going to have a ripple effect down the pike.”Fauci declined to say what Congress should do, but argued that his efforts to take protective steps would soon be harmed.“I am preciously close to the point where I run out of money and things are going to start slowing,” Fauci said.The OMB did not respond to a request for comment on the status of the funding.Congress is not scheduled to return from its break until after Labor Day in September."
17,POLITICS,6 More State Employees Criminally Charged In Flint Water Crisis,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flint-water-charges_us_579b6225e4b0e2e15eb5792d,"“The families of Flint will not be forgotten,” the state's attorney general said.",2016-07-29,Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) might run for governor. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579b66a01200008104a542c5.jpeg?ops=crop_0_61_3228_1715%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Six more people have been charged with crimes for their role in allowing the water in Flint, Michigan to become tainted with lead, a deadly poison. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, announced the charges against the six state employees on Friday morning. “The families of Flint will not be forgotten,” Schuette said at a press conference Friday. “Those who committed crimes will be held accountable.”Friday’s announcement brings the total number of Flint water crisis criminal charges to nine, plus two civil suits against private companies that consulted on the city’s water situation. The people charged Friday are Nancy Peeler, Corrine Miller, Robert Scott, Liane Shekter-Smith, Patrick Cook and Adam Rosenthal, all current or former employees of either the state Department of Environmental Quality or the Department of Health and Human Services.The charges stem from the state’s failure to follow proper treatment protocols after switching the city’s water source to the Flint River in 2014. Contrary to federal regulations, state officials failed to add corrosion inhibitors to prevent the river water from leaching lead from the city’s pipes. “The result was water was poisoned and children were exposed to extremely high levels of lead which may impede their growth and development for the rest of the their lives,” Schuette said. Flint residents knew something was wrong with their water in 2014, but the state insisted it was safe. In July of 2015, Schuette alleges ― and previously released emails have suggested ― Peeler, Scott and Miller became aware of high lead levels in Flint kids’ blood, but convinced themselves seasonal variation accounted for the change. They’ve been charged with conspiracy, willful neglect of duty and misconduct in office.The charges against Shekter-Smith, Cook and Rosenthal relate to their failure to take corrective action once they knew about Flint’s water problems.Political observers believe Schuette is positioning himself to run for governor of Michigan. He spoke about the Flint water crisis at the Republican National Convention. “Pregnant moms and mothers with newborns still should not drink the water and that’s not right,” Schuette said last week. “But I will make it right, because in Michigan the system is not rigged. In Michigan we have one system of justice which means there are rules for all.”Hillary Clinton also gave Flint a shoutout when she formally accepted her presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night. “I sweat the details of policy ― whether we’re talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Michigan, the number of mental health facilities in Iowa, or the cost of your prescription drugs,” Clinton said.Flint’s water still has unsafe levels of lead, meaning water samples from more than 10 percent of homes contained above 15 parts per billion lead in the most recent round of testing. No level of lead exposure is safe ― even at low doses, the heavy metal can cause a range of problems, most notably brain damage in small children. "
18,POLITICS,"To Win, Hillary Should Be Like Bernie, New Poll Suggests",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-poll-hillary-should-be-like-bernie_us_579ab05de4b08a8e8b5d79be,But some progressives are worried the Democratic Party sees a more fiscally conservative pitch as its ticket to the White House.,2016-07-29,Former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579ab1d92a00002d00fb386b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― If Hillary Clinton wants to win, she would do well to channel the populist message of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).That is the main takeaway of a new survey conducted by Democracy Corps, a Democratic-affiliated polling firm, on behalf of the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank. Joseph Stiglitz, the Roosevelt Institute’s Nobel Prize-winning chief economist, and Stanley Greenberg, founder of Democracy Corps, analyzed the implications of the research at a panel discussion for attendees of the Democratic National Convention and members of the media in downtown Philadelphia on Thursday.As part of a survey of 900 voters, Democracy Corps tested two different variations of the “stronger together” message of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.One version, which the pollsters called “build on the progress,” celebrates the economic gains of the Obama presidency. It proposes policies like infrastructure investment and paid family leave to lock in those gains and ensure they are better distributed.Another version, which Democracy Corps called “rewrite the rules,” portrays an economy that is fundamentally broken and a rigged political system that prevents ordinary American voters from making changes that would improve their lives. Unlike “build on the progress,” it insists that ending the “stranglehold of big money on our politics” is effectively a prerequisite for achieving other progressive priorities. While “rewrite the rules” does not identify itself as the Sanders campaign message, it closely mirrors the Democratic presidential candidate’s primary-season pitch to disenchanted voters.They then compared the performance of the two messages to a “nationalist economic” narrative of the kind being peddled by Donald Trump. The latter message claims that the United States is being ripped off by countries around the world, as well as unauthorized immigrants, and needs a veteran of the business world to look out for American businesses and workers.Unsurprisingly, millennials, people of color and unmarried women ― all key Democratic constituencies ― strongly preferred both “stronger together” messages over the Trump-like “nationalist economic” one.But the three groups also favored the “stronger together + rewrite the rules” by a larger margin than the “stronger together + build on progress” message.Fifty-nine percent of millennials, 67 percent of minority voters and 54 percent of unmarried women viewed the “rewrite the rules” message positively. By contrast, 45 percent of millennials, 53 percent of minorities and 52 percent of unmarried women liked the “build on progress” message.Clinton’s overall margin of victory against Trump jumped 4 percentage points among all the voters surveyed after they were introduced to the “rewrite the rules” message, resulting in a 46 percent to 39 percent win. By contrast, Clinton’s margin of victory actually declined by one percentage point after survey participants heard the “build on progress” message, yielding a narrower Clinton win of 43 to 41 percent.As even Democracy Corps’ numbers suggests, there is more than one way to win an election. But the subtext of Thursday’s event is an ongoing fight between the progressive wing of the Democratic party ― exemplified by Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren ― and a more business-friendly branch dominated by elite donors.The progressive wing of the party believes that the rising income inequality and flat median income of the Obama years demonstrated that more dramatic action is needed to make the economy work for ordinary Americans. They tend to reject new trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiated by President Barack Obama; embrace deficit spending; promote policies that strengthen labor unions; and view campaign finance reform as a key component of accomplishing all of those things.Seventy-one percent of Americans believe the economy is “on the wrong track,” according to the Democracy Corps poll. “When they say things are not going well, they know what they’re talking about,” Stiglitz said on Thursday, before sharing a series of statistics to substantiate his point.“The median income of a full-time male worker is lower than it was 42 years ago,” he added. “The real wages at the bottom are roughly comparable to where they were 60 years ago.”Regardless of Clinton’s political options, Stiglitz, Greenberg and many progressives in the audience expressed a hope that she will pursue a more populist path to the White House, which they believe will create the political rationale for a progressive agenda once she is in office.Hillary Clinton’s campaign argues she has a strong message for these struggling voters. Clinton has promised to sign a bill raising the federal minimum wage to $15, increase Social Security benefits and pass a constitutional amendment repealing the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision.Clinton even told Sanders supporters that they have a role to play in her campaign and her governing agenda.Speeches by Obama, vice presidential candidate Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and others were sprinkled with references to Republicans supportive of Clinton’s campaign. After Bloomberg’s ripping speech Wednesday night, Reihan Salam, a conservative policy analyst, wrote in Slate that Democrats are increasingly a party that caters to a coalition of socially liberal and fiscally conservative members of the upper middle class, which he nicknamed the “Bloombourgeoisie” for Bloomberg.“Going forward, one can imagine a battle for the Democratic Party’s soul that will pit the Bloombourgeoisie against the Sandernistas with both factions fighting to win over working- and lower-middle-class minority voters,” Salam wrote.As Salam notes, Trump’s candidacy appears to have only accelerated an exodus of well-off, highly educated Americans from the Republican Party that was already underway. Obama won eight out of 10 of the country’s wealthiest counties in 2012. And a majority of the top 4 percent of earners ― those making $220,000 or more ― voted for Obama in 2012, marking just the third time that a majority of that cohort did not go for the Republican candidate since 1964.Obama’s electoral victories show Democrats can win nationwide with the help of Bloomberg-style fiscal conservatives, offsetting the shrinking share of the white working-class vote that Democrats now receive.Greenberg acknowledged that the growing role of ex-Republican, upper-middle-class voters in the Democratic coalition endangers the chances of the party’s progressive wing.“It gets harder and harder to have this battle,” he concluded. “That’s why we have to have it in this election.”"

The young Republican had jumped at the chance to volunteer for Nelson Rockefeller’s last-minute effort to take the nomination from Richard Nixon and attend her first political convention.“The Republican convention was my first inside look at big-time politics, and I found the week unreal and unsettling,” Clinton wrote in her 2003 memoir. The 20-year-old Rodham probably never anticipated that 48 years later, she’d be at another political convention ― this time standing on the stage at the Democratic National Convention, making history as the first woman to ever receive a major party’s presidential nomination. “Tonight, we’ve reached a milestone in our nation’s march toward a more perfect union: the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president,” Clinton said Thursday night. “Standing here as my mother’s daughter, and my daughter’s mother, I’m so happy this day has come. I’m happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between. I’m happy for boys and men, too – because when any barrier falls in America, it clears the way for everyone.”“After all, when there are no ceilings, the sky’s the limit,” she added. “So let’s keep going, until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to have. But even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead”While more than 200 women have pursued the presidency since 1872 ― when Victoria Woodhull became the first woman to run for the highest office in the land ― no one has come as close as Clinton. Clinton presented the 2016 election as a moment of reckoning for America, a time when “powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart.”“We have to decide whether we all will work together so we all can rise together,” she said. “Our country’s motto is e pluribus unum: out of many, we are one. Will we stay true to that motto? Well, we heard Donald Trump’s answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us ― from the rest of the world, and from each other. ““Don’t believe anyone who says, ‘I alone can fix it,’” she added. “Yes, those were actually Donald Trump’s words in Cleveland. And they should set off alarm bells for all of us.”Thursday night was an event that many women have been waiting for their whole lives, and there were plenty of tears ― both in the arena and from afar ― for the big, historic moment when Clinton came out to greet her daughter, Chelsea, onstage. Suzanne Miller, 66, from Washington, D.C., said her 92-year-old mother in central Pennsylvania was a lifelong Republican. But this spring, she changed her party registration so that she could vote for Clinton.“She’s thrilled, at 92, to be able to vote for a woman,” Miller said. “She never, ever thought she’d see this day. She is so excited and so thrilled that she changed her party after all those years.”“This is looking at the fruits of my labor for 30 years, and feeling very proud,” said Ellen Malcolm, the founder of EMILY’s List, which works to elect pro-choice Democratic women and has become one of the most powerful political action committees since its start in 1985. It’s been a long journey for Clinton. She first came to national attention as a student at Wellesley College in 1969, when her peers selected her to deliver the school’s first-ever student commencement speech. The student body president spoke for her generation, saying that although they weren’t yet in positions of power and leadership, they did have “that indispensable element of criticizing and constructive protest.” Her comments were a direct rebuke of the speech Sen. Edward Brooke (R-Mass.) had delivered right before she took the stage, as he had argued against the effectiveness and need to protest. Clinton made The New York Times, The Washington Post and Life magazine. She began to get noticed, speaking around the country.But she really began to draw attention as a political spouse ― albeit an untraditional one. Although Clinton now faces skepticism from the progressive wing of her party, she was often seen as a liberal feather-ruffler in the establishment. People didn’t like that she wanted to keep her maiden name while her husband was governor of Arkansas; it was later inconceivable to people that she would lead a health care task force as first lady.Along the way ― from her days in Arkansas to her time as first lady, from her election to the U.S. Senate to her years as secretary of state ― Clinton has, in many ways, been the case study for sexism in politics. She has faced intense scrutiny over what kind of a woman she is: her hair styles, her clothes, the sound of her voice, whether she’s likable enough. The atmosphere for women running for office has changed dramatically over the years, but they still face hurdles. Even during this election cycle, people have criticized Clinton by saying she needs to smile more and stop shouting ― despite the fact that her male challengers have never faced similar comments.And it is those struggles ― and Clinton’s endless ability to overcome them ― that have bound her supporters to her. Many of the women who have shown up to Clinton rallies and to the convention in Philadelphia say they relate to her, and that they want to see her finally come out on top. Vicki Saporta, 63, from Washington, D.C., was the first female organizer for the Teamsters union. She said she constantly struggled to be accepted by others in the movement, and that she was put through test after test after test ― only to find her male colleagues resentful when she succeeded. “I understand what it’s like to pave the way for other women and how difficult it can be to be a first ― and how much extra you have to do in order to succeed,” Saporta said.“She was the first person in the public eye, in a traditional role, in a traditional state, who didn’t say, ‘I’m sorry, but I’m going to do this.’ She just did it,” said California delegate Andrea Villa, who was covered in pro-Hillary buttons and a T-shirt that read, “Well-Behaved Women Rarely Make History.”“I’m emotional and sentimental about this because I was the first woman mayor of Ville Platte, [Louisiana,] and here I am witnessing the first woman nominee who will eventually be president of the United States,” said Jennifer Vidrine, 57.The fact that the first female nominee is also eminently qualified also makes these women proud. They stress this over and over, so that Clinton doesn’t get dismissed as just a “token” pick. After all, many of them have been accused of not being as qualified as their male counterparts ― and women still don’t make as much as men do for the same work. “I was hoping she would finally get her turn,” said Roberta Goldman from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, who said she’s been a Clinton fan for a long time. “To me, she’s smarter than any president I’ve experienced, to be honest. ... She’s amazing! I don’t know if we’re going to get anybody else like that in a long time.”“What’s so wonderful this time, for Hillary in particular ... is the most qualified. We are going to be in such capable hands. It’s going to be so inspiring for the rest of us to be more engaged,” said Cleveland resident Terri Hamilton Brown, 54, who said she never thought she’d see a black president, let alone a black president potentially succeeded by the nation’s first female president. But Clinton’s long record of public service has also made her open to criticism that she’s part of the establishment ― something that’s especially dogging her this election, with the rise of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Her supporters consider this another damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t moment: Would the country choose a woman to be president if she weren’t this qualified? And how do you get qualified without being part of the system for so many years?The fact that the first female president would be part of a political family is also not surprising, since that’s how so many women broke barriers in politics.Until the 1970s, one of the most common ways for a woman to enter politics was by following her husband. According to Pew Research Center, 90 women served in the House between 1916 and 1980; 34 of them were elected to fill their husband’s seat or replaced him on the ballot after he died. This country has, traditionally, been more comfortable with female politicians when they know their husbands.Jan Cebula, a nun from Iowa who gave her age as “over 65,” sat in the very last row of the top section of the arena. The view wasn’t the best, but she said she’s overjoyed that “this is finally happening.”“I’m a little bit older. So it wasn’t an aspiration to be president when we were growing up,” Cebula said. Asked what she would have said if someone had suggested a female president when she was young, she stared blankly for a few seconds. “You know, to be real honest with you, they wouldn’t have thought of it.”Audrey Blondin, a Connecticut delegate, said she's been to four Democratic conventions and this one is ""the most emotional, exciting, energizing"" of all. Standing with a red, white and blue feather boa draped around her neck and ""dump Trump"" pins dangling from the rim of her oversized hat, Blondin recalled the glass ceilings she's hit over the years.""I graduated from high school in 1971 and my husband, who was my boyfriend at the time, went to the University of Notre Dame. I couldn't apply there because they didn't take women. I mean, to think about where I've come, from graduating from high school, to this…"" she said, trailing off.Blondin smiled and added, ""We've come a long way, baby.""Laura Bassett and Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting."

It’s been a long journey for Clinton. She first came to national attention as a student at Wellesley College in 1969, when her peers selected her to deliver the school’s first-ever student commencement speech. The student body president spoke for her generation, saying that although they weren’t yet in positions of power and leadership, they did have “that indispensable element of criticizing and constructive protest.” Her comments were a direct rebuke of the speech Sen. Edward Brooke (R-Mass.) had delivered right before she took the stage, as he had argued against the effectiveness and need to protest. Clinton made The New York Times, The Washington Post and Life magazine. She began to get noticed, speaking around the country.But she really began to draw attention as a political spouse ― albeit an untraditional one. Although Clinton now faces skepticism from the progressive wing of her party, she was often seen as a liberal feather-ruffler in the establishment. People didn’t like that she wanted to keep her maiden name while her husband was governor of Arkansas; it was later inconceivable to people that she would lead a health care task force as first lady.Along the way ― from her days in Arkansas to her time as first lady, from her election to the U.S. Senate to her years as secretary of state ― Clinton has, in many ways, been the case study for sexism in politics. She has faced intense scrutiny over what kind of a woman she is: her hair styles, her clothes, the sound of her voice, whether she’s likable enough. The atmosphere for women running for office has changed dramatically over the years, but they still face hurdles. Even during this election cycle, people have criticized Clinton by saying she needs to smile more and stop shouting ― despite the fact that her male challengers have never faced similar comments.And it is those struggles ― and Clinton’s endless ability to overcome them ― that have bound her supporters to her. Many of the women who have shown up to Clinton rallies and to the convention in Philadelphia say they relate to her, and that they want to see her finally come out on top. Vicki Saporta, 63, from Washington, D.C., was the first female organizer for the Teamsters union. She said she constantly struggled to be accepted by others in the movement, and that she was put through test after test after test ― only to find her male colleagues resentful when she succeeded. “I understand what it’s like to pave the way for other women and how difficult it can be to be a first ― and how much extra you have to do in order to succeed,” Saporta said.“She was the first person in the public eye, in a traditional role, in a traditional state, who didn’t say, ‘I’m sorry, but I’m going to do this.’ She just did it,” said California delegate Andrea Villa, who was covered in pro-Hillary buttons and a T-shirt that read, “Well-Behaved Women Rarely Make History.”“I’m emotional and sentimental about this because I was the first woman mayor of Ville Platte, [Louisiana,] and here I am witnessing the first woman nominee who will eventually be president of the United States,” said Jennifer Vidrine, 57.The fact that the first female nominee is also eminently qualified also makes these women proud. They stress this over and over, so that Clinton doesn’t get dismissed as just a “token” pick. After all, many of them have been accused of not being as qualified as their male counterparts ― and women still don’t make as much as men do for the same work. “I was hoping she would finally get her turn,” said Roberta Goldman from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, who said she’s been a Clinton fan for a long time. “To me, she’s smarter than any president I’ve experienced, to be honest. ... She’s amazing! I don’t know if we’re going to get anybody else like that in a long time.”“What’s so wonderful this time, for Hillary in particular ... is the most qualified. We are going to be in such capable hands. It’s going to be so inspiring for the rest of us to be more engaged,” said Cleveland resident Terri Hamilton Brown, 54, who said she never thought she’d see a black president, let alone a black president potentially succeeded by the nation’s first female president. But Clinton’s long record of public service has also made her open to criticism that she’s part of the establishment ― something that’s especially dogging her this election, with the rise of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Her supporters consider this another damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t moment: Would the country choose a woman to be president if she weren’t this qualified? And how do you get qualified without being part of the system for so many years?The fact that the first female president would be part of a political family is also not surprising, since that’s how so many women broke barriers in politics.Until the 1970s, one of the most common ways for a woman to enter politics was by following her husband. According to Pew Research Center, 90 women served in the House between 1916 and 1980; 34 of them were elected to fill their husband’s seat or replaced him on the ballot after he died. This country has, traditionally, been more comfortable with female politicians when they know their husbands.Jan Cebula, a nun from Iowa who gave her age as “over 65,” sat in the very last row of the top section of the arena. The view wasn’t the best, but she said she’s overjoyed that “this is finally happening.”“I’m a little bit older. So it wasn’t an aspiration to be president when we were growing up,” Cebula said. Asked what she would have said if someone had suggested a female president when she was young, she stared blankly for a few seconds. “You know, to be real honest with you, they wouldn’t have thought of it.”Audrey Blondin, a Connecticut delegate, said she's been to four Democratic conventions and this one is ""the most emotional, exciting, energizing"" of all. Standing with a red, white and blue feather boa draped around her neck and ""dump Trump"" pins dangling from the rim of her oversized hat, Blondin recalled the glass ceilings she's hit over the years.""I graduated from high school in 1971 and my husband, who was my boyfriend at the time, went to the University of Notre Dame. I couldn't apply there because they didn't take women. I mean, to think about where I've come, from graduating from high school, to this…"" she said, trailing off.Blondin smiled and added, ""We've come a long way, baby.""Laura Bassett and Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting."
