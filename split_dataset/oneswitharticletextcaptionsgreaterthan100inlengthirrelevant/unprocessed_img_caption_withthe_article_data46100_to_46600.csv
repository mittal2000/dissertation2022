",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d8728c1800006c32bd13a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Louisiana can lower its staggering incarceration rate — and save taxpayers money — by locking up fewer nonviolent offenders and devoting more resources to people who are actually dangerous, the state’s legislative auditor argued in a report last week. The auditors’ suggestions are fairly standard: Politicians and activists on both sides of the aisle, from the Koch brothers to #Cut50, support fiscally conservative reforms that will lower the prison population. That’s what makes a response letter from the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, included in the report’s appendix, so revealing. Although the group says it “generally” finds the auditor’s report “thoughtful” and the recommendations “worthy of serious consideration,” it goes on to push back against many of the auditor’s proposals. Sentencing some non-violent offenders to probation or community service “sounds reasonable on paper” but could actually constitute “a significant risk to public safety,” the group claims. Nonviolent criminals in Louisiana should be locked up not just because of their convictions, the DAs argued, but also because they’ve been arrested a lot.The DAs’ argument exposes a little-known obstacle to lowering prison populations: DAs and judges regularly use arrest records in determining how to charge and sentence people, regardless of whether those arrests resulted in convictions. If you were arrested for any crime in the past — even if you weren’t convicted — you can possibly face a longer sentence.This policy has horrific consequences for black communities. Black people are disproportionately subject to arrest in the state of Louisiana, according to a 2014 investigation by USA Today. They also make up the majority of the state’s prison population.Police in Gretna, which sits right across the river from New Orleans, arrest more people per capita than any other department in the U.S. Most of those apprehended are black. The same is true in Baton Rouge, where 284.3 out of 1,000 black residents are arrested, compared to 104.8 out of 1,000 for every other racial group combined, according to USA Today’s analysis. In Jefferson Parish, that number is 94.2 for black residents and 25.2 for everyone else.But many arrests do not result in convictions, as the Center For American Progress noted in a 2014 report.District attorneys and judges in Louisiana give prior arrests particularly heavy weight when considering charges and sentencing, says Derwyn Bunton, the chief district defender for Orleans Parish. The DAs’ desire to continue using nonviolent arrests that didn’t result in convictions as a justification for locking people up shows that Louisiana’s justice system is “wed to over-incarceration” and “points to how difficult criminal justice reform can be,” he added. “The larger the criminal justice system is, the more DAs we need to prosecute crimes and keep our communities safe. A larger criminal justice system ― one which criminalizes more and more conduct ― allows DA offices to justify budget increases and a need for more resources,” Bunton said. “They are a very active co-conspirator in mass incarceration in Louisiana. It is not all district attorneys, by any means, but generally as an organization, the culpability of our district attorneys in the mass incarceration problem is quite high.”The DAs stand by their argument.“If a person has an arrest record of 10 or 15 felony arrests and for purpose ― like intimidating witnesses or killing witnesses ― but there is no conviction, I believe it’s very relevant to the judge and the district attorney to judge how to proceed with that defendant,” said E. Pete Adams, the group’s executive director. Prosecutors “seem reluctant to let go of long-term Louisiana traditions favoring incarceration and relying on arrest records as a primary source for sentencing data ― even to the extent of giving them more importance than the offense of conviction,” said G. Paul Marx, the chief district defender for Lafayette Parish.Using arrest records to determine sentences is especially problematic in the context of Louisiana’s extremely harsh habitual offender laws, Bunton said. In 2012, Louisiana had around 160 people serving 20 years or more “whose most recent crime involved nothing more harmful than marijuana,” according to an investigation by The Times-Picayune. There were also over 300 inmates serving life without parole who were never convicted of a violent crime.The costs of housing and feeding these nonviolent offenders adds up. As the report notes, the state spent approximately $680.4 million in fiscal year 2015 keeping people behind bars.“Our money would be better spent on people who have a demonstrated history of really going upside somebody’s head,” Bunton said. “But it is the philosophy of many in our district attorneys’ association ― and the association as a whole ― that it’s OK to lock up people with those kinds of criminal histories, mostly because where there’s smoke there’s fire.” Read the entire report below:  "
1,POLITICS,Melania Trump Photographer Backs Up Her Immigration Claims,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melania-trump-immigration-photographer_us_57d9bd09e4b04a1497b24b62,His past comments prompted questions about whether she once worked in the U.S. illegally.,2016-09-14,"Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, says she came to the U.S. for the first time in 1996.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d9c17c1800006c32bd17a5.jpeg?cache=NG2Oi3eWdd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Alé de Basse­ville, the photographer whose July comments led to questions over whether Melania Trump lied about her immigration history, is now backing up the timeline the GOP nominee’s wife has offered regarding when she started working in the United States. The former model again denied allegations on Wednesday that she worked in New York City in 1995, which would have been illegal if she did not receive work authorization until the following year. The allegations were prompted, in part, by the New York Post publishing photos from the now-defunct French magazine Max ― and de Basse­ville saying the photos had been taken in Manhattan in 1995 and published in January 1996. But de Basse­ville told the New York Post on Wednesday that he misspoke.“[T]he photo session actually took place in 1996 in Manhattan, and appeared in a 1997 issue of the magazine,” a spokeswoman for the newspaper said he told the publication. The Post has since updated its piece. De Basseville’s clarification gives some credibility to Melania’s claims that her immigration record has been misreported. The issue over her early immigration status first erupted in August, when Politico reported the discrepancies between her story and other published reports. Critics quickly noted that her husband, Donald Trump, has been hypercritical of both unauthorized workers and even legal immigrants using H-1B visas, as his wife says she did.Melania posted to Twitter a letter from her attorney, Michael J. Wildes, on Wednesday. Wildes writes that Melania “never worked in the United States in 1995 because she was was never in the United States in 1995” (emphasis his). She first entered the U.S. on Aug. 27, 1996, on a visitor visa and received a work visa on Oct. 18 of that year, he said.The Trump campaign did not produce any documentation of Melania’s immigration record, and there are still discrepancies between the letter and past reports and remarks. A recent biography of Melania published by Slovenian journalists also says she came to the U.S. in 1995, according to Politico. Melania has said she left the country “every few months” to get her visa stamped before she became a legal permanent resident ― which contradicts her latest statement that she received five one-year H-1B visas to work between 1996 and 2001.

Finally, in March — after years of boycotts and impending legal pressure — SeaWorld announced that it would end its orca breeding program as well as the theatrical shows that had featured its killer whales.Now, California is hammering the nail into the coffin. Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation this week that will outlaw orca breeding and captivity programs in the state. The new law, which Assemblyman Richard Bloom (D-Santa Monica) authored, will also ban California parks from featuring orcas in performances for entertainment purposes. Starting in June 2017, killer whales in captivity can only be used for “educational presentations,” the Los Angeles Times reports. The legislation makes other exceptions for scientific and educational institutions that have orcas in their care. SeaWorld said earlier this year that it planned to “fundamentally change” its business model, not just ending its orca breeding program but also stopping theatrical shows at its parks in San Diego, California, San Antonio, Texas, and Orlando, Florida.The marine park said it would instead focus on education programs, and animal rescue and rehabilitation.Though activists have pressed SeaWorld to free their captive orcas, it’s believed the animals will live out the remainder of their lives there.“A lot of people just don’t realize that without facilities like SeaWorld, there are no places for these creatures to go,” said CEO Joel Manby in March, adding that the company cares for many sick and injured animals as part of its conservation initiative.There are more than 50 orcas held in captivity in several U.S. states and at least eight countries worldwide, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation. SeaWorld’s parks are home to more than 20 of them. "

4,BUSINESS,Workplace Health Insurance Premiums Finally Stopped Skyrocketing. Now For The Bad News.,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-insurance-costs-2016_us_57d81823e4b0fbd4b7bb75b2,"Deductibles keep getting bigger, and costs are still growing faster than paychecks.",2016-09-14,This is the story for the more than 150 million Americans who get their health insurance through employers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d818831300002a0039bb2e.jpeg?cache=7NdzetJ3FP&ops=crop_0_31_3203_1828%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Employers that provide health insurance, who cover nearly half of all Americans, saw modest premium increases this year, which is good news. But wait until you see the rest of the findings of a new survey.The average annual cost of an employer-sponsored family plan rose just 3 percent to $18,142 this year, and the average annual cost for an individual plan stayed virtually the same at $6,435. Those figures, which combine the amounts that employees and employers pay, come from the survey published Wednesday by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust and from an article appearing in the journal Health Affairs.In the messy, expensive U.S. health care system, such small increases constitute a positive development.The National Business Group on Health previously reported that companies expect just small premium increases next year, too. And all this is happening during a period of lower-than-normal growth in overall health care spending.But beneath those top-line figures are some not-so-positive developments, like a continuing trend toward workers facing higher and higher deductibles they must meet before their benefits kick in and having to pick up a larger share of the premium costs while employers kick in less and less.The following charts from the Kaiser Family Foundation/HRET report show just how much more expensive and less generous Americans’ job-based health benefits have become over time.A family plan cost workers about $1,500 in 1999, $4,000 in 2010 and $5,300 this year, while their employers’ percentage share of the total premium has been creeping downward.Even more striking is this graph, which shows how job-based health insurance costs have dramatically outpaced incomes and economic growth (as measured by inflation) over that same time period. And that continues despite relatively slow premium growth over the past five years.These next two graphs show that the value of health care coverage has declined even as premiums rose: A growing share of workers are enrolled in plans with high deductibles, and the deductibles themselves are increasing. As a result, employees are shouldering more of the costs of their health care over time.This is happening because health care keeps getting more expensive ― a trend that began long before the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Higher costs are the main driver of rising premiums and larger deductibles.But the employer insurance market isn’t struggling with other problems that plague the Obamacare market. Perhaps most importantly, the employer market covers a sustainable mix of healthy and sick customers, unlike the Affordable Care Act exchanges.All the attention lately on Obamacare’s challenges makes it easy to forget that most Americans don’t get their health coverage that way. Despite a widespread public misconception, none of its issues affect health care costs and benefits for the vast majority of people.Jobs are the biggest source of health benefits, and the more than 150 million people who are covered by employer-sponsored health plans dwarfs the 22 million who use an exchange or buy plans directly from insurers. Another 68 million are enrolled in Medicaid and 55 million use Medicare.The Affordable Care Act left the employer market for health insurance mostly untouched. Even provisions of the 2010 law directed at employers ― such as the requirement that companies with at least 50 full-time workers offer health benefits ― have had minimal effect overall to date. The main reason: most employers, and nearly all large businesses, already provided health benefits that met the standards of the law ― and plan to continue doing so, as the new survey shows."

7,THE WORLDPOST,Parents In Northern Greece Say They Don't Want Refugee Children In Their Schools,"Angeliki Kougiannou, HuffPost Greece",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greece-parents-refugee-children_us_57d96ae2e4b0fbd4b7bc9b7b,Two parents associations in the town of Oreokastro are threatening to occupy schools to block refugee kids from attending.,2016-09-14,"Children sit in a classroom in the refugee camp of Lagadikia, near Thessaloniki, Greece, during the visit of UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi on Aug. 25, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d96fc61800002f003147ec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the new school year kicked off in Greece, the country’s Ministry of Education announced a plan to enroll 22,000 migrant and refugee children in schools around the country. The children, who fled war and poverty, are stranded in camps and refugee centers all across Greece, where opportunities for learning have been limited.But the ministry’s decision to help them gain access to formal education has already been met with resistance. Two parents associations in Oreokastro, a town on the outskirts of Thessaloniki in northern Greece, have issued statements saying they will not accept the 420 migrant and refugee children living in the area in their schools.The two associations, for the 1st primary school of Paleokastro and 5th primary school of Oreokastro, said their decision was “unanimous” and threatened to occupy school premises to oppose the children’s entry.HuffPost Greece contacted the parents associations to find out the reasoning behind their opposition.Fotini Kitsiou, president of the Paleokastro school’s parents association, claimed the parents were primarily concerned about health: “These children have not been vaccinated and we are worried about diseases.” If refugee children met health and vaccination standards, she added, the parents would not have a problem with them attending school.But she also mentioned cultural and religious differences as a reason for the parents’ opposition, saying, “These children are raised in a different way and they wouldn’t feel comfortable in our schools.”Oreokastro Mayor Asterios Gavotsis said he believed the best solution would be for refugee children to attend classes in a separate location. If the government does not agree with the proposals Oreokastro residents have submitted, he warned, they will mobilize in protest.Not everyone in town stands behind the two parents associations, however. Athanasios Tsolakidis, the president of the Union of Parents Associations of Oreokastro, told HuffPost Greece the two parents associations were “two isolated cases” and said their views do not resonate with the majority of parents associations in the area. Tsolakidis later resigned, citing attacks from the public.Education Minister Nikos Filis said the groups’ opposition to admitting refugee children is “incomprehensible” and attributed it to lack of information and prejudice. “This attitude stands completely at odds with the love, solidarity and understanding that the great majority of Greek parents, students and teachers have shown [towards refugees] in our country,” he said.According to Filis, the government’s integration plan already addresses health concerns and includes an immunization program. “We have taken all necessary measures,” he affirmed in a radio interview. “Refugee children will be received at schools, will be vaccinated and will have their teachers. We want them to play with the Greek children and they will gradually be introduced in classrooms. I don’t understand why parents would not accept these children at school.”Meanwhile, the prosecutor’s office in Thessaloniki ordered an investigation on Wednesday into the two parents associations’ stance and the mayor of Oreokastro’s statements to determine whether their actions can be prosecuted under a law that prohibits hate speech and the incitement of racist violence.A version of this story originally appeared on HuffPost Greece."

He is a martyr and martyrs are beatified.”Beatification is one of the first steps in the complex process that leads to sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church.“A GOOD HUMBLE MAN”Usually a miracle is needed for a candidate for sainthood to be beatified. But that requirement can be waived if there is evidence that the person died a martyr.“A good, humble man, a man of brotherhood who always sought to make peace, was assassinated as if he were a criminal,” Francis said. He ordered that a picture of the murdered priest be placed on the altar during the Mass.The Catholic Church posthumously confers sainthood on people considered so holy during their lives that they are now believed to be with God and can intercede with him to perform miracles.In another indication that Francis believes Hamel is already on the way to sainthood, the archbishop of Rouen, Dominique Lebrun, told reporters afterwards that the pope had told him Hamel should be “venerated,” an honor usually bestowed only after a sainthood procedure begins.Hamel’s killing came as France’s political leaders sought ways to defeat home-grown Islamist violence.His murder by French citizens was the first Islamist attack on a church in western Europe and came just 12 days after a Tunisian who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State drove his truck through a crowd of Bastille Day revelers in the Riviera city of Nice, killing 84.(Reporting By Philip Pullella; Editing by Andrew Heavens)"

They were allegedly aware of the teenager’s radicalized activity, according to BFMTV. He was filed under the “S” category, meaning that he was being monitored by the state.It’s work that “is keeping us busy night and day,” interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Wednesday. “Our investigation work is more intense than it’s ever been given the heightened threat level and the calls, coming from various players based in Syria who communicate via encrypted messaging, for French people to carry out attacks.”There are about 20,000 people who fall under the “S” category in France, roughly 10,000 of whom have shown ties to radical Islam.The cases of all three minors are connected. They all used Telegram, an encrypted messaging service, to receive guidance on attack planning. They’d also all been in contact with Rachid Kassim, a French jihadi well known to authorities. Kassim is suspected of having mentored the boys via social media from somewhere inside a part of Syria or Iraq controlled by the so-called Islamic State, HuffPost France reported.Kassim was allegedly linked to the car full of explosives placed in central Paris by female commandos on Friday. He is also believed to have been involved in the murder of two French police officers in June and a priest in July. “Women and sisters are executing attacks. So where are the brothers? … If these women are ready to act, it’s because there are too few men who are ready to act,” Kassim said in a Telegram message quoted by Le Monde.Authorities across Western Europe are being kept busy staving off attacks, a mission of unprecedented importance given the recent terror attacks in Paris, Nice and Brussels. German police arrested three Syrian young men on Tuesday suspected of being instructed by ISIS to carry out an attack.The trio arrived in late 2015, likely thanks to the same smuggler network that funneled militants into Paris to carry out November’s attacks, according to interior minister Thomas de Maiziere."

Fallen power cables and trees were among some of the early damage reported.“This typhoon is the world’s strongest so far this year,” weather bureau spokeswoman Hsieh Pei-yun said. “Its impact on Taiwan will peak all day today.”Companies and schools in Kaohsiung and other cities have closed and almost 1,500 residents have been evacuated, the Central Emergency Operation Centre said in a statement.Nearly 200,000 households were without power, according to the Taiwan Power Co. Most domestic flights have been canceled, including all of those from Kaohsiung airport, where international flights were also severely affected.Taiwan will feel the full force of the typhoon through Wednesday and into Thursday before the storm barrels into China, meteorologists said.Meranti is expected to make landfall in the southern Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Fujian on Thursday, where authorities were already canceling train services and preparing to evacuate people, state media said.In eastern Guangdong province, authorities ordered trawlers to return to harbor and fishermen to shelter on land from Meranti, which the official China News Service said could be the strongest typhoon to hit that part of China since 1969.Typhoons are generated at this time of year, picking up strength as they cross the warm waters of the Pacific before bringing strong winds and violent rainstorms when they hit land.Meranti comes just over two months after the deadly typhoon Nepartak cut power, grounded flights and forced thousands to flee their homes across central and southern areas of Taiwan.In 2009, Typhoon Morakot cut a swath of destruction through southern Taiwan, killing about 700 people and causing up to $3 billion of damage."

Job-related dissatisfaction experienced in your 20s and 30s can lead to overall health issues just 10 or 20 years down the line, according to a new study from the American Sociological Association.“We found that there is a cumulative effect of job satisfaction on health that appears as early as your 40s,” said lead author Jonathan Dirlam, a doctoral student in sociology at Ohio State University. Dirlam and his team analyzed data from over 6,000 participants in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which has been tracking outcomes of participants since 1979. The researchers examined the participants’ job satisfaction trajectories from age 25 to 39, and then compared that data with the health conditions reported by the same participants after they turned 40.What they discovered was people who were unhappier in their jobs early in their careers were also the most prone to illness, particularly mental health problems, in their 40s. They were more depressed, had more emotional issues and sleep problems and suffered from excessive worry.Physical ailments were also more likely, though to a lesser degree. Those with lower job satisfaction tended to report more problems like back pain and frequent colds than those who were happier at work.“We found that those with lower job satisfaction levels throughout their late 20s and 30s have worse mental health compared to those with high job satisfaction levels,” Dirlam told CBS News. “Those who initially had high job satisfaction but downwardly decreased over time also had worse health.” Co-author Hui Zheng, an associate professor of sociology at Ohio State, said the findings reveal the importance that early jobs have on people’s lives and well-being. “You don’t have to be near the end of your career to see the health impact of job satisfaction, particularly on your mental health,” he said.Zheng added that though researchers found little difference in other health problems like cancer and diabetes, those issues might be expected later in life among those with lower job satisfaction levels.“The higher levels of mental health problems for those with low job satisfaction may be a precursor to future physical problems,” he said. “Increased anxiety and depression could lead to cardiovascular or other health problems that won’t show up until they are older.”The study, presented on Aug. 22 at an annual meeting of the ASA, supports earlier research that suggests a clear correlation between job satisfaction and health.In a 2003 meta-analysis of 485 studies on the subject, job satisfaction was found to be strongly associated with psychological problems such as burnout, depression and anxiety. A modest link between job happiness and physical illness was also found.Job satisfaction is “an important factor influencing the health of workers,” the authors of the analysis concluded.“Organizations should include the development of stress management policies to identify and eradicate work practices that cause most job dissatisfaction as part of any exercise aimed at improving employee health,” the authors advised. “Occupational health clinicians should consider counselling employees diagnosed as having psychological problems to critically evaluate their work— and help them to explore ways of gaining greater satisfaction from this important aspect of their life.” "
14,POLITICS,Supreme Court Won't Rescue 'Golden Week' Of Early Voting In Ohio,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ohio-early-voting-supreme-court_us_57d715a6e4b0aa4b722bef0a,Ohio Democrats wanted the court to reinstate a six-day period that allowed voters to register and vote at the same time.,2016-09-13,"Some cutbacks to early voting in Ohio have been subject to a flurry of legal challenges, and the Supreme Court has largely sided with the state.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d723131800006c32bd0f3a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned away an effort by Ohio Democratic groups that sought to restore a special week that allowed voters to register and vote early on the same day.In a brief order, the justices denied the groups’ request but did not note where they stood in the dispute. At least five of them are needed to grant an emergency petition.Without this six-day period, known as “Golden Week,” Ohio voters now have four weeks to vote early, beginning on Oct. 12 ― either in person or via absentee ballot.State lawmakers eliminated Golden Week in 2014, leading to legal challenges alleging discrimination against minority voters. An early lawsuit couldn’t stop cutbacks for the 2014 election ― and the Supreme Court at the time agreed to let Ohio officials move forward with the shorter early-voting period. But following a new round of litigation, a federal judge in May concluded that eliminating Golden Week was an unconstitutional burden on black voters.“Indeed, it may be more difficult for voters with time, resource, transportation, and childcare restraints to make two separate trips to register and vote, and Golden Week allowed individuals to do both at once,” wrote U.S. District Judge Michael Watson in his ruling.An appeals court last month reversed that decision, observing that Ohio, even without the benefit of extra days of early voting and same-day registration, was a “national leader” in providing additional opportunities to vote early.“Ohio continues to provide generous, reasonable, and accessible voting options to all Ohioans,” said the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. Ohio Democrats contended that the reversal was too close to the formal start of early voting and that it risked creating confusion and long wait times at the polls.Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted (R) said in a statement that he hoped the Supreme Court’s move would mark the end of the road for these legal challenges, which he called “wasteful.”“This much is perfectly clear: Ohio is a place where it is easy to vote and hard to cheat. In fact, with voting now slated to begin in less than a month for the November election, Ohio is one of the easiest states in the nation in which to register and cast your ballot,” Husted said.With Tuesday’s order, the Supreme Court has so far declined to reverse or put on hold every voting rights ruling that could have an impact on Election Day ― including cases involving North Carolina’s restrictive voting law and a Michigan ban to “straight-ticket” voting.Unlike the Ohio case, these last two controversies resulted in net losses for Republicans ― underscoring the ideological divide among the justices when it comes to voting rights, as well as the politics surrounding the replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia.In a statement, the Ohio Democratic Party suggested as much.“We’re disappointed in the outcome, but we’re not surprised given the fact that the Supreme Court is hamstrung with only eight justices because of Republican obstructionism,” said David Pepper, the state party chairman.This story has been updated to include a statement from the Ohio Democratic Party."

Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), who stood next to Clinton during a 9/11 memorial ceremony on Sunday, pushed back when asked at a press conference if the candidate hadn’t been transparent about her health. “All of a sudden it’s about the transparency of Mrs. Clinton,” Crowley said Tuesday. “What about the transparency of Mr. Trump, who refuses once again ― beside his doctor’s note ― he continues to refuse to show any of his tax returns.”Piling on, Crowley pointed to a recent Washington Post report showing that Trump used his foundation to contribute other people’s money to charitable organizations and take the credit.“There’s a double standard for Mrs. Clinton,” Crowley continued. “[Trump] doesn’t have to show anything. He could walk right up to the election and show absolutely nothing, continue to repeat lies. Lie after lie after lie, and he’s not held accountable.”Clinton’s campaign made her pneumonia diagnosis public hours after she stumbled while exiting the memorial ceremony, but critics argued that the former secretary of state hadn’t been transparent about her health because her doctor had issued the diagnosis on Friday. Clinton previously released a summary of her health and plans to make more medical records available, her campaign said this week. A number of top Democrats have come to Clinton’s defense, attempting downplay the severity of her pneumonia. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) revealed on Monday that he was diagnosed with pneumonia weeks ago and that the illness has passed, The Associated Press reported. Vice President Joe Biden said during a visit to Charlotte, North Carolina, on Monday that he had walking pneumonia last year, according to a pool report. Trump released one note from his doctor in December. In it, gastroenterologist Harold Bornstein said Trump would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Bornstein revealed last month that he wrote the note in just five minutes, while a car sent by Trump waited for him outside. Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) conceded that it is fair to ask about Clinton’s health and question the campaign waiting to announce the diagnosis, but added that Trump’s campaign should be treated the same way. “We know less about Donald Trump’s health today than we’ve known about Hillary Clinton’s health for some time,” Becerra said.

And recently Trump changed his tune, saying he’ll release his returns as soon as Hillary Clinton releases the 33,000 emails she deleted from her email server.”“What this means, of course, is that there’s no real reason that Trump is keeping his returns secret, except that he sees them as a bargaining chip to utilize,” he added.In his post, Hoffman told the story of Peter Kiernan, a 26-year-old Marine who’s launched a campaign on the fundraising site Crowdpac. Kiernan hopes to raise at least $25,000 for charities supporting veterans if Trump releases his tax returns by Oct. 19.With Trump’s 2012 offer to Obama in mind, Hoffman said that if Kiernan’s campaign meets or exceeds its fundraising goal, he’ll match the total fivefold. Hoffman said he is prepared to donate up to $5 million. “The ingenuity of Kiernan’s proposal is how it gives Trump a strong incentive to act but doesn’t reward him directly for something he should have already done,” Hoffman wrote at Medium. “Instead, men and women to whom all Americans owe a great debt of gratitude will benefit from any positive action he takes.”Last year, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton released her personal income tax returns spanning eight years ― 2007 through 2014 ― shortly after declaring her candidacy. Her 2015 tax return, which was released last month, showed that she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, took in $10.6 million last year and paid $3.24 million in taxes.Because of Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign and her husband’s decades-long political career, the couple’s tax returns are available going back to 1977.If Trump doesn’t make his tax returns publicly available, it will break from a tradition more than 40 years old. Nearly every major presidential candidate since 1973 has released his or her personal returns, with the exception of Gerald Ford, who released a tax summary that covered several years but never made his full returns available.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The gift will allow the program to operate in perpetuity and expand its work.Rosenthal said in a statement that the Ohio Innocence Project “has a laudable mission” in seeking to free every innocent person in the state.“I’m proud to help ensure its life-saving work continues now and forever,” Rosenthal said. “Thank you to everyone who has helped make the OIP so successful in its mission – I’m inspired daily by the students, faculty and staff who work tirelessly in the pursuit of justice.”Rosenthal’s single gift was roughly triple the amount that the program had raised over the course of more than a decade, and several times its existing endowment, Godsey said. He added that Rosenthal and his late wife, Lois, had been “instrumental” in shaping the organization, which was founded in 2003.One of the people that the Ohio Innocence Project helped clear is Ricky Jackson (pictured above with Rosenthal), who spent 39 years in prison after being sentenced to death row at the age of 18 for a murder he didn’t commit.“The English language doesn’t have the words to express how I’m feeling right now,’’ Jackson said upon his 2014 release.Godsey said there has been increased interest in programs like the Ohio Innocence Project in recent years, in part thanks to shows like “Making a Murderer” and “Serial,” which have helped depict what lawyers working on these cases have known for years.“I think these shows have been tremendously helpful in making the public aware of the problem,” Godsey said. “To be honest with you, I’ve got many cases that are just as interesting and fascinating and crazy as ‘Making a Murderer,’ but nobody was there filming them. When I’d talked about them, the public is in disbelief, because the public is sort of in this fog that the system is nearly perfect and doesn’t need reform. But now when I talk about these cases, they understand the problem and they’re nodding along, and that is extremely helpful.”"

The woman, screaming profanities, tried to rip their hijabs off their heads.“Get the fuck out of America, bitches,” she said, according to prosecutors. “This is America — you shouldn’t be different from us.”On Saturday, a man walked up to a woman in a hijab on a Manhattan street, and set her on fire.On Sunday ― the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks ― someone threw a “rock-like” object through a New Hampshire mosque’s window while parishioners were inside. On early Monday morning ― the beginning of the Eid al-Adha, one of Islam’s holiest holidays ― a man allegedly walked up to a mosque in Florida and set it on fire. And on Monday night, someone repeatedly backed a tractor-trailer into a Maryland mosque. Eid al-Adha is a four-day period of community and celebration, marked by prayer, feasting and gift-giving. But in America this year, it was also marked by fear and sadness. “I’m running out of things to say, really,” an exasperated Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said on Monday. “Each [incident] is followed by another.”“At this sacred and joyous time for Muslims in the U.S. and around the world, the surge in anti-Muslim attacks is particularly shocking and disheartening,” Nazir Harb, a senior research fellow at Georgetown University’s Bridge Initiative, told The Huffington Post. Muslims in America, Harb said, “began scrambling months ago when it was determined that this year’s Eid holiday would fall on or around the 15th anniversary of the September 11th attacks.”The concern was this: Americans reliving the horrible memories of 9/11 might wrongly perceive public celebrations of Eid as disrespectful, and then lash out against Muslims. But despite a media campaign and a grassroots effort to educate the American public about why Eid was occurring so close to the 9/11 anniversary (answer: the lunar calendar), Harb said that “some of the most gruesome Islamophobic attacks since 9/11 occurred around Eid this week.” “Muslims in this country frequently report potential terrorist incidents and condemn all attacks carried out wrongfully in the name of Islam,” Harb added. “While it is easy, and perhaps comforting, to blame all Muslims for terrorism in the world, such beliefs give rise to violence that hurts innocent, ordinary people.”It’s unclear whether the celebration of Eid had anything to do with this most recent series of vicious Islamophobic crimes. But Islam’s other major holiday, Ramadan, was also marred by anti-Muslim aggression this year. HuffPost documented at least 20 anti-Muslim crimes in the U.S. from June 4 to July 6, including shootings, assaults and acts of vandalism. All of these attacks, of course, have occurred against the backdrop of a presidential election season awash in vitriolic anti-Muslim political speech, most notably from Republican nominee Donald Trump and his advisers. Since 2015, Trump has proposed banning Muslims from entering the U.S., called for a national database of Muslims, said that mosques should be surveilled and Muslims should be profiled, suggested that the Muslim mother of a fallen American soldier didn’t speak at the Democratic National Convention because she wasn’t allowed to talk, and flat-out said that “Islam hates us.”Meanwhile, this election season has also seen a frightening surge in anti-Muslim attacks. According to the group Muslim Advocates, there have been over 100 hate crimes targeting Muslims in the U.S. since the Paris terror attacks last November. A report from The Bridge Initiative found that there were more acts of anti-Muslim violence and vandalism in 2015 than in any year since the 9/11 attacks. And a report from the Council on American-Islamic Relations found 78 instances in 2015 where mosques were targeted for vandalism, arson and other types of destruction ― quadruple the number from the year before.HuffPost has recorded more than 260 acts of anti-Muslim violence, discrimination and political speech in the United States so far in 2016.“It’s just really alarming to see that no matter how many times we publicly talk about these incidents, there still doesn’t seem to be an end in sight,” said Madihha Ahussain, a staff attorney at Muslim Advocates. “And we aren’t able to sort of change the way we’re talking about this. There needs to be some sort of action, like a large-scale solution to this problem.” Harb thinks there’s a small-scale solution, too. “One of the most important facts about Islamophobia to keep in mind is that most people who think all Muslims are terrorists have never met a Muslim,” he said. Sixty-three percent of Americans, in fact, don’t know any Muslims personally, a 2014 poll found. “There’s a starting point for all of us,” Harb said. “Before you allow yourself to hate all Muslims and buy into conspiracy theories about ‘Islamic radical terrorism’ peddled by the Trumps of the world, make a small effort to meet a Muslim and ask a question.”Eid al-Adha ends this Thursday. “Eid Mubarak,” a common Arabic greeting during the holiday, means “have a blessed celebration.”"
