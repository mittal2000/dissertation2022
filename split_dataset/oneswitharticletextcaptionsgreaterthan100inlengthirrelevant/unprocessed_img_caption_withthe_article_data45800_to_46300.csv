Instead of physical displays, the Republican presidential nominee has stuck to verbal ones ― bragging about his penis, launching personal attacks and resorting to racist and sexist insults.Trump is set to debate his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, on Sept. 26. When it happens, Goodall told The Atlantic she’ll be thinking of “Mike,” a chimpanzee she studied that displayed dominance by kicking kerosene cans, creating a racket that sent would-be challengers fleeing. Unsurprisingly, Trump has already boasted that he will come out on top, telling The New York Times “I know how to handle Hillary.”Whether his strategy includes childish tidbits has yet to be seen. Tony Schwartz, co-author of Trump’s book The Art of the Deal, however, bets it will. “Trump has severe attention problems and simply cannot take in complex information — he will be unable to practice for these debates,” Schwartz told the Times. “Trump will bring nothing but his bluster to the debates. He’ll use sixth-grade language, he will repeat himself many times, he won’t complete sentences, and he won’t say anything of substance.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Thompson was also aware of his sexuality when they married in 1994.“She was understanding and I will always be grateful to her. We had a lot of fun, we have three fabulous daughters and I don’t regret any stage of my life,” he said.The couple divorced in 2011 and Mountbatten had a “gay fling” in the ensuing years, he told the Mail. But he never felt comfortable enough to come out about his sexuality until recently, when he met 54-year-old airline cabin services director James Coyle.The pair was skiing in Verbier, Switzerland when a chance encounter at a bar changed their lives forever.They immediately hit it off and exchanged phone numbers, they both recalled. Coyle was already open about his sexuality, having come out after his mother’s death in 2003. If this relationship was to continue, Coyle declared that it could not be in secret.“If I was going to be with him, it had to be in the open with friends and family. I wanted us to be honest, not to hide anything, not to be anything else,” Coyle told the Mail.Mountbatten agreed, first speaking with his family, who “could not be more supportive,” he said.The couple decided to come forward to the media after receiving inquires into their personal lives, they told the newspaper.In June, Prince William also made history by becoming the first royal to appear on the cover of a gay magazine.His photo spread on the U.K.’s Attitude Magazine followed joint efforts by his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, and his brother, Prince Harry, to address mental health issues and fight bullying that can come with it."

You can’t do that with a tie vote.”Before Scalia’s death, the Supreme Court was widely expected to make a lot of noise with decisions that could’ve reshaped the law for a generation on issues such as the president’s power to enforce immigration law, the future of public sector unions, and the clash between religious freedom and contraception access.But in a number of those areas the justices went out with a whimper ― divided 4-to-4 and leaving the law as if the court had never agreed to hear the case.Kagan called this inability to decide a “disability” for the court, but she did give Chief Justice John Roberts some credit for trying to steer her and her colleagues toward common ground.“I think enormous credit goes to the chief justice in that, who has really tried to forge compromise and really tried to get us to keep to a minimum the number of cases where we just throw up our hands and say, ‘We can’t reach a decision,’” Kagan said.But she added that there have been moments of indecision ― sometimes to the point that the compromise or the “narrowing” of the case is such that it makes it worse off for everybody else.“In other words,” Kagan explained, “narrowing them so far that it left undecided the real reason why we took the case, and the real thing that’s confounding the lower courts. And, you know, over time that’s a problem.”President Barack Obama, who in March offered a nominee to fill Scalia’s vacant seat, acknowledged as much in June when the Supreme Court was deadlocked on the fate of his ambitious effort to defer deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants, the vast majority parents of American citizens and permanent residents.“This is part of the consequence of a Republican failure so far to give a fair hearing to Merrick Garland, my nominee to the Supreme Court,” Obama told reporters after the ruling was announced. This failure to decide, the president added, is “a very clear reminder of why it’s so important for the Supreme Court to have a full bench.”Thus far, his appeals have fallen on deaf ears. Back in full swing after a seven-week recess, Senate leadership has shown no signs or willingness to give Garland a hearing before the election. And even Hillary Clinton has sent strong signals that she might not stick with the 63-year-old judge if she wins the presidency.In her Harvard remarks, Kagan steered clear of talking confirmation politics directly. But she was not shy about what the empty seat does to the Supreme Court’s inner workings ― suggesting that its work and overall decision-making power could take a toll in the long run.“I think all of us have tried hard to find ways of resolving cases, which are not so apparent on the surface,” she said. “But is that cost-free? No, it’s absolutely not.”"

In a direct comparison, Americans say by a 19-point margin, 53 percent to 34 percent, that Trump is the more extreme of the two.Views of which candidate is more extreme divide generally along party lines, with 86 percent of Democrats naming Trump, 60 percent of Republicans naming Clinton and independents split between Trump and Clinton at 45 percent and 38 percent, respectively.But although most Republicans are comfortable with Trump’s positions, 27 percent believe that he is too extreme ― considerably higher than the 11 percent of Democrats who say the same of Clinton.Since Trump won the nomination, it seems every show of even modest restraint on his part has sparked a debate over whether or not he was “pivoting” to a more moderate position. Trump himself shot down that idea, telling a Wisconsin TV station last month that “I am who I am. It’s me. I don’t want to change.” Thirty percent of Americans say Trump has gotten more extreme since becoming the nominee, while 27 percent say he’s gotten less extreme and 35 percent that he’s stayed about the same.Members of Trump’s own party are the most likely to believe that he’s moderated. Forty percent of Republicans, compared to just 13 percent of Democrats, say he’s become less extreme since the start of the general election campaign.The majority of Americans ― 53 percent ― say Clinton has stayed about the same since winning the Democratic nomination, with 29 percent saying she’s gotten more extreme and 9 percent that she has become less so.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 10-Sept. 12 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

Shown here, forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad walk at a military complex in a handout photo provided by SANA on Sept. 5, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57dd99c21300002b0039ca79.jpeg?cache=ZuXXEr4zl7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S.-led coalition air strikes reportedly killed dozens of Syrian soldiers on Saturday, endangering a U.S.-Russian brokered ceasefire and prompting an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting as tensions between Moscow and Washington escalated.The United States military said the coalition stopped the attacks against what it had believed to be Islamic State positions in northeast Syria after Russia informed it that Syrian military personnel and vehicles may have been hit.The United States relayed its “regret” through the Russian government for what it described as the unintentional loss of life of Syrian forces in the strike, a senior Obama administration official said in an emailed statement.The 15-member Security Council met on Saturday night after Russia demanded an emergency session to discuss the incident and accused the United States of jeopardizing the Syria deal.The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, chastised Russia for the move.“Russia really needs to stop the cheap point scoring and the grandstanding and the stunts and focus on what matters, which is implementation of something we negotiated in good faith with them,” Power told reporters before the meeting.She said the United States was investigating the air strikes and “if we determine that we did indeed strike Syrian military personnel, that was not our intention and we of course regret the loss of life.”When asked if the incident ended the Syria deal between Moscow and Washington, Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said: “This is a very big question mark.”“I would be very interested to see how Washington is going to react. If what Ambassador Power has done today is any indication of their possible reaction then we are in serious trouble,” Churkin told reporters.Moscow cited the strikes, which allowed Islamic State fighters to briefly overrun a Syrian army position near Deir al-Zor airport, as evidence that the United States was helping the jihadist militants.“We are reaching a really terrifying conclusion for the whole world: That the White House is defending Islamic State. Now there can be no doubts about that,” the RIA Novosti news agency quoted Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying.She said the strikes threatened to undermine the ceasefire in Syria brokered by Russia, which has been aiding Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad in the civil war, and the United States, which has backed some rebel groups.The Russian Defence Ministry said U.S. jets had killed more than 60 Syrian soldiers in four air strikes by two F-16s and two A-10s coming from the direction of Iraq.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitoring group with contacts across Syria, cited a military source at Deir al-Zor airport as saying at least 80 Syrian soldiers had been killed.The ceasefire, which took effect on Monday, is the most significant peacemaking effort in Syria for months, but has been undermined by repeated accusations of violations on both sides and by a failure to bring humanitarian aid to besieged areas.Apart from the U.S. and Russian involvement, Assad is supported by Iran and Arab Shi’ite militias, while Sunni rebels seeking to unseat him are backed by Turkey and Gulf Arab states.All the warring parties are also sworn enemies of Islamic State, whose territory extends along the Euphrates valley from the Iraqi border, including around Deir al-Zor, up to land near Syria’s frontier with Turkey.In its sixth year, the conflict has cost hundreds of thousands of lives, displaced half of Syria’s pre-war population, prompted a refugee crisis in the Middle East and Europe and inspired a wave of jihadist attacks across the world.Syria’s army said the U.S.-led strikes, which took place at around 5 p.m. local time (1400 GMT) were “conclusive evidence” of U.S. support for Islamic State, calling them “dangerous and blatant aggression”.The U.S. military said in its statement that Syria was a “complex situation” but that “coalition forces would not intentionally strike a known Syrian military unit”.Islamic State said via its Amaq news channel it had taken complete control of Jebel Tharda, where the bombed position was located, which would have allowed it to overlook government-held areas of Deir al-Zor.The city’s airport and some districts have been entirely surrounded by Islamic State since last year, with the airport providing their only external access.However, Russia and Syrian state media said the Syrian army later recaptured positions it had lost. The Observatory monitoring group said at least 20 Islamic State fighters were killed in heavy Russian air strikes during that fighting.The incident also threatens to undermine proposed joint targeting by the United States and Russia of Islamic State and some other jihadist groups across Syria.SHAKY TRUCEEarlier on Saturday, Russia and Syrian rebels cast doubt over the prospects for the increasingly shaky ceasefire, with Moscow saying the situation was worsening and a senior insurgent warning that the truce “will not hold out”.While the ceasefire has reduced fighting, some violence has persisted across Syria. Meanwhile, there has been little movement on promised aid deliveries to besieged areas and both sides have accused the other of bad faith.Russia’s Defence Ministry said conditions in Syria were deteriorating, adding that it believed the ceasefire had been breached 199 times by rebels and saying the United States would be responsible if it were to collapse.After the Deir al-Zor attack, it said Moscow had told the United States to rein in the Syrian opposition and make sure it did not launch a new offensive, adding that it had informed Washington about a concentration of rebels north of Hama.Insurgents say they only reluctantly accepted the initial deal, which they believe is skewed against them, because it could relieve the dire humanitarian situation in besieged areas they control, and blamed Russia for undermining the truce.“The truce, as we have warned, and we told the (U.S.) State Department - will not hold out,” a senior rebel official in Aleppo said, pointing to the continued presence of a U.N. aid convoy at the Turkish border awaiting permission to enter.Rebels have also accused Russia of using the ceasefire to give the Syrian army and allied Shi’ite militias a chance to regroup and deploy forces ready for their own offensives.OVERNIGHT SHELLINGBoth sides have accused the other of being responsible for aid deliveries being stuck far from Aleppo, where army and rebel forces were supposed to pull back from the Castello Road which leads into besieged, insurgent-held eastern districts.Russia on Friday said the Syrian army had initially withdrawn but returned to its positions after being fired on by rebels, who in turn say they saw no sign of government forces ever leaving their positions.“There is no change,” Zakariya Malahifji, an official for a rebel group in Aleppo, said on Saturday when asked whether there had been any move by the army to withdraw from positions along the road.Syria’s government said it was doing all that was necessary for the arrival of aid to those in need in all parts of the country, particularly eastern Aleppo.Two convoys of aid for Aleppo have been waiting at the Turkish border for days. The U.N. has said both sides in the war are to blame for the delay of aid to Aleppo, where neither has yet withdrawn from the Castello Road.The government said the road was being fired on by rebels, so it could not give convoys a guarantee of safety. The rebels deny the accusation.Senior U.N. officials have accused the government of failing to provide letters to allow convoys to reach other besieged areas in Syria.(Additional reporting by Tom Perry in Beirut, Katya Golubkova and Andrew Osborn in Moscow, Olesya Astakhova in Bishkek, Phil Stewart in Split, Croatia, Patricia Zengerle in Washington, Michelle Nichols in New York and Humeyra Pamuk in Istanbul; Editing by Dominic Evans, Paul Simao and Mary Milliken)"

In one study, American students and Tamil speakers in India both called the angular shape on the left ""kiki"" and the curvy one on the right ""bouba.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57dc1ab3180000113cbd1e79.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A painter who hears noise in colors. A musician who sees sounds in shapes. People who taste words. These are just some examples of what it’s like to have synesthesia ― a condition where input received via one sense triggers a response from another sense, causing people to experience reduced boundaries between vision, hearing and other types of perception. Now, a study published Sept. 15 in the European Journal of Neuroscience suggests that simply having one type of synesthesia ― for example, seeing colors in letters of the alphabet ― is enough to blur the lines between other senses as well.“It shows that something about their synesthesia is spilling over into another domain,” Dr. Krish Sathian, a neurologist at Emory University, said in a press release.The findings may help researchers pin down the exact cause of synesthesia, which remains mysterious. Are the brains of people with synesthesia wired differently from everyone else’s? Or are they simply ordinary brains doing what ordinary brains do, only more intensely?We don’t yet have enough data to say for sure, but the new research suggests it may be the latter. Most people, even those without synesthesia, make some implicit associations between different sensory features. We describe people’s voices as “sharp” or “soft” as if they’re things we can touch. Or we talk of painting a room in “warm” colors.One famous example of these so-called cross-modal correspondences is the Bouba-Kiki effect, first observed by the psychologist Wolfgang Köhler in 1929. Experiments have shown that no matter what language someone speaks, he or she is more likely to assign the name “bouba” to a round-cornered shape and the name “kiki” to an angular shape than the other way around.“Some argue that these phenomena form a continuum, with classical synesthesia being an exaggeration of universal cross-modal correspondences,” the researchers note in this week’s paper. “Others contend that the two are quite different.” The people in the study had the most common form of synesthesia ― a type known as grapheme-color synesthesia, which causes people to perceive colors in letters and numbers.But during tests, the researchers found that these people are also more likely than their non-synesthete peers to make associations between shapes and meaningless words.“We conclude that synesthesia heightens universally experienced cross-modal correspondences,” the researchers said.Synesthesia is thought to be rare, but estimates are highly variable and unclear. Anecdotally the condition has been linked to creativity, with some research backing it up. One study in Australia found 24 percent of synesthetes to be involved in an artistic profession. Among the general population, this figure falls to just 2 percent.It may be possible to learn synesthesia, by consciously trying to associate different sensory modalities, to improve your memory and creativity.And some researchers argue that true synesthetes, too, have learned the associations during childhood. One study last year found a link between the colors that some people see in letters and the colors of a popular brand of refrigerator magnets. That might be hard for synesthetes to believe, however, since they often perceive the letters in highly irregular, complex and almost otherworldly hues. "

He is stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government, and temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform. He is unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief,” Gates wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Friday evening.Gates wrote that Trump was clueless when it came to the American military and foreign policy. Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin repeatedly, threatened to not defend NATO countries, said he would “bomb the shit” out of ISIS and seemed unfamiliar with Russia’s annexation of Crimea.“Mr. Trump is also willfully ignorant about the rest of the world, about our military and its capabilities, and about government itself. He disdains expertise and experience while touting his own—such as his claim that he knows more about ISIS than America’s generals,” Gates wrote. “He has no clue about the difference between negotiating a business deal and negotiating with sovereign nations.”Gates ran the CIA under President George H.W. Bush and served as defense secretary under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He wrote that all the leaders he served were smart enough to listen to their advisers ― even if they didn’t take their advice. Trump, he worried, would not.“The world we confront is too perilous and too complex to have as president a man who believes he, and he alone, has all the answers and has no need to listen to anyone. In domestic affairs, there are many checks on what a president can do; in national security there are few constraints,” he said. “A thin-skinned, temperamental, shoot-from-the-hip and lip, uninformed commander-in-chief is too great a risk for America.”Case in point: just last week, Trump threatened to start a war with Iran over hand gestures.Trump responded to Gates in a tweet Saturday morning, saying his leadership had been “a total disaster.” Gates, who has been critical of the Obama administration, wrote that Hillary Clinton still had time before the election to demonstrate her trustworthiness and show voters how she would deal with foreign policy issues in China, Russia, North Korea, Iran and the Middle East.Gates joins a number of national security officials ― Democrats and Republicans ― who have said Trump would make the United States less safe.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

In the first place, there's Donald Trump leading or tied in a number of national polls.

Individually, these stories are confounding, collectively they are appalling.   After Hillary Clinton fainted while leaving a 9/11 memorial event, it was revealed that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia a few days earlier and would, therefore, stay off the campaign trail for a few days until she regained her strength. Because Clinton hadn't made public her illness, until after the fainting spell, the press pounced on her denouncing penchant for privacy, secrecy, and whatever.   Now that charge has some merit and is reflected in polling which shows that Clinton is not seen as honest and trustworthy by a majority of American voters. This trust issue continues to plague Clinton and is, to some degree, responsible for her declining poll numbers. While that may be understandable, what is impossible to comprehend is how Trump becomes the beneficiary of her slide. The Republican nominee is, by far, the most dishonest, least transparent candidate to ever run for president. The health records he has revealed are a joke. He continues to withhold his tax returns. His business dealings are, at best, shady. And we now know that his much touted ""charitable giving"" is a scam--since many of the donations he claimed to have made were more often than not contributions that others funneled through him. Given Trump's record of dishonesty, his appeals to bigotry, the contradictory nature of the positions he has taken on critical issues, and his lack of experience in governance, how can one reasonably explain the fact that none of this seems to matter to the 42 or so percent of the electorate who say they would choose him as president over a person, who for all her flaws is without a doubt the most qualified candidate in the field. I have written extensively about ""Trumpism"" and the anger, fear, and deep trauma of the group of voters who propelled Trump onto the national stage. But I assumed that the majority of the American electorate would ultimately reject him. I can still hope (and work) that they will. That this race is tied is both confusing and worrisome. I shouldn't have been stunned when Congress passed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA). But I was. Congress frequently considers bills that are baseless, outrageous, and/or just plain dangerous. Because these efforts are often motivated by crass politics, they usually die as saner minds prevail.   In proposing this bill, Congress was preying on the deep residual pain resulting from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The legislation is premised on the notion that there was direct Arab governmental role in the attacks, despite the findings of the 9/11 Commission to the contrary. In fact, it is only because of the persistence of deep anti-Arab sentiment that some Members of Congress continued to advance the bill. By passing it and sending it to the President they are putting at risk US relations with important Arab allies and they are opening the door for other countries to pass similar legislation that could hold the US or Israel (with US support) accountable for their actions in the Middle East. While Congress often sees Arabs as soft targets that can be attacked with impunity, this legislation is clearly a step too far. Just as I assumed, that it would not pass, I am assuming that the Obama Administration will veto it and that his veto will not be overridden by Congress. Given the unpredictable climate, I am no longer sure of anything. The icing on the cake was the conclusion of a monumental disaster of an agreement--the 10 year, commitment to a $38 Billion military assistance package for Israel. Even though I understand politics--who has clout and who does not--this aid package is inexplicable and even dangerous. It rewards Netanyahu's efforts to sabotage the President's Iran Deal and his blocking of any movement toward Israeli-Palestinian peace. And it takes away any leverage the US may have had to restrain Israel's unconscionable behavior in the occupied territories. One would have thought that this President, after more than seven years of dealing with Netanyahu, has learned that by rewarding bad behavior he only enables it--allowing the Israeli leader to act with impunity.   If this were not troubling enough, the Administration's lame statement, accompanying the announcement of the deal, still advocating for two-states (which Netanyahu's policies have now buried) and decrying continued settlement expansion (which Israel routinely ignores), was embarrassing. And what I found deeply troubling was the statement that this massive demonstration of ""unprecedented support for Israel's security"" was being touted as part of this White House's proud legacy--a far cry, indeed, from the Middle East goals they had established seven years ago.All of this, defies reasonable explanation. That it all happened in a week (together, I might add, with the US/Russian ""Syrian peace deal"", that provides neither ""peace"" nor a ""deal"") left me stymied. Follow @jjz1600 for more. "

It goes back to hunger and poverty and the proverb stated by Ms. Ritchie. The answer lies in finance and economics, namely JOBS!!",2016-09-17,"BRUNSWICK, ME - JANUARY 26: Pieces of broccoli sit on a cutting board in the Brunswick kitchen of Christine Burns Rudalevige (cq) before she makes a broccoli stem and stilton soup for the Green Plate Special Tuesday, January 26, 2016. (Photo by Gabe Souza/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb108432100006401c71498.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Proverb: Give a man a fish he eats for a day. Teach a man how to fish and he eats for a lifetime. Many might think; this passage is straight from the bible or an ancient Chinese proverb, in fact it is neither. The proverb was actually coined by Anne Isabella Ritchie during the 1880's in a story she wrote titled Mrs. Dymond.  Its relevancy however seems so important today as we face alarming rates of poverty, homelessness and food insecurity. According to the United States statistics on hunger 45 million people fall into this category, which translates into 14% of the population. 19% are children, 8% senior.  Millions and millions of dollars are spent each year on hunger relief programs and organizations aimed at feeding the poor. Yet, as the economy grows it seems the rich continue to get rich and the poor, poorer while the middle class remains stagnant. I want to know do we really target the root cause of hunger?  When we talk about poverty, do we just talk about ways of ending it or do we have financial and economic programs and resources in place to deal with the problem?  As a person and farmer living in a low- income neighborhood the cost and the value of food comes into question. Each year in low -income neighborhoods across this country, money is put into programs and nonprofit organizations such as food pantries and soup kitchens to combat hunger. Granted, they offer tremendous help and support in feeding the needy. However; does charity in its greatest form really help to stem the tide of hunger and poverty? When people are constantly given free food at no cost, do we then devalue the true cost of food? These are questions I keep asking myself. As a farmer, I am up against such programs that have people to believe that my organically grown produce is too pricey or expensive. Heck, the fact that they can get a flat of strawberries or tomatoes free and I am asking them to pay for a pint or a pound of the same item does not make sense. For too long, the hunger and emergency food programs which were meant to be short-term solutions have become for some a way of life. In my neighborhood you can get free food each day from a local food pantry and or soup kitchen. It might not be the healthiest but it's there. People in low- income neighborhood have been institutionalized into thinking that free food is part of the system. It is a food system that has plagued our neighborhood with cheap food, fast food, junk food and processed food. Having us to believe that this is our way of eating, a way of life which is unacceptable. This brings me back to the real cost and value of food.  If you look at the real cost of food in my neighborhood you can see that it is associated with the high cost of diet-related diseases. Hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity and heart disease are leading the way to the high cost of health care. A health system of ongoing treatment in the long run is not sustainable. As for the value of food; marketing and advertisement is at its core. When we have people placing more value on buying a new pair of $200 sneakers verses the cost of a $2 freshly grown bunch of carrots. I have a problem with that. When someone can find $25 to put more minutes on his or her cellphone but question the fact that my $2/lb. collards are expensive. I again have a problem with that. When we have people placing more value on materialistic things rather than on food and water. I have a problem with that and I am angry. Somewhere, somehow, companies are making money on the backs of the poor and infirm and that money is not being re-invested in our communities.So how can we get from under this paradigm of the real cost and value of food? It goes back to hunger and poverty and the proverb stated by Ms. Ritchie. The answer lies in finance and economics, namely JOBS!!Imagine in low-income communities, with technology and businesses coming in and training people to run and manage their own enterprises. Imagine how it would look for folks to be paid a living wage job so that they can save and invest, buy a home or pay rent, send their children to the best school and finally being able to pay for healthy nutritious food. Why do we have to imagine it? Let's just do it! We have the resources, we have the technology and we have the people wanting the opportunity to get from under poverty and provide for their families.I know the answer may sound simplistic, but I do dare to dream and I dream big. If we continue to feed the poor without the ability to give them the financial resources needed to be self sufficient we fail, but if given the opportunity to have them own a business, or a living wage job we succeed. The fight against poverty and ending hunger will never be won with a handout; rather, it can be won through financial and economic self-sufficiency and determination.

Nina Rothe, ContributorCultural Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-irreverent-perfumer-e_b_12060014.html,,2016-09-17,2016-09-17-1474118657-3968288-ACollectionWithoutFear_ACelebrationofthe10thAnniversaryofEtatLibredOrangesWorksofArt.004.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-17-1474118657-3968288-ACollectionWithoutFear_ACelebrationofthe10thAnniversaryofEtatLibredOrangesWorksofArt.004-thumb.jpg," Etienne de Swardt and Chandler Burr, photo by Vanni BassettiLast year, at Pitti Fragranze in Florence, Chandler Burr ignited my passion for scent. This year, at the 14th edition of the world renowned fragrance fair, Etienne de Swardt made me fall in lust with perfume.Olfactory curator, former NY Times perfume critic, author and eighth art activist Burr was kind enough last year, when I attended my first Pitti Fragranze, to clarify that scent is a work of art. What I came away with was a quote that I now refer to every time I need to clear my head about perfume, smell and scent. Think of it as the written word equivalent of that little beaker of coffee beans one often finds at perfumeries around the world. Scent is something different from smell. Smell can invoke memories, like when you step into the Paris metro or off a plane in Bombay, but scent is an art form. And we lack the terminology to speak of it that way, we lack the right words but it doesn't mean it shouldn't be treated as such. So when I discovered a talk between Burr and self-proclaimed ""troublemaker and perfumer"" Etienne de Swardt, founder of Etat Libre d'Orange at Pitti Fragranze, I knew I had to listen in. I craved to listen to these two powerhouses of perfumes. Born in South Africa, sporting a lovely French accent and a rocking sense of humor, de Swardt talked about perfume with passion, simplicity and charisma. He described in particular a few of the scents included in his brand -- the name of which refers to a South African free state in the late 19th Century, a Boer utopia of sorts with its own currency and laws that came to an end in 1902. What attracted me to Etat Libre d'Orange is this idea of perfume, personal scent, as a story we tell to each person we meet, through our skin. Everything becomes much clearer this way, and suddenly the reason we love someone immediately, or despise someone else at that initial meeting, depends deeply from a subconscious decision our olfactory sense makes. It's very cinematic to me, this idea of falling in scent at first sight. Very rockstar too... And that makes sense in my world. During the fascinating talk, the perfumer described 'Jasmin et Cigarette' a combination of two familiar scents which he called, ""very Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich."" It was fascinating to hear from de Swardt the source of inspiration for the scent, which ranged from ""the film we discussed while making this was Blade Runner, the smoking scene,"" and the song ""Thanks for the Memory, by The Platters,"" which he admitted was also ""the code name for the scent.""Burr jumped in to give his own, colorful translation of the scent into words, by saying ""it could be a photograph, something that is done by a Cindy Sherman... It would be a woman, a young woman, a French woman or a New Yorker."" Burr also added, ""it's intentionally somewhat cheap jasmine, she sprays herself with this perfume and she has a date, so she goes down and sits at a cafe and she smokes."" 'Jasmin et Cigarette', he concluded, is ""a portrait of this woman, an image that is astonishingly clear and astonishingly realistic -- the cinematic story.""I can always get behind a cinematic story, and when it comes to perfume, it's a match made in heaven. Equally elusive to describe and yet so powerfully sensual. With the next fragrance presented, it was time for roses. 'Eau de Protection' is a fragrance inspired and created with the help of Rossy de Palma, the quirky Spanish actress best known for her work with Pedro Almodóvar in beauties like Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.While de Swardt described 'Eau de Protection' as ""dangerous and quite charming, possessing all the facets of the rose, and sweet chocolate,"" Burr found the hidden meaning of the fragrance. ""I smell desperation and violence and terrible suffering, there is nothing feminine about it,"" Burr said. He also added that there is a hint of metallic blood in the scent, and concluded that the fragrance itself ""is in a sense perverse because it takes violence and presents it to you as something beautiful.""With the next scent, 'Fat Electrician' came a backstory as outrageous as the title of a perfume which Burr called, ""easily, the most beautiful work of perfumery done in my life."" 'Fat Electrician' is vetiver scented and inspired by the lead of '70s arthouse film Pink Narcissus, gay porn star Bobby Kendall. One day, filmmaker James Bidgood said about Kendall ""oh, he now is a fat electrician in New Jersey,"" and the name stuck. Burr admitted he wears it all the time, because of its use of the main note, ""vetiver, one of the most beautiful materials around and this is the best description of vetivers around."" Instead, de Swardt provided the cinematic analogy for the scent, by saying that 'Fat Electrician' ""is a tragedy, we call it the curse of beauty, that's the definition of that perfume.""There is also a perfume, co-created with actress Tilda Swinton, called 'Like This' and inspired by Rumi's famous love poem by the same name. A mix of Moroccan Neroli, with roses, ginger, pumpkin and spices thrown in, it's the perfect interpretation of a poem by the one poet of the Middle East who could actually help us solve all our world problems -- if only we united in reading him. When describing his brand de Swardt said, ""we are a beautiful blend of confusion, we generate emotion; we are on the skin, we spray on, so we are superficial but we are fundamental."" Fundamental. It was perhaps that word by de Swardt -- along with this cinematic view I felt while listening to him talk with Burr -- which made me run to the Etat Libre d'Orange stand immediately afterward and spray on some 'Jasmin et Cigarette'. The fragrance smelled as perfectly wonderful as I expected it to, with a twist of course, and I now yearn to have a full bottle.

Nowhere is this more apparent than when looking at how the world responds to refugees and mass migration - an issue that leaves virtually no corner of the globe untouched.There are more people on the move today than ever before. A quarter of a billion have left their homes for new lives abroad. Sixty-five million have been displaced by war or persecution. The millions of people fleeing the devastating war in Syria have attracted considerable media attention over the past two years, but their plight mirrors that of countless others in less ""visible"" conflicts from Afghanistan to Congo or the vicious gang violence in Central America that has driven so many to seek safety in the United States.In this context, the fact that the United Nations is convening a special summit on refugees and migration during the high-level week of its General Assembly in New York, and that President Barack Obama will chair a donor summit the following day is very welcome. These are two moments for the world to come together and move beyond warm words to concrete actions that will help the most vulnerable people. Because for all the summits and deliberations of recent years, it is clear that the world can - and must - do more to protect refugees and migrants, and ensure that their basic human rights are respected in the process.This is the key message of a new report The Elders have just issued. Entitled ""In Challenge Lies Opportunity: How the world must respond to refugees and mass migration"", it sets out four key principles that we believe must be at the heart of a coherent international response: better coordinated response mechanisms to large flows of people; enhanced assistance to major refugee-hosting countries; increased resettlement opportunities and additional pathways for refugees; and respect for human rights and protection.The heads of state meeting in New York this week have a responsibility to prove that they take these matters seriously, and reject the politics of prejudice and populism that are proving all too resonant on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond.As Kofi Annan, Chair of The Elders, said on his recent visit to Germany to discuss these issues with top government officials, the solution to increased numbers of refugees can never be walls, fences or militarised borders.Prosperous countries of the world must show genuine compassion and shoulder their fair share of the burden of hosting refugees. How can it be fair that a tiny country like Lebanon, with a population of only 4 million people, hosts at least 1.5 million refugees, when some much wealthier European countries quibble about even receiving a few thousand?But equally, states in the developing world need to assume their own responsibilities. Leaders need to be held to account for the dire social, economic and human rights situations that cause so many of their citizens to flee abroad, believing there is no prospect of peace or security in their homeland. Addressing the root causes of flight is the key, not treating the symptoms.Pakistan, my home country, has been host to over three million refugees from Afghanistan ever since the Soviet invasion nearly 40 years ago. Most of these poor people have been languishing in squalid urban camps for decades - as, I should add, have millions of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Gaza and of course Syria, where they now find themselves victims of yet another war.This week in New York, leaders at the United Nations - in particular, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council who have the heaviest responsibility - must demonstrate their willingness to prioritise saving lives over political rivalries, whether in Syria, Ukraine or other conflicts too often seen through the prism of realpolitik than that of protecting civilians.Only a concerted international approach guided by the principles of solidarity, human rights and respect can deliver a durable solution Failure to rise to the challenge will only exacerbate the plethora of refugee crises the world faces today which in turn will further worsen global stability.The founder of The Elders, Nelson Mandela, saw this all too clearly when discussing refugee problems in Africa in 1997. His words still resonate today and will continue to inform The Elders' engagement on refugees and migration in the months and years ahead:""Unresolved refugee problems become a source of instability, violence and further population displacements. Dealing with these problems is inextricably linked to achieving peace, upholding the rule of law and entrenching a human rights culture and democracy.""Hina Jilani is a member of The Elders, the independent group of former leaders founded by Nelson Mandela who work for peace and human rights. This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post to mark the occasion of two critical conferences at the UN on the Refugee and Migrant crisis: the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants (Sept. 19th, a UN conference) and the Leaders Summit on Refugees (Sept. 20th, hosted by U.S. Pres.

But neither met the threshold of having 15 percent of support in national polls.Johnson averaged only 8.4 percent, and Stein came in at 3.2 percent, according to the commission. The exclusion from the debate delivers a heavy blow to two third-party presidential bids that had hoped to sell themselves as viable alternatives to Clinton and Trump, both of whom suffer from notoriously low favorability ratings.“I would say I am surprised that the CPD has chosen to exclude me from the first debate, but I’m not,” Johnson said in a statement Friday, adding, “Americans are tired of rigged systems, and the monopoly on debates created by the CPD is a prime and skillfully executed example.”Johnson was in the news recently after giving an MSNBC interview in which he appeared to have no idea what Aleppo was. (The city in Syria has become a center of that country’s civil war and its refugee crisis.)Meanwhile, Stein and her running mate, Ajamu Baraka, are facing charges after protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline last week.

Trump made the comments to The Washington Post in an article that came out just 20 minutes before Obama, the first black president, took the stage at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Gala, so Obama may not have seen them. But Clinton, who spoke next, clearly did. “He was asked one more time where was President Obama born, and he still wouldn’t say Hawaii. He still wouldn’t say America,” she said to the crowd of mostly Latinos. “This man wants to be our next president?” she asked. “When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry? Now, he’s tried to reset himself and his campaign many times. This is the best he can do. This is who he is.” Clinton and Obama both spoke at the gala about the need to renounce Trump and his divisive rhetoric. Clinton pointed to not only Trump’s latest birther comments, but also his attacks on a pastor in Flint, Michigan, and numerous anti-Latino and anti-immigrant comments. The goal was to inspire Latinos, who support Clinton over Trump by large margins, to vote for both her and the down-ballot candidates who can help her enact her agenda, including the comprehensive immigration reform that she has promised.“We need to decide who we are,” Clinton said. “If we just sigh and shake our heads and accept this, then what does that tell our kids about who we are? We need to stand up and repudiate this divisive rhetoric. We need to stop him conclusively in November in an election that sends a message that even he can hear.”Obama implored the crowd earlier in the evening to ensure that Trump’s brand of politics doesn’t win. “I know there are a lot of folks who have this notion of what the ‘real America’ looks like. Somehow it only includes a few of us,” Obama said. “But who’s going to decide who the real America is? Who’s to determine that in this nation of immigrants — in a nation where unless you are a Native American, you came here from someplace else — that you have a greater claim than anybody here?”He got an especially warm reception at an event where he was heckled over immigration just two years earlier. There were boos when he said it was his last time at the event as president, and someone interrupted him by yelling, “I love you,” earning them an “I love you, too” from the president. But the biggest applause was for Obama’s praise for immigrants.“It’s young people like that that keep me going,” Obama said. “Folks who prove that immigrants aren’t somehow changing the American character, immigrants are the American character.”The Trump campaign later released a statement saying the Republican nominee believes Obama was born in the United States, while still praising Trump’s past questions about the president’s citizenship.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
