0,POLITICS,Obama To Announce New Climate Change Help For Island Nations,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-climate-change_us_57c855dee4b0e60d31dda9bd,The announcement signals a changing tone on the need to deal with climate impacts already underway.,2016-09-01,"President Barack Obama disembarks from Air Force One in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Wednesday. He'll head to the remote Midway Atoll on Thursday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c85648160000ef1bc00017.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Barack Obama on Thursday will announce $40 million in programs to help island nations and other communities vulnerable to climate change.Obama addressed the Pacific Island Conference of Leaders and the World Conservation Congress in Honolulu on Wednesday night. On Thursday, he is speaking from the remote coral reef Midway Atoll, where he will announce programs to both help nations react to climate-related changes and relocate people when it becomes necessary.After the Midway visit, Obama is heading to China to attend the G20 summit this weekend ― where he and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to formally join the climate agreement reached in Paris last year. The Pacific announcement on Thursday “shows the administration’s ongoing commitment to not only working with the large emitters ― the world’s largest, in the case of China ― but also importance of working with some of the smallest and most vulnerable in the world,” a White House official, speaking on background ahead of the announcements, told The Huffington Post.The new programs include a new USAID Climate Ready Program, which will direct $9 million toward helping governments develop policies that “promote resilience, enhance access to climate finance, and improve national capacity to manage and monitor adaptation programs.” Those countries include Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.The U.S. also said it would direct up to $5 million to Pacific regional organizations through the Institutional Strengthening in Pacific Island Countries to Adapt to Climate Change (ISACC) program, and $15 million toward disaster-risk reduction initiatives in the region.The White House’s Council on Environmental Quality will also co-host a “Symposium on Climate Displacement, Migration, and Relocation” in December 2016 in Hawaii. The White House official said the efforts signal that the Obama administration is prioritizing helping countries adapt to climate shifts already underway, rather than just focusing on efforts to cut emissions driving the problem. “These announcements are a sign that we are not only not shying away from that conversation, but we’re actively embracing it,” said the official. The official said that the symposium discussion will also focus on climate relocation and adaptation needs in the U.S., where Alaskan native villages and coastal Louisiana communities are already working on relocation due to erosion and sea level rise. “We will be talking about our issues as well,” he said.“I think there’s both a realization of what’s happening, and the pace at which climate change is forcing these conversations. That grows every year, and every month as we see the impact of climate change,” said the official. “I think the goal that we set out last year in Paris to attempt to limit climate change to well less than 2 degrees in terms of temperatures rises ― even in that world there will be major relocations and dislocations.”The announcement “builds on the deep partnership that President Obama forged with island leaders when they worked together on the historic Paris agreement last year,” said Brian Deese, senior adviser to the president, in a statement. “As the President told Pacific Island leaders last night, their leadership was a key part of reaching a global climate agreement, and our partnership going forward will be a key part of winning the fight against climate change.”"
1,POLITICS,Virginia Republicans Seem Determined To Not Let Thousands Of Ex-Felons Vote In November,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/virginia-terry-mcauliffe-felons-vote_us_57c81f9be4b0a22de0941e95,They're asking the state Supreme Court to hold Gov. Terry McAuliffe in contempt.,2016-09-01,Did Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) violate the state constitution with his latest attempt to re-enfranchise those who have paid their debts to society? Virginia Republicans think so.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c822cc170000172ac76efa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What the governor giveth, the state Supreme Court taketh away. And so the governor giveth again ― but maybe not for long.Republican lawmakers in Virginia are asking the state’s high court to hold Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) in contempt for not adhering to an earlier ruling that declared his attempt to restore voting rights to 200,000 ex-felons unconstitutional.After the Virginia Supreme Court, on a 4-to-3 vote, said in July that McAuliffe’s order went beyond his clemency powers under the state’s constitution, the governor gave it a second shot in late August ― this time individually issuing restoration orders for 13,000 people who had their voting registrations canceled by the court.“I am not content to condemn them for eternity as inferior and second-class citizens,” he said of those men and women affected, all of whom had completed their sentences and had reregistered to vote following McAuliffe’s earlier decree.Now Virginia Republicans want these individual orders held invalid, too, arguing Wednesday that the governor’s move is merely a political power play and an affront to the Virginia Supreme Court.“In announcing last week his new plan to unilaterally re-enfranchise 206,000 felons, Governor McAuliffe again expressed his disdain for this Court’s decision,” read the lawmakers’ filing with the court.Lawyers for the GOP legislators told the court that “the purpose, scope, and effect of his new process is precisely the same” as the one McAuliffe employed in April, and that it’s equally unlawful because none of the former offenders who received the benefit had requested that their civil rights be restored.McAuliffe dismissed the Virginia GOP’s move and said he had “established a process that is fully consistent with the ruling as well as the precedent of past governors.”“Our ongoing fight to restore Virginians’ rights is about one thing: Moving our Commonwealth into the mainstream of American states where people who serve their time reenter society as full citizens again,” he said in a statement Wednesday.McAuliffe added that the GOP’s legal effort is simply designed to “intimidate and disenfranchise” voters who might otherwise turn the tide against the Republican Party’s presidential nominee.“The people who have filed it are more concerned with the impact new voters could have on Donald Trump’s campaign than they are with the dignity of the people whom they continue to drag through the mud with their political lawsuits and ugly attacks,” the governor said.John Whitbeck, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, called McAuliffe’s new wave of orders a “mail merge” operation to try and get Hillary Clinton ― a close friend whose presidential campaign McAuliffe ran in 2008 ― elected.He also said he and his party had hoped McAuliffe “would see the error of his ways” and do as the state’s high court had instructed. “Sadly, we were wrong,” Whitbeck said in a statement.In April, The Atlantic chronicled the racist origins of Virginia’s felon disenfranchisement laws.Clarification: Language has been updated to indicate that Republican lawmakers, not the state party, are bringing the contempt action against McAuliffe."
2,POLITICS,Democrats See Social Security As Edge In Tight Senate Races,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-social-security-senate-races_us_57c8a743e4b0a22de095437c,Control of the upper chamber hangs in the balance this November.,2016-09-01,Former Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold (D) is ahead in a race to take back his old Senate seat. He has emphasized his support for Social Security expansion.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If Donald Trump’s unpopularity is not enough to sweep them into office, Democrats in key Senate races are hoping Social Security expansion will do the trick.Nine Democratic Senate candidates are campaigning on their support for increasing Social Security benefits: Sen. Michael Bennet in Colorado; Sen. Patty Murray in Washington; Kamala Harris in California; Russ Feingold in Wisconsin; Rep. Tammy Duckworth in Illinois; Ted Strickland in Ohio; Ann Kirkpatrick in Arizona; Deborah Ross in North Carolina; and Patty Judge in Iowa.The widespread use of Social Security expansion as a campaign talking point in close Senate contests reflects the degree to which the politics of Social Security have changed in recent years. Even if Democrats’ evolution on Social Security fails to win them control of the Senate, it is all but certain to achieve another progressive priority: ruling out a bipartisan budget deal to cut the program in the next Congress.The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, an online liberal group, solicited original statements from the candidates about why they back Social Security expansion and publicized them in a press release on Thursday.The candidates’ statements, with rare exception, mark the first time they are on the record backing Social Security expansion, according to PCCC.“Years of progressive activism led to this moment,” PCCC co-founder Stephanie Taylor said in a statement touting the news. “With Hillary Clinton and Senate candidates campaigning on the expansion of Social Security benefits to keep up with the rising costs faced by our seniors, it’s clear that the center of gravity has shifted in the Democratic Party in a more populist direction.”Some of the Democratic candidates campaigning on Social Security expansion ― like Judge and Kirkpatrick ― still face long odds in their battles to unseat Republican incumbents. Others in the cohort ― such as Harris and Bennet ― appear almost guaranteed to win.But for candidates like Ross in North Carolina, who is trailing Burr by just 2 percentage points, according to HuffPost Pollster, an issue like Social Security could make a difference. And victories in just a handful of Senate contests could restore Democrats’ control of the upper chamber. As of late August, Democrats had a 55 percent chance of retaking the Senate come November, according to a HuffPost Pollster analysis. It is not hard to see why Democrats are at least partly pinning their hopes on Social Security. Unlike means-tested social programs often derided as handouts to undeserving people, Social Security enjoys strong support among Republicans as well as Democrats. More than two-thirds of Republicans at least oppose cutting Social Security’s benefits, according to a Pew poll released in March.Until recently, however, Democrats were more concerned that opposing Social Security cuts would make them seem like they were soft on debt. For many years, President Barack Obama doggedly sought a so-called Grand Bargain with Republicans that would have cut Social Security in exchange for revenue hikes. But an improving economy, which reduced deficits, and persistent progressive activism that framed Social Security benefits as inadequate for an impending retirement income crisis, led to a tidal change in the party’s view of the program. Social Security will not be able to pay out all of its promised benefits by 2034 if nothing is done to address its long-term funding gap. Progressives support closing the gap through revenue increases, which they argue can also finance some benefit increases. Conservatives favor closing the funding gap primarily through gradual benefit cuts.Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton promised not to cut Social Security in February, saying instead that she supports expanding it. (Obama followed suit, embracing benefits expansion in a June speech.)Republican standard-bearer Donald Trump has said he would not to cut the program."

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it is running out of funds to fight the virus.The current Zika outbreak, first detected in Brazil last year, has rapidly spread across the Americas.Florida officials said more than 40,000 mosquitoes had been tested since May, and that the three samples were the first to test positive.“It means that there is a substantial amount of Zika virus in that population because it’s actually not easy to find the virus in the mosquitoes that you trap,” said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville.Zika infection in pregnant women can cause the rare birth defect known as microcephaly, which can lead to serious developmental problems, and has also been linked to severe fetal brain abnormalities.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot and Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Frances Kerry)"
4,HEALTHY LIVING,Study Finds Strong Link Between Zika And Guillain-Barre Syndrome,"Julie Steenhuysen, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/study-find-strong-link-between-zika-and-guillain-barre-syndrome_us_57c8ad8be4b078581f125668,"Guillain-Barre causes gradual weakness and in some cases, temporary paralysis.",2016-09-01,"Compared with pre-Zika rates, Guillain-Barre syndrome increased 172 percent in the state of Bahia, Brazil, which was hard hit by the Zika outbreak.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c8ae5c180000b429bcebd3.jpeg?cache=J0nDp7z6QT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A comparison of rates of Guillain-Barre syndrome before and after Zika arrived in seven countries has found a strong association between the virus and the illness, researchers from the Pan American Health Organization said on Wednesday.The current Zika outbreak was first detected in Brazil last year and has since spread across the Americas and the Caribbean.Pregnant women are considered to be at greatest risk because the virus can cause severe birth defects, including microcephaly, which is marked by small head size and underdeveloped brains. In Brazil, Zika has been linked to more than 1,800 cases of microcephaly.The first alarms over Zika in Brazil, however, occurred months before microcephaly cases emerged, as adults recovering from Zika infections appeared to have higher-than-normal rates of Guillain-Barre, an autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks itself in the aftermath of an infection, typically occurring in the days following an illness.In a report published as a letter to the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Marcos Espinal, director of the department of communicable disease at PAHO - the regional arm of the World Health Organization - and colleagues analyzed rates of Guillain-Barre syndrome and Zika in Bahia, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Suriname and Venezuela.They evaluated a total of 164,237 confirmed and suspected cases of Zika virus disease and 1,474 cases of Guillain-Barre that occurred between April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016, using data collected through official country reports.Their analysis found a close association between increases in Zika cases and increases in Guillain-Barre. As Zika infections waned in a country, incidence of Guillain-Barre waned as well, the team found.Compared with pre-Zika rates, Guillain-Barre increased 172 percent in the state of Bahia, Brazil, which was hard hit by the Zika outbreak. They saw similar increases in other countries, with Guillain-Barre cases rising 211 percent in Colombia, 150 percent in the Dominican Republic, 100 percent in El Salvador, 144 percent in Honduras, 400 percent in Suriname and 877 percent in Venezuela.The team found no link between Guillain-Barre and dengue, a closely related virus that had been suspected as a contributor to the increase in cases.Based on their findings, the researchers said Zika and Guillain-Barre “are strongly associated,” however, they said more study is needed to prove direct causation.Guillain-Barre causes gradual weakness in the legs, arms and upper body, and in some cases, temporary paralysis. Patients often require intensive care and a respirator to support breathing.Given these demands, the researchers said Zika imposes “a substantial burden” on populations in Latin America and the Caribbean, where some 500 million people are at risk.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Bernard Orr)"

The two men met privately on Wednesday, and their stories about the interaction differed.Trump told reporters at a press conference that they “did not discuss payment of the wall” he has promised to build if he wins the general election. But Peña Nieto’s spokesman said later that the president began the meeting by saying Mexico would not pay for the wall.Peña Nieto said so again Wednesday evening. “At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made it clear that Mexico would not pay for the wall,” he tweeted in Spanish.He also said in an op-ed for El Universal on Thursday that he told Trump he was offended by the things the candidate has said about Mexicans, and that his country would not pay for a wall. Trump wasn’t having it. While delivering a speech in Phoenix Wednesday night, Trump called the Mexican president “a man I like and respect very much” but dismissed his words about a wall. “Mexico will pay for the wall, 100 percent,” Trump said during his speech. “They don’t know it yet, but they’re going to pay for the wall.”He said the structure would be “an impenetrable, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall” with technology to keep people from digging tunnels or going over it. “Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it,” he said. “And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today. I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I’m sure they will.”He stuck to that message early Thursday, prompting the latest Twitter response from Peña Nieto that afternoon.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified the order of the tweets from Peña Nieto and Trump.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

I say let’s keep them, and get rid of discrimination,"" says Colombian transgender activist Ophelia Pastrana.

To read this article in Spanish from HuffPost Mexico, click here.Things seem to be looking up for Mexico’s LGBT community. Lawmakers have passed a series of anti-discrimination laws in recent years to protect gay rights, and President Enrique Peña Nieto has proposed constitutional reforms to legalize same-sex marriage across the country. Legal progress has not eliminated acts of violence against members of the LGBT community, however, and transgender women have suffered the most in recent years. A report co-published by New York’s Cornell University Law School and California-based civil rights organization, the Transgender Law Center in May 2016 shows that Mexico has one of the world’s highest rates of transphobic violence — including harassment, hate crimes and murder. The report estimates a total of 120 transphobic murders happened in the country between 2008 and late 2013.Ophelia Pastrana, a tall, red-haired transgender woman with an infectious laugh, is among a growing movement of activists working to empower Mexico’s gay and trans community. Her YouTube channel, where she regularly delves into trans issues, attract tens of thousands of viewers. Openly discussing her personal experiences is one of the ways Pastrana aims to inspire other trans women ― but she wasn’t always as outspoken. Born in Bogota, Colombia, as Mauricio, she remembers beings a shy boy that everyone would pick on. “Sometimes I tease people and say, ‘If you felt fat in high school, well, I was a boy!’” she tells HuffPost Mexico.  The 34-year-old started to transition six years ago, facing a number of challenges along the way. “I had to deal with a teenager’s dilemmas when I was 28,” she says. Back then, she had already completed a Master’s degree and was running two digital media companies, one of which was her own. She wasn’t as concerned with her career ― which she managed to maintain as she settled into her new gender identity ― as she was with her social life, which suffered when she came out. “Many people turned away from me because of silly little things,” she explains, recalling how her relatives, friends and co-workers reacted when they saw her in high heels and a skirt instead of a suit and tie.  Pastrana believes that society’s aversion to transgender women can be explained by widespread misogyny and “hatred of everything feminine.” But while some transgender activists work to shed light on the suffering endured by transgender women, Pastrana’s activism focuses on helping members of the community embrace their bodies and work on achieving self-love.In addition to her digital activism on various platforms, Pastrana has opened up her house in the south of Mexico City to host transgender people. She has become an informal counselor and spokeswoman for the LGBT community, offering valuable advice for trans women battling societal prejudice and intolerance. “You have to work on your self-esteem,” she says. “Let them say whatever you want! They tell me, ‘You look like a man.’ Well, it doesn’t matter to me if you think so!” Pastrana is unnerved by society’s prevailing beauty standards, she explains, since they make transgender women believe that they need to “try a little harder” to be pretty. “Many transgender people live frustrated because they are not pretty.

To read this article in Spanish from HuffPost Mexico, click here.Things seem to be looking up for Mexico’s LGBT community. Lawmakers have passed a series of anti-discrimination laws in recent years to protect gay rights, and President Enrique Peña Nieto has proposed constitutional reforms to legalize same-sex marriage across the country. Legal progress has not eliminated acts of violence against members of the LGBT community, however, and transgender women have suffered the most in recent years. A report co-published by New York’s Cornell University Law School and California-based civil rights organization, the Transgender Law Center in May 2016 shows that Mexico has one of the world’s highest rates of transphobic violence — including harassment, hate crimes and murder. The report estimates a total of 120 transphobic murders happened in the country between 2008 and late 2013.Ophelia Pastrana, a tall, red-haired transgender woman with an infectious laugh, is among a growing movement of activists working to empower Mexico’s gay and trans community. Her YouTube channel, where she regularly delves into trans issues, attract tens of thousands of viewers. Openly discussing her personal experiences is one of the ways Pastrana aims to inspire other trans women ― but she wasn’t always as outspoken. Born in Bogota, Colombia, as Mauricio, she remembers beings a shy boy that everyone would pick on. “Sometimes I tease people and say, ‘If you felt fat in high school, well, I was a boy!’” she tells HuffPost Mexico.  The 34-year-old started to transition six years ago, facing a number of challenges along the way. “I had to deal with a teenager’s dilemmas when I was 28,” she says. Back then, she had already completed a Master’s degree and was running two digital media companies, one of which was her own. She wasn’t as concerned with her career ― which she managed to maintain as she settled into her new gender identity ― as she was with her social life, which suffered when she came out. “Many people turned away from me because of silly little things,” she explains, recalling how her relatives, friends and co-workers reacted when they saw her in high heels and a skirt instead of a suit and tie.  Pastrana believes that society’s aversion to transgender women can be explained by widespread misogyny and “hatred of everything feminine.” But while some transgender activists work to shed light on the suffering endured by transgender women, Pastrana’s activism focuses on helping members of the community embrace their bodies and work on achieving self-love.In addition to her digital activism on various platforms, Pastrana has opened up her house in the south of Mexico City to host transgender people. She has become an informal counselor and spokeswoman for the LGBT community, offering valuable advice for trans women battling societal prejudice and intolerance. “You have to work on your self-esteem,” she says. “Let them say whatever you want! They tell me, ‘You look like a man.’ Well, it doesn’t matter to me if you think so!” Pastrana is unnerved by society’s prevailing beauty standards, she explains, since they make transgender women believe that they need to “try a little harder” to be pretty. “Many transgender people live frustrated because they are not pretty. I know some who started transitioning, ended up not being the beautiful women they had imagined, and then de-transitioned,” she says. Pastrana is intent on pushing transgender women to achieve their full potential, and tries to alert them to any self-imposed limitations. “Whenever a person says, ‘If I come out, they’ll fire me,’ they are self-discriminating,” Pastrana says. “I tell them, ‘You have not been fired. The only person who has fired you is in your own head.’”Pastrana admits that she hasn’t always found it easy to be confident, but she continues to figure out ways to push herself. “This is going to sound very Michael Jackson of me, but to deal with self-empowerment,” she says, “I ultimately had to look myself in the mirror and say, ‘I’m gonna make a change.’” "

To read this article in Spanish from HuffPost Mexico, click here.Hundreds of thousands of disenchanted Venezuelans are marching in the capital, Caracas, Thursday, as part of a campaign by the opposition to push the national electoral council to speedily hold a referendum so that citizens can decide if they want President Nicolás Maduro to stay in power.The mass rally comes at a time when Venezuelans are desperate for change in their country — which is currently experiencing its worst economic depression in more than 200 years, soaring crime rates and a shortage of basic goods.“There’s been a collapse in Venezuela, an economic, social and political crisis,” Lilian Tintori, a Venezuelan human rights activist and the wife of Leopoldo López, a hardline opposition leader put behind bars in 2015 for “inciting violence” during protests, told HuffPost Mexico.“And the worst of it is that there is no medicine or food,” Tintori said in a phone conversation from the city of Barinas, where she was mobilizing for the peaceful march to Caracas.Together with other Venezuelan activists, Tintori has been demanding the recall referendum since March, but the national electoral council has repeatedly put it off. Stalling the process is in the ruling party’s best interest — if the vote is delayed until January, even if Maduro is toppled his vice president, a Socialist party member, would retain the right to serve out his term, which ends in 2019. An earlier referendum date — the scenario the opposition is hoping for — would bring about fresh elections. Polls indicate that an overwhelming majority of citizens would opt to vote Maduro out of power.“We want a change of government and a change of system. We want new people, leaders who are respected by Venezuelans, and, most importantly, who are democratic,” Tintori said. The current protests calling for “la salida” or the exit of Maduro have been preceded by waves of dissent criticizing the regime’s failure to address corruption, security challenges and economic struggles.Maduro’s popularity has continued to plummet as citizens stand in mile-long lines to access nearly empty supermarkets, endure power outages and struggle to make ends meet. “To feed a family of four, you need 16 minimum wages,” Tintori explained.In addition to her work defending López and other political prisoners, Tintori has also called on the government to open a humanitarian channel that would allow international aid, including medical supplies, to reach those in need. Her efforts have fallen on deaf ears, however. “Nicolas Maduro’s government doesn’t want to open a humanitarian channel because it still does not acknowledge that there is a crisis,” she said. Refusing to declare a state of emergency means that supplies from international aid organizations can’t enter the country.Thursday’s mass protest aims to make a public show of the people’s anger. In a recent interview with Venezuelan radio station RCM, manager of polling firm DatinCorp Jesus Seguías estimated that 34 percent of Caracas’ residents — 1,258,000 people — would attend the march. Members of indigenous tribes from the Amazonian state have also made their way to the capital to show their discontent and demand Maduro’s ouster.The government’s history of putting down mass protests has made it difficult for the opposition to mobilize the public in recent years. In 2014, protests called for by hardline opposition leaders López, Antonio Ledezma and Maria Corina Machado were met with police retaliation, leaving 43 dead.López is currently serving a 14-year sentence for his role in organizing and taking part in the deadly protests. Tintori says he is staying strong, despite enduring physical and psychological abuse.“Leopoldo is resisting; he is holding on,” Tintori said. “He tells me, ‘Lilian, they can put me in a shoebox, but I will not bow down and I will not compromise on my freedom, because my freedom is Venezuela’s freedom.’”Since his imprisonment, Tintori has met with international figures, including Vice President Joseph Biden, Mexican Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, to ask for their support for the release of her husband and other political prisoners.Amnesty International has deemed López a “prisoner of conscience,” and has called for his immediate release. “Leopoldo López is the victim of a vicious ‘witch hunt’ against anyone who dares to disagree with the Venezuelan government,” Carolina Jiménez, Americas deputy director for research at Amnesty International said earlier this month.“It’s been difficult,” said Tintori, who has two children. “I have to stand up for my Leopoldo and others, and tell the world what is happening in Venezuela.”“There are thousands of Venezuelan families separated by exile and displacement who are fleeing from the lack of security, the government and the theft of their lands or companies,” she added. “Every day, I try to find comfort in the thought that all these families, my own included, will meet very soon.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c898dc160000ef1bc00183.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Canada has officially launched a national inquiry into its sobering epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women, or MMIW― a move many hope will shed light on an issue shrouded in decades of confusion and political inaction.Echoed by activists nationwide, indigenous families’ repeated pleas for a formal investigation into the violent deaths and disappearances of female loved ones seem to have fallen on deaf ears over the years, despite troubling statistics highlighting the urgency of the crisis. Sixteen percent of Canada’s female homicide victims in recent decades were indigenous, even though their demographic, which is “disproportionately affected by all forms of violence,” comprises only 4 percent of the nation’s female population, the government notes on its website.Canada’s national and federal police force, the RCMP, released a shocking report in 2014 concluding that indigenous women in the country were nearly seven times more likely to be murdered than non-indigenous women.The findings also revealed that between 1980 and 2013, 1,181 indigenous women in Canada went missing or had been murdered. Of those cases, 225 remain unsolved with the cause of disappearance or death listed simply as “unknown” or “foul play suspected.”These figures have been widely disputed, with several women’s rights advocacy groups like Native Women’s Association of Canada asserting there are actually thousands more Canadian indigenous women who are missing or slain.The NWAC acquired research that suggests the RCMP failed to document almost 3,000 additional MMIW cases in its report, Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett pointed out in February.While in office, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper repeatedly denied public requests for an official MMIW inquiry, saying “we are way past the time for further study.” His Conservative government’s “failure” to adequately address the crisis yielded harsh backlash from critics, including the United Nations Human Rights Committee.Harper’s successor, Justin Trudeau, vowed during his election campaign to prioritize the issue.Almost one year after Trudeau’s election in October 2015, his promised MMIW inquiry is underway, although the federal government is not directly involved at this stage. A panel of appointed independent commissioners will conduct a nearly $54 million investigation before presenting their final recommendations to the government by the end of 2018.The commissioners’ approach will include reviewing existing literature on the issue, and listening to affected indigenous families and survivors of violence in a way that is “trauma-informed and culturally-appropriate.” Their ultimate objective is to analyze the root causes behind the MMIW epidemic by “looking for patterns and underlying factors that explain why higher levels of violence occur.”The inquiry began Thursday, but Chief Commissioner Marion Buller, British Columbia’s first female indigenous judge, told Canadians not to expect major results in the near future due to the intimate nature of the process. Information about the committee and its work is limited currently, but it will establish its own office and website at some point.In addition to the independent inquiry, the Canadian Department of Justice is allocating $16.17 million over four years for new Family Information Liaison Units in each province and territory to provide resources and support to those affected by the MMIW crisis.

The region ― which includes the dozens of African countries located south of the Sahara desert ― currently accounts for about half of children living in extreme poverty worldwide. The World Bank classifies people as being in extreme poverty if they live on less than $1.90 a day. The region’s poor have further to go than others when it comes to “crossing” above the extreme poverty line. Sub-Saharan Africa also faces high levels of inequality and is in a much earlier stage of demographic transition than other areas ― meaning it still experiences high birth and death rates ― according to the report.The region has succeeded in significantly reducing its child mortality rate, yet fertility rates remain high by international standards. Though reducing extreme poverty will require a multi-pronged approach, increasing access to family planning is a critical element, per the report.Women in the region have an average of 4.7 children. That’s twice the number in South Asia, for example. One-quarter of women of reproductive age in the area say they have unmet needs for family planning. Family planning addresses a number of issues. For one, those programs can help to free up government resources.Every dollar spent on family planning can save governments up to $6, which can be spent on improving health, housing, water and other public services, according to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which works to bring contraception to women and girls in need. Getting contraception into the hands of adolescents is particularly crucial, since delaying pregnancy increases their chances of pursuing education and economic opportunities.But part of the issue on that front is figuring out how to effectively address child marriage.About 12 percent of girls in sub-Saharan Africa marry before they turn 15, and 40 percent wed before 18. Four countries in the region have the highest child marriage rates worldwide. In India, by contrast, which has the 10th highest child marriage rate in the world, 47 percent of girls are married before they turn 18, according to Girls Not Brides, a nonprofit that works to end child marriage. One way to combat child marriage and teen pregnancy is to incentivize girls to stay in school. Providing cash transfers for those who continue to pursue their education has been proven to help reduce the social and economic pressures surrounding child marriage, the report recommends. Still, even when contraception is made available, and women and girls know where to access it, they still often avoid it because of the stigma associated with the issue.“Women in the developing world will tell you they cannot use condoms,” Melinda Gates told The New York Times in 2013. “They can’t negotiate a condom even in their marriage because they’re either suggesting their husband has AIDS or that they do.”The Gates Foundation is one of a number of groups working to dispel those stereotypes, address other related issues among the world’s poorest and identify implementable solutions. By 2020, the organization has committed to bringing high-quality contraceptive information, service and supplies to an additional 120 million women and girls in the most underserved countries. "

In July, there were 1,920 arrivals.The number of people coming to Greece fell off sharply after Turkey agreed in March to take back asylum seekers who arrived on Greek shores.The report from the IOM also notes that 3,601 people reached Greece between July 15 ― the day of the attempted coup in Turkey ― and Aug. 28.An official from the United Nations’ refugee agency told The Guardian this week that in the wake of the coup attempt, Turkey has put its deal with the EU in jeopardy by withdrawing supervising Turkish officers from the Greek islands and not allowing the UN access to the two main Turkish deportation centers that house returning refugees.And after Greek authorities documented 462 arrivals by sea between Aug. 29 and 30, with most people coming to the islands of Lesbos and Kos, fresh worries about an imminent collapse of the Turkey deal resurfaced among Greek media.But a spokesman for Greece’s minister of migration said those concerns seem to be unfounded, for now.“We are watching the situation very closely, but so far we don’t observe the sort of change which would imply that there is intention to break the deal on the part of Turkey,” Kyriakos Mantouvalos told The WorldPost.Mantouvalos noted that the average number of monthly arrivals has not increased dramatically this summer, and that things were far worse last year.“It may seem that numbers have picked up now, but around the same time last year, when the weather was also good but there was no deal in place, we had around 4,000 arrivals a day in Lesbos,” he said.An IOM spokesman said that in addition to more people making their way to Greece in the past few weeks, it seems others are shifting course and attempting to enter Europe through Bulgaria.Overall, the figures are declining: The total number of arrivals to Greece by sea since the beginning of 2016 is 163,105. In the first eight months of last year, that figure was 234,357."

Bongo took power in 2009 on the death of his father, who had ruled for 42 years.“Everybody knows that I won the election,” Ping told Reuters, adding that the electoral commission’s figures were based on false documents.“The (Bongo) family are repeating the same scenario for almost half a century. The opposition can win the elections but they have never had access to power... We need assistance from the rest of the world to protect the population of Gabon from a clan of mercenaries, a rogue state,” he said.Opposition supporters greeted the election result with anger. Demonstrators in the capital Libreville clashed with police and set part of the parliament building on fire. It burned for hours before being extinguished, witnesses said.On Thursday there were fresh clashes in the impoverished Nkembo neighborhood near the center of the capital. Gunfire and explosions could be heard, witnesses said. A government spokesman was not immediately available for comment.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault called for an immediate end to violence. France is Gabon’s former colonial power and retains strong economic and cultural links.“Within the framework of a political process, there’s no room for violence,” Ayrault said in a statement. “I’m calling, therefore, all parties to exercise the utmost restraint to avoid additional victims.”NO CLEAR PATHFrance, the United States and the European Union urged calm and called on authorities to release the results of individual polling stations for greater transparency, while the United Nations also urged restraint.Bongo won 49.80 percent of votes against 48.23 percent for Ping, on a turnout of 59.46 percent, according to results given region by region by Interior Minister Pacome Moubelet Boubeya.“This victory by such a tight score obliges ... each of us to respect the verdict of the ballot box and our institutions,” Bongo said in the text of a speech distributed to reporters.Ping, a political insider who has served as foreign minister and African Union Commission chairman, was a close ally of the late president and fathered two children with his daughter.His avenue for contesting the result appeared uncertain. Elections in Africa are frequently disputed but it is unusual for results to be overturned.Ping said he was not calling on his supporters to protest because they were already under so much pressure from authorities. He said he feared arms would be planted in his party headquarters and he could be arrested as a result.Voting was peaceful but the election followed a bitter campaign in which both sides traded accusations of fraud. Opposition suspicions were heightened when the release of results was delayed earlier in the week.An EU observer mission criticized a “lack of transparency” among institutions running the election and said Bongo had benefited from preferential access to money and the media.France’s Foreign Ministry also said the way in which the results were announced was a source of concern.“We think it is necessary to publish the results of all the polling stations. The credibility of the election as well as Gabon’s international reputation are at stake,” it said.(Additional reporting by Matthew Mpoke Bigg in Accra, Tim Cocks in Dakar and Joe Bavier in Abidjan; Writing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg; Editing by Toby Chopra)"

But he was also “glad” to be having the conversation.Ruffalo’s comments came after many in the queer community lambasted the film’s announcement. According to Variety, “Anything” will star Bomer as a trans sex worker who begins an “intense friendship” with a suicidal man, played by actor John Carroll Lynch.The “White Collar” and “American Horror Story” star, who is openly gay, joined the ranks of other cisgender actors, including Jared Leto and Eddie Redmayne, who’ve played trans characters. Leto won an Academy Award for his performance in “The Dallas Buyers Club” in 2014, and Redmayne received an Academy Award nomination in 2016 for his work in “The Danish Girl.”LGBT rights advocates have long argued such casting deprives trans actors of roles they’re overwhelmingly qualified for while perpetuating stereotypes about the community.“There are many qualified trans actors and writers who could have played in and advised on the construction of the scenes you’re about to edit into a motion picture. They will lose more work because of this,” Mya Byrne, a trans musician and poet wrote on HuffPost. “We know you have good intentions. But those intentions have far-reaching after-effects that you, as cis men, don’t experience.”Others have echoed Bryne’s sentiments, including “Orange Is The New Black” star Laverne Cox and actress Jamie Clayton from Netflix’s “Sense8.” Clayton said she was temporarily blocked from following Bomer on Twitter after expressing her anger, although she regained access shortly thereafter.Jen Richards, a trans actress and writer who said she auditioned for a separate role in the film, thanked Ruffalo for his comments and said she’d welcome the chance to chat with the actor about how to “move forward positively.”Some called for Bomer’s role to be recast, but Ruffalo noted the film had already wrapped."

As a condition of the adult probation, Salvant ordered him to serve 720 days in jail, 180 days for each of the four crash fatalities.Tonya Couch was indicted by a grand jury in May on charges of money laundering and hindering apprehension of her fugitive son. She was released on bond and placed under house confinement.Her curfew was eased in June so she could get a job. She has been working at a Fort Worth-area honky-tonk bar, according to attorney Stephanie Patten."

Once the search was over, federal authorities announced they had recovered approximately 209 pounds of cocaine. Both women were arrested, along with a 63-year-old man named André Tamine, The Associated Press reported.The astonishing twist followed weeks of lavish Instagram travel photos the women posted showing them riding ATVs, bathing in turquoise oceans, sipping on drinks in coconuts, and taking in New York City’s Times Square.“I always said I wanted to do a once in a life time trip,” one photo posted to Roberge’s Instagram account on May 19 read.The trio went before a judge Monday and was charged with importing a commercial quantity of cocaine. They each face a maximum sentence of life behind bars, authorities said. They were denied bail and their next court appearance is scheduled for October, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.The trio is believed to have been working with a “very well organized syndicate,” the Herald reported, citing the Australian Border Force.“These syndicates should be on notice that the Australian Border Force is aware of all the different ways they attempt to smuggle drugs in our country and we are working with a range of international agencies to stop them,” Australian Border Force Assistant Commissioner Clive Murray said in a statement.Authorities have not said where the drugs are believed to have originated. Photos shared on the women’s Instagram pages show them having traveled to London, Ireland, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile, among other countries.Australian Border Force commander Tim Fitzgerald credited the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Canada Border Services Agency for helping flag the trio as “high-risk passengers,” the AP reported.The investigation remains ongoing and additional arrests could be made, the Australian Federal Police stated.

Niccolai of the Yale School of Public Health in New Haven. “The decision to immunize a child does not occur in vacuum and is not as straightforward as simply accepting a preventive medical intervention or not.”Current recommendations include human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, tetanus-diphtheria-acellar pertussis (Tdap) and meningococcal conjugate (MCV4) for boys and girls aged 11 to 12. The researchers used the 2012 National Immunization Survey-Teen to estimate how many teens in each state got at least one dose of these vaccines.The HPV vaccine, which was recommended for girls in 2006 and boys in 2011, protects against cancers caused by HPV infection, which affects about one in four Americans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends boys and girls get all three shots of the HPV vaccine series.The Tdap vaccine booster helps protect preteens from infections they were vaccinated against as children. The MCV4 vaccine protects against a rare but dangerous bacterial infection of the brain.“The HPV, Tdap, and MCV4 vaccines that we have in the U.S. have very strong safety records and effectively prevent several important diseases,” Niccolai told Reuters Health by email. “They are recommended for all adolescents, so there is no downside to these vaccinations,” and they are covered by insurance or the federal vaccine program for nearly all children.The researchers adjusted for factors that could influence vaccination patterns, including income, education, race and ethnicicty and insurance coverage. Then they calculated the median vaccination rates among blue and red states – meaning half of states had rates above the median for their group.In 2012, Democratic-voting “blue states” had a median of 63 percent coverage for girls and 47 percent coverage for boys for the HPV shot, compared to 56 of girls and 34 percent of boys in Republican-voting “red states.”For Tdap, blue states had a median of 90 percent vaccine coverage for teens, compared to 85 percent in red states. For MCV4, almost 80 percent of teens in half of blue states had been vaccinated compared to 73 percent in red states, as reported in the American Journal of Public Health.“We hypothesized there would be differences for HPV, a sexually transmitted infection, perhaps due to social conservatism found in many Republican states,” Niccolai said. “But we also found differences for MCV4 and Tdap, suggesting something else, perhaps related to political affiliation more broadly, that is important.”Preference for a smaller role of government in personal decision making, typically associated with more Republican views, could lead to individuals rejecting vaccinations that are recommended by federal agencies, she said. But this study alone can’t explain why differences exist between states.Underlying preferences may drive differences in voting patterns and vaccine behavior between states, said W. David Bradford, the Busbee Chair in Public Policy at the University of Georgia in Atlanta.“Remember that Democratic-leaning states tend to be on the coasts and by and large have higher incomes,” Bradford said. “The surprising part is that the authors actually control for many of the things that one would first think of as explaining differences in healthy behaviors (median income, education levels, and insurance, for example) and yet even then the impact of political preferences still mattered.”"

While he is still lagging in the horserace polls, trailing even the 15 percent he needs to secure a debate invitation, most voters now at least know who he is, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.Sixty-three percent of voters say they’ve heard of Johnson, up from just 34 percent three months earlier. Twenty-four percent of voters now view the candidate favorably; 24 percent view him unfavorably; 14 percent have heard of him but aren’t sure; and 37 percent still haven’t heard of him.Green Party nominee Jill Stein, who wasn’t included in the May survey, is also now known to a majority of voters, although she’s somewhat less liked. Sixteen percent have a favorable opinion of her; 30 percent have an unfavorable opinion; 14 percent have heard of her but have no opinion; and 41 percent haven’t heard of her at all.That’s far more notoriety than third-party candidates have attracted in the past. During Johnson’s 2012 run for president, for instance, a September Pew Research survey found that more than three-quarters of voters had never heard of him.Still, Johnson and Stein remain lesser-known than nearly all of the Republican presidential hopefuls were in the beginning of January. And they’re still nowhere near matching the near-universal name recognition enjoyed by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.Johnson’s increased name recognition also doesn’t seem to have done him much good in polls. HuffPost Pollster’s average shows Johnson pulling in less than 9 percent of the vote, a number that has remained largely unchanged during the past few months. Stein, when she’s included by pollsters, tends to take under 5 percent of the vote.Even that may overstate the percentage of each candidate’s backers who actually make it to the polls.Surveying races that include third-party candidates is a tricky prospect with no easy answers: Polls that ask about those candidates by name tend to overstate their support, while those that exclude them understate it. And as SurveyMonkey’s Mark Blumenthal noted recently, “[T]he voters who opt for Johnson and Stein – often younger and more politically independent – are also less politically engaged and less likely to vote.” According to SurveyMonkey’s tracking poll, nearly half of Johnson and Stein’s supporters give themselves a 50-50 or lower chance of actually voting for those candidates, and only about two-thirds of each candidate’s backers are certain that they’ll vote at all.Still, in a race where more than a third of voters dislike both major candidates, the public seems willing to at least pay more attention than normal to the alternatives.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Aug. 25-26 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

It’s not just about differences over policy,” Clinton told an American Legion convention in Cincinnati. “It truly is about who has the experience and the temperament to serve as president and commander in chief.”Clinton, a former secretary of state and former U.S. senator, at times sounded like the Republican candidates Trump defeated to win his party’s presidential nomination. She highlighted the United States’ role as a global superpower and celebrated “American exceptionalism,” a term frequently used by conservatives in a foreign-policy context.“When we say America is exceptional ... it means that we recognize America’s unique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress,” Clinton told the veterans. “When America fails to lead, we leave a vacuum.”She harshly rebuked Trump, accusing him of advocating a retreat from global affairs and suggesting that his calls for U.S. forces to torture terror suspects and threaten their families would make the country less safe.The speech came on the same day that Trump was slated to meet with Mexico’s president, Enrique Pena Nieto, in Mexico City in an attempt to bolster his own foreign-policy profile before delivering a speech on immigration policy Wednesday evening in Arizona.In her speech, Clinton cited the endorsements of dozens of members of the Republican foreign-policy establishment. On Wednesday, she secured another one from James Clad, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense under President George W. Bush.In a comment that has sparked criticism from many Republicans, Trump has called the U.S.-led NATO military alliance obsolete, although he has since pledged to work with NATO to defeat Islamic State. He has also vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and to make Mexico pay for it.Brian Katulis, a national-security analyst at the liberal Center for American Progress think tank in Washington, said Clinton’s remarks were in line with “a bipartisan consensus about how we can best keep America safe and secure.”Trump, he said, stands outside that consensus - something the Clinton campaign has attempted to exploit in courting Republican voters concerned about his rhetoric and lack of government experience.John Feehery, a Republican strategist in Washington, said Clinton’s approach could peel off some wavering voters, but could cost her support from liberals and others who are wary of overseas conflicts after protracted wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.“It could lose her votes on the left from folks who are tired of us blundering into any more wars,” he said. “Most voters think we should focus on the home front.”(Reporting By Caren Bohan and James Oliphant in Washington and Jonathan Allen in Cincinnati.; Editing by Richard Balmforth and Jonathan Oatis)"

Penzone, a former Phoenix police officer who is expected to present a tough challenge to Arpaio in November, lost to the longtime sheriff in 2012 by six percentage points.Arpaio, 84, was expected to win his primary despite a judge’s request that criminal contempt charges be brought against him stemming from a 2007 racial profiling case where he was found to have violated the constitutional rights of Latino motorists.The investigation and possible prosecution was turned over to the U.S. Justice Department last week. It was not clear when a decision would be made.Arpaio, who styles himself as America’s toughest sheriff, said his looming legal battles apparently had no effect on the primary race.”I think the people understand that they should not believe everything they hear,” Arpaio told Reuters in a telephone interview. “They support me as they always have and that feels good.”Saban has called on Arpaio to resign, saying the sheriff has “soiled his badge” and made himself ineffective as a lawman.Saban declined comment on the election results through a spokesman, adding that he would issue a statement on Wednesday morning.Arpaio, along with three others, could face incarceration and fines if convicted of any criminal charges. Arpaio and his second-in-command, Gerard Sheridan, already have been cited and admitted to civil contempt.The charges center on unlawful traffic stops and detentions by deputies of Latino drivers for 18 months after the judge ordered them to cease.Opponents also have targeted the profiling lawsuit’s high cost to the county, which will have spent an estimated $54 million on the case by next summer."
