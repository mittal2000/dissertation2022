0,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Is Doing Better In States With Highly Educated White Populations,Ariel Edwards-Levy and Janie Velencia,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-college-educated-whites_us_57c5d19ee4b0664f13cb0530,The demographic is one Donald Trump can't afford to lose.,2016-08-30,"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks at a rally at Truckee Meadows Community College in Reno, Nevada, Aug. 25, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c5d7b31700000011c76791.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton is winning in states with a greater proportion of highly educated white voters, a demographic that her rival Donald Trump needs to win over in order to have a shot at the presidency.Clinton polls proportionally better in states that have a higher ratio of white people with college degrees relative to the overall number of white people in the state. As the following chart shows, in the 21 states where HuffPost Pollster has enough survey data to estimate the state of the race, there’s a moderately positive correlation between Clinton’s margin and the percentage of whites over age 25 who’ve obtained a bachelor’s degree.These white, highly educated Americans, who have tended to lean Republican, could help to reshape the electoral map, keeping Clinton competitive in traditionally red states and contributing to her advantage in states like Colorado and Virginia, where races have often been closer.As The Atlantic’s Ron Brownstein notes, winning over educated white voters is crucial for Trump. With white voters who don’t have a college education still largely in Trump’s camp, and nonwhite voters unlikely to give him much support, “that leaves college-educated whites as the campaign’s most closely contested ― and conflicted ― major constituency,” Brownstein wrote in July.“Even if [Trump] grows among blue-collar whites to Reagan ’84 levels, his struggles among non-whites means he likely can’t win without capturing either slightly below or just above 60 percent of college-educated whites, depending on how large a share of the vote they comprise,” Brownstein went on. “For comparison, the exit polls showed Romney winning 56 percent of white-collar whites last time.”Now, a month later, Trump seems increasingly unlikely to match even those numbers. Clinton leads among white voters with college degrees by 10 points, 46 percent to 36 percent, according to the most recent YouGov/Economist poll. Other surveys have shown her leading among that group by smaller margins.If those numbers hold, they would mark a significant realignment along educational lines, making Trump the first Republican presidential candidate in 60 years to lose white college graduates.Clinton’s strength among that demographic is the culmination of a long shift in American politics.As recently as 1992, there was no correlation between the share of a state’s population with a college degree and that state’s willingness to vote Republican, according to Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. By 2012, Democrats were performing markedly better in more educated states.“Republicans and Democrats essentially underwent a four-decade exchange program,” Drutman wrote. “Democrats sent Republicans their non-college-educated, culturally conservative white voters, mostly in declining rural and exurban areas, who had once been the core of the New Deal. In return, Democrats got culturally liberal wealthy professionals, largely in prosperous urban and suburban areas, many of whom were once ‘Rockefeller Republicans’ and had once opposed many elements of the New Deal.”Trump’s weakness with well-educated white voters, in fact, could explain his recent outreach to black and Latino voters. Polls have shown that one of the things college-educated whites don’t like about Trump is their belief that he is either racist or willing to use racist themes in his campaign. It’s been argued that his newfound concern about minorities may be less about winning voters of color and more about persuading skeptical white voters that he is not a racist.S.V.

1,POLITICS,California Lawmakers Pass Mandatory Jail Bill Inspired By Stanford Rape Case,"By Dan Whitcomb, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stanford-rape-case-bill_us_57c550f6e4b0cdfc5ac90704,The bill now goes to Democratic Governor Jerry Brown for his approval.,2016-08-30,Former Stanford student Brock Turner was sentenced to six months in county jail for the sexual assault of an unconscious and intoxicated woman. He will be released on Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c552081800002100bcdf93.jpeg?cache=9PsDeHrmmu&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California lawmakers, responding to outrage over the six-month jail term given to a former Stanford University swimmer after his conviction for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman, passed legislation on Monday closing a loophole that allowed the sentence.The bill now goes to Democratic Governor Jerry Brown for his approval. He has not indicated whether he will sign it into law.The measure was introduced in response to the sentence given to 20-year-old Brock Turner by Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky in June, which was widely condemned as too lenient.Prosecutors had asked that Turner be given six years in state prison. He is scheduled to be released on Friday from jail in Northern California.“Sexually assaulting an unconscious or intoxicated victim is a terrible crime and our laws need to reflect that,” Democratic Assemblyman Bill Dodd, a co-author of the legislation, said in a written statement following its passage.Turner was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape, penetration of an intoxicated person and penetration of an unconscious person in the January 2015 attack. Under California law, those charges are not considered rape because they did not involve penile penetration.The uproar over the sentence, fueled in part by the victim’s harrowing letter in which she detailed the assault in graphic terms, comes amid growing outrage over sexual assault on U.S. college campuses.“This bill is about more than sentencing, it’s about supporting victims and changing the culture on our college campuses to help prevent future crimes,” Dodd said.The case has also led to efforts to remove Persky from the bench. Earlier this month, the judge asked for a transfer to civil court.According to the legislators, current California law calls for a mandatory prison term in cases of rape or sexual assault where force is used, but not when the victim is unconscious or severely intoxicated and thus unable to resist.The bill, which faced no serious opposition in the Democratic-controlled legislature, would eliminate a judge’s discretion to sentence defendants convicted of such crimes to probation. Under its provisions, Turner would have faced a minimum of three years behind bars.Need help?

Stephen Brantley and director David Drake are hoping to put an optimistic spin on the trials and tribulations of recovering drug addicts in the queer community with a new, introspective play.“The Jamb,” which is billed as a “punk-rock rom-com on crystal meth,” focuses on the lives of two gay men who grew up in a post-Stonewall era, but who came of age before the era of “Will and Grace” and all that followed afterward.Brantley stars as Roderick, a former punk who has “gone straightedge” as he inches closer to 40, embracing LGBT activism and martial arts along the way. His pal, Tuffer (Nic Grellli), has had the opposite trajectory, and continues to abuse substances while dating ― and discarding ― a series of young lovers.When things take a turn for the worse, Roderick stages an intervention that ultimately takes the pair to New Mexico, where they both “hit bottom on the high desert.”The new play, which opens Sept. 1 at the Kraine Theater in Manhattan, echoes themes Brantley first examined in 2014’s “Chicken-Fried Ciccone,” which Drake also directed. That show saw the Texas-born Brantley recalling his struggle with heroin addiction and brush with homelessness through hit Madonna songs, including “Like a Virgin” and “Vogue.”Similarly, “The Jamb” is inspired by music – in this case, punk rock – as well as many of Brantley’s personal experiences with addiction and sex. Still, the actor-playwright told The Huffington Post that he wrote the piece from the “perspective of those who want to save an addict from self-destruction” as opposed to that of an addict themselves.“Even now, we don’t see a whole lot of queer characters over 30 that aren’t tragic or boring. Stories about gay men and drug use tend to end badly, and there is truth in that, of course,” he said. “But there’s also hope and resilience – I should know.”The personal feel of Brantley’s work instantly appealed to Drake, whose award-winning solo play, “The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me,” was a landmark drama based on his own coming-of-age during the HIV/AIDS crisis.Drake praised Brantley’s “inspiring way of zeroing in on the truth of a moment” and willingness to take “fearless leaps of faith” in his work. The pair first began working on “The Jamb” in 2008, and the eight-year process has “mirrored our own journey of wisdom and maturity,” he said.Noting that he’s “really interested in representing LGBT people in all their complexity,” Brantley was also quick to stress the romantic comedy nature of “The Jamb,” noting that the relationship at the core of the story is partly inspired by the John Hughes classic, “Sixteen Candles.”Ultimately, he sees the show as a reminder of “how much better life is when lived honestly, and shared with others.”“Queer folks have struggled long and hard for their piece but, now that we’re finally at the table, we should split dessert,” he said. “Life is sweeter that way.”J. Stephen Brantley stars in “The Jamb,” which opens Sept. 1 at the Kraine Theater in New York. Head here for more details. "
3,POLITICS,Trump Hits Clinton For Not Doing News Conferences While Banning Reporters From His Pressers,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-news-conference-media_us_57c5f496e4b0a22de092e8f4,The GOP nominee's media blacklist has excluded a big chunk of the press corps.,2016-08-30,"Donald Trump and the Republican Party have attacked Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for not holding news conferences, even though he has banned dozens of reporters from attending his own.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c5f6d9180000dd10bce262.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – Republicans have ramped up their hammering of Hillary Clinton for not holding a news conference this year – even as their own presidential nominee has been banning dozens of journalists from participating in his.Trump has banned Univision, Buzzfeed, The Huffington Post, The Daily Beast, The Des Moines Register, Politico and The Washington Post from receiving credentials to his campaign events, including news conferences. The ban prevents reporters who have produced some of the most critical coverage of Trump from even attending, let alone asking questions.The news organizations were blacklisted because of coverage Trump did not like. (Many of the banned news organizations, though, including this publication, are taking part in a rotation for pool coverage of Trump through the election.) The Des Moines Register was banned after its editorial board called on Trump to drop out of the GOP race last July. HuffPost was also banned last summer after its editors relegated coverage of Trump to its entertainment section. Politico was banned this spring after it ran a story questioning the temperament of its first campaign manager.This record, though, has not stopped Trump and the RNC from trying to exploit the Democratic presidential nominee’s aversion to question-and-answer sessions with the reporters who cover her campaign daily.At the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani scolded reporters for not more forcefully demanding news conferences from Clinton. “You, the press should be ashamed of yourself. You should be ashamed for not doing your job,” said Giuliani, now a top Trump supporter. “She should not be allowed to run for president and hide in an ivory tower.”In the intervening weeks, Republican leaders have taken to taunting Clinton on Twitter, in interviews and in their daily emails to campaign reporters.“Why is the press OK with that?” asked Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway last week on CNBC. “Two hundred and sixty days, you could have had a baby by then.”Starting last week, the campaign also began sending out emails counting how many days have passed since Clinton’s last formal news conference in December. “HIDING HILLARY: DAY 269,” was the subject line for Tuesday’s, which included a statement from Trump spokesman Jason Miller demanding “full transparency.”On the issue of transparency, however, the Trump campaign lags far behind the Clinton operation in one key area: fundraising.The Clinton campaign, from the day it was launched, has disclosed the location of every fundraiser, the name of the hosts, how many were in attendance and what the minimum donation amount was. The practice has been common for presidential campaigns in recent years. Both President Barack Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney routinely disclosed this information in 2012.Clinton, for example, on Monday released information on three fundraisers she attended in the Hamptons. The third, according to the campaign, was held at the home of Tracy and Jay Snyder in East Hampton, where the 25 attendees each donated a minimum of $33,400 to attend.Trump also held a fundraiser Monday, at a private home near the Stanford University campus in Woodside, California. His campaign revealed zero information about who attended or how much was raised.Neither the Trump campaign nor the Republican National Committee, which co-sponsors his events as part of a joint fundraising agreement, responded to requests for comment from HuffPost.The names of donors and the amounts contributed are eventually reported to the Federal Election Commission, but those records do not reveal the names of the hosts or event locations.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The “all lives matter” camp fails to realize that the lives of black Americans are disproportionately destroyed by the criminal justice system, civil rights advocates point out.Some Twitter users scolded Rice for the controversial tweet and for speaking out against Kaepernick’s actions at all.Rice’s tweet also appears to reference a quote from Rodney King, the victim of a horrendous police beating in 1991 that was caught on camera. After a jury acquitted the Los Angeles cops involved in the incident, King famously pleaded against rioting by saying, “Can we all get along?”Rice used almost the same wording on Twitter.Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem at a preseason game on Friday night, arguing that he did not want to “show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.” Despite criticism from other players and the public, the 49ers quarterback is defending the gesture as a way to protest racism in the U.S., particularly police brutality.Kaepernick said on Sunday that he will sit during the anthem in forthcoming football games."

Troopers purchased food and drinks for them before transporting them back to their headquarters, where they were treated to toys and visits by other troopers, state police said.“This is an excellent example of Troopers working hand in hand with law enforcement across the nation to help those in need,” Col. Mike Edmonson, Louisiana’s state police superintendent, said in a release. “The successful recovery of these four children is proof that law enforcement partnerships work. Troopers will continue to work with our established partners to seek out and bring to justice those who wish to harm our children.”"

Shannon Purser, the actress who played the beloved Netflix character whose life was cut tragically short, is set to join the cast of The CW’s Archie reboot series, “Riverdale,” Entertainment Weekly reports. Purser will be playing Ethel Muggs (sometimes known as “Big Ethel”), the boy-crazy character known for her huge crush on Jughead (who will be played by Cole Sprouse). According to EW, though, Ethel will get a new love interest in the series. Purser expressed her excitement about the role on Tuesday with a tweet: EW also notes that Ethel, who will appear in at least three episodes, will strike up a friendship with Betty (Lili Reinhart) and Veronica (Camila Mendes), after they get revenge on Archie’s rival, Reggie Mantle. “Riverdale” is set to premiere midseason on The CW."
11,RELIGION,A Baptist Pastor’s Plea To Love Our Muslim Neighbors,"Rev. Dr. Chris George, ContributorSenior Pastor of Smoke Rise Baptist Church in Stone Mountain, ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-baptist-pastors-plea-to-love-our-muslim-neighbors_us_57c5bdc6e4b09cd22d92d974,"Hundreds of people packed the Newton County courthouse in Covington, Ga., on August 22 to protest the placement of a mosque",2016-08-30,"Louisville community members come together for an interfaith service to honor Muhammad Ali at The Louisville Islamic Center. June 5, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c5c5151700000011c76748.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hundreds of people packed the Newton County courthouse in Covington, Ga., on August 22 to protest the placement of a mosque in their neighborhood. Sadly, it was not the first time that fierce anger and opposition to Muslims was expressed in the metro Atlanta area. Two years ago, the Kennesaw City Council voted (without cause) to reject a permit for the creation of a small, storefront mosque in their community.Two months ago, homeowners in Cobb County fought against the placement of a Muslim cemetery.It is not only happening in our community, but across our country.Many of the loudest protesters are people of faith and members of my faith community—Christians. We are people called and commissioned to love God and love others, but still struggling with an age-old question: Who is my neighbor?Words like “us” and “them” are some of the first we learn as children and we never forget those words. I have heard them echoed over and over again in recent days. “We” don’t want “them” here. “They” don’t have a place in “our” neighborhood.At the 2016 annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention, a pastor rose with some comments and a question. He said, “They (Muslims) are murdering Christians, beheading Christians, imprisoning Christians all over the world…These people (Muslims) are a threat to our very way of existence as Christians in America…How in the world (can) someone within the Southern Baptist Convention support defending of the rights of Muslims to construct mosques in the United States?”Dr. Russell Moore, President of the SBC Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, listened patiently and responded unequivocally. “Sometimes questions are complicated and sometimes we have hard decisions to make, but this is NOT one of those times,” Moore said. “What it means to be a Baptist is to support soul freedom for everybody.”His answer was grounded in Baptist theology, but it was also grounded in an ancient rule―often called golden―that we “love our neighbors as we love ourselves.”In the Parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus answered the question, “Who is my neighbor?” Defying the conventional wisdom of his day (and ours), Jesus broke down the walls of “us” and “them,” calling for us to love beyond ethnic differences and religious labels. My church, Smoke Rise Baptist Church, is located at a great cultural crossroads just a short distance from Clarkston, Ga., the largest refugee community in the Southeast United States. Within 10 miles of our church, we have a Hindu Temple, Muslim mosques, Jewish synagogues, and Buddhist Temples.The neighborhood is changing.Our church has decided to respond not in fear, but in faith.Fear labels. Faith loves.Our church welcomes other houses of worship in our community, because we believe that religious liberty must be for all, or it will not exist at all.We choose to be a Good Neighbor.Jesus said, “Love God and Love your neighbor.” It is not an either/or, but a both/and. If we love God, we will love our neighbor, regardless of our differences.The conversation in Newton County and in many others places across the country is about more than politics or building permits. It is about people.One person who has inspired our congregation is Malik Waliyani, an Indian-born Muslim. In April, he purchased the local gas station about a block from our church. In July, his station was robbed and ransacked. After learning of his loss, we wanted to be a good neighbor and support him. So, one Sunday, our congregation went to buy gas and groceries from his store.He gave us the items we purchased, but he also gave us something else that Sunday, something that you can’t get on a shelf, something priceless… He gave us his friendship.In August, Malik came to our church and shared a meal with us, expressing gratitude and introducing himself and his faith to his new neighbors. Malik is a Muslim AND Malik is our friend and our neighbor.Georgia is still scarred from a time where exclusion was the order of the day. But, a new day is dawning. Today, Georgia is the most diverse state in the Southeast. We have a unique opportunity to move beyond our prejudicial past and embrace a new identity as a community of welcome, a place where words like “us” and “them” are outdated and obsolete.Georgia can be a place where everyone is treated like a neighbor and where strangers are welcomed as friends—Southern Hospitality in the best way.We stand at the intersection of yesterday and tomorrow. Will we will run back to the past with fear or walk forward toward the future with faith?Rev. Dr. Chris George is senior pastor of Smoke Rise Baptist Church, a congregation located in Stone Mountain, Ga., and affiliated with the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick went on the political offensive Sunday, throwing criticism at the presidential candidates after he refused to stand for the national anthem in a Friday preseason game.Kaepernick, who says he has been protesting the nation’s oppression of people of color by not standing, was asked Sunday if the election year had anything to do with the timing of his demonstration.“It wasn’t a timing thing, it wasn’t something that was planned,” he said, per The Big Lead. “But I think the two presidential candidates that we currently have also represent the issues that we have in this country right now.”Asked to elaborate, he answered, “You have Hillary, who has called black teens or black kids superpredators, you have Donald Trump who’s openly racist. We have a presidential candidate who has deleted emails and done things illegally and is a presidential candidate. That doesn’t make sense to me because if that was any other person you’d be in prison. So, what is this country really standing for?”The 49ers play their final preseason game at San Diego on Sept. 1 before opening the regular season Sept. 12 against the Los Angeles Rams. Kaepernick had not played in an exhibition game until Friday against Green Bay, when he completed 2 of 6 passes for 14 yards and rushed four times for 18 yards."

For her grand finale, Rihanna got glamorous, singing “Stay” and “Diamonds” backed by a full orchestra. Her saucy, soulful performance of “Love on the Brain” brought the damn house down.
