Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has joined the discussion. While the San Francisco 49ers quarterback’s protest has inspired countless professional athletes and a Missouri lawmaker to join the cause, others have criticized his actions. Speaking with The Huffington Post this week, Booker landed somewhere in the middle. “It’s something that, to me, I would never do,” the senator said. But he added that Kaepernick’s protest should ignite a meaningful conversation about the racial issues and unchecked police violence that led to his protest in the first place.“I can condemn what’s going on, but let me at least understand why this is happening,” he said. “...Maybe there’s some things that this person’s saying that should arouse my empathy and actually should arouse my engagement.”Booker, who compared Kaepernick’s actions to those of Muhammad Ali, John Carlos and Tommie Smith, also spoke out against critics who have denounced the quarterback’s protest, but haven’t acknowledged the problems he’s highlighting.“The most perverse reality of privilege is when there is a serious problem in this country, but it’s not affecting you or your family personally, so therefore it’s not a serious problem,” Booker said. The issues of racial bias in policing and police brutality are wholly intertwined with one of Booker’s biggest initiatives ― criminal justice reform. The senator has been pushing a bill that would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for federal drug offenders, but the bipartisan effort has a slim chance of passing this year. Nonetheless, Booker ― who is just one of two black senators in Congress ― is still strongly committed to the issue. He addressed the exorbitant cost of the U.S. prison system and the disproportionate way mass incarceration affects the most vulnerable groups in the United States. “The land of the free is the nation of incarceration,” he said. “Since 1980 alone, our prison population in America alone has grown 500 percent. It’s because of this drug war, which is disproportionately executed upon poor people, disadvantaged people, mentally ill, drug addicted and disproportionately minority people.”He lamented that America has chosen to “invest in prisons,” when so many people are pushing for a change. “If you think about this, we have a nation right now where common sense tells you we should be going in a different direction,” he said.

1,QUEER VOICES,Inside The South's First School For LGBTQ Students,"Timothy Pratt, The 74",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pride-school_us_57dc434ae4b08cb14095cacb,"At Pride School, students are safe, free and powerful.",2016-09-16,Pride School students listen as the schools mission and structure are discussed in the first days of school.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57dc45171300002b0039c875.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The74Million.org is a non-profit education news site, devoted to telling the stories of schools, teachers, parents and America’s 74 million kids. Christian Zsilavetz stood in front of the classroom reading the school’s handwritten guidelines from a spiral notebook to his eight students, ages 8 to 17.It was the first meeting of teachers, students and volunteers in Atlanta’s recently launched Pride School, which is billing itself as the first school in the South aimed at creating a safe learning environment for LGBTQ teachers, students, their families and allies.Reviewing the guidelines was one of eight items on the agenda that day. The first guideline, unsurprisingly, was “No bullying.” Then there was “Respect one another.” Third, “Use correct names and pronouns.”So began the second week of the tiny private school’s educational experiment, founded on the premise of accepting students for who they are and guided by the principles of power-sharing and student-driven decision-making that gained traction during the counterculture free schools movement of the 1960s and ’70s.The school hopes to turn around the alarming indicators for LGBTQ youth that have become more documented as the population becomes more visible, while providing a learning environment for these and other students that allows them to succeed.At the same time, Zsilavetz points out that his school is casting a wide net, hoping to attract “gender-diverse or otherwise LGBT-identified students; students who come from LGBT families, regardless of how they identify; and families who just want a great place to go to school — where they’ll be accepted.”Obstacles include not only the impacts of bullying and other challenges the school’s students faced in their previous schools but also the pushback from society at large, particularly in the Bible Belt. Georgia is one of 12 states to join Texas in a challenge to federal guidelines allowing public school students to use the restroom of their choice, and neighboring North Carolina is home to HB2, the controversial law that restricts use of public school and government restrooms and impedes local governments from passing anti-discrimination measures based on gender and sexual orientation.The Pride school is one of only three such experiments nationwide, together with New York’s Harvey Milk High School and Milwaukee’s The Alliance School, both of which are public schools.The dire situation facing lesbian, gay and bisexual students was demonstrated by the recently released Centers for Disease Control survey of 15,600 high school students that included questions for the first time about sexual-orientation identities. The survey, which did not ask students about being transgender, showed that about 1 in 12 students identified themselves as lesbian, gay or bisexual, and that these students were at greater risk than others.Forty percent had considered suicide in the past 12 months, and 29 percent had attempted to kill themselves; 34 percent were bullied at school, compared with 19 percent of the rest of the student population. About 1 in 8 had missed school in the past 30 days due to fears of violence.The small group of students at Pride School, and their parents, are keenly aware of these issues, having lived them firsthand. Seventeen-year-old Jasper, who was born female but is questioning his gender, said a small group of like-minded friends in his former school warned him about “being ambushed or verbally harassed” by other students if he was open about his thoughts and feelings. “I also heard from my parents, who see all this stuff on social media — ‘Be careful, this could happen to you.’”The hostility appears to be more acute in the South. The most recent biennial survey of about 7,900 sixth- through 12th-graders done by the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), a national education and advocacy group, shows, for example, that LGBTQ students were twice as likely to experience physical harassment and assault in the South as in the Northeast. Zsilavetz hopes Pride School offers a better alternative to a sliver of these students and their families — and any others who could benefit from the school’s approach. The fledgling school has onlyeight students now; full annual tuition is $13,500, with need-based reductions offered in exchange for volunteering. Zsilavetz said enrolling 12 to 15 students would make the school “financially viable,” and he is trying to raise scholarship money for families who can’t afford tuition. For now, the group size seems just right for the two rooms housing the project in a Unitarian church just off I-85, about eight miles northeast of downtown Atlanta. The church used to run a preschool program in the space, and much of the furniture — small tables, cubbyhole shelves — brings small children to mind.The liberal nature of the denomination is a good fit for Pride School — the church recently placed gender-neutral signs on its restrooms. Now 46, Zsilavetz has taught math since 1992 in public schools in New Jersey and Washington State. Schools suffer from a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach to sexual and gender identity issues, he said. This winds up making day-to-day life in the classroom more difficult for teachers like Zsilavetz, who is transgender, and for students who are in any way outside society’s norms when it comes to gender and sexual orientation, he added.“Most staff [in public schools] are not out,” Zsilavetz said. “In many states you can be fired [for being openly LGBTQ], and it’s relatively forbidden to talk [about it] with students.” In the Pride School, students and staff are free to be themselves, he said.Heather Stancil was volunteering at the school on a recent Tuesday. She and her child, Tristan, who is 17, decided to enroll in Pride after the teenager came out as a transgender male last summer. The private school Tristan attended in Alpharetta, Ga., required uniforms, including skirts for girls. Tristan “felt uncomfortable as a male” wearing the uniform, Stancil said.The school had never dealt with an openly transgender student before, she added. “We didn’t want Tristan to be that much of a trailblazer,” Stancil said.She and Tristan went to therapy together. Stancil and her husband learned about the risks for LGBTQ youth —the bullying, suicides and drugs.“I was scared to death,” she said. “I wanted to do everything in my power to not have anyone harm my child … [and] being transgender paints an even bigger target on your back.”They began homeschooling. Tristan didn’t feel motivated. “The whole year was a wash [academically],” Stancil said. “We were feeling lost.” Then she came across news of the Pride School online. “Everything just fell into place.”Across a nearby table from Tristan, 17-year-old Jasper is glad he found the school as well. He went through public school in Alpharetta, a suburb about 25 miles north of Atlanta, where he remembers feeling “socially awkward.” “I felt different but couldn’t put a finger on it,” said Jasper, who was born female. Then a friend in eighth grade talked to him about the “pride spectrum,” as he calls it. “I thought maybe I fell on that [spectrum].”For the next two years, Jasper “expanded a network of friends to talk to” about his feelings. Finally, last spring, he told his parents. “I felt I wasn’t female. I wasn’t male … I told them, ‘I don’t want to go by my birth name anymore.’”Gradually, his parents came to accept the new name and the questioning of his gender. But in school, he couldn’t be open. “Kids would say, ‘God says gay kids are going to hell,’” he recalls.Finally, his mother found Pride School. “I can relate to these kids,” he said, sitting on a beanbag chair that occupies a central place in the classroom. “I can accept and love myself.”Cary Costello is a director of the LGBT studies program and a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. He is also the transgender parent of a daughter who graduated from the Alliance School, one of the other schools nationwide that is based on providing a safe place to learn for children who have been bullied. Nearly half the students are LGBT.“If you make these kids feel safe, then you can remediate the negative impact on learning,” Costello said. “You allow them to focus on education instead of survival.”Allan Laird, lead teacher at the Alliance School, said his students “come in broken and behind academically.” Founded in 2005, the school has seen students achieve increases in attendance and GPA, as well as decreases in violence. The charter high school has 195 students and a waiting list of several dozen. It features such innovative practices as staging student-led circles throughout the school at least four times a year to air any grievances or conflicts.The school has gone “from being the black sheep to the cool older brother” in the education world during the past decade-plus, Laird said. National and international media have visited, and the Milwaukee school district has asked Laird to share the school’s techniques with principals.The lead teacher wasn’t surprised to hear about Atlanta’s school. “I think the larger social changes [of recent years] help give people courage to start schools like Pride,” he said.Like the Alliance School, Pride School seeks to innovate in its educational approach. Peter Gray, a research professor at Boston College, has for decades studied the free-school model Zsilavetz and the school’s board have adopted, particularly at the Sudbury Valley School in Massachusetts.The idea is to give students a central role in creating rules and guidelines for the school, and to mix students of different ages in classrooms. The result: “It turns out if adults provide a safe place for learning, you don’t have to require them [students] to learn … you can’t stop them from learning!” he said.Opening a school that draws LGBTQ students is not without controversy. In the short time Pride School has been open, Zsilavetz has received online attacks, such as an email with the subject line “homo school” and the following message: “My kid’s a fag. Can I send him to your school?”But he’s also been surprised at pushback from area LGBTQ activists, who have told him that opening the school “lets public schools off the hook ... They say we’re not holding them accountable.”Still, Mike Sadowski, author of the recently released book Safe Is Not Enough: Better Schools for LGBTQ Students, said that schools like Harvey Milk High School, the Alliance School and Pride School fill a need.“Public schools are under an obligation to be safe and inclusive for LGBTQ students,” he said. “But until that’s happening, these schools serve a purpose. Students can benefit. Especially if an unsafe public school is the alternative.”"

5,ENTERTAINMENT,How 'Loving' Tells The Quiet Story Of A Monumental Supreme Court Case About Interracial Marriage,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/loving-jeff-nichols_us_57daf822e4b04a1497b32212,Jeff Nichols discussed his touching work at the Toronto Film Festival.,2016-09-16,"Michael Shannon, Joel Edgerton, Ruth Negga, Jeff Nichols and Nick Kroll attend the ""Loving"" premiere at the Toronto Film Festival on Sept. 11, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57db0df61800002f00314e0e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 1958, a white construction worker and his pregnant black girlfriend traveled to Washington, D.C., where they could be legally wed. After returning to rural Virginia, police raided their home. The marriage license hanging on the wall was cause for arrest. A legal battle ensued, all while the couple tried to evade the authorities and live in peace.Richard and Mildred Loving’s case, filed by the ACLU and heard by the Supreme Court, ultimately overturned bans on interracial marriage. In 2011, Nancy Buirski made a documentary about the proceedings. That inspired “Take Shelter” and “Midnight Special” director Jeff Nichols to craft a feature film, not about the case itself, but about the reserved couple at its center, the ones who never sought to be heroes.Having screened at the Toronto Film Festival this week following its Cannes premiere in May, “Loving” is a remarkable character study. Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga play Richard and Mildred, operating off of a delicate script, written by Nichols, that doesn’t require a showy proclamation to graft its emotional center. It also, of course, has a brief appearance from Michael Shannon, who has been in each of Nichols’ films. “Loving” will make a viable play for Oscars in the coming months. It wrecked me. I sobbed through the final half hour and emerged from the screening worried my face was too splotchy for the streets of Toronto. I can’t wait for the world to have this movie in its hands on Nov. 4, especially after this conversation with Nichols about his approach to the story.When “Loving” was first announced, I remember thinking there’s no way Jeff Nichols is directing a historical biopic. It seems so unlike what we know of your work, at least until you actually see the movie. Did you receive similar responses while developing the project?No, from that standpoint, everybody was pretty excited. We still had to navigate and find the right financier and all that, but that’s more an equation of dollars and the variables of the project. Honestly, there was a bit of a personal process on my part of “How do I fit into this story?” and “Why is it right for me?” Those questions started to get answered very quickly, though, when I started to watch the documentary. A lot of people attribute the pace of this film and the aesthetic of the film to the way that I make movies. That’s flattering, but it’s also a little limiting because I feel like the pace of this film, and the true nature of it, is dedicated to Richard and Mildred. It represents who they were. I think the fortunate part is that falls very neatly into my wheelhouse as a filmmaker.But that being said, I remember thinking, much like you were thinking, that this would be the most conventional film I had made. And I was sitting in the editing room with my editor, and I was like, “Ya know, this thing really doesn’t have a climax in any traditional sense.” There is no three-act structure at work here. I never work along those lines anyway, narratively. I just find it too limiting. Now, there is an emotional climax. That’s just something I try to put in all my films. But by the time it was all said and done, I kind of stood back and said, “Well, I’ve gone and made another film that was not conventional.” I’d like to think it’s just what the story needed to be. It’s what Richard and Mildred demanded of it.We don’t see the actual Supreme Court hearing, so the film ends rather quietly, considering how towering the results were. Did you ever think of giving us some galvanizing, rah-rah moment?No, I picked up on that right from the start in the documentary. There’s this amazing scene where [lawyer Bernie Cohen] is recounting the victory. It’s really joyous. It’s hard to watch and not feel an exuberance with him as he’s recounting it. But then Nancy Buirski, who made the documentary, is offscreen and says, “So, how did you tell the Lovings?” And he says, “Oh, I think we called them on the phone.” And that just struck me right to the core. What was that phone call like? Which obviously becomes an important, very quiet scene in the film ― one of these things that feels like an ordinary thing: You pick up the phone and your life is changed. But that’s what the Lovings felt like, these very ordinary moments that had extraordinary consequences.When I first talked to the producers ― this was back in 2012 ― we weren’t far off the heels of “The Help” making $200 million and being what it was. I told them, “Guys, there’s a feel-good movie in here that could probably make a lot of money, and I’m probably not going to make that film.” So as much as I was surprised on the back end by the fact that it wasn’t as conventional as I thought it might be, there was an element on the front end of saying, “I know for a fact, though, just by benefit of sticking to the point of view of the Lovings, of not going the route of the court case, this is going to counter what I think might be financially responsible for a story like this.”So you’re saying you aimed to make the antithesis of “The Help.”[Smiles] I’ll let you say that. I did not say that. That is your quote, not mine. No, I wanted to make a film that represented its people. [Nichols pauses, then chuckles.] In order to do that, it’s kind of like a sweater with a loose thread, meaning the court case. The more you start to pull it, the more it unravels, and you need to incorporate that in the film. So it was very important to really have this narrative temperance when it came to the Lovings’ point of view.We were really lucky ― Martin Scorsese was a friend of the project because he was a friend of the documentary filmmaker. I got to speak to him about the script. There was a question: Should we play up the lawyers a little bit more? He was like, “No, no, no, it’s very delicate.” And I kind of took that as permission to stick to my guns. You saw that note coming, and it was really nice to hear from him that, no, the balance of this was correct.In what fashion does Scorsese give notes on another director’s script?It was a pretty brief phone call where I’m just fumbling over myself and trying to listen. I remember I was trying to bring up some of the other producers’ points, and he just kind of kept saying, “No, you’ve really done a nice job with this ― don’t mess with it.” It was a pretty short, simple conversation.Would you agree that you are drawn to small movies about big topics? “Take Shelter” is about apocalyptic visions, “Mud” is about children without parents, “Midnight Special” is about supernatural paranoia, “Loving” is about a landmark legal case. Yeah, I think that makes sense. I actually don’t think the movies are that small. They feel odd, and they feel oddly placed. We are used to seeing stories told a certain way, and for whatever reason, I don’t tell narratives that way. A lot of people don’t like that. A lot of people watch my films and say, “He’s missing something” or “That’s not a satisfying way to receive the story.” That’s their prerogative. But it’s just in my nature to lay out narratives as I see the characters needing them to lay out. So many people think about plot. I’m really just thinking about character behavior, and I’m letting that lead the narrative. Regardless, and this gets to the heart of your question, I really want there to be an emotional conveyance to the audience. I want them to be affected by these things. Each film that I’ve made, there’s specifically one scene that I can point to, and it’s a pressure point. If you’re not there with me, I haven’t done my job, or you’re not paying attention, or some sort of combination of the two, and this is where you’re going to feel it. That’s more important to me than some plot twist or contrivance. I just want people to feel things, and in order to do that, they have to identify with the characters.How did you arrive at that scene here, knowing it would have to come from the Lovings, who opted not to attend the Supreme Court hearings?The back half of the film was a real question mark for me. In the documentary, the back third of the film downshifts into the court case, as it should. And it’s fascinating. But since I made such a strict decision to stick to their point of view, I wanted to see their lives in hiding.There’s not a lot of information about that time period. I’m sure there were more harrowing details that happened to them that I’m just not aware of, but I didn’t want to contrive things, so I really focused on the psychological threat that they had to be living under in hiding during this period in this very dangerous place. I read this quote from Mildred before she passed away that’s at the end of the film: “I miss him. He took care of me.” It seemed like such a beautiful thing to say because if you really look at their relationship, and if you look at the fact that Mildred is the more active of the two characters in terms of getting the case in front of the Supreme Court, ultimately, she is the active character. But she says he took care of her. I think Richard ― and this speaks to the cult of domesticity in that period ― felt an obligation to take care of and provide for his family, like so many people do. He was emasculated in that effort. He was not allowed to do that. I thought how frustrating that must have been for a man like that and how heartbreaking that must have been.You see that it’s not just about “he can take care of her” ― it’s about “they take care of each other.” What a beautiful idea. As soon as I had that quote at the end and that moment there in the back third of the film [where Richard tells Mildred he can take care of her], I felt like I had something. I don’t think we see Richard and Mildred say the words “I love you” to each other. Then there’s that scene on the porch ― and this isn’t a spoiler, since it’s in the trailer ― where Richard says to the lawyer, “You tell the judge I love my wife.” There is such power in that because of the muted affection they display. How conscious were you in building to that moment?It was not a conscious effort. There wasn’t a “love” removal pass on the script. But I’m married. I’m seven years in. When you start to add time, you start to understand where the real love comes from, and it’s not from platitudes. Everybody needs to hear it. I tell my wife I love her all the time. But it really comes from these examples of love, these demonstrations of love in very small moments.I think marriage is a lot about commitment, and they very much had the opportunity to just divorce one another and quote-unquote solve this problem. They made a conscious choice not to. They made a conscious choice to stay committed to each other through this process. That was the ultimate thing. I guess as I was laying out scenes, there was an innate approach to what I would consider the real examples of “I love you,” which are these smaller ones. To just have them say it, maybe that’s not good enough for the audience, and maybe not fair enough of a representation of how they felt about each other. And then you have the fact that it’s Richard Loving. That guy probably doesn’t walk around saying “I love you” a lot, even though he feels it.Just a couple of days ago, it was announced that you’re directing a reboot of “Alien Nation” for Fox. Given all this talk of small movies, how comfortable do you feel stepping into the territory of a blockbuster-ish remake?My hope is it goes back to your first question about when you first heard about “Loving.” The hope is you will feel the same way about that. But that project is in its infancy, so TBD.“Loving” opens in theaters on Nov. 4. This interview has been edited and condensed. "

The $3.7 billion development has prompted mass protests led by members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, who say their sovereignty will be trampled and their water supply imperiled if the project goes through.The AFL-CIO has said in recent years that it wants to link arms with other major liberal players on issues like civil rights and racial and environmental justice. But it also must answer to its member unions. Some of those unions ― particularly in the construction trades ― support energy projects like the Dakota Access pipeline because they create jobs for union members. There has been a similar friction within labor throughout the Keystone XL controversy.The Laborers’ International Union of North America, or LiUNA, has been the most vocal supporter of the Dakota Access pipeline within the AFL-CIO. LiUNA has accused the protesters of being “extremists” who trespass, intimidate and endanger its members working on the project.In its statement Thursday, the AFL-CIO said the pipeline provides “high-quality jobs” and makes the U.S. “more competitive.” It also argued that the project “addresses the threat of climate change.”“Pipelines are less costly, more reliable and less energy intensive than other forms of transporting fuels, and pipeline construction and maintenance provides quality jobs to tens of thousands of skilled workers,” reads the statement attributed to AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.The federation took heat on Twitter for its support of the Dakota Access project:Three years ago, the AFL-CIO said it was considering a more formal partnership with progressive groups such as the Sierra Club, the National Council of La Raza and the NAACP. “It used to be your issues and my issues,” Trumka told HuffPost at the time. “We want it to be our issues, whether it’s a civil rights issue, a human rights issue, a women’s issue, a race issue or a collective bargaining issue.”Support for the Dakota Access project is hardly uniform among the federation’s unions. The Communications Workers of America, which represents 700,000 people and tends to have progressive politics, issued a statement of solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, saying it would oppose “the environmental and cultural degradation of their community.”“The labor movement is rooted in the simple and powerful idea of solidarity with all struggles for dignity, justice and respect,” the CWA said."
9,ARTS & CULTURE,You Can Now Take A Dump In A Solid-Gold Toilet And Call It Art,Katherine Brooks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/golden-toilet-guggenheim_us_57dc0d4ce4b08cb1409548dd,"Let's talk about that toilet and what it means as ""art.""",2016-09-16,"Maurizio Cattelan, “America,” 2016, Gold, 72.4 x 35.6 x 68.6 cm. (Courtesy Marian Goodman Gallery, copyright Maurizio Cattelan.)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57dc0e281800002f003150be.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s easy to mistake New York’s newest site-specific artwork for a common toilet.That would be because Maurizio Cattelan’s “America” looks and functions exactly like a commode, save for the fact that it’s cast in solid gold. Yes, if you so wish, you can defecate into Cattelan’s luxury appliance, fulfilling your morose dream to shit on a piece of contemporary art.You’ll just have to pay the compulsory $15 admission fee at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum to do so.”America” ― henceforth referred to as The Toilet ― sits in one of the Guggenheim’s actual restrooms, awaiting patrons in dire need of a pee. Eager users will find a security guard posted outside the public space, making sure Cattalan’s work is kept clean and free of enthusiastic tributes to its splendor vandalism. According to Fox News, the golden throne will require cleaning crews to use medical wipes to clean The Toilet after each user, regularly steaming and polishing it to keep the 18-karat glimmer in check.But what are we actually to make of what appears to be a simple golden toilet masquerading as art? The Toilet functions as an homage to Marcel Duchamp’s “Fountain,” that other famous artsy receptacle ― a ready-made sculpture that looked just like a urinal, because it was one. According to the Guggenheim, The Toilet also alludes to Piero Manzoni’s “Artist’s Shit (1961),” for which Manzoni supposedly sold his own excrement for a cost equivalent to its own weight in gold. (Cans of his excrement ended up at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Tate museum in London.)Other artists have dabbled in the realm where human waste meets art before Cattalan. Tobias “Tobi” Wong created a pill that would allegedly turn a wealth-loving individual’s feces into sparkling packages. And, of course, who can forget “Piss Christ,” a 1987 photograph that depicted a plastic crucifix submerged in a jar of artist Andre Serrano’s own urine.Cattelan was born to a working class family in Padua, Italy, in 1960, and is known for making playful sculptures that illicit an immediate “WTF?” His “La Nona Ora (The Ninth Hour)” shows the figure of Pope John Paul II lying on the ground after having been struck by a meteorite.His Toilet, a touch less absurd than the sci-fi sculpture of a pope, is meant to provoke much more than a satisfied trip to the loo. According to The Guggenheim:The new work makes available to the public an extravagant luxury product seemingly intended for the one percent. Its participatory nature, in which viewers are invited to make use of the fixture individually and privately, allows for an experience of unprecedented intimacy with an artwork. Cattelan’s toilet offers a wink to the excesses of the art market, but also evokes the American dream of opportunity for all, its utility ultimately reminding us of the inescapable physical realities of our shared humanity.The artist himself has a similarly serious explanation:“There’s the risk that people will think of it as a joke, maybe, but I don’t see it as a joke,” he explained to The New York Times. “I was born in a [low-income] condition where I was — how do you say? — forced to think about that. It’s not my job to tell people what a work means. But I think people might see meaning in this piece.”On the one hand, it’s hard not to see The Toilet as an opportunity for those frustrated with the state of contemporary art ― It’s indulgent! It’s arbitrary! It doesn’t reflect the thoughts or cares of the common people! ― to feel validated in their beliefs. Plus, The Toilet allows these dissenters to come face-to-face with their enemy and perform one of the most triumphant acts in its presence: taking a dump in its face.And perhaps Cattalan is aware of the allure. Maybe he’s tempting the loudest decriers, luring them into the confines of an art museum to gawk at the thing they hate most. “Gotcha!” Cattalan could say. Because in the process, he’s brought reluctant new patrons to a space filled with objects beyond a gaping gold toilet. Maybe they won’t like “America,” but what about art from the Middle East and North Africa, or an exhibition dedicated to Frank Lloyd Wright?As The New York Times has already pointed out, The Toilet seems especially relevant today, when a presidential candidate with a penchant for gold-plated decor continues to campaign for dangerous immigration reform and an incomplete maternity leave policy.If you think a golden toilet in the middle of the Guggenheim is a ridiculous spectacle, what do you make of Donald Trump?"
10,GREEN,"Thanks To Technology, You Might Soon Know Where Your Seafood Actually Comes From",Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/seafood-traceability-technology_us_57db9fa2e4b04a1497b3960f,"Better traceability in a notoriously opaque seafood industry could save our oceans, experts say.",2016-09-16,"A prospective buyer inspects the quality of frozen tuna before an auction at Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, Japan on Jan. 5, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Millions of people worldwide depend on seafood to survive. An estimated 450 million people get their primary source of food from the ocean, and according to the World Bank, fishing makes up at least 10 percent of the global economy.But for all its popularity and importance, the seafood industry’s supply chain is notoriously opaque, complex and plagued with problems, including illegal fishing and seafood fraud, which can seriously deplete fish populations and harm marine habitats.Seafood lovers often have no idea where their fish or shrimp were caught, and even whether or not their snapper was the real McCoy.Thanks to improved technology, together with the efforts of businesses, nonprofits and governments, however, “ocean-to-table” visibility is fast becoming a reality. And this, experts say, may help save our ailing seas.During an innovation in seafood event last year, one participant called the seafood industry “the most antiquated” he’d ever seen when it comes to traceability.“This industry reminds me of thick San Francisco fog,” said Mark Barnekow, CEO of BluWrap, a seafood transportation company — a fog that’s served to mask a slew of entrenched problems.Pirate fishing, for one, is a global concern. Up to $12 billion worth of seafood is caught illegally by pirates every year, according to the State Department. Pirate fishing is linked to enormous environmental impacts, including destructive fishing practices, as well as drug and human trafficking and other crimes.Overfishing is another major worry. Secretary of State John Kerry called the problem “gigantic” in an interview this week.“A third of the world’s fisheries are overfished, and the ones that aren’t overfished are at max, with more and more demand,” he told The Washington Post. “Half of the world’s population, basically, relies on protein from the ocean to survive. It’s an ecosystem that requires sustainability to survive, and we’re not treating it in a sustainable fashion.”Then there’s seafood fraud. A recent Oceana report revealed just how staggering this problem is: 1 in 5 of the more than 25,000 seafood samples surveyed in the study was found to be mislabeled. In many cases, the fish were actually cheaper, less desirable fish than the labeling indicated. Troublingly, 16 percent of fish mislabeled as other species were found to be vulnerable, or even endangered, species.“There are few controls right now in the seafood supply chain so it’s really easy to pull a bait and switch,” Beth Lowell, a senior campaign director at Oceana, told National Geographic this month.Until recently, consumers had few options for recourse as they waded through the murky waters of the world of seafood, making sustainability an especially challenging goal to fulfil. Was that shrimp dinner you ate caught by pirates in West Africa? Or, was the apparently green-friendly U.S.-farmed snapper you bought at the supermarket actually mislabeled? With an industry so lacking in traceability, such questions had been near-impossible to answer.“The seafood industry hasn’t come up to speed in understanding the farm-to-table movement; it’s a dinosaur that’s mostly written out on fish tickets, ordered over the phone, and relationship-based,” said Sean Dimin, co-founder of seafood sustainability company Sea-To-Table at a New York event this year. But technology is now bringing change and more visibility to this long-opaque sector. Just this week, a new, free and potentially industry-changing online tracker called Global Fishing Watch was launched, a collaborative effort between Oceana, Google and the nonprofit SkyTruth.The satellite-based surveillance system allows consumers, researchers and regulators to track tens of thousands of commercial fishing trawlers all over the globe almost in real time. “You can slice [this] data in many different ways which we think will be helpful when it comes to law enforcement, increasing public understanding, and catching the kind of people who are doing stuff they shouldn’t be doing,” Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of Oceana in Europe, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation of the tracker’s potential.Other traceability tools and services have emerged in recent years to help consumers have more insight into the seafood they’re eating. Conservation organization Ecotrust, for instance, has launched a traceability software platform called ThisFish that allows fisherman to attach tracking codes to fish they catch. Consumers can then use their smartphone, tablet or computer to read the code, and learn exactly where the fish came from and the people who harvested it. FairAgora Asia, a company based in Bangkok, is developing a software platform that monitors and displays social and environmental data on fisheries. North Carolina-based TRUfish is working on a subscription service that offers retailers DNA testing of fish ― a service that could better assure customers of the authenticity of seafood in stores. Despite progress in this area, however, traceability in the seafood industry is still in its infancy. Paper-based tracing is still commonplace, and in remote areas where some fishermen work, the internet or even cellphone connection can be hard to come by. Some information is “theoretically there but it’s almost impossible to access and difficult to verify,” Timothy Moore, an advisor for the U.S. Agency for International Development, told USA Today. Still, it seems change is underway ― and it’s not just in seafood but in the food industry as a whole. In 2014, Allied Market Research said the market for food traceability products and technologies would grow to an estimated $14.1 billion by 2019. “Food traceability is becoming a norm for all food producers across the globe as a result of consumer demands and government regulations concerning food safety,” the company wrote. This, experts say, is great news for the world’s oceans ― and for the people who rely on them to survive. Depleted fish stocks, for example, could bounce back if destructive and illegal practices are curbed, Gustavsson of Oceana told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.“If we do all the right things now,” he said, “in 10 years we will have twice as much fish in the ocean globally.” "

She’s allowed to speak what she thinks. I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on other things,” he said. “I don’t talk about it anymore. The reason I don’t is because then everyone is going to be talking about it as opposed to jobs, the military, the vets, security.” Read the full Washington Post interview here.Trump made similar remarks earlier this month.The GOP presidential candidate is the most well-known proponent of what’s known as the birther movement. Throughout Obama’s first years in office, Trump continuously badgered the White House to release detailed information on the president’s birth, going so far as to claim he’d sent investigators to Hawaii. And while the White House did release Obama’s “long form” birth certificate in 2011, Trump has never explicitly denounced the theory.“Well I don’t know. Was it a birth certificate? You tell me. Some people say that was not his birth certificate,” Trump told ABC News’ Jonathan Karl in 2013. “I’m saying I don’t know. Nobody knows. And you don’t know either, Jonathan. You’re a smart guy. You don’t know either.”Republican vice presidential candidate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) has split with his running mate on the issue.“I believe Barack Obama was born in Hawaii,” he said last week. “I accept his birthplace. I just don’t know where he’s coming from on foreign policy and on economics and on Obamacare.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
12,POLITICS,Most Of Mitt Romney's Biggest Donors Are Sitting Out The Presidential Election,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-mitt-romney-donors_us_57db1095e4b08cb140949e1a,And just 10 percent of them have bothered to give to Donald Trump.,2016-09-16,Many elite Republican donors have not yet given to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57db12db130000930639c4ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Republican Party’s last presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, has been forthright about his opposition to the party’s current nominee, Donald Trump. It appears that most of Romney’s biggest donors feel the same way.A review of campaign finance records finds that just slightly more than 10 percent of the 22,000 donors who gave $5,000 or more to Romney’s 2012 presidential bid had donated to Trump’s campaign by the end of July. On the other hand, about 1 percent, or more than 260, of Romney’s largest donors contributed to the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.The underwhelming financial support from these major donors demonstrates the split Trump’s nomination has caused between the Republican Party’s elite and its voter base. While the real estate mogul has about the same percentage of support from GOP voters as Clinton has from Democratic voters, it’s the Republican donor class that has largely not gotten on board with his candidacy.Those who supported Romney with big contributions in 2012 but have not donated to Trump include a who’s who of major party donors. Billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, hedge fund billionaires Paul Singer and Ken Griffin, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts, former Anheuser-Busch chairman August Busch III, Oracle CEO Lawrence Ellison and others like David Humphreys, John W. Childs, Stan Herzog, Robert Rowling and Julian Robertson have so far kept their pocketbooks shut.Adelson endorsed Trump earlier in the summer and was reportedly willing to spend $100 million to ensure his victory. But by the end of July, he had not made any contribution to either the Trump campaign or any pro-Trump super PAC. The casino billionaire gave more than $100 million to super PACs in 2012 and reportedly made eight-figure donations to dark money nonprofit groups helping to protect Republican congressional majorities.Frank Vandersloot, the billionaire owner of the multi-level marketing nutritional supplement company Melaleuca and a major Romney donor, also expressed support for Trump, but has failed to make a donation by late July. “Who knows if he’ll need our money?” he told Politico.Many of the biggest donors who are avoiding Trump donated to one or more of the Republican opponents he savaged in the primary campaign. There is still lingering animosity over the way Trump ran roughshod over their preferred candidates with his typical barrage of insults and campaigned toward the basest prejudices in the electorate. This is especially true of those who supported former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a large number of whom were major Romney donors.“Most of them are shot in the head,” a longtime Republican Party operative who raised money for Bush this cycle and Romney in 2012 said about Bush’s donors. “The whole Jeb experience was so bizarre in terms of how unsuccessful it was and how out of place all of us were with the sentiment that I think a lot of us are just, ‘Let this year be over.’”And Trump attacked many of the donors themselves over the course of the primary campaign.“Paul Singer. Take a look at what he represents,” Trump told a crowd in New Hampshire after Singer backed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s primary campaign. “And he represents other things, beside. Paul Singer represents amnesty and he represents illegal immigration pouring into the country.”Trump asked in one tweet whether those attending the Koch brothers’ annual donor meeting in California were puppets. In another tweet, he said that Adelson was supporting Rubio ― he wasn’t ― because “he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!” Even without these major party donors, Trump appears to have raised significant sums for his campaign and the Republican Party thanks to some big money donors and large hauls from small donors. He reportedly raised $90 million in August after pulling in more than $80 million in July. The only problem is that these sums are far behind what Romney raised during the same months in 2012, and they also still trail Clinton’s totals. Further, they do little to help cut into Clinton’s advantage in campaign infrastructure.A handful of former Romney donors have flipped to support Clinton ― often citing Trump’s coarse language and blatantly racist rhetoric and policies.Massachusetts hedge fund billionaire Seth Klarman announced his support for Clinton in August. He called Trump’s statements throughout the campaign “shockingly unacceptable” and said he would donate to and fundraise for the Clinton campaign.Klarman had given $10,000 to Romney and a joint fundraising committee supporting Romney’s campaign in 2012, and he remains a prominent Republican super PAC donor. He has also been a major supporter of the Israeli right wing and U.S. groups that opposed the Iran deal negotiated by Clinton, Secretary of State John Kerry and President Barack Obama. Still, he gave $2,700 to the Clinton campaign in June. Other donors who have gone from Romney to Clinton have also made their views of the Republican nominee publicly known on social media.Bob Arum, a boxing promoter, contributed $10,000 to support Romney in 2012 and has so far donated $16,700 to support the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party. Arum has made his distaste for Trump clear multiple times on Twitter this year, including after the Republican candidate doubled down on his hardline anti-immigrant policies.In July 2015, during the Republican primary campaign, comScore chairman and co-founder Magid Abraham, who gave $25,000 to support Romney, tweeted that Trump was “an embarrassment to this nation.” Four months later, Abraham and his wife Linda Abraham, also a co-founder of comScore, donated $2,700 each to the Clinton campaign.However, Clinton’s fundraising from ex-Romney donors may only just be getting started.In August, Meg Whitman, head of Hewlett-Packard and a major fundraiser for Romney in 2012, publicly endorsed Clinton, stating she would raise money for her. Whitman further called Trump “a dishonest demagogue.” The billionaire tech executive ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2010 and lost to current Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat who has also endorsed Clinton.Mike Fernandez, the founder of MBF Healthcare Partners, previously gave $3 million to Romney’s super PAC and $3 million to the super PAC supporting Bush this cycle. Yet, like Whitman, he announced he was endorsing Clinton in August but had not yet donated to her campaign. In his endorsement of Clinton in The Miami Herald, Fernandez wrote, “As a Republican who has contributed millions of dollars to the party’s causes, I ask: Why has our party not sought a psychological evaluation of its nominee?”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Encinia, who arrested Bland, was arraigned on a misdemeanor perjury charge.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― An attorney for the family of Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old black woman who was found hanging in her jail cell days after she was arrested during a traffic stop, announced Thursday that they’d reached a $1.9 million settlement over her death.But while Bland’s 2015 death and news of the settlement drew national attention, hundreds of people are still dying unnoticed in jails across the country.More than 800 people have died in jail in the year since Bland’s death, a Huffington Post analysis found. Many of these deaths were preventable. At least one-third of those people died within three days of being arrested or booked in jail, and nearly one-third of the total deaths were suicides.Video of Bland’s arrest showed a white state trooper trying to grab her out of her car after she refused to put out a cigarette. She died just days later in jail, and Texas officials ruled it a suicide.The circumstances of Bland’s death fit a disturbingly common pattern. Many people who die in jail are not yet convicted of a crime, and their charges may never result in real prison time. But jail, nonetheless, can have a devastating impact on a person’s psyche, particularly if he or she has a pre-existing mental health or drug issue.“I really didn’t do anything to somebody in there to be denigrated as a human being, to be disrespected as a woman,” said Donyale Thomas, a 32-year-old mother living on a fixed income in Berkeley, Missouri, who was jailed in March 2011 after failing to pay hundreds of dollars in fines for municipal code violations. Thomas attempted suicide, but staff intervened. (Berkeley Police Chief Frank McCall called Thomas’ suicide attempt an effort “to get out of jail.”) “You have all kinds of things going through your head, so it gets to the point where you think, ‘OK, I just want to find my way out of this,’” Thomas said. It’s a misconception that if an inmate wants to take his or her own life, there is nothing that can be done to stop it. Jail suicides are highly preventable when adequate protocols, like comprehensive screening and regular observation, are in place. When a suicide occurs, it’s often because something went wrong. In Bland’s case, numerous problems were found at the jail where she died. Bland told staff about a prior suicide attempt, which should have triggered close observation. A guard also said he lied about when Bland was checked on, according to the Bland family’s lawyer. (A Waller County attorney disputed this characterization.)Bland’s mother, Geneva Reed-Veal, on Thursday emphasized in an interview with NPR that she is more interested in changes that are going to occur as a result of the settlement agreement, rather than any money.“It’s always been about that other mother who’s lost their child as well across this country,” she said.The Bland family attorney told reporters that Waller County jail agreed to make a number of changes as a result of the settlement, including requiring cell sensors to ensure adequate inmate monitoring. On Thursday, officials contested that an agreement had been finalized, and the Waller County attorney told The New York Times that “defendants also emphasize they vigorously deny any fault or wrongdoing, and the potential settlement does not involve any such admissions.”Other changes have been made in county jails statewide in the wake of Bland’s death, including the introduction of an improved intake screening form. Last year, there were 33 suicides in county jails in Texas. This year, as of June, there had been eight.But jails don’t always make improvements until it’s too late. In March, 22-year-old Marcus Johnson, arrested for possession of a fake ID, hung himself in jail with the drawstring of his pants. Prior to his death, he told officers he had attempted suicide three times, including a few weeks earlier, and had previously been institutionalized. His mother also called the jail and said her son needed psychiatric medication. But Johnson wasn’t checked on for over two hours. After his death, Michael Whaley, the Burkburnett city manager, told HuffPost that department-wide training would be conducted. Just this week, a woman whose 21-year-old son took his own life at a Nevada jail in June questioned how he was able to do so while on suicide watch. The 21-year-old was arrested for disturbing the peace and not being on a sidewalk, according to Fox5.One reason it’s so difficult to identify which jails are having problems is that the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which counts fatalities, doesn’t release jail-specific data. Instead, this information is published in aggregate form. That means if multiple suicides occur at one jail over a short period of time, there may be no outside scrutiny — unless there is a high-profile case like Bland’s. Reed-Veal said earlier this year that her family’s tragedy had motivated her to fight for the other women dying in the nation’s jails.“I will continue to speak for every mother paralyzed because of the loss of their child,” she said."

The longest insurgency in the Americas ended in September 2016 when left-wing guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) announced the beginning of a bilateral cease-fire with the government. It leaves behind 220,000 dead and nearly 7 million people forced from their homes. There are more internally displaced people in Colombia than in Syria.Jorge Ariza is one of them. He was, like the majority of the conflict’s victims, a peasant farmer, or campesino. It was a life of hard toil in Chaparral, Tolima, a hamlet nestled in Colombia’s central mountain range, long held by FARC rebels. He and his family farmed yuca, the starchy vegetable eaten across the Andean Cone.“We never had any problems with the FARC,” Ariza said. “It’s a rural area completely abandoned by the state, and so the people grew up living with the guerrillas, respecting them.”That changed after the turn of the century when the Colombian military upped its offensive against the rebels. In Ariza’s home area, firefights between the army and rebels became a daily phenomenon.“I would lay awake at night listening to the sounds of bullets and bombs,” he said. “You can’t live like that; you can’t relax.”Ariza fled with his two young children in October 2006, after the military tried to coerce him into giving away rebel locations. “It was impossible for us to remain neutral. I didn’t want to help either side.”Ariza reserves some of the blame for Alvaro Uribe, the president of Colombia at the time. He came to power promising a “firm hand” against the country’s leftist guerrilla groups. His father, a wealthy landowner, had been murdered by the FARC, and many saw his fervor as personal.Uribe was true to his word. He ramped up military offensives against rebels hiding in the mountains and jungles, as well as the cities. Paramilitary groups with links to the state – often acting alongside the army – carried out massacres in rebel-dominated areas, pushing out entire communities. The number of people forced from their homes and communities peaked in 2002, when 412,553 people were forcibly displaced.Since then the conflict has waned. Uribe demobilized the paramilitary umbrella organization the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) in 2006. His successor, President Juan Manuel Santos, launched a tentative peace process with the FARC. Those dialogues, which lasted nearly four years in Havana, Cuba, reached an apparently successful conclusion last week. While Santos’ deal with rebels still needs to be approved by a referendum – the first time in history a peace treaty has been put to the public – many voters are suspicious of the FARC’s intentions.“I don’t know which [way] to vote, or if I even if I will,” said Ariza. “It’s hard to trust anyone in this conflict.”Ariza, like so many of those displaced, headed for Bogota, Colombia’s sprawling, smoggy capital city, hoping to make enough money to buy some land in the countryside and return to farming. He rented a home in Ciudad Bolivar, an overcrowded hillside slum. The neglected neighborhood is home to tens of thousands of displaced people, living in shacks of scrap wood and metal, often sheltered from the elements by asbestos roofs – with few even aware of the danger this poses.Ariza found the adjustment to city life difficult. “Campesinos don’t have the skills for the city, so the only work I could find was in construction.” Those displaced often work in the black economy, constructing ritzy apartment buildings and country houses for Bogota’s wealthy. The work is low-paid and the hours are long. Ariza would make a little less than $9 a day, leaving at 4 a.m. every morning and returning to his children at 11 p.m.After five years, he gave up hope of returning to the rural yuca fields and resigned himself to raising his children in Ciudad Bolivar. “It’s all I wanted, it was my focus, to get back to the fields, to get back to Tolima, but the money was never there.”He now leads a community of the displaced in his adopted neighborhood and manufactures and sells cleaning products after years of barely scraping by on his earnings as a construction worker.Ciudad Bolivar was also home to Olga Betancourt, who works with the National Association of Displaced Persons (ANDESCOL). “It’s a horrible place, because it’s on the outskirts and there’s extreme poverty,” she said in her modest office in downtown Bogota. “It doesn’t feel like you are fully part of the city there.”Betancourt added that the lack of jobs for residents of Ciudad Bolivar leads many to crime and drug addiction. “You can see the desperation on the streets, people with nothing to do.”Betancourt’s own story of displacement began in her home village of El Castillo, in Colombia’s eastern plains. It was ransacked by paramilitaries in 2002, and she ended up in the squalor of Ciudad Bolivar. She found a way to survive in the slum and eventually to escape. Many of her fellow villagers did not. “There were 12,000 people in El Castillo, but today only half remain.”She hopes to return to her home on the plains, as do her family, but she worries about the possibility of repercussions from armed groups there.There are many cases where communities return home and are either driven out again or murdered, she says. “I remember one case, where a collective of 70 people went back to the fields and all of them were massacred.”Her organization ANDESCOL works to provide visibility for such vulnerable communities. There is a legal route to reacquiring land stolen by armed groups, though critics says it is ineffective.Amnesty International has repeatedly called on Colombian authorities to speed up the bureaucratic processes and ensure physical and financial security for those returning.It concluded a 2014 report on land restitution by saying: “Handing over a land title and sending people on their way is not enough.”Viviana Ferro, deputy director of Colombia’s governmental unit for victims, argues that that while there is a comprehensive route to register as a victim and reclaim land or receive compensation, the process is long and many are unwilling to submit to it. “Many people fear the stigma that registering as a victim could bring them,” she said in her office overlooking downtown Bogota, with Ciudad Bolivar in the distance. “Or worse, they fear reprisal from the armed groups victimizing them.”The peace deal, which Betancourt is campaigning in favor of, also promises a fund for returning land to millions of farmers forced to flee but it is conditional on the Havana accords passing a public referendum. The outcome of the vote on October 2 is far from clear.“If there’s a Yes vote, there will be more resources to get people home. It’s for that reason that we are out in the streets every day getting the message across,” said Betancourt.But she worries that decades of atrocities, kidnaps, land grabs and conflict has left her country deeply divided: “Lots of people will vote No because they don’t trust the FARC, but they are not the ones forced to run away from war. They are not the ones who will send their children to fight.”This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.

In a Washington Post interview published Thursday evening, Trump described CNN’s Anderson Cooper as “very biased” and said he shouldn’t be allowed to moderate a debate. “I don’t think Anderson Cooper should be a moderator because Anderson Cooper works for CNN and over the last couple of days, I’ve seen how Anderson Cooper behaves,” Trump said.Despite his unhappiness with the moderator situation, the Republican presidential candidate still plans to attend the debate.“He’ll be very biased, very biased. I don’t think he should be a moderator. I’ll participate, but I don’t think he should be a moderator. CNN is the Clinton News Network and Anderson Cooper, I don’t think he can be fair.”Cooper will co-moderate the second debate, scheduled for Oct. 9, with ABC’s Martha Raddatz. If history is any indication, Cooper is likely to be tough on both candidates.On Monday, he took Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to task for not coming clean about her pneumonia diagnosis sooner. And last year, the CNN host made headlines for being tough on her at a Democratic debate. At one point, he confronted Clinton on her history of changing positions on key issues, asking: “Will you say anything to get elected?”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Steve King (R-Iowa) accused Kaepernick of “activism sympathetic to ISIS.” It’s unclear whether the lawmaker also thinks the students at Mission High School are terrorists.In any case, Harris and the boys at Mission have a slew of local and national athletes behind them. NFL teams from the Seattle Seahawks to the Miami Dolphins have knelt, stood arm-in-arm or raised their fists in solidarity. Three black volleyball players from West Virginia University Tech knelt before a game. Professional soccer player Megan Rapinoe joined in (though U.S. Soccer has aired its frustration with her protest). The list goes on.These athletes haven’t just started a discussion ― they’ve inspired action. The 49ers announced plans to donate $1 million to charities focused on racial issues after Kaepernick pledged $1 million of his own money to underserved communities. Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall pledged $300 for every tackle he makes to local organizations “that benefit the Denver community and others through the services, awareness and funds they provide for these critical social issues.”And their advocacy shows no signs of stopping. “Throughout the nation, athletes on different levels are finding their voice and recognizing that they have a platform,” Jeremi Duru, a professor of sports law at American University’s law school in Washington, told the Chronicle. “We haven’t seen this level of athlete activism in nearly half a century. This is a movement.”"

The judge said Gutierrez failed to introduce evidence that called into question cell tower data placing Syed in the vicinity of the murder scene.Last month, Maryland’s attorney general appealed the June order and charged that Syed shouldn’t get a new trial in the absence of “new evidence” or a “change in law” since he was convicted. But the criminal defense organizations are asking the appeals court to subject the state’s request to “rigorous scrutiny” and deny it ― in the interests of justice and the “millions” of podcast listeners who may now doubt that Syed murdered Lee.The story of Syed’s 1999 trial and murder conviction captivated listeners of the first season of “Serial,” which first aired in 2014. In the podcast, journalist and creator Sarah Koenig raised questions about Syed’s guilt and how the state of Maryland conducted its prosecution.In light of the renewed interest in the case, the lawyer organizations say Maryland owes it to the public to get Syed’s trial right the second time around.“Millions will continue to passionately believe that the Maryland criminal justice system failed Mr. Syed, and that he would prevail in a fair trial with competent counsel,” the groups’ brief read. “The only satisfactory way to resolve the debate between the believers and doubters is through a retrial.”Read the brief below."

To finance a deal greater than $10 million, the five-person board needs to approve the agreement, which it’s been unable to do because three of the five seats on the board remain vacant.Without a three-person quorum, the Export-Import Bank can’t approve high-dollar deals, and Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), the Senate banking chairman, has said he will oppose the appointment of any new board members because he is ideologically against the credit agency.Reports that Democrats are trying to include provisions removing the three-person quorum requirement prompted groups like Heritage Action, Club for Growth and Freedom Partners to write a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) urging them to oppose the measure.“Attaching this quorum change to a continuing resolution is the latest in a line of efforts that subvert Congressional processes,” the letter said Friday. “This provision would subvert the Senate approval process for board members of the Export-Import Bank and set a concerning precedent for future accountability.”The groups argue that the policy rider is unrelated to government funding and would allow the Export-Import Bank to make larger loans with less oversight. Although the language could be a sticking point in the negotiations over a continuing resolution, it’s hardly the only issue. Conservatives also oppose any provision to address the Zika virus that would fund Planned Parenthood. Democrats argue that the virus can be sexually transmitted, and therefore, money for Planned Parenthood to prevent the spread of Zika is appropriate. But many Republicans have taken a hard stand against any funding for the family planning organization.Conservatives are also opposed to the term of the government funding bill. While Democrats and some Republicans want a short-term bill that would allow Congress to return after Election Day to make spending decisions, conservatives want a longer-term bill that would allow a new Congress ― and a new president ― to ultimately decide what government funding looks like.The problem for conservatives, however, is that their opposition to the continuing resolution is basically taken for granted. If Democrats are expected to supply the majority of the votes for the funding bill, and if their votes are needed to keep the government funded past Sept. 30, conservative members have little leverage in the negotiations.Asked on Thursday what conservatives could do to affect funding decisions if they had no leverage, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) agreed there was “not a whole lot” they could do.“We can make the argument, and we can see how December plays out,” Jordan said, “which is what we’re going to do.”"

He doesn’t necessarily believe in realism, either. And he certainly doesn’t believe in the spirit of Christmas. He believes in “Dollars and Sense” (as his signature song goes) and without him, Dragonslayer would not be the homage to The Twilight Zone that it is. There are countless plays that make use of one location (just ask Harold Pinter or Edward Albee to name a few of their favorites), but few of these plays, however esteemed or obscure, are struck by the flavor of purgatory as Dragonslayer, with its characters on a passage to somewhere (though they know not where) beyond a fresh job search or even their untethered grief. The proceedings are startlingly reminiscent of the classic episode “Five Characters in Search of An Exit.” And in a place where nothing––and no one––is what it seems, the recriminations between Slade and the restaurant staff, not to mention the commentary from outsiders such as a police officer (Paul Chamberlain) with a crush on a husband-happy regular diner patron (Erin Clancy-Balsamo) and an emotionally shattered 9/11 first responder (Steve Walsh), boast a peculiar uncertainty not entirely dissimilar to “Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?”All of this drama peaks the moment our characters become privy to a host of phenomena some might call miracles, but that others might refer to as classic deus ex machina. Is it ridiculous? Does it matter? We’re talking about 9/11 here, after all. How could you not want the literal hand of God to whisk these people away from the unease of their status as the lost generation of the new millennia? If everything’s eventual, in the world according to Dragonslayer, there are no surprises, nor are there accidents.This is not to say that the musical does not successfully strike notes of authentic pathos, particularly in its second act. If the show threatens to lose you in the first act, then the Duchess’s plea that you “Don’t Go Up the Stairs” will move you. Should Damon Slade infuriate you, he will ooze his way into your heart with delectably soulless aplomb thanks to John Mervini’s characterization. And should you doubt Chris’s childlike innocence, Steffen Whorton’s vocals will charm you into creating your own fables. Whorton’s wife, Lindsey Morgan, doubles as a performer (she plays the nearly mute Forgotten One) as well as the production’s social media consultant. While she is never unconvincing, the fact that we hardly get to hear her sing (and I have heard this lady sing) is something I would liken to the loss of a precious natural resource. The rest of the actors hit various highs and lows. In true ensemble fashion, they support and listen to each other beautifully. If it looks like everyone respects their material, it’s because they do. If it looks like they’re having fun, it’s because they are. In less capable hands, Dragonslayer would have faltered. It’s a timely and surprisingly resonant treat that is never lost in the shadow of the catastrophe from which it was inspired."

The couple filled out the form anyway, but the hospital didn’t input Jessamy’s name into the state records system ― resulting in a birth certificate that listed Chelsea as the sole parent.It wasn’t until May that Wisconsin amended its birth certificate applications to address the Torreses’ situation ― female, same-sex married couples conceiving through artificial insemination ― but the state still kept the word “husband” in other parts of the application or in informational materials. In light of this limited change, Crabb conceded that her ruling is “narrow” in scope and benefits only female married couples who were denied a two-parent birth certificate prior to May. But she said she needs more information from the parties to address exactly who was wronged and needs a two-parent certificate.Still, the judge used her ruling to prod Wisconsin to keep amending its practices to make them “more inclusive,” or else face a new round of litigation.“If the department’s inaction continues, it seems inevitable that more lawsuits will follow, bringing along with them the potential for large bills for attorney fees and even damage awards,” Crabb wrote. “The department should act now to prevent these lawsuits, minimize confusion and provide the equal treatment that same-sex couples are entitled to receive under the law.”"

Legislation passed by the Senate could help Flint rebuild its water system, but it faces a long road before it could become law.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57dac7f51800006c32bd1a7b.jpeg?cache=9kGBRMo9zW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― For months senators have argued over whether they should approve money to help Flint, Michigan, rebuild its contaminated water system. On Thursday, two years after people in the city discovered they were drinking poisonous tap water, the upper chamber acted. Yet Flint will have to keep waiting. There is no official plan to take up the legislation in the House before lawmakers leave at the end of the month for another break ahead of the election. The $220 million aid package, which was wrapped into a larger $10 billion water projects bill, would help cities dealing with crumbling water infrastructures, such as Flint. It passed the Senate 95-3 on Thursday.The measure includes $100 million in grants and loans made available to Flint and other cities that need to replace their lead-contaminated pipes, $70 million in loans to improve water infrastructure across the U.S., and $50 million to boost prevention programs and test water in schools for lead. Earlier this year, Michigan Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D) and Gary Peters (D) pushed for approving emergency funds for Flint. When that didn’t work, they partnered with Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) on the measure that passed Thursday. It provides loan credits for any city dealing with a presidentially declared water infrastructure emergency by redistributing funds from an Energy Department program for advanced vehicles.Stabenow admitted the road to passage was longer than she would have liked. “People have waited way too long,” she told The Huffington Post earlier this week. “So many come up to me and talk about what’s happening in Flint as if it was over. People are still using bottled water to bathe, to cook, to drink with on a daily basis.”Stabenow remains hopeful that the House will take up the Senate bill before members leave at the end of the month. That is unlikely, though. Stabenow speculated that one option is for the House to attach the Senate legislation on a continuing resolution to fund the government, which Congress needs to pass before Oct. 1.Ahead of Thursday’s vote, however, Inhofe and Boxer debated the timing of when the House would ultimately take up the bill and whether the Flint package would be included. Inhofe said House Republicans are eager to go to conference with the Senate on the water resources bill, where they can work on the Flint language to resolve differences between what the two chambers deem acceptable ― meaning the legislation likely wouldn’t reach the president’s desk until after the November election. “So I just want to be clear it would be a shortsighted mistake for those trying to help the people in Flint to prevent the quick movement of [the Water Resources Development Act] in the House so we can conference immediately,” Inhofe said.A handful of House members have pushed back against taking up the larger water resources bill without the money for cities such as Flint attached. Inhofe vowed on Thursday that he would not back down on including the Flint aid when the two chambers work out their differences on the bill. Boxer said Democrats would work with him if it came to that but urged the House to take an easier road. “I would like to simply say to my friends in the House there is a simple way to go: Take up and pass the Senate bill,” she said.Flint’s water has been contaminated with lead since 2014 when the state of Michigan changed the city’s water source to the Flint River. The new water corroded the city’s lead pipes, causing thousands of people to be poisoned. Lead is a dangerous toxin, capable of causing a wide range of health problems, including irreversible brain damage in children. "

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) are among the leaders of a Senate push to add a public option to the health insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d9991b1300002b0039c019.jpeg?cache=69GxXbyMp1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Progressive senators and liberal activist groups plan a renewed effort to achieve what they couldn’t when the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010: Create a “public option” health plan in Obamacare that consumers can choose instead of private insurance.Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are among the leaders of the effort, which also includes three members of the Senate Democratic leadership: Dick Durbin (Ill.), Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and Patty Murray (Wash.). The senators will introduce a resolution Thursday calling for the creation of a public option, and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee will spearhead a grassroots campaign to promote the cause to other senators ― and to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The revival of the public option comes after Clinton and President Barack Obama both endorsed it as a progressive priority this summer, more than six years after liberal lawmakers left it out of the Affordable Care Act after a lengthy debate.Moreover, bad news about Obamacare’s health insurance exchanges ― where premiums appear set to rise significantly for at least some customers and fewer insurers will be offering plans for next year ― has invigorated interest among Democrats and other supporters of the health care law in expanding health coverage and reducing costs.“The Affordable Care Act has already expanded health coverage to millions who were previously uninsured and given countless Americans greater peace of mind,” Merkley said in a written statement provided by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “We should build on this success by driving competition and holding insurance companies accountable with a public, Medicare-like option available to every American.”As he did during his unsuccessful White House bid, Sanders acknowledged the Affordable Care Act’s accomplishments ― namely the historic reduction in the number of uninsured Americans ― and described the public option as the next step toward universal coverage. “The Affordable Care Act has made great progress in helping millions of people get access to health insurance. But at a time when 29 million people are still uninsured, and 31 million are underinsured, we must continue to make needed health care reforms so that the American people can have health care as a right, not a privilege,” Sanders said in a written statement provided by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.The Progressive Change Campaign Committee also shared a portion of the resolution, which Merkley will introduce Thursday, with The Huffington Post in advance of the announcement.Resolved, that the Senate supports efforts to build on the Affordable Care Act by ensuring that, in addition to the coverage options provided by private insurers, every American has access to a public health insurance option which, when established, will strengthen competition, improve affordability for families by reducing premiums and increasing choices, and save American taxpayers billions of dollars.Other sponsors of the resolution include Democratic Sens. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.), Barbara Boxer (Calif.), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) and Al Franken (Minn.).The Progressive Change Campaign Committee also has partnered with other groups to generate support for enacting a public option next year, including MoveOn.org and Democracy for America. These organizations will create a petition for supporters to express their views at a new website, WeWantAPublicOption.com.“We see this as the most significant health care push by Democrats since the passage of Obamacare,” Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Stephanie Taylor said in a written statement.No matter how much muscle Senate Democrats may put behind enacting a public option, the policy faces significant and possibly insurmountable obstacles in the near term.Congressional Republicans continue to focus on repealing all of the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with some other scheme that would provide coverage and financial assistance to far fewer people. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump also backs Obamacare repeal and has outlined a vague alternative that would substantially increase the number of uninsured people.And even if Clinton prevails over Trump in November and Democrats win the Senate, the party faces slim odds of gaining a majority in the House next year."
