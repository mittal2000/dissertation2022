Naomi Moyer, mixed media. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57da90fe180000113cbd1957.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Mary Bibb was born in Rhode Island around 1820 as the daughter of free black Quakers. After becoming one of the first black woman teachers in North America, she involved herself in the anti-slavery movement.However, following the 1850 passing of the Fugitive Slave Law, which demanded that all escaped slaves in America, including her husband, abolitionist Henry Bibb, be returned to their masters upon capture ― even if found in free states ― Bibb moved to Canada. Upon relocating, she and her husband began housing fugitive slaves in their home. Together they started publishing a newspaper, Voice of the Fugitive, the first major paper aimed at black Canadians. Today, Bibb is considered the first black woman journalist in Canada. And yet, most Canadians do not even know her name. Self-taught artist Naomi Moyer, herself a black woman living in Canada, was disturbed by the lack of awareness surrounding figures like Bibb, women that Moyer could identify with and look up to.“The school curriculum here is just as flawed and deficient as it is in the States,” Moyer told The Huffington Post. “Not one teacher, from kindergarten to college, gave me any book to read that was written by a black woman, let alone a black Canadian woman. The only kind of exposure most black people really got about ‘blackness’ or the black experience was through media and pop culture from the States.” Moyer realized that it was extremely important for her to learn the names and stories of the women shaping Canadian black history. If no one else was going to teach her, she would do the research herself. The print series “Black Women in Canada” integrates Moyer’s research with graphic visuals that bring the under-acknowledged heroines to life.“One of my biggest concerns going into this project was getting my facts right,” Moyer said. “A lot of the women that I chose to focus on, even though their stories are paramount ― there was still very little information on them.” Similarly, without access to many photographs of her subjects, Moyer struggled to capture their appearance accurately with little source material. Moyer’s mixed-media works are made with a combination of acrylic, stencils, ink, pencil and paper on Masonite board. In one image, a black-and-white Bibb writes by candlelight, her backdrop a fiery juxtaposition of oranges and purples.Another depicts Rosa Pryor, the first black woman to own a business in Vancouver ― a restaurant called Chicken Inn ― holding a flailing bird, its feathers floating alongside her, before a bulging yellow sun. Other subjects include the Coloured Women’s Club, crediting with coining the term “self help,” and the Black Cross Nurses, who were some of the few healers for black communities in the early 20th century available.Moyer’s artworks ― graphic, vibrant and brimming with passion ― use images to share the histories that might otherwise have gone overlooked. The stories she chose to immortalize don’t adhere to the traditional mainstream narratives of the genius, the hero or the leader. Rather, these women endured the most egregious of conditions to serve their communities and stand up for what’s right in a peaceful, and often quiet, manner. Now, Moyer is doing all she can to make sure these stories are heard and appreciated. “I wanted folks to know that these women were brave and defiant,” she said. “These women were feminists who did lots of radical acts to serve black communities in Canada when the government failed to do so. I wanted to turn the few sentences that were written about these women from history books and online into a huge, colorful punch in the face.”The artist hopes her prints will affect young black women in Canada not used to seeing themselves represented in school lessons and history books. “I’m hoping that, with these posters, the stories of these women will carry on and continue to motivate and inspire.”Browse and purchase Moyer’s prints here."
1,POLITICS,Meet The One Group Of Latinos Who Actually Like Trump,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-miami-cubans-latinos_us_57dfffade4b04a1497b58d00,"The original generation of Cuban exiles from the 1960s are rock solid behind Trump, unlike their children and grandchildren.",2016-09-19,"Cuban exile Santiago Portal shows off his support for Donald Trump earlier this year in Miami's Little Havana. The first general of exiles is the one group of Latinos that supports the GOP presidential candidate, who is strongly disliked by Hispanics generally.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e00a331300002b0039cf53.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LITTLE HAVANA, Miami – In a city where Spanish is the most common language heard, in a neighborhood where English appears second even in a lot of business signage, there resides unyielding support for the presidential candidate most Latinos cannot abide.The old generation of exiles from the days of the 1959 Cuban Revolution ― Republican since they were “betrayed” by Democratic President John F. Kennedy during the botched Bay of Pigs invasion ― appear ready to line up behind the Republican Party once again.“I’m for Trump,” said Ricardo Naranjo, 75, as he pulled open the front door to the landmark Versailles Cuban restaurant in Little Havana, “because I don’t like the other one.”“He’s the person who’s going to bring back this country, bring back law and order,” Peter Fernandez, also 75, said of Donald Trump.Most are fully aware of Trump’s strained relationship with the greater Hispanic community – how he called undocumented immigrants from Mexico “rapists,” how he accused a federal judge of overseeing a fraud lawsuit against Trump of being biased because of his Mexican heritage.“He’s not very tactful, true,” Gustavo Roca, 82, said. “I’ll grant you that.”In their view, though, they have little choice. At Fernandez’s table, they discussed matter-of-factly how the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, had had over 100 people murdered to hide her crimes from Whitewater investigators.“On the one side you have a liar, a crook,” said one of Fernandez’s tablemates, who would not give his name. “On the other we have someone we don’t like a lot. But that’s all we have.”That older generation of Cuban-Americans delivers the good news for Trump in South Florida. The generations that follow – less ideological and more open to supporting Democrats – provide the bad news.In a recent Florida poll done by Bendixen & Amandi, Trump could only muster 43 percent of Cuban-Americans to Hillary Clinton’s 36 percent, with the remainder divided among other candidates and undecided. “This is the lowest we’ve seen for a Republican presidential candidate,” Fernand Amandi said.In contrast, Arizona Sen. John McCain (R) won 65 percent of Cuban-Americans in 2008 against then-Sen. Barack Obama (D), and Mitt Romney (R) won 48 percent against Obama in 2012.Of course, if the undecideds and those supporting other candidates break at the same ratio as those currently backing Trump and Clinton, he would win 54 percent of the Cuban vote – a 6 point improvement over Romney.That, though, is a big if, Amandi said, adding that there’s a better chance that Clinton will consolidate more of the anti-Trump sentiment among the younger generations. “A lot of Cubans locally are not supporting Trump,” he said. “I think Hillary has more room to grow.”Trump is polling abysmally among non-Cuban Latinos nationally, and his campaign’s efforts to fix that have failed so far. Trump was scheduled to meet with Hispanic leaders in Miami Monday afternoon, but the meeting was canceled. Trump campaign officials did not respond to Huffington Post queries regarding the reason for the cancelation. It was the third time since early July that a planned meeting has failed to materialize.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

When a fan on Twitter suggested someone may have handed the purse to a staff member working the event, Abbington responded: The Huffington Post has reached out to a representative for the Emmys and the Microsoft Theater for a comment and will update this post accordingly.

According to the Columbus Police Department, he was shot multiple times after he appeared to pull a handgun from his waistband during an encounter with police after a report of an armed robbery.It was later determined the gun in question was an air pistol that fires BBs - small, metal pellets, not bullets. Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther previously said the BB gun looks “almost identical” to the 9-millimeter Glock semi-automatic handguns carried by city police.“Based on the location and the direction of the wound paths, it is more likely than not that Tyre King was in the process of running away from the shooter or shooters when he suffered all three gunshot wounds,” Diaz said, according to a statement from attorneys Sean Walton and Chanda Brown.City officials referred calls to the Franklin County Coroner’s Office, which said it had not provided any information to Diaz and a determination on the cause and manner of King’s death was pending.Attorneys for King’s family said the coroner’s office has completed the autopsy and told the family the results will not be available for six to eight weeks. The family has called for an independent investigation of the shooting.Diaz described King as a “small-framed adolescent boy,” who was 5-feet tall and weighed less than 100 pounds. He found the boy “suffered three gunshot wounds with entrance paths on the left side of his body, any of which could be determined to have been the cause of death,” the attorneys said.On Saturday, Columbus police arrested Demetrius Emanuel Lee Braxton, 19, in connection with the reported robbery preceding King’s shooting. Braxton was charged with one count of robbery.Braxton and King were two of three suspects police confronted after responding to reports of an armed robbery. Police are still looking for other individuals who might have been with Braxton at the time of the robbery.King’s family members said last week the version of events related by officer Bryan Mason, the nine-year veteran who shot King and has been placed on administrative leave, conflicted with witnesses’ accounts.Progressive group Organize Ohio planned a rally on Monday at Columbus City Hall demanding justice for King.(Reporting by Kim Palmer, Editing by Ben Klayman and Dan Grebler)"

5,THE WORLDPOST,Syria's Military Declares Initial Ceasefire Period Over,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syria-ceasefire-collapse_us_57dfe1fee4b08cb14096a01a,The military did not indicate whether the truce would be reinstated.,2016-09-19,"A boy rides a bicycle near a hole in the ground after an airstrike on Sunday in the rebel-held town of Dael, in Deraa Governorate, Syria September 19, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57dfe26a1800006c32bd250e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BEIRUT, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Syria’s military declared a week-long ceasefire over on Monday and air raids were reported in Aleppo, even as officials from the United States and Russia met behind closed doors in Geneva to try to extend the truce.Syrian or Russian warplanes bombed rebel-held areas in the city of Aleppo and nearby villages, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, reporting a number of dead and injured.The monitoring group said it was not clear if the jets were Syrian or Russian. Moscow supports President Bashar al-Assad with its air force.The raids came as what is likely to be the final attempt by the U.S. administration of President Barack Obama to find a negotiated solution to the five year old civil war appeared close to collapse.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said it was too early to call the ceasefire finished, and the United Nations said that only Washington and Moscow could declare it over, as they were the ones who had originally agreed it.Washington said it was working to extend the truce but called on Russia to first clarify the Syrian army’s statement that it was over.Russian and U.S. officials met in Geneva on Monday and the International Syria Support Group - the countries backing the Syria peace process - were scheduled to meet on Tuesday in New York to assess the ceasefire agreement.But both the Syrian army and the rebels spoke openly of returning to the battlefield.Syria’s army said the seven day truce period had ended. It accused “terrorist groups,” a term the government uses for all insurgents, of exploiting the calm to rearm while violating the ceasefire 300 times, and vowed to “continue fulfilling its national duties in fighting terrorism in order to bring back security and stability.”Asked about the army’s statement, Kerry told reporters in New York that the seven days of calm and aid deliveries envisaged in the truce had not yet taken place.“It would be good if they didn’t talk first to the press but if they talked to the people who are actually negotiating this,” Kerry said. “We just began today to see real movement of humanitarian goods, and let’s see where we are. We’re happy to have a conversation with them.”Aid was delivered to the besieged town of Talbiseh in Homs province on Monday, the Red Cross said, for the first time since July. The convoy brought in food, water and hygiene supplies for up to 84,000 people, it said.But most aid shipments envisioned under the truce have yet to go in, especially a convoy destined for rebel-held eastern parts of Aleppo, where some 275,000 civilians are believed trapped without access to food or medical supplies.“I am pained and disappointed that a United Nations convoy has yet to cross into Syria from Turkey, and safely reach eastern Aleppo,” the U.N. Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Stephen O’Brien said in a statement.The United Nations said it had received government approval to reach nearly all the besieged and hard-to-reach areas where it sought to bring aid, but access to many areas was still constrained by fighting, insecurity and administrative delays.Already widely violated since it took effect, the ceasefire came under added strain at the weekend when Russia said jets from the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State killed more than 60 Syrian soldiers in eastern Syria.Assad called that incident “flagrant aggression.” Washington has called it a mistake.KERRY’S GAMBLEThe ceasefire is the second negotiated by Washington and Moscow since Russia joined the war. But while it led to a significant reduction in fighting at the outset, violence has increased in recent days and aid has mostly failed to arrive.Plans to evacuate several hundred rebels from the last opposition-held district of Homs city have also overshadowed the agreement, with rebels saying it would amount to the government declaring the ceasefire over. The Homs governor said the plan had been postponed from Monday to Tuesday.An end to the truce could doom any chance of the Obama administration negotiating a Syria breakthrough before it leaves office in January. Kerry overcame skepticism of other administration officials to hammer out the deal, gambling on cooperation with Russia despite the deepest mistrust in decades between the Cold War-era superpower foes.Washington and Moscow back opposite sides in the war between Assad’s government and the insurgents, while both oppose the Islamic State jihadist group. Russia joined the war a year ago on Assad’s side, tipping it firmly in his favor.The politburo chief of one prominent Aleppo rebel group, Fastaqim, said the agreement had “practically failed and has ended,” adding that it remained to be seen if anything could be done “in theory” to save it.Zakaria Malahifji, speaking to Reuters from the Turkish city of Gaziantep, also indicated rebel groups were preparing for combat: “I imagine in the near future there will be action by the factions.”Monitors reported clashes in and around Aleppo on Monday. The government blamed some of the violence on what it said was an insurgent assault, but another rebel official denied they had yet launched new attacks.The opposition High Negotiations Committee spokesman Riad Nassan Agha said the government side had never committed to the truce: “Air raids by Russian and Syrian warplanes, which haven’t stopped, suggest the truce never started in the first place.”CHALLENGESThe U.S.-Russian deal, whose details are still secret, calls for the eventual joint U.S.-Russian targeting of jihadists including Islamic State and the former Syrian branch of al Qaeda.That would mean the former superpower enemies fighting together for the first time since World War Two, a measure even more remarkable for the distrust between them since Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula in 2014 and the United States and Europe responded by imposing financial sanctions.But the peace initiative has faced enormous challenges from the outset, including how to disentangle nationalist rebels backed by the West from jihadists not covered by the truce.There has been no sign of compromise on the issue at the heart of the war: the future of Assad, who enjoys firm Iranian and Russian military backing that is buttressing his strongest military position in years. The dispute over his fate has made a mockery of all previous diplomatic efforts to end the fighting."

The Palestinian Health Ministry said one was aged 17 and the other, 21. The incident occurred near the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a site holy to Jews and Muslims, who refer to it as the Ibrahimi Mosque.The deaths raised to six the number of alleged attackers - five Palestinians and a Jordanian - killed since Friday in incidents in which Israeli authorities said at least nine Israelis have been wounded.Earlier on Monday, a Palestinian stabbed and wounded two police officers, one of them a woman who sustained serious injuries, in East Jerusalem, police said. The second officer, a man, shot and wounded the assailant.At least 217 Palestinians have died in violent incidents since October 2015 in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Of them, 146 were identified by authorities as assailants while others were killed during clashes and protests.Palestinians, many of them acting alone and with rudimentary weapons, have killed at least 33 Israelis and two visiting Americans in the attacks.Palestinians have accused Israel of using excessive force and say that some of those killed posed no threat or had no intention of attacking anyone. In some cases, Israel has opened investigations into whether excessive force was used.Palestinian leaders say assailants have acted out of desperation over the collapse of peace talks in 2014 and Israeli settlement expansion on occupied land that Palestinians seek for an independent state, with East Jerusalem as its capital.Israel says anti-Israeli incitement by Palestinian officials and on social media networks have stoked attacks."

Now 23, she’s taking a stand in her male-dominated community and enrolling girls in school.When Neelam Ibrar Chattan was born in Pakistan’s picturesque Swat Valley, no one in her family ever imagined their region would one day make international headlines. She had a calm childhood with her three brothers, a sister and parents who treated their girls no differently from their sons. It was an upbringing that allowed Chattan to grow up and become an outspoken activist who rallies for girls’ education.During her teens, the Taliban took control of Chattan’s hometown and began its reign of violence and terror. Taliban militants gained control of the Swat Valley in 2007 and later banned girls in the region from going to school, decrying education for girls as un-Islamic. Under its rule, the Taliban destroyed 400 schools, 70 percent of them girls’ schools, according to the Guardian.More than 1.5 million residents fled their homes in the Swat Valley before the Taliban was forced out of the region. Even then, the group continued to exert its fundamentalist beliefs on the area. In 2012, a masked gunman shot education activist Malala Yousafzai in the head for openly defying the Taliban’s rules and going to school. She survived and went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize for her work advocating the right to education for all children.But the same year Yousafzai was attacked, Chattan formally launched her own campaign, Peace for a New Generation, which works closely with both girls and boys to promote education, arts and sports as ways to combat violence and terrorism.Though the Taliban’s control over the valley has ended and some sense of normalcy has returned to the area, the extremist militant group left behind a largely male-dominated region, which still lags behind in rights for women and girls.“In this society, girls are supposed to stay at home and they are looked upon as having no value and opinion,” Chattan says. “If a girl is getting an education, she’s not considered a good girl.”Chattan says many parents worry that if their daughters leave the house to go to school, they risk falling under the gaze of male strangers, which would bring shame to the family. “People will keep their girls inside the house so they can keep a close eye on them,” she says.Girls as young as 12 find themselves trapped in their homes, kept from an education they are legally allowed to have. So Chattan visits families to explain that Islamic teachings encourage education for everyone, including girls. “We sit with the family and explain to them the merits of education,” she says. “We explain to them how, in Islam, getting an education is a positive thing. … The first word that was revealed to us in the Quran was ‘Read.’”In situations where the family still doesn’t agree, Chattan takes matters into her own hands.“If the family doesn’t listen, then we enroll the girl into school ourselves,” she says. Through her initiative, she has raised money to pay for these girls’ school fees, books and uniforms.Chattan also leads educational workshops for young men and women. In her sessions, she encourages girls to pursue careers such as law or journalism, which are not traditionally practiced by women in the Swat Valley. She says she tries to give the girls a voice, since they often aren’t allowed to choose their own path.“Girls in this area never do the opposite of what their family wants,” Chattan says. “In our workshops, we find out what the girls are thinking and what they want. If a girl comes to me and says, ‘I want to do this’ or ‘I want to do that, and my family isn’t giving me the permission to do it,’ we try really hard to help her.”Sometimes, says Chattan, the girls’ fathers or brothers show up and forcibly take their daughters or sisters back home from the workshops. “They say, ‘You are spreading vulgarity,’” she says.Chattan has been the target of numerous threats, not only because she is outspoken and in the public eye – appearing in the news and giving speeches – but also because she goes outside her home without wearing the traditional full-length scarf, leaving her face uncovered.She’s faced verbal abuse and insults, and people have also hurled derogatory remarks to her brothers. “People yell at me and scream at me,” she says. “They go up to my brother and say, ‘Your sister goes outside, doesn’t cover up and doesn’t cover her face,’” she says.While her immediate family has stood by her, Chattan says her activism has tarnished her reputation among other relatives. “Even in my own family, I’m considered to have a very progressive mindset, which is a bad thing,” she says.“I’m on Facebook, and you can see my face. I’m the first girl in my family who is using my real name on Facebook,” she says. “All the male relatives in the family say I don’t have a good character because I use my real picture and talk to the media.”But she remains determined to reach her goal of educating Pakistan’s children and says she’s helped almost 800 kids and young adults through her work.“We need to move in a direction where both girls and boys have an opportunity and resources to learn,” Chattan says. “If you look at other countries, their men and women work side by side and go to school side by side. In our country, the men are in the front and the women are always pushed to the back. You can’t have that if you want to be a normal functioning society.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub. For weekly updates, you can sign up to the Women & Girls Hub email list."

If a girl comes to me and says, ‘I want to do this’ or ‘I want to do that, and my family isn’t giving me the permission to do it,’ we try really hard to help her.”Sometimes, says Chattan, the girls’ fathers or brothers show up and forcibly take their daughters or sisters back home from the workshops. “They say, ‘You are spreading vulgarity,’” she says.Chattan has been the target of numerous threats, not only because she is outspoken and in the public eye – appearing in the news and giving speeches – but also because she goes outside her home without wearing the traditional full-length scarf, leaving her face uncovered.She’s faced verbal abuse and insults, and people have also hurled derogatory remarks to her brothers. “People yell at me and scream at me,” she says. “They go up to my brother and say, ‘Your sister goes outside, doesn’t cover up and doesn’t cover her face,’” she says.While her immediate family has stood by her, Chattan says her activism has tarnished her reputation among other relatives. “Even in my own family, I’m considered to have a very progressive mindset, which is a bad thing,” she says.“I’m on Facebook, and you can see my face. I’m the first girl in my family who is using my real name on Facebook,” she says. “All the male relatives in the family say I don’t have a good character because I use my real picture and talk to the media.”But she remains determined to reach her goal of educating Pakistan’s children and says she’s helped almost 800 kids and young adults through her work.“We need to move in a direction where both girls and boys have an opportunity and resources to learn,” Chattan says. “If you look at other countries, their men and women work side by side and go to school side by side. In our country, the men are in the front and the women are always pushed to the back. You can’t have that if you want to be a normal functioning society.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub. For weekly updates, you can sign up to the Women & Girls Hub email list."

A Syrian rebel official said the truce had ended, and there was no hope the eastern Aleppo aid would be delivered.Up to 275,000 people remain trapped in that part of Syria’s most populous city without food, water, proper shelter or medical care, said U.N. Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Stephen O’Brien.“I am pained and disappointed that a United Nations convoy has yet to cross into Syria from Turkey, and safely reach eastern Aleppo,” O’Brien said in a statement.He referred to a 20-truck convoy, the first of two that would have carried flour and other food supplies, enough to feed some 185,000 people for one month, he said.Both convoys are still sitting at the Turkey-Syria border, where they have been for almost a week, U.N. spokesman Jens Laerke said.Humanitarian access to Aleppo hinges on control of the main road into the besieged rebel-held part of the divided city.The road needs to become a demilitarized zone in order for aid to proceed. Russia has said the Syrian army had begun to withdraw from the road, but insurgent groups in Aleppo have said they have seen no such move and would not pull back from their own positions around the road until it did so.“I hope that all parties to the conflict, and those with influence over them, would see the convoy as an opportunity to move forward,” O’Brien said.“Humanitarian aid must remain neutral, impartial and free of political and military agendas.”"
10,POLITICS,Pat McCrory's Utterly Absurd Excuse For Not Repealing HB2,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-pat-mccrory-hb2_us_57e021f9e4b04a1497b5ca55,The North Carolina governor blames critics of the anti-LGBT law for keeping it in place. Really?,2016-09-19,N.C. House Speaker Tim Moore says his hands are tied on repealing HB2 because of a Charlotte ordinance that has no bearing on repealing HB2. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_252_4602_2819%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― By any objective measure, North Carolina’s anti-LGBT law, HB2, has been a complete disaster for the state.The law, which Gov. Pat McCrory (R) has steadfastly defended since signing it earlier this year, has drawn national criticism for banning transgender people from using bathrooms that match their gender identity. Businesses have protested by canceling plans for expansion in the state. The NBA, the NCAA and the ACC pulled major sporting events. High-profile musicians have canceled concerts. Conferences have been called off. In all, the law has driven business out of North Carolina to the tune of at least $230 million in lost revenue.But in a bizarre twist, the same Republican politicians who put HB2 in place ― and who have the authority to repeal it anytime ― are now blaming critics of the law for being the reason they can’t repeal it.Say what?In a joint statement issued Sunday night, North Carolina Senate Leader Phil Berger (R) and House Speaker Tim Moore (R) said the only way they can repeal HB2 is if the Charlotte City Council gets rid of a separate, local anti-discrimination law. That ordinance, which bans LGBT discrimination and includes language about letting transgender people use the right bathrooms, is why the legislature had to pass HB2 in the first place, argue the Republicans.“If the Charlotte City Council had not passed its ordinance in the first place, the North Carolina General Assembly would not have called itself back into session to pass HB2 in response,” said Berger and Moore. “Consequently, although our respective caucuses have not met or taken an official position, we believe that if the Charlotte City Council rescinds its ordinance there would be support in our caucuses to return state law to where it was pre-HB2.”They are echoing a statement issued Friday by McCrory’s office.“For the last nine months, the governor has consistently said state legislation is only needed if the Charlotte ordinance remains in place,” McCrory spokesman Josh Ellis said in a statement. “If the Charlotte City Council totally repeals the ordinance and then we can confirm there is support to repeal among the majority of state lawmakers in the House and Senate, the governor will call a special session.”It’s an absurd demand, for a few reasons. The most obvious is that it is entirely within McCrory’s control to call the legislature into session, if he wants to, and it is entirely within GOP leaders’ control to introduce a bill that repeals HB2. They don’t need Charlotte to take any action.Rescinding the local law wouldn’t stem the economic bleeding from HB2, either. The NCAA, for one, has indicated it won’t hold events in any city that lacks anti-discrimination protections. There are currently 18 states and more than 100 U.S. cities that have LGBT ordinances like Charlotte’s, so there are plenty others to pick from.There’s also no guarantee that McCrory and GOP legislators would follow through with getting rid of HB2, even if Charlotte officials rescinded their anti-discrimination measure. Their statements say they’ll only look into repealing the law once the Charlotte ordinance is fully eliminated.And then there’s the fact that HB2 nullified Charlotte’s ordinance anyway. Beyond its provisions targeting transgender people, HB2 prevents local governments from passing any nondiscrimination policy that goes beyond the state standard. So the push to make Charlotte vote to rescind its ordinance is purely so Republicans can say local officials voted with them in scaling back LGBT protections.Put all of those reasons together, and you get the kind of response from Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts (D) that she gave Monday, ahead of a scheduled city council meeting.“The City of Charlotte continues its commitment to be a welcoming community that honors and respects all people,” Roberts said in a statement. “We appreciate the state wanting to find a solution to the challenges we are facing and applaud the governor for recognizing the state should overturn HB2, which the state can do at any time without any action from the City of Charlotte. We are not prepared to add this item to our agenda this evening. However, we urge the state to take action as soon as possible and encourage continued dialogue with the broader community.”It’s no coincidence that McCrory is trying to blame the fallout from HB2 on Charlotte officials two months before the elections. His name has become synonymous with the law and all of its baggage, and his gubernatorial challenger, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper (D), is slightly leading in the polls, per HuffPollster.McCrory clearly doesn’t want to take questions on the matter ahead of November. His own staff planted questions at an event he held last week, none about HB2, instead of letting reporters get in questions.When a reporter finally did get a question in, after the event, and asked about HB2, McCrory said he wanted the federal government to sort it out. There is a bill in Congress that would address LGBT discrimination, the Equality Act, but it hasn’t gone anywhere in the GOP-led House and Senate.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the year that Gov. Pat McCrory signed HB2. It was this year."

After cordoning off the area, a bomb squad used a robot to cut a wire to try to disable the device, but inadvertently set off an explosion, he said.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the investigation was focusing on a person of interest in the case.“The evidence might suggest a foreign connection,” Cuomo said in television interviews on Monday morning.The Chelsea blast followed a pipe bomb explosion on Saturday morning along the route of a running race in the New Jersey beach town of Seaside Park. No one was injured in that blast.(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles, Doina Chiacu and Susan Heavey in Washington; Eric M. Johnson in Seattle; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)"

A second device, described as a pressure-cooker bomb, was found nearby.Linden Mayor Derek Armstead told WABC that the owner of a Linden bar found someone sleeping in the hallway of his bar, and called police.“One of our police officers went to investigate and to wake him up, and realized that he was [Rahami], the suspect that had been being sought in the bombings,” Armstead said. “He realized it was the suspect and, within moments, the suspect fired on him. And thank God that he had his vest on. And I think that was very helpful for him. I think that saved his life.”After he shot the officer, Rahami proceeded to walk down the street firing a handgun, Linden Police Capt. James Sarnicki told CBS2.The Linden Police Department identified the injured officers as Angel Padilla and Peter Hammer. Neither of the officers suffered life-threatening wounds.“The gentleman got up and started walking down the street in a westerly direction,” Sarnicki said. “I’m told that he was randomly discharging his handgun and one of the officers was able to get close enough to him and return fire.”The officer who was shot in the bar was wearing a bulletproof vest and was not seriously injured, CBS2 reported. Several reports said a second officer was also injured during the altercation.Video from the scene Monday showed Rahami being loaded into an ambulance after the shootout.Authorities also suspect Rahami may be connected to a small bomb that detonated along the route of a 5K race in a New Jersey beach town Saturday morning. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said “there are similarities” in the devices found in New York and New Jersey.William Sweeney Jr., the FBI assistant director in charge of New York, said during a press conference Monday that authorities have “directly linked” Rahami to the devices in New York City and Seaside Park, New Jersey, on Saturday. Prosecutors expect to charge Rahami with five counts of attempted murder and two gun charges. Terrorism charges will likely follow later, once federal officials have had time to assemble a more detailed case. His bail has reportedly been set at $5.2 million.“This is a very common tactic, especially in terrorism cases,” CBS justice reporter Paula Reid explained. “They often don’t want to reveal all of their evidence, so they’ll try to hold a suspect on a minor charge — certainly attempted murder is not a minor charge at all — but here they have the luxury of being able to charge him on state charges, so they don’t have to reveal really any of their federal terrorism evidence until they’re ready to do so.”Law enforcement sources told CNN that Rahami had traveled to Afghanistan, where he was born, several times in recent years. Officials questioned him every time he returned to the U.S. as part of standard procedure, but didn’t consider him a threat. Sweeney also said during the press conference that there’s “no indication” that Rahami was on any FBI watch list.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio added that authorities are not looking for any other suspects at the moment. But he urged New Yorkers to remain vigilant.“It’s very important ... if people see anything unusual, especially an unattended package, that people report it immediately,” he said.U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said charges are expected against Rahami for the shooting in New Jersey, but didn’t elaborate on any possible charges related to the bombs.Rahami’s last known address was in Elizabeth, New Jersey. An unidentified law enforcement official told NBC New York that a fingerprint on one of the unexploded devices helped identify him.”He certainly seemed to do virtually nothing to cover his tracks,” the official said. The New York Times reported that surveillance video captured footage of Rahami planting the bombs in Manhattan. Authorities sent out a cell phone alert early Monday asking people to call 911 if they spotted Rahami.All 29 injured in Saturday night’s blast have been released from the hospital. It’s not clear what motivated the attack.This article has been updated with information about expected charges against Ahmad Khan Rahami, and the identities of the injured Linden Police Department officers."

Corbett had maintained that the child ― whom he was watching while the toddler’s mother, fellow airman Nicole Dudley, was serving in the Middle East ― sustained his injuries by falling down stairs.A Delaware Online reporter, speaking to Dudley on Thursday, asked the mother if she believed justice had been served. Her answer: “Absolutely not.”“You have a man who killed Evan who is walking free. The evidence speaks for itself,” she said outside the Kent County Superior Court in Dover.A coroner reported that her son suffered serious brain injuries, as well as a detached retina and multiple bruises to his head and body. The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide by blunt-force trauma, Delaware State News reported.“I’ve been in that house and have seen those stairs. It’s just not possible,” Dudley told Delaware Online of the eight carpeted steps in Corbett’s home.Ahead of Corbett’s sentencing, the married father took the stand and expressed his grief to Dudley over the loss of her son.“Nikki, I can’t ever start to understand the pain you feel,” he said, according to Delaware Online. “I will bear the burden of this tragedy my whole life. I am truly aware of the pain this accident and I have caused you, and for that, I am truly sorry.”His apology appeared to offer little, if any, comfort to the grieving mother.“Just because you’re in the military doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be held accountable for your actions,” she later told the AP. “I think the jury failed, I think the judge failed and I think justice was not served.”"
18,THE WORLDPOST,Merkel's Party Suffers Heavy Losses In Berlin As Voters Boost AfD,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/berlin-germany-vote_us_57dec406e4b0071a6e07d82e,The German chancellor is suffering a backlash against the government's refugee policy.,2016-09-18,"Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives for the informal EU summit at the Bratislava Castle in the Slovak capital on September 16, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57dec58e130000930639cbf8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BERLIN, Sept 18 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives suffered their second electoral blow in two weeks on Sunday, slumping to their lowest level since reunification in 1990 in a Berlin city vote in which citizens roundly rejected her open-door refugee policy.Voters turned to the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), which with 12.2 percent of the vote will enter its tenth regional assembly of the country’s 16 states.A year before a federal election, the result is likely to raise pressure on Merkel and deepen divisions within her conservative camp.“There is no question. We didn’t get a good result in Berlin today,” said Michael Grosse-Broemer, a senior CDU lawmaker said. However, he blamed his party’s historic losses in Berlin primarily on local issues.“I think it is dangerous to transfer the Berlin result to the federal level,” he told broadcaster ZDF.A backlash against her migrant policy has raised questions about whether Merkel, Europe’s most powerful leader, will stand for a fourth term next year. But given a dearth of options in her party, she still looks the most likely candidate.Initial projections from broadcaster ZDF put Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) on 18 percent, down from 23.3 percent in the last election in 2011.The Social Democrats (SPD) also lost support, falling to 23.1 percent from 28.3 percent but remained the biggest party and are likely to ditch the CDU from their current coalition.The result compounds Merkel’s problems after a rout in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern two weeks ago triggered calls from her conservative allies in Bavaria to toughen up her migrant policy. In particular, they want a cap of 200,000 refugees per year but Merkel has rejected this outright.The AfD has campaigned heavily on the migrant issue, playing to voters’ fears about the integration of the roughly 1 million migrants who entered Germany last year.“From zero to double digits, that’s unique for Berlin. The grand coalition has been voted out - not yet at the federal level, but that will happen next year,” said AfD candidate Georg Pazderski to cheering supporters after the results.The SPD, Merkel’s junior coalition partner at the federal level, wants to form a coalition with the Greens and possibly the radical Left party.The increasingly heated debate about Merkel’s migrant policy boosted overall turnout, which jumped to 66 percent, up 6 points from the last election in 2011, according to broadcaster ARD. This was the highest turnout in Berlin since 2001."

Otherwise the implementation of the entire package of the U.S.-Russian accords reached in Geneva on Sept. 9 may be jeopardized.”Russia has repeatedly called on the United States to push units of moderate Syrian opposition to separate from Islamic State and other “terrorist groups.”The Foreign Ministry said Saturday’s incident was a result of Washington’s “stubborn refusal” to cooperate with Moscow in fighting Islamic State, the Nusra Front - now renamed Jabhat Fatah al Sham - and “other terrorist groups.”The U.S. military said the coalition stopped the attacks against what it had believed to be Islamic State positions in northeast Syria after Russia informed it that Syrian military personnel and vehicles may have been hit.Washington further unnerved Moscow when its envoy to the United Nations abruptly left her seat as the Russian representative took the floor to condemn the air strikes at an emergency U.S. Security Council meeting.“We are reaching a really terrifying conclusion for the whole world: That the White House is defending Islamic State. Now there can be no doubts about that,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in comments aired by state TV.The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, said Zakharova should be embarrassed by that claim. Russia’s U.N. representative Vitaly Churkin said Russia had no “specific evidence” of the U.S. colluding with Islamic State militants.The diplomatic row is likely to further complicate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Syria, including its largest pre-war city of Aleppo where the situation remains especially tense and Monday’s fragile truce has been repeatedly violated.The U.N. told Reuters aid trucks that had been expected to move to Aleppo on Sunday morning were once again being delayed.“It’s a tough moment,” one top aid official in Geneva told Reuters. “The U.N. convoys are highly politicized.”CEASEFIRERussia’s Defence Ministry said conditions in Syria were deteriorating, as fighting escalated in parts of the country where the ceasefire, which is set to expire late on Sunday, should apply.Heavy clashes continued on Sunday east of Damascus in the rebel-held Jobar suburb between rebels and Syrian government troops and allied forces, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and a witness said.Sunday is the first day of the new school year. Residents living near Jobar and the wider Eastern Ghouta suburbs told Reuters they were afraid of the mortars and fighting.The al-Rahman Legion, part of a Free Syrian Army rebel alliance in the Damascus suburbs, said in an online statement its fighters had destroyed a Syrian government tank and killed soldiers after government forces tried to storm Jobar for the second time this week.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least six people died and many were seriously injured when helicopters dropped barrel bombs onto a town in a rebel-held part of the southern Syrian province of Daraa on Sunday.Insurgents say they only reluctantly accepted the initial deal, which they believe is skewed against them, because it could relieve the dire humanitarian situation in besieged areas they control, and blamed Russia for undermining the truce.“The truce, as we have warned, and we told the (U.S.) State Department - will not hold out,” a senior rebel official in Aleppo said, pointing to the continued presence of a U.N. aid convoy at the Turkish border awaiting permission to enter.Rebels have also accused Russia of using the ceasefire to give the Syrian army and allied Shi’ite militias a chance to regroup and deploy forces ready for their own offensives.Islamic State is excluded from the truce. U.S.-led and Damascus-led operations against the militants have continued throughout the ceasefire on various fronts.On Sunday, Islamic State said in an online statement it had shot down a warplane in Deir al-Zor with “anti-aircraft” guns, in the same area as the U.S.-led coalition strikes hit the Syrian military on Saturday.The Syrian military confirmed the loss of a warplane which it said had been carrying out an operation against the militants."

It is the first parliamentary vote since 2011, when allegations of ballot-rigging sparked big protests against Putin in the capital.Voting got under way at 2000 GMT on Saturday on Russia’s Chukotka Peninsula across the Bering Strait from Alaska. By 1700 GMT on Sunday, most polling stations in Russia were shut, except for Kaliningrad, Russia’s most westerly point, where people have an extra hour to cast their votes.Yevgeny Korsak, a 65-year-old pensioner in the city of Saransk, 600 km south-east of Moscow, said he had voted for United Russia “because it is strong and powerful.”A middle-aged man in the town of Velikiye Luki in western Russia, who declined to give his name, told Reuters: “Of course I voted for United Russia .. We don’t need other parties here. At least they (United Russia) have done their stealing.”United Russia, led by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, a Putin loyalist, has 238 of 450 Duma seats, dominates the more than 80 regional parliaments, and is routinely depicted in a favorable light by state television, where most Russians get their news.The party is able to draw on the support of the other three parties in the federal Duma, and benefits from its association with 63-year-old Putin, who after 17 years in power as either president or prime minister, enjoys a personal approval rating of about 80 percent. Putin does not belong to any party.By contrast, liberal opposition politicians, who have just one sympathetic member in the Duma, complain they are starved of air time, vilified by state media, and their campaigns systematically disrupted by pro-Kremlin provocateurs. Pro-Kremlin politicians deny that charge.The liberal opposition hopes it can break through to win about two dozen seats. Pollsters say it will be lucky to snag a handful and may end up with none.APATHYThe vote will be closely watched to see how many of Russia’s roughly 110 million registered voters across its 11 time zones in the world’s largest country turn up to cast their ballots, with some opinion polls showing apathy levels are high.There was some evidence of that on Sunday with a taxi driver in Ufa, just over 700 miles east of Moscow, telling a Reuters reporter voting “was like urinating into a blocked toilet.” “Why bother?,” the man, who gave his first name as Ilysh, said.Putin has said it is too early to say if he will go for what would be a fourth presidential term in 2018. If he did and won, he would be in power until 2024, longer than Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.Putin, after voting in Moscow, told reporters he now planned to “go to work.” When asked who he had voted for he said: “I have someone to vote for don’t you know.”Anxious to avoid a repeat of 2011’s street protests, Kremlin officials have tried to assure Russians that the vote will be the cleanest in the country’s modern history.Observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe are being allowed to monitor the vote, a new head of the central election commission has been appointed, and regional and Kremlin officials have been fired in the run-up.The authorities have also resurrected an old voting system viewed as more equitable, which means that half of parliament will be decided by people voting for individuals with the other half drawn from party lists. The last parliament was elected on party lists alone.There were some reports of voting irregularities. Reuters reporters at one polling station witnessed the same people voting multiple times.The election is the first time that voters in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, are helping decide the makeup of the Duma. That has angered the Ukrainian government and there were scuffles between Ukrainian nationalists and police outside the Russian embassy in Kiev on Sunday after a few nationalists tried to stop Russian citizens from voting there.Polls show United Russia’s popularity has been somewhat dented by a grinding economic crisis caused by a fall in global oil prices and compounded by Western sanctions over Moscow’s role in the Ukraine crisis.But they also show that Putin’s own popularity remains high and that many voters buy the Kremlin narrative that is frequently repeated on state TV, of the West using sanctions to try to wreck the economy in revenge for Moscow’s seizure of Crimea.The first exit polls are due at 1800 GMT on Sunday."

He gave no details of the identities of the victims.The knife attack in St. Cloud, a community about 60 miles (97 km) northwest of Minneapolis-St. Paul, comes at a time of heightened concern in the United States about the threat of violence in public places.An explosion rocked New York City’s bustling Chelsea district on Saturday, injuring at least 29 people in what authorities described as a deliberate, criminal act. But they said investigators had turned up no evidence of a “terror connection.”In St. Cloud, the attacker entered the mall in the evening as it was busy with shoppers, Anderson said.He attacked his victims at several sites in the shopping center, which will remained closed on Sunday as police investigate, the police chief said.The eight wounded were transported to St. Cloud Hospital but none were believed to have life-threatening injuries, said Chris Nelson, a communications specialist for the medical facility.One victim was expected to remain there, but the other seven patients had already been released or were expected to be let go shortly, officials said.Police officials said they were still interviewing witnesses hours after the attack.The off-duty police officer who shot the suspect was from a jurisdiction outside of St. Cloud, Anderson said. He would not say which agency employs the officer.(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Susan Fenton)"
