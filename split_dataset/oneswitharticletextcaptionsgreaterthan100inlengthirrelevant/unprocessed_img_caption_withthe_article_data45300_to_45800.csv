0,POLITICS,Fixing Our Food System Shouldn't Be A Partisan Issue,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/food-system-a-libertarian-case_us_57e54614e4b0e80b1ba1907a,Addressing some of our nation's most pressing food issues isn't about establishing a nanny state.,2016-09-23,A cow stands in a barn on a Wisconsin dairy farm. There are many problems with America's food system -- and new food rules may not be the key to fixing them.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e580831a00002c005b43ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whether it’s the massive amount of food we waste, the burden large agribusinesses places on our environment or the staggering number of children who go to bed hungry every night, the American food system is obviously quite far from perfect.The question of how to address the above failures is, of course, a tough one. In fact, it’s a question so tough it’s gone mostly ignored, so far, in the presidential contest.The answers that some call for involve the implementation of further regulations for farmers, food manufacturers and consumers alike, and advances in these areas are often touted as successes by “good food” activists like Michael Pollan, author of Food Rules and The Omnivore’s Dilemma.But not all food rules are good food rules, and many regulations concerning the American food supply have actually had a negative impact on food producers, particularly small ones, while incentivizing instead the sort of practices preferred by larger, corporate producers.Such is the argument laid out by food writer, attorney and professor Baylen J. Linnekin in his new book, Biting the Hands that Feed Us, out this month.In just one example, Linnekin points out how the cosmetic standards laid out by the EPA and USDA and adhered to by many retailers result in countless pounds of “ugly” but otherwise delicious produce — an estimated half of all the produce grown in the U.S. — going uneaten.The book makes a strong case that the biggest issues facing our nation’s food supply are ones deserving of bipartisan solutions — and that those solutions might actually entail fewer, better food laws instead of a spate of new ones.The Huffington Post recently spoke with Linnekin.What was the inspiration behind your new book? Who did you write it for?Obviously, I would never have written the book if I didn’t think sustainability in our food system wasn’t an important goal. But I think people look at sustainability as something that must be supported always by stricter and stricter, more and more, greater and greater regulations. I think that would turn off anyone who identifies as a conservative or libertarian and I think that’s too bad. As I point out in the book, this is not the case.I think I’m appealing to the people on the ideological right to recognize that there are ways to have a sustainable food system that don’t involve the government telling us everything to do. I’m also pointing out the ways that some on the right, like Michele Bachmann, the former representative of Minnesota, are big recipients of farm subsidies and are hypocrites on these issues. And to the people on the left, I’m suggesting that not all regulations are bad. The book is about how some regulations are bad, and if we’re unwilling to repeal the bad regulations that harm the food system you want to exist, I think you need to take a long, hard look in the mirror.This is, essentially, a conservative case for fixing our food system. Would you agree with that assessment?I should stress that I identify as a libertarian and not a conservative. There are people that I portray in the book, like Thomas Massie, a more libertarian-minded member of Congress who raises grass-fed beef on his farm in Kentucky, who has co-sponsored legislation with Chellie Pingree, a stalwart liberal member of Congress who is, likewise, an organic farmer who lives on an island off Maine. I think that’s a great example of the actual food movement, the people who really care about the small farmers on the ground and the individuals that want to make their own food choices, rather than the sort of politicized food movement. They recognize that so many regulations value large producers over small ones, wasting food and getting in the way of people growing fruits and vegetables in their own yards.None of these are political issues that belong to either the Democratic or Republican or Green or Libertarian Party. These are issues everyone can, should and does care about. I’m not trying to discourage people from getting too “political” about their food, but I think that when some of the ideology gets in the way of recognizing that there is room for collaborating with people who you don’t agree with on some issues to create meaningful change, you’ve got blinders on. I hope this book will be a way to look at food regulations and food sustainability in a different way such that people will come to see others, whether they be Republicans or Democrats, as a partner on food issues instead of this sort politicized enemy.In your book you discuss food waste reduction efforts as a promising example of bipartisanship on this. Could food waste activism provide a model of collaboration going forward?We certainly need less partisanship on issues like this. Some of the good food rules I cited in the book are ones that have tackled food waste. The Emerson Act was named after a Republican congressman who passed away before that law took effect and was sponsored during the Clinton administration, which was not exactly an era of cooperation, but was very successful in the Republican House, and President Clinton signed it gladly. The PATH Act was sponsored by [Republican] John McCain and several Democrats. Those are both efforts to increase food donations with the ultimate goal of reducing both hunger and food waste.I think food safety is another area where there’s a divide, particularly on the left, between supporters of local food and supporters of increased food safety. I don’t know exactly how to bridge that schism between people like Pollan who identify as local food supporters and people like Marion Nestle who are more aligned with food safety rather than local food. I think my appeal would be for food safety supporters to rally support for regulations that actually make our food safer.You do criticize some individuals and programs typically revered by the food movement — not only Pollan, but also the Michelle Obama-backed Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, as two examples. Were you nervous to air these critiques of folks held dear by many who would be considered your book’s target audience?I wasn’t the least bit nervous. I think that disagreement and debate is healthy. I’m certainly not lashing out at Pollan [for his support for the Food Safety Modernization Act] or calling him names. I think it’s important to add to the discourse and constructively dialogue with one another. With the first lady and the National School Lunch Program, it’s important to point out that the idea that the first lady created food waste in the program is absurd, but it’s worth noting that food waste has increased due to some of the measures in the act.There is obviously a lot of work to be done to get both these “bad” food laws repealed and “good” ones passed. What do you think all of us can do, as consumers and eaters, to speed up progress?Some of the things I talked about in the book include the role of consumers in, say, ugly fruits and vegetables. The regulations the USDA and EPA have established make wasting the “ugly” fruits and vegetables often times easier than actually picking them at the farm and trying to sell them. The government’s at fault there, full stop. But it’s also incumbent upon consumers to change their behavior and recognize that.Now, I’m not a food anarchist and this is not a book about eliminating all rules. This is about eliminating the bad ones, but also changing our own behavior and expectations to also improve the food system and make it more sustainable.Are you optimistic that we are on a path toward a better food system?I think I am optimistic. I think there is a growing interest and understanding about food and sustainability, and people increasingly care about this even if it’s not sort of traditionally in their political or ideological wheelhouse. I think that trend will only continue.If you look back maybe 10 years — even 5 years — food waste, for example, was an issue very few people were talking about and now it’s very much at the forefront of the food system. As I note in the book, if food waste were a country in terms of how much waste it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, it would be the third largest country in the world, behind the U.S. and China in terms of its GDP. I think that shows the potential impact reducing our food waste from the 40 percent we currently waste to even cutting it in half would have on both the food issue and climate change.If readers take one thought away from reading your book, what do you hope that will be? I hope that people who are skeptical of sustainable food because they think it’s a system that requires billions of new regulations will read this book and come to embrace sustainability in food not as something that requires this huge new regulatory structure, but as something that would actually benefit from deregulation in many ways.And I hope supporters of sustainable food who I think are sometimes guilty of thinking we just need more rules will instead recognize that the people arguing against more regulations aren’t always wrong and that perhaps these two groups can meet somewhere in the middle and hold hands and eat a sustainably raised, grass-fed hamburger.This interview has been edited for length and clarity. ―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

Although he drew on his gay friend’s experience in writing “Rise Now,” he added, “I decided to make it more universal so that anyone could relate to it.” Kassam was born in Ivory Coast and spent several years in Paris before he relocated to New York. His international background has influenced what he calls a “multifaceted” sound, which is also inspired by Michael Jackson, Queen and Chaka Khan. Noting that his mission is about “world commitment” and “striving for global equality,” he told The Huffington Post that the LGBT community has “accepted me for who I am, and I can relate to their struggle.” “Rise Now,” he added, has personal resonance, too. “As ironic as it was, I realized this song was also about me coming forward as an artist and owning my music,” he said. ​Head here to read more about Jamil Kassam.

2,POLITICS,Judge Who Ended New York's Stop-And-Frisk Policy Slams Trump's Idea To Bring It Back,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-shira-scheindlin-stop-and-frisk_us_57e41865e4b0e80b1ba0d49f,"""You really wonder about this man's level of knowledge.""",2016-09-23,"Judge Scheindlin, seen in a 2012 courtroom sketch, found ""overwhelming proof"" that stop-and-frisk practices discriminated against people of color.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Shira Scheindlin, the federal judge who ruled three years ago that the New York City Police Department’s aggressive stop-and-frisk practices were unconstitutional, had a few words about Donald Trump’s proposal to institute a similar policy nationwide.Trump’s idea sounded “so retrograde and so non-commonsensical,” she told The Huffington Post in an interview while on vacation.“You really wonder about this man’s level of knowledge,” added Scheindlin, who stepped down from the bench in May and is now of counsel at a New York law firm.At a town hall event on Wednesday, Trump said he “would do stop and frisk” to address crime in black communities. He claimed that the tactic had “worked incredibly well” in New York ― evidently unaware of Scheindlin’s ruling that the way the NYPD did it actually amounted to racial profiling.“Why would you call for instituting a failed policy across the United States?” said Scheindlin.Trump also didn’t seem to grasp that as president he would have little power to micromanage policing, which is chiefly the states’ domain.Floyd v. City of New York was a long-running class action case charging that the NYPD’s practice of stopping, questioning and frisking thousands of New Yorkers without reasonable suspicion ― the vast majority of them black or Latino ― violated the Constitution. The 10-week trial in Scheindlin’s court offered dramatic testimony and thousands of exhibits.The judge then issued a 198-page ruling that served as a damning indictment of the city’s police department ― and then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg and then-NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly ― for targeting communities of color under a policy that did little to curb crime or violence.“The city’s highest officials have turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially discriminatory manner,” Scheindlin wrote. “In their zeal to defend a policy that they believe to be effective, they have willfully ignored overwhelming proof that the policy of targeting ‘the right people’ is racially discriminatory.”Thanks to that decision, the NYPD now has a court-ordered monitor to make sure that updated guidelines for police stops and initiatives such as body-worn cameras are being implemented responsibly and with input from community groups.Reflecting on her ruling today ― and Trump’s praise for what it condemned ― Scheindlin still maintains that stop-and-frisk tactics served “no law enforcement benefit” in New York and “did not reduce crime in any way.”As for the Republican presidential nominee’s unsupported notion that such a policy would somehow reduce gun violence by getting firearms off the streets, Scheindlin said the evidence collected in the Floyd trial told a very different story.“Very few guns were seized ― 1.5 percent of all the stops resulted in the seizure of any contraband, which is a very tiny number,” she said. “But on top of that, we have no idea if it deterred folks from carrying guns.”The more the judge pondered Trump’s proposal and how he might make it work ― could he, say, use the U.S. Department of Justice to condition federal funding on local police embracing stop and frisk? ― the more the exercise seemed like a fool’s errand.“I doubt that he thought it through to that extent,” she said.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

3,PARENTS,Read Hillary Clinton's Letter To A Little Girl Who Wants To Be President,Caroline Bologna,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/read-hillary-clintons-letter-to-a-little-girl-who-wants-to-be-president_us_57e5497be4b0e80b1ba19516,"""Proudly take credit for your ideas.""",2016-09-23,"Jennifer Rosen-Heinz wrote to Hillary Clinton after her daughter announced she'd like to be called ""Lillary"" and become president someday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e5992d1700002900ac6bfa.jpeg?cache=ThIV4H55Hd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton is all about empowering kids to pursue their dreams.Wisconsin mom and nurse, Kelsey Vandersteen, tweeted a letter that her friend’s 7-year-old daughter Lilly received from the Democratic nominee.The letter was in response to a message that Lilly’s mom, Jennifer Rosen-Heinz, sent to Clinton’s campaign over the summer through the “Contact Us” form on the candidate’s website. Rosen-Heinz told The Huffington Post she was inspired to write to Clinton after her daughter announced one night at dinner that she’d like to change her name to “Lillary.”When her parents asked why, the little girl responded, “So I can be a girl president.” Rosen-Heinz said Lilly has been very engaged in hearing about the presidential election. “Since she’s taken SO MUCH pride in the fact that a ‘girl’ can become president, I felt like I needed to share her story with Hillary,” the mom said.“In my message, I mentioned that as much as Hillary has given tirelessly her entire public life to making sure that women and children’s voices are heard, that she could know that she was not only making history, but she was leaving footprints that young girls like my daughter can easily read― a girl has been here. YOU can be here.”In her response to Rosen-Heinz’ message, Clinton wrote that she was “touched” to learn about Lilly’s plans. However, she added, “I think Lilly is a great name ― and I hope you know that you don’t have to change it to become president; if you dream big, work hard, and care deeply about what you believe in, there’s no limit to what you can achieve.”The presidential candidate encouraged Lilly to use her voice and speak her mind in school and then eventually the workforce.“Proudly take credit for your ideas,” she wrote. “Have confidence in the value of your contributions. And if the space you’re in doesn’t have room for your voice, don’t be afraid to carve out a space of your own.”“Don’t be discouraged,” Clinton concluded. “Don’t give in. Don’t give up. Don’t quit ― on yourself, on your dreams, on your future. You really can be anything you want to be. I may become the first woman president, but you, Lilly, could be next.”Rosen-Heinz told HuffPost that Lilly was “really, really excited” to receive the letter from Clinton. “I think it was pretty unreal to her,” she said. “But you could see as she read the words, that she felt spoken to. Hillary wrote to her in a way that was both developmentally appropriate and eloquent.”The mom said she believes the letter could have a much larger impact. “Seeing the effect those words had on my daughter, I knew that these words were for her, but not just for her. They were really for ALL girls (and boys) in this country. Our children should know that they are not bounded by their name, by their gender, by the color of their skin.”Added Rosen-Heinz, “And all little girls can know that they, too, can find their own voices, speak out, and carve out room where there has never seemed to be room.#WhoRunTheWorld."
4,POLITICS,"Obama's Long, Frustrating And Fruitless Campaign To Kill Birtherism",Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-birtherism_us_57e55a91e4b0e80b1ba1b470,His aides have discovered a painful truth: The conspiracy theory will never fully die.,2016-09-23,"Andy Martin, a dark arts Republican from Illinois who helped spread many of the rumors about Obama's origins.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For aides to President Barack Obama, the first hint that his biography was the subject of conspiracy theories arrived well before Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, and even before Obama considered a presidential bid. It came in the weeks after he delivered his famous “Red America, Blue America” speech at the Democratic convention in 2004. And the theories had nothing to do with his place of birth ― they had to do with his religion. In the summer of 2004, the conservative website Free Republic picked up a press release alleging that the up-and-coming state senator from Illinois was secretly Muslim. Obama’s office was aware of the post’s existence. But as Tommy Vietor, Obama’s aide at the time, noted, they treated it as a “subterranean issue,” the type that sparked more eye-rolls than intrigue. The assumption was that few would take it seriously.Twelve years later, those assumptions seem quaint. Conspiracy theories about Obama’s biography have morphed and persisted. And with Trump’s ascendance in the Republican Party and his years of unwillingness to firmly disavow the myth that Obama was not born in America, it’s clear to these same aides that the smears they tried to dismiss in 2004 and kill thereafter will likely never fully die.“I never imagined it would go this far and be taken seriously by credible people ― if you consider Donald Trump to be a credible person,” said Ben LaBolt, an aide in the 2008 campaign and the press secretary in 2012. “It is like Glenn Close in ‘Fatal Attraction.’ You think it is gone, but it keeps popping up in the craziest places.” The story of birtherism is not a story about Obama, since birtherism is a lie. It is a story about the difficult, often futile attempts to dispel a myth in an online age when there are more means and incentives to spread it. For those who have worked with the president, it is a nagging, demoralizing and often-shifting battle defined by its racist undertones. Birtherism began not as Trump asserts ― as an effort by Clinton’s 2008 campaign to delegitimize Obama ― but by those on the conservative fringe who were taken aback by the speed of Obama’s political trajectory. The setting was, initially, the 2004 Senate race. And the person doing the peddling was Andy Martin, a lawyer and occasional candidate known for feeling a bit more comfortable than most in the fever swamps of Illinois politics. Martin himself doesn’t deny the role he played. “When Obama gave the speech about the red states and blue states, there was something about him that didn’t ring true,” he recalled in an interview with The Huffington Post. “I had my old investigator’s hat on. I said, ‘I’m going to look into this guy.’ I picked up the phone and called my operation in London and said, ‘Do what you can to find dirt on Obama.’” But Martin stresses that he wasn’t questioning ― then or now ― Obama’s Hawaiian birth. Instead, he said, his goal was to pick apart other elements of Obama’s biography, including his father’s story and his religious upbringing. Obama’s aides were aware of it all. But those in the 2004 campaign were hardly distracted by the smears. Obama won in a landslide, one of the few Democratic bright spots that cycle. The real noise came three years later, as then-Sen. Obama launched his White House bid. This time, the rumors weren’t just about Obama’s religion (though a “Fox & Friends” segment alleging that he attended a madrasa remains a searing memory for veterans of that campaign) ― but about his origins, too. Martin, once again, was a catalyst. In 2007, he says, he wrote stories suggesting that Obama may have been born with Kenyan and American citizenship. He and others began calling for documentation of Obama’s origins.“Even though you know somebody was born somewhere, there may be something on a birth certificate,” Martin said. The conspiracy spread. Campaign staffers recall being forwarded email exchanges asserting their boss’ Kenyan birth. They were informal threads, the type passed along to relatives or within church groups. But it was enough to set off alarms, since the very instrument that had proved beneficial to the campaign ― the ability to galvanize people online ― was becoming a source of poison. Eventually, birtherism began showing up as a voter concern in the campaign’s internal polling. “I remember one morning ... we were talking it through in the meeting, that we had to go hard at it with every piece of pushback we have,” said Vietor.The campaign set up a website called “Fight The Smears,” which furnished information people could send back in response to the birther threads. It dispatched its research director, Shauna Daly, to compile a dossier of evidence to use for pushback against birthers. Eventually, the site posted Obama’s birth certificate online. But Martin, along with others, didn’t relent. He appeared alongside Sean Hannity (an appearance that would later play a pivotal role in the campaign) and filed a lawsuit in Honolulu to get a judge to release Obama’s birth certificate. But the percentage of people questioning Obama’s birthplace gradually diminished. In November, Obama was elected president and the world largely moved on. “It faded to the background when we got to the White House,” recalled Dan Pfeiffer, Obama’s former communications director. “The president was sued by Orly Taitz [another prominent birther] over this issue and I had to go to some meetings where [White House counsel] Bob Bauer would brief us on it. But it was not a real thing.”And then, Trump made it a thing again. The first step Trump took into that particular nether region came during a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 10, 2011. Openly flirting with a presidential run, he declared that none of Obama’s former schoolmates could actually recall him as a classmate. The crowd loved it. A month later, Trump went on “The View.” “Why doesn’t he show his birth certificate?” he asked. Then, on the “Today Show”: “His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth.” On CNN, Trump announced that he was sending investigators to Hawaii. Later, he teased forthcoming revelations. Inside the White House, the news cycle went from comical to alarming to suffocating. “I remember that period very well, because there was a lot of real serious shit happening in the world, a European financial crisis, and the economy was in a bad place,” said Pfeiffer. “But Donald Trump kept going on TV and he would make these claims, and it was treated as: ‘Well, Trump says this.’ It wasn’t with great scrutiny. He was being given a bullhorn to shout racist shit without being called on it.” As it happened, Obama was at his home in Chicago during this period, staying overnight after a fundraiser. The president went through some boxes and found what he thought was his long-form birth certificate. It was a souvenir copy ― the type given out by hospitals ― and not an official document. But when he was back in Washington, he instructed Bauer to request the original version in “whatever quiet way a president could,” as Pfeiffer put it. Before the document arrived from Hawaii, Obama huddled in the Oval Office with his top aide, David Plouffe, along with Bauer and Pfeiffer, to plot out how to present the document. He wanted to make a statement. But it had to be to the full press corps, and they needed to keep it secret out of fear that cable news would start a countdown clock for a big reveal. They decided to make the announcement in the Brady briefing room and hand out photocopies of the long-form birth certificate beforehand. The appearance was originally planned for a Thursday, but events got in the way, Pfeiffer said. So they settled on Friday. “I know that there’s going to be a segment of people for which, no matter what we put out, this issue will not be put to rest,” Obama told the frantically gathered reporters. “But I’m speaking to the vast majority of the American people, as well as to the press. We do not have time for this kind of silliness. We’ve got better stuff to do. I’ve got better stuff to do.”Later that day, Trump landed his helicopter in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, still considering a White House run. He took credit for getting the long-form certificate made public.What the real estate mogul likely didn’t know then was the extent of the humiliation in store for him for spreading this conspiracy theory. Days earlier, Obama’s speechwriters had finished writing the remarks for the upcoming White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. It contained an extended roast of Trump and his persistent birtherism. Since Obama had already put out his long-form birth certificate, the writers worried that they’d have to ditch the concept. Instead, they revised a part the speech that involved a scene from “The Lion King” and refined a riff on “Celebrity Apprentice” that was written with the help of director Judd Apatow and blessed by Obama himself.Days later, Obama delivered the speech. The moment is now a part of political lore: A sardonic twisting of the knife, Trump sitting stoically during the roast, a slight grimace on his face. It was exactly what White House aides designed it to be: A public humiliation of Trump in a room full of people whose admiration he craved. “I was hoping he got annoyed,” said Jon Favreau, one of Obama’s speechwriters, who had the luxury of watching it play out from a table right behind Trump’s. “Because we were all annoyed with Trump. He had done this entire birther thing and made it an issue. We thought he was a fucking goofball.” The White House Correspondents’ Dinner of 2011 stunted birtherism’s resurgence. It would come up here and there on the campaign trail, with former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney even attempting a painfully forced joke. But having dismissed the conspiracy theory with a heavy dose of ridicule, Obama felt comfortable enough to co-opt it as well. His team sold coffee mugs with a copy of his birth certificate on it.“It became a rallying cry for our supporters to say, ‘This is how crazy the Republican Party has gotten,’” said LaBolt. Like most conspiracy theories, however, birtherism didn’t fully die. Nor, in that moment, did Obama effectively cast off Trump as a loony rumor monger. In fact, Trump’s associate, Roger Stone, said the 2011 dinner convinced him to run for office in 2016. The real estate mogul talked about his birther theories less frequently. But they continued to populate his Twitter feed and public statements, feeding fantasies and paranoia. It distinguished him in a crowded Republican primary in 2016, which he won, and followed him into the general election. One week ago, Trump finally stated his belief that Obama was born in America, without ever actually apologizing for perpetuating the myth ― only to later admit that he was merely trying to move the conversation to more friendly topics. The relentless fact-checking, the primary documents, and the dismissive, sarcastic put-downs had muted him. But it had not killed the conspiracy itself.  “It’s so funny,” said Favreau. “I’ve told the story of the correspondents’ dinner speech for many years afterwards, and before this election, I would always say, ‘And we never heard from Donald Trump again.’ That, clearly, proved not to be true.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Human Rights Council on Monday.The hard-hitting criticism - drawing a comparison between modern police behaviour and mob killings of blacks in the 19th and 20th centuries - comes at a time of renewed racial tension in the United States.This week Charlotte, North Carolina, saw street riots over the shooting of a black man, Keith Scott, by a black police officer. On Friday, a white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man turned herself into authorities in Tulsa, Oklahoma.“Contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching,” said the report by the U.N. Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent.Most lynching victims died by hanging. A 2015 report by a non-profit organisation, the Equal Justice Initiative, said 3,959 black people were killed in “racial terror lynchings” in a dozen southern states between 1877 and 1950.The U.N. expert report was based on a visit to the United States in January by a five-member group chaired by Filipino law professor Ricardo A. Sunga III.Since the visit, anger over police tactics has risen as their fatal encounters with African-Americans, many of them unarmed, have sparked protests and unrest across the country.RACIAL LEGACYAlthough the United States has made efforts at reform, the group said it remained “extremely concerned” about the human rights situation of African-Americans.“In particular, the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent.“Impunity for State violence has resulted in the current human rights crisis and must be addressed as a matter of urgency.”Police killings go unpunished because initial investigations are usually conducted by the police department where the alleged perpetrator works, because prosecutors have wide discretion over presenting charges, and because the use of force is not subject to international standards, the experts’ group said.They recommended the United States create a reliable national system to track killings and excessive use of force by law enforcement officials, and end racial profiling, which is “a rampant practice and seriously damages the trust between African Americans and law enforcement officials”.To improve race relations, education should be “accompanied by acts of reconciliation” to overcome bigotry and past injustices, while federal and state laws should recognise the negative impact of enslavement and racial injustice, the report added.(Reporting by Tom Miles; editing by Stephanie Nebehay and Mark Trevelyan)"

Mehmet never left custody.Both will face trial “for trying to overthrow the government or prevent it from carrying out its duties,” media outlets said.Turkey has detained more than 100 journalists since July 15, when soldiers commandeered tanks and fighter jets, bombing parliament and other key buildings in an attempt to seize power.The brothers, outspoken critics of President Tayyip Erdogan, allegedly disseminated “subliminal messages suggestive of a coup attempt” during their TV appearance on July 14, the state-run Anadolu Agency said at the time of their first detention.Ahmet Altan, former editor-in-chief of the now-defunct Taraf newspaper, has denied the charges in a post on P24, calling them “nonsense”.The government blames followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen for masterminding the coup, but he denies involvement.Some 100,000 police, soldiers, judges and civil servants have also been sacked or suspended on suspicion of links to Gulen, drawing criticism from rights groups and Western allies who fear a wider attempt to silence dissent. Tens of thousands of civil servants are in custody.Turkish officials reject the criticism, saying the extent of the crackdown is justified by the gravity of the threat to the Turkish state on July 15. Those found not to have links to the coup plot will be released, officials have said.Left-leaning Taraf, one of dozens of media outlets closed since the coup attempt, was once supportive of Erdogan’s policies and his ruling AK Party. It has denied financial links with the Gulen movement.More than 200 writers worldwide, including Margaret Atwood, Russell Banks and JM Coetzee, and other public figures have signed a petition protesting against the arrests of the Altan brothers.(Writing by Ece Toksabay; Editing by Ayla Jean Yackley and Andrew Heavens)"

Her presence was significant, considering that the U.N. General Assembly dedicated this year’s summit to addressing the largest refugee crisis since WWII. After days of high-level meetings at the U.N., along with squeezing in training sessions at a local YMCA, the teen talked with The Huffington Post on Wednesday before she headed out for her flight to Berlin.Mardini said she is well aware of the magnitude of her task. She knows that “refugee” is considered an “ugly” word and how opposed so many communities are to allowing them into their countries. But for Mardini, who helped drag a dinghy for over three hours from Turkey to Greece after the engine died, there’s very little that intimidates her.When asked how she feels about people who fear refugees and want to close their borders to them, Mardini didn’t demur.“It’s OK,” she said. “I will change that.”Mardini is also well aware of how close she came to just being another statistic in the rising death toll of fleeing refugees. As of May, 2,510 people had died this year after their vessels capsized in the Mediterranean Sea. But due to her unique set of skills, her will to live and some sheer luck, Mardini survived a terrifying journey last year. She says she knows that her triumphant story now holds the power to change people’s perceptions.Mardini grew up in Damascus where she had a typical childhood and swam competitively. However, she said when people hear “refugee” they often presume she’s from some remote, disconnected place and wouldn’t even know what an iPhone is.Everything changed for her when the war broke out more than 5 years ago. In 2012, Mardini’s home was destroyed. In August of last year, she’d had enough. Together with her sister, Mardini flew to Beirut, Lebanon and then to Istanbul, where they met up with smugglers. They joined up with about 20 refugees in Izmir, Turkey and boarded a boat meant for about six people and began their journey to the Greek island Lesbos.When the engine died 20 minutes into the journey, Mardini, her sister and two men jumped in the choppy frigid water and began pulling the vessel along. Even after the men quit, Mardini and her sister kept going. More than three hours later, they arrived safely in Lesbos. But that was just the beginning of their trek.Over a total of 25 days, she traveled through six countries before arriving to a refugee camp in Berlin.Once there, Mardini said she spent about 12 hours a day waiting on lines to get her asylum papers.It was when she finally got the chance to start swimming again – ironically enough, at the pool built by Nazis for the 1936 Olympics – that Mardini began to feel hopeful again.Then, in March, the International Olympics Committee (IOC) began putting together its first-ever refugee team for the games in Rio. When Mardini’s trainer, Sven Spannekrebs, suggested she reach out to the IOC, the teen was initially reluctant.“First, you feel like, the word refugee is not really easy, it’s ugly at the beginning,” she said. “They don’t think you left your home. They think you have nothing.”After considering the opportunity, though, Mardini realized she could help reshape the way people understand the term and make it “stronger.”Mardini was one of 10 members of the refugee team and competed in the 100-meter freestyle event.While competing was a dream come true, what Mardini appreciated most was feeling a sense of belonging.“Sport is the only thing can bring all people together,” she said. “As we saw in the Olympics, when you’re an athlete no one can ask, ‘where you’re from?’ You’re an athlete.”When Mardini heads back to Berlin, she plans on resuming her grueling schedule. She trains five hours a day, six days a week and is focusing on learning German. Her goal is to continue speaking out on behalf of refugees and develop projects that empower them.“I want to send a message that refugees are normal people who can achieve, who can create, who can work hard,” she said. “We were born in the same world, but we had some bad situations, which made us even stronger.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e4cd411800002d009a4819.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States and Russia failed to agree on how to revive a short-lived ceasefire in Syria during what the U.N. Syria mediator called a “long, painful, difficult and disappointing” meeting on Thursday.The International Syria Support Group, including the U.S., Russia and other major powers, met on the sidelines of the annual United Nations gathering of world leaders in New York as the Syrian army announced the start of a new military offensive in the rebel-held east of the city of Aleppo.“We have exchanged ideas with the Russians and we plan to consult tomorrow with respect to those ideas,” U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said, expressing concern at the reports of the planned new Syrian offensive.“I am no less determined today than I was yesterday but I am even more frustrated,” said Kerry.Russia and the United States agreed on Sept. 9 a deal aimed at putting Syria’s peace process back on track. It included a nationwide truce, improved humanitarian aid access and the possibility of joint military operations against al-Qaeda-linked groups and the banned Islamist groups.However, the truce effectively collapsed after a week when an aid convoy was bombed on Monday, killing some 20 people.“The good news is that Russia and the U.S. agreed to work intensely on a possible restoration of it,” U.N. Syria mediator Staffan de Mistura told reporters. “It was a long, painful, difficult and disappointing meeting.”“Meanwhile ... everyone is going back to the conflict. The next few hours, days maximum are crucial for making it or breaking it,” de Mistura said.Kerry demanded on Wednesday that Russia and the Syrian government immediately halt flights over Syrian battle zones.“We have not succeeded so far, but there was a lot of support around the table for the proposal, a temporary ban for all flights in order to create the conditions for the truce,” German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault described Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s response to the proposal for grounding planes as “not satisfying.” He described the meeting as “intense.”“The offensive on Aleppo just shows why we need Syrian planes grounded, otherwise there will be no truce,” Ayrault said.Lavrov said the Syrian opposition needed to take steps toward a compromise. Kerry said the United States and allies who supported opposition groups were prepared to reciprocate but only if Russia showed it was serious about implementing the ceasefire agreement.A senior U.S. State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters: “The ball is very much in the Russians’ court to come back to us with some ideas that are serious, that would be above and beyond the types of things they have been willing to agree to in the past with regard to air activities over large parts of Syria.”When asked what would happen next if the process completely collapsed, the official said it was something the United States was “giving a lot of thought to.”“I don’t think tonight and right now as we are approaching a climactic stage is a time to say where we will go from here,” the official added."

But his concern is that the bill departs from longstanding practices relating to foreign governments’ reliance on immunity from judicial processes.“The 9/11 attacks were the worst act of terrorism on U.S. soil and they were met with an unprecedented U.S. Government response … I have continued and expanded upon these efforts, both to help victims of terrorism gain justice for the loss and suffering of their loved ones and to protect the United States from future attacks,” he said. “The JASTA, however, does not contribute to these goals, does not enhance the safety of Americans from terrorist attacks, and undermines core U.S. interests.”Here’s his full statement:The White House has been protesting the bill for months, but even Democratic leaders disagree with Obama on this one. The bill prevents Saudi Arabia and other countries with alleged ties to terrorist groups from invoking their legal immunity in U.S. courts. It overrides the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which grants immunity to countries that aren’t designated state sponsors of terrorism.Saudi Arabia denies any role in the 9/11 attacks, though 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi citizens.Administration officials say the bill puts Americans overseas at legal risk, and leaves the United States vulnerable to bogus lawsuits ― and hefty bills ― in court systems around the world. The European Union and former top executive branch officials have urged Obama to stop it. Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate against such a law by selling off hundreds of billions of dollars in American assets.Lawmakers haven’t been swayed, though. They say the warnings are overblown and that 9/11 victims deserve justice. The bill sailed through the House and the Senate without a single “no” vote.“If the Saudis did nothing wrong, they should not fear this legislation. If they were culpable in 9/11, they should be held accountable,” Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), one of the bill’s lead sponsors, said in a statement. “The families of the victims of 9/11 deserve their day in court, and justice for those families shouldn’t be thrown overboard because of diplomatic concerns.”The House and Senate are both prepared to vote to override the veto next week, aides to GOP leaders told The Huffington Post on Friday.Obama’s not ready to throw in the towel yet.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said administration officials are still lobbying lawmakers to reject the bill. He said that, behind the scenes, many are actually sympathetic to the White House’s concerns.“One of the particular challenges of counting votes in this instance is the frequency with which we hear private concerns expressed that don’t match the public votes that are cast,” Earnest said in his Friday briefing. “We continue to make a forceful case to members of Congress that overriding the president’s veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism, and potentially opens up U.S service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world.”He brushed off the significance of Obama preparing to be rebuked by Congress in a way he’s never been before.“This president has gone longer in his tenure in the White House than just about any other president in modern history before facing the prospect of having his veto overridden,” Earnest said.A group of 9/11 survivors and family members expressed disappointment with Obama’s decision to veto the bill.“We are outraged and dismayed at the President’s veto of JASTA and the unconvincing and unsupportable reasons that he offers as explanation,” reads a statement from the group, called 9/11 Families & Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism.“No matter how much the Saudi lobbying and propaganda machine may argue otherwise, JASTA is a narrowly drawn statute that restores longstanding legal principles that have enjoyed bipartisan support for decades,” reads the statement. “We are deeply grateful for the unanimous bipartisan support that JASTA has in Congress, and we look forward to the Senate and House fulfilling their commitments by quickly overriding this veto.”This story has been updated with language from Obama’s statement and a statement from 9/11 Families & Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism."

The leadership of the FARC have so far been coy on policy details but are expected soon to transition to a party rooted in Marxist ideals.“The war is over, long live Colombia, long live peace,” said FARC commander Ivan Marquez in a statement to reporters alongside fellow members of the rebel leadership.“We inform the country and the government and the governments and people of the world that the rebel delegates of the congress have given unanimous backing to the final accord.”Colombians will vote on the peace accord in an Oct. 2 plebiscite, the final go-ahead for rebels to demobilize. Polls show the accord will easily pass.Two-hundred delegates from FARC units around the country gathered at the Yari site, five hours by rutted road from the nearest provincial town, to review the accord and discuss re-organization in peacetime.Although both leadership and rank and file fighters say they will prioritize political activism as civilians, the group has so far not provided examples of specific policies.“Our initial platform is the implementation of the Havana accords,” Pastor Alape, a member of the FARC’s secretariat and a negotiator at the talks in Cuba, told Reuters at the congress. “Our political proposals will have to come from the suggestions of our base.“We started our political efforts clandestinely and now we aspire, legally, to open our initiatives, together with all sectors of society, to concretely cultivate the political space we are given,” Alape said.The five-point peace accord covers agricultural reform, an end to the illegal drugs trade, victims’ reparations, FARC political participation and demobilization.The FARC may find an electoral foothold among poor farmers and committed leftists, but manyColombians are wary that ex-fighters will join gangs or a smaller rebel group, the National Liberation Army.(Reporting by Julia Symmes Cobb; Editing by Helen Murphy and Dan Grebler)"
16,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Properties Were Sued At Least Eight Times For Disabilities Violations,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-disabilities-violations_us_57e44c0be4b08d73b8307075,Trump dragged some cases out for years.,2016-09-23,"The Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City on May 31, 2016. In 2004, a disabled Purple Heart veteran sued the property, alleging it lacked proper handicapped-accessible emergency exits, guest rooms and restrooms. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At least eight times over the last 19 years, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump’s properties have been subject to lawsuits for violating the Americans with Disabilities Act, court records show. Additionally, a federal inspection found ADA violations at one of his properties.Only once did Trump come close to winning, in a suit that was dismissed at the request of both sides. Five of the cases were settled, while two ended in consent decrees requiring building modifications and one met its end in a Trump property bankruptcy. When a disabled Purple Heart veteran filed a lawsuit in 2004 alleging that the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York lacked proper handicapped-accessible emergency exits, guest rooms and restrooms, Trump dragged the case out for three years. He tried to get the lawsuit dismissed and counter-sued his own architects to try and shift liability to them, but a judge dismissed that attempt. Trump eventually settled and agreed to make changes to the hotel.“What was so striking and frankly appalling was the way he tried to fight [the violations],” said Helena Berger, the president and CEO of the nonprofit American Association of People with Disabilities. “That, I think, is really telling.”Still, after Trump mocked a New York Times reporter with arthrogryposis last November, the reality TV star defended himself by pointing out how much money he’d spent on accessibility in his hotels. “I spend millions a year, or millions of dollars on ramps,” he said in July, “and get rid of the stairs and different kinds of elevators all over and I’m gonna mock? I would never do that.”Spending that money is a legal requirement: The Americans with Disabilities Act, which became law in 1990, requires that buildings and spaces used by the public meet specific disability access standards. “It is the policy at all of our properties to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act,” Christine Da Silva, a Trump Hotels spokeswoman, told The Huffington Post. “This handful of cases, many of which are over ten years old, are not representative of our organization’s strong record of ADA compliance.”Still, the cases do show that Trump has, at times, been less than enthusiastic about spending money to bring his buildings into compliance with federal law.For example, in 2001, two wheelchair users alleged that the wheelchair lift at Trump International was kept locked, and the employee who eventually unlocked it couldn’t operate it. In court records, one of the plaintiffs, Robert Levine, said the experience made him feel like a “second class citizen.” The other plaintiff, Frieda Zames, said it was like being a “grade school child asking permission to go to the restroom.”As in the 2004 lawsuit, after a judge denied Trump’s motion to dismiss the case, Trump counter-sued his architect to try to shift liability. Trump “amicably settled” the 2001 case in 2009, when both he and the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the complaint.Emily Munson, a disability rights lawyer, told HuffPost that she understands the building owner’s perspective in ADA cases. The requirements are exhaustive and violations can be very technical, compared to more substantive problems, Munson said. “On the other hand,” she added, “businesses have had over a quarter century to come into compliance with the ADA.”Trump, she said, “clearly sees people with disabilities as sick or in need of charity and pity, rather than people with rights who deserve to be out and about and accessing the community.”Trump’s Atlantic City Plaza Hotel has also come under fire for its basic and serious deficiencies in accessibility. In a 1997 suit, James Conlon, who is paraplegic, said that even though he stayed in a designated handicapped-accessible room at the hotel, the toilets and showers were unusable for someone in a wheelchair, and the public restrooms were so inaccessible that he had to ask strangers to help him use them. Trump settled the case a year later, agreeing to pay Conlon’s legal fees and renovate the hotels rooms and public restrooms to comply with federal law. But a year after that, Conlon told the judge in the case that the renovations Trump had agreed to hadn’t been done. Two additional complaints were brought against the Plaza Hotel in 2007 and 2008. The plaintiffs in the former agreed to dismiss the case, and the latter case was terminated by Trump’s company’s 2009 bankruptcy.Conlon also brought a case in 2003 alleging that the bus between New York and the Atlantic City, New Jersey, casino wasn’t accessible and that wheelchair access could only be provided with one week’s notice. Trump tried counter-suing the bus provider, but eventually settled Conlon’s case.Another Trump hotel in Atlantic City, the Trump Taj Mahal, settled with the Department of Justice in 2011 after an inspection by the U.S. Attorney’s Office showed numerous violations, including not posting signs on some disabled parking spots. But the cases aren’t limited to Trump’s tri-state area properties. In 2011, a guest at the Trump International Miami ― which the reality star doesn’t own but licenses his name to ― alleged that his designated accessible room had accessibility problems. The case was confidentially settled. And in response to a lawsuit in 2014, the Trump National Doral Miami golf course said making its pool accessible to disabled users would be “impose an undue burden.” Trump and the plaintiff agreed to enter into a consent decree four months after the suit was filed. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Each participant received either a dose of oxytocin or a placebo, administered through a nasal spray.Researchers found that those who received oxytocin were more likely to report feeling that spirituality was important in their lives and that life has meaning and purpose. They were also more likely to give higher ratings to statements like, “All life is interconnected” and “There is a higher plane of consciousness or spirituality that binds all people.”Participants also listened to a guided meditation, after which those who received oxytocin reported experiencing more positive emotions like awe, gratitude, hope, inspiration, interest, love and serenity than those who received a placebo.The study’s results held true regardless of whether the participant reported belonging to an organized religion or not, and they remained consistent a week after the hormone and placebo were administered.Van Cappellen noted that the results of the study could only be applied to men given that the research subjects were all males. Oxytocin produces slightly different results in men and women, she said, and thus further studies should investigate the hormone’s role on women’s spirituality.Even among men, the effect might not be uniform. The study also showed that oxytocin has a stronger spiritual effect on people with a particular variant of the CD38 gene, which regulates the release of oxytocin from hypothalamic neurons in the brain.“Spirituality is complex and affected by many factors,” Van Cappellen said. “However, oxytocin does seem to affect how we perceive the world and what we believe.”But Van Cappellen isn’t alone in her findings. Previous studies have shown oxytocin to have a profound impact on spirituality, as well as generosity, altruism, and empathy. Oxytocin has also been shown to play a role in experiences of spiritual transformation.But it has a dark side, too.A 2010 study of Dutch males out of the University of Amsterdam found that male subjects who received a dose of oxytocin were more likely to express ethnocentric prejudice and xenophobia than those who received a placebo.Luckily, spirituality isn’t bound by hormones alone. It’s how we choose to define our spirituality ― whether as a connection to all creation on our global home or loyalty only to those who look, act and believe as we do ― that makes all the difference."

19,POLITICS,Rakeyia Scott's Slip Of The Tongue Is A Window Into The Poignancy Of Police Shootings,Ryan Grim and Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rakeyia-scott-video-call-the-police_us_57e59706e4b0e80b1ba22256,"""Did y'all call the police?"" Keith Scott's widow asked officers as her husband lay dying.",2016-09-23,"In this image taken from video recorded by Keith Lamont Scott's wife, Rakeyia Scott, on Tuesday, Charlotte-Mecklenburg officers squat next to Keith Lamont Scott as Scott lies face-down on the ground.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. ― When Rakeyia Scott saw cops surrounding her husband, Keith Scott, she immediately worried they might shoot him. She pulled out her cell phone camera.The horrifying video she captured has now been seen millions of times. One poignant moment, however, stands out.As officers huddle around her dying husband, she shouts out: “Did y’all call the police?”Call the police. It’s what one does, or is supposed to do, when a crime has been committed, when someone is in need of help. The idea that the police exist to protect and serve is so powerful that it broke through the reality of what she had just witnessed: police shooting her husband to death.She quickly caught her mistake. “I mean, did y’all call the ambulance?”Given the nonchalant attitude officers betrayed as Keith Scott lay on the pavement bleeding, she didn’t wait for an answer and took it upon herself to call 911.The reaction of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg officers to a man dying at their feet was strikingly familiar. The ubiquity of cellphone, dashcam and surveillance video has transformed the way the public understands police violence. But as scene after scene unfolds on shaky screens and in grainy contours, another element of the violence is beginning to come into focus: the pattern of officers seeming to show no concern for the person they have shot, often fatally.The nonchalance around the injured and the dying is stunning in its own way.Set aside the question of whether any particular shooting was justified, either legally or morally. Perhaps it was. Perhaps the officer had no other choice. Even in such a situation, though, the officer has just exercised the most terrifying of powers ― the use of lethal force against another human being. And yet no care seems to be taken of that human being.Consider another recent police shooting caught on video: that of Charles Kinsey, who survived. Kinsey, a black behavioral therapist in North Miami, Florida, was trying to help a man with autism who was sitting in the street blocking traffic. A cellphone video shows Kinsey himself lying on the ground with his hands in the air. He was trying to explain to police that the other man had a toy truck and not a gun, contrary to what a 911 caller had reported.One of the officers fired three times, hitting Kinsey in the leg. Then Kinsey said he was handcuffed and left bleeding on the street for 20 minutes before an ambulance arrived.And this was a case in which the police understood, right from the start, that the man they shot was the victim.Letting the body lie where it falls is a fairly common trend in these high-profile police shootings. After Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police shot and killed Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old black man, on July 5, the officers appeared rattled by what had happened. But as for Sterling, they said to “just leave him,” according to a witness. In Ferguson, Missouri, officers left Mike Brown’s body in the street for four hours, an indignity that protesters have referred to often.Cedrick Chatman was shot four times, within 10 seconds, as he ran from officers on the south side of Chicago. Then they handcuffed the dying teen, and an officer placed his boot on top of him.After officers shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, the child was still alive. Even when police realized he was just a kid with a toy gun, they still failed to offer basic medical assistance. (They have since said they thought his toy gun was real and were afraid for their lives.) Instead, when his 14-year-old sister, T.R., ran toward him crying out, “My baby brother, they killed my baby brother,” one of the officers tackled her. She tried to get up and crawl toward her dying brother, but the second officer dragged her down. She was handcuffed and put in the backseat of a car, left to watch her brother continue to bleed while the officers did nothing.“When Tamir’s mother, Samaria Rice, heard about the shooting and rushed to the park, the officers refused to release T.R. into her custody and told her she had to choose between going to the hospital with her fatally wounded 12-year-old son and staying with her handcuffed 14-year-old daughter, who was in the back of the car with the very same officers who had shot her son,” the Rice family’s lawyers have since written.On Dec. 28, an Ohio grand jury chose not to indict the officer who fatally shot Tamir.When a Tulsa, Oklahoma, reserve deputy accidentally shot 44-year-old Eric Harris, he was already being subdued by other officers. “Oh shit, he shot me!” Harris says in the video. “I’m losing my breath.”“Fuck your breath,” one officer says in response, among the last words Harris would ever hear.If black lives truly mattered, police would make an attempt to save the dying. If black lives truly mattered, the dead would be afforded more dignity. It is this lack of caring for a fellow human being in his last moments, over and above the violence itself, that reinforces the belief that black lives don’t matter.After shooting LaQuan McDonald, Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke can be seen in video meandering about the crime scene. When North Charleston, South Carolina, police officer Michael Slager shot and killed Walter Scott, he casually walked toward his body. Later, more officers stand around Scott, and it takes some time for any of them to check for a pulse.Videos of police behaving nonchalantly after shooting white people have also come to light. Andrew Thomas, driving drunk, flipped his car and his passenger was thrown from the vehicle. Paradise, California, police officer Patrick Feaster witnessed the crash and pulled up behind them. Instead of attending to the passenger or helping Thomas out of the car, he simply drew his weapon, aimed, fired and struck Thomas in the neck, all in a matter of seconds. Then he radioed that the driver was refusing to exit the car, not mentioning for 11 minutes that he had shot him.Almost instantly after confronting Kajieme Powell in St. Louis, police shot him. Then they rolled over his body to put him in handcuffs. “They’re putting him in cuffs. He’s dead. Oh my God,” one bystander can be heard saying in a video. “Now they cuffin’ him, he’s already dead.”In fact, in reviewing nearly every publicly available video of a police shooting over the past year or so, it is close to impossible to find footage of an officer aiding the person who has been shot.Video of 25-year-old Freddie Gray’s arrest shows him screaming out, possibly in pain, as he is placed in the back of a Baltimore police van. Knowledge of what happened inside the van is limited, at best. But prosecutors argued in cases against several of the six officers charged in Gray’s death that not buckling his seatbelt was a mistake, whether intentional or not, that contributed to the severity of his injuries. William Porter, whose first trial ended in a mistrial, has also been accused of failing to ensure that Gray was provided immediate medical assistance once he requested help.That lackluster response, as much as the rough ride, might have cost Gray his life.It’s this nonchalance that gives weight to claims that too many police officers are operating more like law enforcement warriors than like public servants dedicated to the protection of others. Couple this with officers’ unwillingness to publicly shoulder any moral responsibility in these deaths, and we can only conclude that they believe those on the receiving end of police violence have invited death upon themselves.When social activists like Colin Kaepernick protest police violence against black people, the black-on-black crime rate is often raised in response. But Rakeyia Scott’s powerful slip of the tongue ought to show people who couldn’t see it before why that response is so offensive, and why police violence itself carries a unique resonance. The police are supposed to be the ones you call for help. Learning that they are, instead, the perpetrators of violence, flips everything upside down. If police officers want to convince the public they value black lives as much as any others, they need to start acting like the life they just took matters to them. They need to call the police.

She declined to comment further, citing a policy of not providing information about investigations.(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Mohammad Zargham and Steve Orlofsky)"
21,POLITICS,Senate Democrats Are Mercilessly Trolling Trump Over His Tax Returns,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-democrats-trump-tax-returns_us_57e41285e4b0e28b2b52bbe9,"""It's obvious he’s been ethically compromised in most everything he’s ever done.""",2016-09-22,Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is not pulling any punches when it comes to Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e413521800002f0031672b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When it comes to attacking Donald Trump, congressional Democrats are pulling out all the stops.The party’s lawmakers are following the lead of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) who has made a sport out of poking the GOP nominee for, among other things, failing to release his tax returns. Now, they’re working to get a law on their side.Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) joined Reid at a press conference Thursday to tout legislation Wyden introduced that requires all presidential nominees to release their tax returns.At the event, the Democrats showed themselves just as capable of employing the kind of idle speculation and clever epithets that fueled Trump’s rise.Absent the release of Trump’s returns, the senators argued, one can only assume he is either not paying taxes, profiting from Russian business interests, violating tax charity laws or all of the above.Reid, speaking first, delivered the most stinging remarks.“Why has he not released his tax returns? Because it’s obvious he’s been ethically compromised in most everything he’s ever done,” he said.Trump’s returns would shed new light on the massive tax breaks and other public benefits the mogul has received for his lucrative business projects, Reid ventured.“He is a welfare king. He is king of the welfare kings ― a freeloader who’s made his way in life by feeding off other people’s hard work,” he said.Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argued that the returns might show that Trump’s plans to ease sanctions on Russia would benefit him financially.“It is likely that those tax returns will show major income for Trump and his family from Russia ― from Russian business interests, from Russian oligarchs,” Murphy said. “It will show that the decisions he will make on whether to turn on or off sanctions against Russia could have a multi-million dollar impact on his net wealth.”Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, introduced the Presidential Tax Transparency Act in May. (Stabenow and Cardin are also members of the committee, which is responsible for tax-related legislation.)Wyden claimed conversations with Republicans led him to believe the bill would pass very quickly if it were brought for a vote. He and fellow Democrats tried to force a vote on the bill last week.Of course, the Republicans who control the Senate are almost certain not to allow such a vote. Instead, the bill creates a plum opportunity for Democrats to hammer the GOP presidential nominee and, in the process, boost their chances of regaining control of the upper chamber.Their counterparts in the House have used their public perch to slam Trump on the issue as well. Several members hijacked a hearing with Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen on Wednesday to pepper him with questions about whether a tax audit would prevent someone from releasing their returns. (An ongoing audit is among the many reasons Trump has cited for not releasing his own.)Every GOP presidential nominee since 1980 has released his tax returns well before the election; Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has released hers going back to 1977.Reid, who is retiring this year, has said he plans to campaign against down-ballot Republican candidates in the hopes of tying them to Trump, who remains unpopular in many states with tight Senate and House races.The minority leader showcased that approach on Thursday in a broadside at his Republican colleagues for preventing a vote on Wyden’s bill.Requiring the tax returns’ release is “a kind of good government policy we should all be able to agree [on], but Republicans refuse to apply basic standards of decency to their swindler-in-chief,” he said.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
