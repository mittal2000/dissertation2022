0,POLITICS,Court Says Orange County DA's Tactic To Disqualify Judge Who Exposed Misconduct Was 'Abusive',Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/orange-county-da-appeals-court-ruling_us_5797d4fde4b02d5d5ed350d4,"Still, the justices ruled in favor of the DA office's ability to disqualify the judge.",2016-07-27,District Attorney Tony Rackauckas maintains that no one in his office intentionally behaved inappropriately in relation to the jailhouse informant program. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5797f8d12a00002e004f6ade.jpeg?cache=zLwOymZYta&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES ― Justices for a California appellate court said in an opinion Monday that a tactic used repeatedly by the beleaguered Orange County District Attorney’s Office to disqualify a judge who exposed their misconduct from hearing additional murder cases, while technically legal, was “abusive.”The justices also suggested the state Supreme Court and legislature should re-examine the decades-old state code surrounding judge disqualification.In its majority opinion, the 4th District Court of Appeal’s three-justice panel ultimately ruled in favor of the OCDA’s office and upheld their right to disqualify Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals from hearing murder cases because the controversial tactic allegedly used by the DA’s office, so-called “blanket papering” ― wherein a prosector or defense attorney requests the removal of a judge over and over again due to concerns of bias ― is allowed in state code. Goethals has presided over scores of murder cases in the county for years, but when he began exposing illegal use of jailhouse informants by county prosecutors, critics say, DAs began to steer cases away from him.Last year, Superior Court Judge Richard King, in a ruling that denied a request by prosecutors to yet again disqualify Goethals, did some number-crunching to illustrate what has been going on in the county. From 2010 to 2014 ― before the most egregious misconduct began bubbling up around the county’s tainted informant program, which has allegedly violated the rights of countless defendants ― Goethals was assigned 35 murder cases and was disqualified only once by OCDA prosecutors, King found. However, from February 2014 through September 2015, Goethals was assigned 49 murder cases and disqualified by county prosecutors in all but three. During that same period, Goethals’ rulings had found that county prosecutors and police had committed misconduct and ultimately had led him to eject the entire OCDA office from a high-profile murder case. “As courts work to keep doors open and to provide timely and meaningful access to justice to the public, the extraordinary abuse of [judicial disqualification] is a barrier to justice and its cost to a court should be reconsidered,” Justice Kathleen O’Leary wrote Monday in the majority opinion.Justice Richard Aronson in a concurring opinion said he agreed that “substantial evidence” supports King’s conclusion that “the district attorney engaged in blanket papering of Judge Goethals and did so to retaliate and punish a widely respected and experienced jurist the district attorney previously accepted on a routine basis.”Aronson went on to say that “blanket papering” could be brought in good faith against a judge if a DA or public defender reasonably believes the judge is, in fact, prejudiced against an entire office. But, Aronson writes, “that is not the case here.” Before Goethals’ bombshell rulings about misconduct by police and prosecutors in the county, “the district attorney routinely accepted Judge Goethals without question,” Aronson wrote.In the dissenting opinion in the 2-1 vote, Justice David Thompson strongly agreed with King’s findings, writing that the DA’s motions were “based on the fact that [Goethals] called them out on their misconduct.”Appellate courts are intermediaries and therefore are bound, not just guided, by decisions by the Supreme Court. In 1977, in Solberg v. Superior Court, the California Supreme Court ruled that “papering” is allowed. The court then viewed the tactic as one that could allow for fairness and balance in the justice system. On Monday, the appellate justices openly questioned the wisdom of continuing to use the decades-old ruling in the modern era, but ultimately they remain bound to the higher court’s ruling.Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas’ office said Monday in a press statement that there has never been a “blanket papering” effort by county prosecutors against any judge in the county. “Any exercise of preemptory challenge made by any member of the OCDA has been the individual prosecutor’s decision to do what is in the best interest of the People, public safety, and crime victims,” the office said. Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University who has written at length about prosecutorial misconduct, told The Huffington Post that “beneath the patina of collegiality,” Monday’s opinion struck him as “a cry for the higher court to look anew at Solberg and for the legislature to revisit that section of the code.”The current state code, and legal precedent, “seems like a license for DAs to use this practice selectively and with impunity,” Medwed added. The OCDA’s office has been under fire for almost three years for its involvement in mishandling evidence produced from a secret jailhouse informant program that has allegedly violated the rights of countless defendants. Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders, who first unearthed the informant network, has been arguing since 2013 that a tainted snitch network in county jails has existed in secret for decades. Sanders argues that county prosecutors and police have violated multiple defendants’ rights by illegally obtaining, and sometimes withholding, evidence gleaned from jail informants. His discoveries have led to multiple murder cases in the county unravelling, even resulting in some accused murderers having their sentences vacated. It remains unclear exactly how many cases may have been affected by tainted informant evidence, but Sanders has argued that every case involving a jailhouse informant in Orange County over the last 30 years deserves to be re-examined.The OCDA’s office denied that an informant program existed in the county for years, but last month they finally acknowledged that an informant program does indeed exist and that sheriff’s deputies actively “cultivated,” “recruited” and “utilized” informants and rewarded them in exchange for their information. Additionally, a new trove of secret notes kept by sheriff’s deputies about jail inmates and informants surfaced in recent months, shining new light on the informant program.Legal experts have called for the U.S. Department of Justice to conduct a full investigation of the DA’s office and the sheriff’s department over the informant program."
1,BLACK VOICES,New York City Has A Plan To Keep Black Kids In School And Out Of Jail,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-city-suspensions_us_57978f5ae4b02d5d5ed2f0e8,Mayor Bill de Blasio is trying to help end the school-to-prison pipeline.,2016-07-27,New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to limit school suspensions for young children.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK - The largest district in the country is taking steps to make sure that its littlest, most vulnerable students are not pushed out of school for misbehaving.Last week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio put forth a proposal to ban school suspensions for students in kindergarten through second grade. During the past year, 801 students in this age group received suspensions, per education news outlet Chalkbeat New York. The proposal will likely be finalized in the coming weeks after it is presented for public comment.The proposal is part of the second phase of the mayor’s school safety plan. In 2015, the de Blasio administration worked to put limits on how often students can be suspended for general offenses like insubordination and expand de-escalation training for school safety agents. The efforts were designed to stymie what is commonly referred to as the school-to-prison pipeline, a phenomenon which uses suspensions and school-based arrests to push kids out of school and into the criminal justice system.So far, the city’s efforts to decrease suspension rates appear to be working. Student suspensions dropped 32 percent for the first half of the 2015 - 2016 school year compared to the previous year. This decrease could have an immense impact on students’ lives. Research shows that just one school suspension ― the practice by which students are removed from their classrooms as a form of punishment ― can lead to a student being more likely to later drop out of school. On the whole, students of color tend to be disproportionately impacted by these harsh discipline practices. Nationally, black students are nearly 4 times more likely to get suspended than their white counterparts. These disparities are reflected in data for New York City schools too ― an issue the mayor has said he is dedicated to tackling. As touted by the administration, suspension rates for the offense of “insubordination” have dropped sharply in the past year, which has been “historically a major factor in racial disparities in suspensions,” according to a press release from city hall. The mayor’s new recommendations ― which were announced in partnership with the city council, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton and Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña ― replace suspensions with “appropriate positive disciplinary interventions” for kindergarten through second-grade students. The proposals also allocate $47 million for related issues like increased mental health programs for students and training for restorative justice programs. The recommendations call for increased reporting from the New York Police Department on how often students are subjected to school-based arrests and handcuffing. “New York City schools are earning excellent marks when it comes to safety,” Bratton said in the press release. “They are some of the safest places in the City. Total index crime in schools is down 35 percent over the last five years and, accordingly, so are arrests, suspensions and summonses.”Overall, however, the recommendations have earned mixed marks by education stakeholders.A letter sent last week from the United Federation of Teachers to the New York City schools chancellor complains that educators have not been given enough resources to adequately implement these changes.“In a perfect world, no child under the age of eight would ever be suspended, every child having a discipline crisis would have the proper interventions by adults, and every classroom would be a positive learning environment. We are committed to working toward these goals,” says the letter from union president Michael Mulgrew to Fariña. “Unfortunately, children who are in crisis and who are disrupting classrooms are not going to be helped by this plan to ban suspensions in grades K-2, and neither will the thousands of other children who will lose instruction as a result of those disruptions.”Other groups have expressed optimism. Kesi Foster, coordinator for the Urban Youth Collaborative, a student group that fights for social justice issues, called the proposals “important measures that all stakeholders committed to ending the school-to-prison pipeline should embrace and support,” according to a press release. Similarly, a youth leader with the group named Onyx Walker said in the press release, “Eliminating suspensions for K-2nd grade is progress, but we have much further to go if we are going to make school welcoming for everyone. We have to expand that same compassion and understanding for youth of all ages, and sexual and gender identities, and we have to break this cycle of Black students being pushed into the criminal justice system, and we have to do it right away.” ______Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

Ferrera, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Honduras, argued that Trump and others who share his xenophobic views don’t see immigrants as worthwhile investments. “I am profoundly grateful for the access and opportunity that exists in this extraordinary nation,” Ferrera said. “I was educated in public schools, my talents were nurtured through public arts programs, and you know what, occasionally I needed a free meal to get through the school day. Not everybody looks at millions of young people like me ... and sees an investment.” Dunham, who has previously opened up about being raped in college and written on her struggle with endometriosis, cautioned that Trump’s positions on women’s health have serious consequences.“I am a pro-choice, feminist sexual assault survivor with a chronic reproductive illness,” Dunham said. “Donald Trump and his party think I should be punished for exercising my constitutional rights. His rhetoric about about women takes us back to a time where we were meant to be beautiful and silent. Meanwhile, 22 years ago, Hillary Clinton declared that women’s rights are human rights.” “Donald’s not making America great again,” said Ferrera. “He’s making America hate again. And the vast majority of us, we cannot afford to see his vision of America come to be.” "

Trump said just last week in his Republican National Convention acceptance speech that he would “protect LGBTQ” people from a “foreign ideology,” referring to the threat of attacks by Islamic extremists in the United States.“Very interesting ― he’s going to protect us, LGBT people, from foreign oppression,” Frank said, mocking Trump. “No, it’s not foreigners firing people. No, it’s not foreigners refusing to serve LGBT people.”He continued, “[Trump’s comments were] very carefully worded. And it was a terrible thing that happened in Orlando. But the great majority of problems LGBT people have faced ― violence against transgender people, discrimination ― come from good, old home-grown Americans. So this fraudulent promise that he’s going to protect us from foreigners, who have not on the whole been a threat, I hope people see through it.”Frank went on to discuss Hillary Clinton’s record on equality for LGBT people as secretary of state, noting that she was a “leader” in moving the state department to protect LGBT people overseas.“My husband Jim and I were in Thailand and we met with the officials of the American state department, who were working under Hillary Clinton’s initiated policy in protecting lesbian and gay and bisexual and transgender people throughout Southeast Asia,” Frank said, giving an example of how Clinton’s directives have affected people internationally.In reality, Trump wouldn’t protect LGBT Americans, and, as Frank pointed out, Clinton has already moved to protect queer people around the world from bigotry.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Our staff reporters will provide education coverage from Cleveland and Philadelphia. PHILADELPHIA — Free college has become the banner headline for Democrats in an effort to attract the energetic, debt-ridden millennials who flocked to the Bernie Sanders campaign.But what about the 8 million adult college students struggling to complete a degree, and the millions of other adults who wish they could go to college but can’t afford it? Most current tuition assistance programs are aimed at recent high school graduates. Yet a majority (60 percent) of 25- to 64-year-olds do not hold at least an associate degree, and the numbers rise to 71 percent and 79 percent for African-Americans and Latinos, respectively.While Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders both attracted many frustrated adults who feel left behind by the current economy, neither political party has provided many concrete ideas about how to help them catch up, even while admitting that having a college degree is often crucial to getting out of poverty. Free in-state college tuition at public colleges, proposed by Hillary Clinton, would no doubt help. But conversations with the forgotten majority of degree-less adults show that the solutions are more complicated than a one-size-fits-some policy.“For adults, the issue is broader than making college tuition-free,” said Hadass Sheffer, president of the Graduate! Network, which provides support for adults trying to get a degree. “Most adults who have dropped out already have loans; they may need to go part-time; and they need to replace any income they may lose from their jobs.”Related: Democrats want to open more doors to college, but can their plan get more students to the finish line?At the Community College of Philadelphia, just a 15-minute drive from where the Democrats are meeting, close to half the students are older than 25, and 75 percent go to classes part-time. Nearly two-thirds are low-income and 18 percent default on their loans.LaCountess Ingram, 45, is determined not to become another statistic. Even though a federal Pell grant covers her tuition at the college, she still needed loans to cover other school and living expenses.“I raised my children, I worked, but I wasn’t able to move up in my company because I didn’t have a degree,” said Ingram, who has four children, ages 18 to 26. “But I know that when I come out, there’s a bear waiting for me and that’s student loans.”Like other adults, she said that having to juggle multiple loans, at different interest rates, made it even more confusing to figure out how to afford to continue. She also noted that income-based repayment plans often look only at income, without taking into account costs that younger students might not have, such as car payments, mortgages and child care.“You want to move up, you want to do better and you know education is the thing you need, but there has to be a better way than all this debt,” Ingram said.For adults with children at home, the situation can be a juggling act.Ssire Ivy, 26, is currently enrolled at St. Louis Community College.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday staged a walkout at the Democratic National Convention over what they claim was rigged primary process that wrongly handed the party nomination to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.In an orchestrated show of party unity, Sanders appeared on the floor of the convention at the end of formal roll call proceedings, where he called for a suspension of rules to name Clinton the nominee by acclamation. The convention hall did so nearly unanimously by voice vote, prompting loud cheers and jubilant celebration among hundreds of gathered delegates.But above the convention floor, away from the glare of television cameras in the halls of Wells Fargo Center, hundreds of angry Sanders supporters rushed for the doors, chanting “walkout,” and “this is what democracy looks like.” They held Sanders campaign signs, placards that read, “Rigged,” and “#WikiLeak DNC,” a reference to hacked DNC emails released by WikiLeaks that showed bias against Sanders.As the evening’s program was getting underway inside, the demonstrators marched toward a press tent outside the arena, where they held a sit-in to protest what they called an unfair primary election.“There wasn’t a fair election. It was obviously rigged,” said Bill Sifford of Idaho, who told HuffPost he was “heartbroken” to see Sanders nominate Clinton.Asked whether Sanders would approve of the walkout, Sifford said he did not know.“He doesn’t like our decisions,” Sifford added. “We made our decision to go to him.”Another attendee, who declined to be named, said the walkout was about “making our voices heard because obviously they haven’t been heard for this entire process. Bernie Sanders is the beginning, this is about a movement.”Sanders, however, framed the stakes in a different manner earlier in the day while addressing supporters at a California delegation breakfast: It’s easier to jeer and boo and protest than to deal with the reality of Donald Trump as president."

Holder is also likely referencing the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, two black men who were shot and killed by police earlier this month in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Graphic videos of both incidents began circulating on social media after the shootings, sparking outrage and protests nationwide. Holder also mentioned that his brother is a retired police officer and that “an attack on a police officer anywhere is an attack on our entire society.”This month, five police officers were shot and killed by a sniper in Dallas following a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest. On July 17, three officers were shot and killed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.Sean Bruno, a delegate from Louisiana, said the points Holder made must be taken into consideration as the push for criminal justice reform moves forward.“It was a wonderful speech. In today’s times, it’s very relevant to talk about justice and being respectful to both the police as well as the police being respectful to the citizens,” he said.Holder said Clinton realizes that striking a balance between protecting officers and citizens is necessary, and he also noted how black people, especially men, are unjustly targeted by the criminal justice system. “At a time when our justice system is out of balance, when 1 in 3 black men will be incarcerated in their lifetimes, and when black defendants in the federal system receive sentences 20 percent longer than their white peers, we need a president who will end this policy of over-incarceration,” he said. Holder added that the prison population ― and violent crime ― has dropped during President Barack Obama’s term and that Clinton will push forward that legacy. North Carolina state Rep. Pricey Harrison (D), a delegate from North Carolina, has been pushing criminal justice reform in the state’s House and appreciated Holder’s speech.“There’s a lot about our criminal justice system where we lock people up for life who haven’t really done anything bad,” she said. “What we need to do is more justice [and] reinvestment and less locking people up because you don’t get good results.”Holder also said that Clinton will work to restore voting access in places where the 1965 Voting Rights Act has been rolled back.“At a time when the right to vote is under siege ― when Republicans brazenly assault the most fundamental right of our democracy ― passing laws designed to stop people from voting, while closing locations in minority neighborhoods where people get the documents they need to vote ― we need a president sensitive to these echoes of Jim Crow,” Holder said. “We need a president who holds the right to vote as sacred and stands firm against any kind of modern-day poll tax.”“These are the ideals for which Hillary Clinton has fought her entire life,” Holder said at the end of his speech. “This is the fight that she will continue ― when we make history by electing her as the 45th president of the United States.”"

9,POLITICS,Bill Clinton Tells Democrats How He Met Their Nominee,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-clinton-democratic-national-convention-speech_us_5797d160e4b0d3568f84f271,The former president spoke on the night of his wife's historic nomination.,2016-07-27,Former President Bill Clinton spoke about his relationship with wife Hillary on the second night of the Democratic National Convention.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579829832a00002e004f6b29.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― A quarter-century after winning his party’s nomination for the presidency, Bill Clinton took the Democratic National Convention stage to tell a story on the night his wife officially won it herself: “In the spring of 1971, I met a girl.”And so began the 42nd president’s push to make Hillary Clinton the 45th president, with an attempt to humanize a woman whom American voters don’t like or trust. While most voters likely associate Hillary Clinton with “email server” or “Whitewater” or the other controversies Republicans like to talk about, Bill Clinton spent 43 minutes ― a short speech, by his standards ― explaining the small details of their courtship, of becoming parents, of dropping their daughter off at college where Hillary busied herself with laying liner paper in Chelsea’s dorm-room dresser drawers.“We’ve built up a lifetime of memories,” he said.He interspersed the personal stories with praise for his wife’s work ethic and attention to detail, and tried to turn her difficulty in delivering an entertaining speech into a virtue.“Speeches like this are fun. Actually doing the work is hard,” he said, as he explained how Hillary had put together a package of reforms to improve the public schools as first lady of Arkansas and later pushed through the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program that remains today.And it was that effectiveness, someone who can make government work, the former president said, that so terrified her political opponents who ultimately want to cut government. “If you win elections on the theory that government is always bad and will mess up a two-car parade, a real change maker represents a real threat,” he said.Clinton said that is why the real Hillary Clinton is so different from what was described by Republicans in their convention last week.“What’s the difference from what I told you and what they said? How do you square it? You can’t. One is real. One is made up,” he said, explaining that Republicans had no choice. “Your only option is to create a cartoon, a cartoon alternative. They’re running against a cartoon.”Clinton’s testimonial continues the role reversal the two began in the final year of his presidency, when Hillary Clinton started her own political career after some 25 years of standing by Bill’s side during his rise from Arkansas attorney general to governor to president.The party and nation Bill Clinton addresses on behalf of his wife, of course, is a world apart from the one he spoke to during his nominating convention in 1992. Democrats had won only three of the previous 10 presidential elections, and one of those was Jimmy Carter’s post-Watergate victory in 1976.Democrats like Bill Clinton thought that only by appealing to more conservative voters could they break the Republicans’ lock on the Electoral College. And, with the third-party run of Ross Perot peeling away Republican votes, that’s what he managed to do, winning Louisiana, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia, as well as his home state of Arkansas. Six elections later, Hillary Clinton will probably not win any of those states. She doesn’t need to, thanks to the increase in black and Latino voters in California, Florida, Virginia and elsewhere.“Bill Clinton was a Blue Dog. He was more conservative ― he had to be to win, but the party is being much more liberal,” Michigan delegate Rebecca Bahar-Cook said. “It’s becoming much, much more progressive and I think that’s a really cool thing.”“I don’t think it’s so much the party,” New York delegate Maxine Outerbridge said. “I think the question should be put in context as in what’s gone on in the world.”Hillary Clinton’s historic Tuesday brought with it two associated firsts: Bill Clinton becomes the first potential “first gentleman” based on a nomination of a major party, and the couple would become, should she win in November, the first husband and wife to each serve as president.Such an eventuality was hinted at, if not held out as a promise, right from the start. During his 1992 run, Bill Clinton advertised his wife’s policy chops as a “buy one, get one free” deal. Voters weren’t universally thrilled with the notion, and, after the failure of the health care reform effort that she led in 1994, Hillary Clinton’s West Wing role was not emphasized much anymore.Hillary Clinton’s political ambitions were kept on ice until the end of Bill Clinton’s second term, when she announced she would run for an open Senate seat in New York. Her run for president came after her re-election to a second term, but was thwarted by Barack Obama’s improbable campaign.If Hillary Clinton lands the top job, putting Bill Clinton in an undefined advisory role, Democrats gathered for the convention did not seem worried about potential turf battles.“Listen, any spouse, my wife, has an awful lot of influence on me. Anyone, whether man or woman, who says the spouse doesn’t have influence is crazy,” Georgia delegate John Olsen said. “At the end of the day, it’s always the president’s decision. But there’s nothing like having someone to give you a pat on the back or a kick in the butt. And only a wife or a husband could do that.”Clinton now has been an ex-president for nearly twice as long as he was in the Oval Office. For those 16 years, Clinton has remained the most popular Democrat on the campaign trail, surpassed only in recent years by Obama.Even Obama relied on him four years ago, assigning him the role of “explainer in chief” to talk up the performance of the economy under Obama against Republican attacks. His well-received performance helped Obama open a measurable polling lead over Republican nominee Mitt Romney that remained stable through Election Day.Clinton’s role now reprises his work in 2008, when he was his wife’s top surrogate in her first try at the presidency, at times effectively reaching the working-class white supporters who helped him win two terms, but at times creating damaging distractions for the campaign with off-script attacks on her opponent, Barack Obama.Igor Bobic and Julia Craven contributed reporting.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579907f22a00002e004f6e2f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― The pro-Bernie Sanders protesters out in force may hate to admit it, but the Democratic primary is over. The Clinton campaign, however, is clearly looking ahead toward November as it increasingly targets Fox News viewers. Hillary Clinton gave her first interview to the network this election cycle just last month, after becoming the party’s presumptive nominee. She next called into Bill O’Reilly’s primetime Fox News show in response to the Nice terrorist attacks, taking a page from Donald Trump’s media playbook. Clinton will now give her first post-Democratic convention interview to Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.”The Democratic nominee hasn’t appeared on the Sunday show since 2011, and in a Wednesday appearance on Fox News, Wallace said he’d been requesting an interview since she announced her run for president 15 months ago. “We’ve all earned the value of persistence,” Wallace said. “You keep knocking on doors. Nobody answers. And finally, somebody opens the door. You’ve got to pick the right time, the right pitch, the right person to speak to, and it all worked together.”Fox News has been embroiled in controversy over the past week as chairman and CEO Roger Ailes resigned in the wake of widespread sexual harassment allegations. Still, Fox News remains the top-rated cable news network and Clinton could try and win over its Independent or even “Never Trump” Republican viewers. Of course, she’ll still have to contend with Trump, who primarily turns to Fox News and sympathetic hosts like O’Reilly and Sean Hannity. The Clinton campaign hinted during the Democratic primary that the candidate might appear more on Fox after first dealing with Sanders’ insurgent candidacy. In April, The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple asked communications director Jennifer Palmieri whether Clinton’s participation in a Fox News town hall could lead to more appearances. “We’re in the middle of a string of contests in the Democratic primary, so our focus is on Democratic voters,” Palmieri said at the time, adding that they expected more engagement with Fox in the future.

12,IMPACT,"77% Of Us Feel Bad About Wasting Food, But Aren't Sure What To Do",Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/food-waste-poll-americans-guilt_us_5797ac1ee4b01180b53071e7,Awareness is just the first step.,2016-07-27,Over three in four Americans say they feel guilty about food waste.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5797d1be2a00002d004f6a60.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When it comes to food waste, the United States has a bit of a guilty conscience. And given that we waste an estimated 40 percent of the food we produce each year, that’s with good reason.A new survey released last week and published in PLOS ONE found that 77 percent of respondents in a poll of 500 people representative of the U.S. population agreed that they feel guilty when they throw out food.But it’s unclear if most Americans truly understand why they might feel guilty about food waste. Only 58 percent of respondents said they believed food waste was bad for the environment, while just 42 percent saw food waste as a major source of wasted money.That disconnect came as a surprise to Brian Roe, a professor of agricultural marketing and policy at Ohio State University and the study’s co-author.“Our intuition is that respondents might think that throwing away food is environmentally benign because food is organic and naturally occurring,” Roe wrote via email to HuffPost, “and they haven’t quite connected the dots that food that goes to a landfill produces methane, which has substantial environmental impacts and that all the energy and resources that went into creating the wasted food are essentially now useless.”There also appeared to be a disconnect between respondents’ guilt about food waste and the feeling that they could do anything about it.Fifty-one percent of respondents felt it would be difficult for them to reduce food waste in their homes and 42 percent said they don’t have enough time to worry about it. Further, it appears that most Americans believe we’re doing better than our neighbors on food waste — 87 percent of respondents said they believed they toss out less food than similar households.The survey also provided insight into some of the causes of food waste. About 70 percent of respondents said that throwing away food past its package date reduces the risk of someone getting a foodborne illness. This is a misconception, the Ohio State researchers say.“As recent congressional testimony points out, label dates are not generally indicators of safety,” Roe noted.An effort to standardize food labels could address this. The researchers and other advocates are pushing for confusing labels like “sell by” and “use by” to be supplanted by more straightforward ones like “best by” and “expires on.” Federal legislation with this aim was proposed earlier this year.While less confusing date labels could help, it is still only part of the solution, the researchers and others working to reduce food waste argue.Awareness of food waste appears to be growing — the Ohio State poll observed a 10 percentage point increase in the number of people who said they were aware of the issue when compared to a similar Johns Hopkins poll taken last year. But awareness still relatively low. The new poll found only 53 percent of respondents were aware food waste was a problem in the first place.Awareness, too, isn’t action. Stefanie Sacks, a food writer and nutritionist who is helping to push retailers like Whole Foods and Walmart to agree to sell “ugly” produce as a means of reducing food waste at the retail level, believes education is the key to getting consumers on board.“We have to hit people in their kitchens,” Sacks told HuffPost. “We need to give people the tools, not only to cook but also to have tools to store and manage waste. We need to give people information.”That’s because consumer-level food waste represents such a large piece of overall food waste in the U.S. According to USDA data, about 30 percent of all food loss occurs at either the retail or consumer level. Consumer food waste outnumbers retail waste in nearly every commodity category, with the lone exception of added fats and oils.New technology could also prove helpful. The Ohio State team, including study co-author Danyi Qi, is currently working with with researchers at Louisiana State University to develop such a tool — a new app that measures household food waste.Even with recent progress, other food waste experts are aware movement on the issue is still going to take time, though there are plenty of opportunities for meaningful action — pushing for standard date-label legislation, engaging with initiatives like the Walmart “ugly” produce campaign — now. “This isn’t going to change overnight,” Natural Resources Defense Council staff scientist and Waste-Free Kitchen Handbook author Dana Gunders told HuffPost. “I think it’s going to take decades to really fundamentally fix [food waste], but I think there is a lot we can do quickly.”―-Alissa Scheller contributed graphics to this piece.Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

Veterinarians monitor the ponies as an added precaution, CBS affiliate WBOC-TV reports.Last year, 61 ponies were sold for a record average price of $2,780, bringing in a total of $169,519 for the fire company. The auction also set a record for the highest bid on an individual horse at $25,000, according to the Chincoteague Chamber of Commerce’s website.In addition to purchasing a pony, auction participants have the option of buying a pony’s permanent freedom. In 2015, there were 12 of these so-called “buybacks.” The buyers receive certificates from the fire company and are allowed to name the pony before it returns to Assateague Island to live out its life.“All proceeds from one of the buybacks this year will benefit Special Olympics of Virginia Eastern Shore Area 19,” Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company Spokesperson Roe Terry told CBS affiliate WTKR.“Buyback ponies have actually become some of the highest priced foals sold at the auction,” the chamber’s website boasts.On Friday, unsold ponies will return to the island the way they came, where they’ll live for another year until the next auction.Before Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1943, the firefighters purchased the horses living on the Virginia side of Assateague Island ― which also lies partly in Maryland ― and obtained a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to graze up to 150 ponies there, according to the refuge’s website.Each spring, an average of 70 new foals are born on the Virginia side of the island, according to the chamber’s website. The annual auction therefore serves a double purpose: to raise money for the firefighters and to thin the herd.Approximately 75 percent of the island’s mature mares have foals each year. Because mares and can become pregnant once their foals stop nursing and have an 11-month gestation cycle, many of them are pregnant almost year around.This year’s event is expected to attract tens of thousands of people by both land and sea, according to WTKR.The event was made famous by Marguerite Henry’s 1947 children’s novel, Misty of Chincoteague, which turned into a book series and later a movie.

They declined further comment.The shooting occurred after McBean bought an air rifle at a pawn shop, according to the court ruling. He was carrying it openly while walking home, prompting 911 emergency calls.McBean did not respond to orders from officers to drop the weapon, according to testimony during a court hearing that was cited in the ruling.Peraza testified that he believed McBean had a deadly firearm and he feared for his safety. He fired his weapon three times and struck McBean twice, the court noted.“Under the situation, he was defending himself,” said Schwartzreich. “The fact that it is finally over for him is a huge relief.”"

She will be a great president and she will be the first in a long line of women ― and men ― who serve with grit and grace. She’ll be the first but she won’t be the last.”Watch the rest of Streep’s speech below."

The singer, who’s been involved in a legal battle with Gottwald for the past two years, was performing at Gabby Giffords’ Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC event following the second night of the Democratic National Convention. While she was onstage, the 29-year-old “Blow” singer took a moment to address her legal struggles, calling the situation “f**king horrible.” “I feel like if you’re a human being, you go through pain. And you go through hurt. And every single one of us knows that emotion. I don’t know if you guys know what I am going through. I’m going through a lawsuit. It’s f**king horrible,” she said. The singer also spoke about gun control, noting that while we can’t control people’s emotions or actions, “we can control who we give the fucking weapons to.” “I think the universe is screaming at us that there needs to be a change and we have to f**king listen,” she said, according to E! News. “I do think love is something as humans we all have and I hope heals us. I really believe that love and empathy, it can heal us.”Kesha has been quite open about her lawsuit as of late, and she’s never been one to hold back on speaking about issues she’s passionate about. During her emotional speech at the 2016 Human Rights Campaign Nashville Equality Dinner in March, she echoed a similar sentiment. The singer thanked everyone for their support through her lawsuit before talking about her strong connection to the LGBTQ community and urging the crowd to “love each other.” “I’ve met many members of the LGBT community, and some very, very close friends, who have come close to taking their own lives because of the abuse they’ve had to deal with, and that is heartbreaking,” she said. “I don’t want to live in a world where we treat each other like that.”As she held back tears, the singer added, “That’s why my message has always been about being yourself. And we really have to love each other and support each other.” The Huffington Post receives a percentage from the purchase of tickets bought via a link on this page."

The Green Bay Packers quarterback, however, has taken the high road, avoiding discussing Jordan during the offseason. Most notably, noted “Bachelor” fan Bill Simmons didn’t even ask him a single question about it when Rodgers appeared on his show “Any Given Wednesday” this month. In general, Rodgers has kept a relatively low profile this offseason outside of attending award shows with girlfriend Olivia Munn.But he was back at Green Bay Packers training camp on Tuesday, where he was finally was asked the question by ABC affiliate WISN 12: What’s up with your bro? His answer:I haven’t seen the show, to be honest with you, so it hasn’t really affected me a whole lot. As far as those kinds of things go, I’ve always found that it’s a little inappropriate to talk publicly about some family matters, so I’m just — I’m not going to speak on those things, but I wish him well in the competition.Aaron’s response reads as an easy, diplomatic non-response. Aaron even wished him well in the competition — key word “competition” — perhaps knowing that Jordan’s past as an NFL quarterback himself gives his brother an athlete’s drive to “win” the “Bachelorette.” But moreover, Aaron hasn’t even seen the show, probably because he’s busy leading a charmed, well-deserved life in reality. He achieved fame by becoming the NFL’s No. 1 quarterback and a Super Bowl winner, not because he went on orchestrated dates for ABC.Here’s where the ideological chasm, and, as inferred from Aaron’s interview, the beef between the two brothers emerges: Jordan is digging up family dirt — which again, may or may not be substantiated — to garner strategic pity while chasing D-list fame on a reality television competition. Aaron, on the other hand, doesn’t give a shit. He’s got another Super Bowl and MVP award to win this year. That’s better than getting the final rose. Love “The Bachelorette” and its related shows, or love to hate it?

Its attempts to reach the Donald Trump campaign went into a “black hole.” By comparison, Torres said, Univision executives met privately Monday with a top Hillary Clinton official, and campaign manager Robby Mook has been interviewed on the network. Univision and Telemundo also landed the first solo interviews with Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Clinton’s running mate. Both interviews were conducted in Spanish and aired as the convention kicked off Monday.It’s up for debate whether Kaine’s fluency alone will influence Latino voters. But the Clinton campaign signaled through Monday’s bookings that it considers Spanish-language television a priority. The Atlantic even wondered last week if Univision could swing the presidential election, given its deep reach into the Hispanic community.Some Republicans have been wary of Univision because of its owner’s ties to the Clintons, and because its editorial positions on immigration are often at odds with the GOP’s. But Republicans have made inroads on the network, including Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who participated in a town hall event in 2012. The relationship between Univision and the top of the Republican ticket this time has been far more fraught. Trump sued Univision last year after the company severed its partnership with his Miss Universe pageant, following his description of Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and drug dealers. Trump later kicked star Univision anchor Jorge Ramos out of a press conference (an ejection Ramos discussed Tuesday at an event in Philadelphia). Both Univision and Fusion, its millennial-focused, English-language sibling, are among nearly a dozen outlets to which the Trump campaign has refused press credentials. Univision noted the lack of responsiveness from the Trump campaign in a story last week about how the real estate mogul is the first Republican candidate in 20 years without staff dedicated to Hispanic media outreach. A Trump campaign official declined to comment on Hispanic media outreach. The Clinton campaign, by comparison, has a small army in Philadelphia. Jorge Silva, the campaign’s director of Hispanic media, said there are about two dozen people doing interviews in Spanish and translating speeches. The campaign also plans to hold a Hispanic media briefing Wednesday featuring Mook. José Díaz-Balart, a top anchor at NBC Universal-owned Telemundo, as well as NBC and MSNBC, didn’t speak in as stark terms as his colleagues at Univision. But he acknowledged that the Trump campaign “has been a little more difficult” than Clinton’s team.Díaz-Balart interviewed Trump on June 25, 2015, and asked him about his inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants and his pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. The next month, Trump batted down Díaz-Balart’s question about his immigration comments at a border event in Laredo, Texas. “You’re finished,” Trump said. “That was the last time I’ve had access to him,” Díaz-Balart said. Still, Díaz-Balart drew a distinction between the level of engagement from the Trump campaign and that from the Republican National Committee. The latter, he said, has provided access and surrogates, similar to the DNC. Torres, too, described Helen Aguirre Ferré, the RNC’s head of Hispanic media relations, as “the ultimate professional.” Aguirre Ferré, a former journalist and Univision political analyst, took over the role last month after Ruth Guerra reportedly left because of discomfort with Trump’s hardline views. In an email, Aguirre Ferré said the RNC held daily press briefings in English and Spanish and noted that communications director Sean Spicer did an interview with Ramos on Fusion. “I myself did a minimum of six to ten interviews a day in addition to the press briefings,” she wrote.Aguirre Ferré took issue with Univision’s frustration about lack of access to major speakers. She wrote that “the other 15,000 reporters who attended the Cleveland convention” also wanted interviews with Trump, his daughter Ivanka, and other high-profile draws like House Speaker Paul Ryan, Dr. Ben Carson, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. She further noted that Univision passed on an opportunity to interview Florida Gov. Rick Scott.Torres, in response, noted that Scott wasn’t of interest to Univision in Cleveland because the network’s local Miami station had already secured an interview with him. While Aguirre Ferré “is batting as hard as she can for Latinos,” Torres told The Huffington Post by email, “please note that the RNC is NOT the campaign.”Díaz-Balart declined to speculate as to whether Trump would appear again on Telemundo this cycle. He said it’s been helpful getting Republican surrogates on the air over the past year, but noted that even so, “you eventually want to reach the person running the campaign.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

The new Citizen Privacy Protection Act requires law enforcement in most cases to obtain a warrant before using StingRay, a device capable of extracting information like location, contact lists, text messages and incoming and outgoing call data. Law enforcement must tell the court who they’re looking for and how they plan to tailor the technology so that it doesn’t target unintended citizens. “One of the things we now know is that if a StingRay is used at an event publicly because of one person, police are required to delete information about everyone else who was there,” Yohnka said.Privacy advocates complain that the StingRay and similar devices capture data from all cell phones in its range, not simply the intended target. The Illinois law will require police to delete this extraneous user data at least every 24 hours. Police say the technology is valuable because it can help pinpoint the location of a kidnapper or fugutive, for example. “If police are tracking a particular suspect and they think they’re inside of a certain home or apartment, they can track them pretty closely.” Yohnka said. Privacy advocates, however, liken the technology to an unlawful digital “stop and frisk.” Chicago demonstrators have accused police of using the technology to spy on their protest activities and say they fear officials will use the data to build a database of protesters. Devices like StingRay and a competitor called Triggerfish are known as cell tower site simulators, or “International Mobile Subscriber Identity catchers.” They’re about the size of a suitcase, so they can be concealed in a police vehicle, aircraft or carried by an individual.When a StingRay is activated, it mimics a cell tower by broadcasting a strong signal that tricks nearby cell phones into connecting to the surveillance device and releasing location data. Once the StingRay drops the cell phone signal, the phone reconnects with a legitimate cell tower. Phone users may notice when a cell tower site simulator is nearby. Typical signs are rapid battery drain, difficulty sending or receiving text messages and calls, difficulty connecting to the internet, and sometimes a phone shutting down. The surveillance technology was originally designed for the military and is widely used by federal investigative agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, Secret Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Marshals Service. The ACLU says police in at least 24 states and the District of Columbia also have cell tower site simulators.“Once the manufacturers has exhausted their opportunities to sell it to the federal government, they’ve started selling it to local governments,” said Matt Topic, a Chicago civil rights attorney.Topic represents Freddy Martinez, a Chicago-area tech expert who is suing the Chicago Police Department for its refusal to comply with open records requests concerning the use of StingRay. The department, like many others, has been reluctant to admit it has a StingRay, let alone uses it. Legal experts have been troubled by some police departments apparently misleading judges or omitting information from warrant requests about how the technology is deployed. Illinois’ law drew bipartisan support as it unanimously passed the state legislature this year. State and local police were neutral on the bill and did not comment when Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) signed the measure into law. It takes effect Jan. 1. Topic praised the new law, but said it falls short of protecting citizens’ privacy.“The way the technology works is that it intrudes into everyone’s phone in the area, and that hasn’t been really addressed,” Topic said. “You’d still have a Fourth Amendment problem as soon as the invasion occurs.” He said he favors an outright ban on the technology. “To me that would be the best protection.”"

It concluded that between Nov. 20, 2015, and July 14, 2016, 83 hours’ worth of negative ads ― nearly three and a half days ― ran against the Republican presidential nominee.Surprisingly, the report notes, a large number of those ads originated not from left-leaning groups, but from the Republican establishment itself.Of the 7,811 negative Trump ads that aired during the Republican primary, at least 1,795 were funded by “Our Principles,” a Republican group that’s fighting Donald Trump. The group has spent $16,353,117 so far during the 2016 race opposing Republicans, according to OpenSecrets.org.A further 670 anti-Trump ads were sponsored by two different super PACs that backed Ted Cruz, while a super PAC in support of Marco Rubio paid for a further 600 ads to air against the Republican presidential nominee.Comparatively, in the same November to July period, Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was hit by “only” around 11 hours of negative ads, all of which were paid for by Republican groups."

It is the organizing positive principle of her campaign and, indeed, of her whole career.You know: It takes a village.There is only one problem with this theme and this strategy, and the signs of that problem are everywhere.Americans are so corrosively distrustful of leaders, institutions, political parties, candidates, Washington, government, corporations ― and each other ― that they may not even want to be brought together. Clinton’s argument that she has the bipartisan key to end the gridlock in Washington is viewed with suspicion, not because voters distrust her personally (though they do), but because they have lost faith that the system can be fixed.Leave-us-alone distrust is of course what powered the rise of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, but there are plenty of other signs.Rather than pitch in to ameliorate the effects of Trump’s candidacy, other Republican leaders ― led by two former presidents named Bush ― took their ball and stayed far away from Cleveland.Here in Philadelphia, Sanders delegates and supporters roamed the streets of Center City today in a pointless ― but to them, satisfying ― show of defiance at the roll call that will make Clinton the nominee.They are taking THEIR ball and going home, and that will require the Clinton campaign to spend money and time it cannot afford in a never-ending effort to woo the Sanders vote.White middle-class voters have resented the federal government (even though they depend on it) for decades, but that resentment has new fuel and fire after years of stagnant wages.They focus their rage on Washington, bankers, the media and any other centralizing influence.They want to be left alone to live a way of life that perhaps is gone forever, but if it is, they don’t know why they can’t somehow get it back.So far, the only public figure who seems genuinely capable of a truly unifying speech is Michelle Obama. Her powerful and gracious address on Monday was a triumph.But the first lady is liked and, to the extent any public figure is, trusted. Clinton, on the other hand, is regarded by all too many with suspicion, which makes her togetherness theme a tougher sell this fall. The thought of bridging such gaps this year seems naive at best. "

Those who switched their support at least once from December to April also overwhelmingly back Clinton in a matchup against Trump (88% vs. 9%).” [Pew]But getting Sanders supporters out to vote might actually be the problem - Harry Enten: “Hillary Clinton is coming into her convention with a real problem….New data and analysis shared with FiveThirtyEight from Catalist and SurveyMonkey shows that, before the 2016 primaries, Sanders’s supporters voted less frequently than other 2016 voters, and they were less reliably Democratic than Clinton supporters….In the 2012 general election, for instance, 88 percent of Clinton’s 2016 primary supporters cast a ballot. Same with Trump supporters. And 87 percent of Cruz supporters voted in 2012. But just 79 percent of Sanders’s voters did….Moreover, a higher percentage of Sanders voters had to re-register (7 percent) than Clinton voters (4 percent) for the primary, indicating that Sanders may have been bringing in more people who had let their registration lapse. All of this means that Sanders brought irregular voters into the process, as well as young voters, to an extent the other candidates did not. Will these people still vote without Sanders on the ballot? It’s far from guaranteed.” [538]The Clinton campaign might also struggle with Hispanic voter turnout - Grace Sparks: “Hispanic voters are registered in record numbers, and they generally support presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. But despite the focus on immigration in this year’s election rhetoric, Hispanic voters are still less likely to vote than some other groups. A July Washington Post poll showed that 39 percent of Hispanic voters said there’s a less than 50/50 chance they will vote in the presidential election in November. This number is very high compared with other groups such as whites (11 percent) and African-Americans (13 percent)....At the same time, Hispanic voter registration reached a record high this past spring….There are some indications Hispanics might vote in higher numbers this year. Some experts have projected that as many as 13.1 million Hispanics will vote in 2016, compared to 11.2 million in 2012 and 9.7 million in 2008. Among Hispanics registered to vote in Colorado and Nevada, 80 percent reported they were less likely to vote Republican due to nominee Donald Trump’s views on immigration….However, according to a Gallup poll, only 38 percent of Hispanic voters strongly agreed that they were afraid of the election outcome, compared with 51 percent of national adults and 64 percent of African-Americans.” [HuffPost]DONALD TRUMP IS FAILING AMONG COLLEGE-EDUCATED WHITE VOTERS - Samantha Neal: “Although new polling indicates Trump is enjoying a modest spike in support after the Republican National Convention, he experiences the opposite effect among white college-educated voters. A CNN/ORC poll released Monday shows a significant divide among this traditionally Republican voting bloc. Among college-educated white voters, Clinton actually improves her standing: initially split with Trump 40-40 before the convention, she now pulls ahead with a 44 to 39 percent lead after the RNC. The opposite happened among white voters who lack college degrees. Trump’s 20 percent advantage in this demographic before the convention has grown to 39 percentage points after the RNC. Post-RNC polling by Morning Consult likewise echoes the Clinton-Trump education disparity among voters of all races. Pre-convention, Trump barely edged past Clinton by three percentage points among the non-college educated. Post-convention, he surges past her by ten percentage points.” [HuffPost] Trump’s success among the less-educated helps explain the close race - Nate Cohn: “The list of voting groups generally alienated by Donald J. Trump is long: Hispanics, women, the young, the college educated and more. How is it that he’s in such a close race with Hillary Clinton? The answer lies with a group that still represented nearly half of all voters in 2012: white voters without a college degree, and particularly white men without a degree….In six polls conducted this month, Mr. Trump leads among white registered voters without a degree by a margin of 58 percent to 30 percent. This has been true, to varying degrees, for the entire year. It’s a significant improvement over Mr. Romney in 2012, who led in pre-election polls by a 55-to-37 margin among this group.” [NYT] REPUBLICANS WERE MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN THE CONVENTION THIS YEAR - John Lapinski and Stephanie Psyllos: “Overall, Trump’s unprecedented candidacy and convention buzz meant that voters from both sides of the aisle were more focused on this year’s Republican convention than in prior years. Overall, 41 percent of voters said that compared to past Republican conventions, this year’s convention was of more interest to them. Nearly six in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaners were more interested in this year’s convention than previous conventions, and even three in 10 Democrats were more interested as well.”  [NBC] And they weren’t thrilled with Ted Cruz’s speech - Elise Foley: “Many pundits and politicians, including GOP nominee Donald Trump himself, predicted that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) had hurt his own reputation by declining to endorse the businessman at the Republican National Convention last week. They appear to have been right in the short term: Cruz’s favorability with Republican and Republican-leaning voters plummeted after his speech, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Monday. The poll, conducted in the two days following the convention, found only 33 percent of voters have a favorable view of Cruz. Prior to the convention, a survey put Cruz’s favorability at 60 percent among Republican and Republican-leaning voters, according to CNN.” [HuffPost]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Luckily, the Democrats seem to.",2016-07-26,Donald Trump: A man who clearly (lol) understands everything women need in a president.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57978a3b2a00002d004f68cb.jpeg?cache=WmKwwJC2Ef&ops=crop_47_202_3502_2178%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On Monday night, in the midst of some self-delusional word vomit, Donald Trump ― the presidential candidate who has approximately zero regard for facts ― stumbled upon one nugget of truth: He is completely clueless about women.During a campaign rally in North Carolina, the GOP nominee bragged about how much (white) men love him and admitted he wasn’t quite sure what was up with the lady voters:Fifty percent of our country is men, where I am doing very, very well, record-setting numbers, folks. That’s the good news. Let me give you the bad news. The women, I don’t know what is going on with the women here, but I think, I think I’m doing well with the women.Let’s be clear: Trump is not “doing well with the women.”The gender gap between Trump and soon-to-be-official Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton last month was a record 24.4 points. And despite his attempts to pander to millennial women by way of his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump ― who gave a speech at the RNC last week talking up policies that are nowhere to be found in the GOP platform and lie in direct opposition to her father’s campaign talking points ― women voters are not, in fact, idiots.Trump has a well-documented history of misogyny ― in his interviews, his (ghostwritten) books, his treatment of female employees, his treatment of his ex-wives, and, of course, in his political campaign. For Trump, a man who has built his career on image, publicity and self-promotion, a lack of respect for women has long been a core part of his “personal brand.” Over the weekend, just days after Ivanka touted her father’s commitment to women in the workforce through equal pay, Trump publicly praised Roger Ailes, who was recently forced to resign as CEO of Fox News after dozens of women accused him of workplace sexual harassment. Not only did Trump call Ailes “a very, very good person,” he actually had the audacity to chastise the women who have come forward.“I can tell you that some of the women that are complaining, I know how much [Ailes has] helped them,” Trump said on “Meet The Press.”This is a man who purports to support the interests and needs of American women.The first night of the Democratic National Convention gave Americans a taste of a very different side of our country. The speakers were diverse ― in their gender identities, political leanings, religious identities, racial identities and life experiences. Those speakers addressed racial injustice and the power of protest, equal pay and abortion rights, the dignity of workers, mental health and smashing glass ceilings.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the third female DNC keynote speaker ever, drove home the importance of so-called “women’s issues.” “We believe ― and I can’t believe I have to say this in 2016 ― in equal pay for equal work and a woman’s right to control over her own body!,” Warren said. “Hillary will fight for women. And we’re with her.”First Lady Michelle Obama, in what may have been the most powerful speech of the night, explained why it’s so important for children to see a woman breaking our country’s very highest glass ceiling.The party’s platform reinforces that “every woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services,” that “LGBT rights are human rights,” that we must “restore the full power of the Voting Rights Act,” and that Democrats are committed to raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. These are just a few of the things that many women voters care about, and that Donald Trump has zero plans to deliver on.As Rebecca Traister wrote in March, before the primary process had ended, a Clinton v. Trump race is one of great contrasts:Hillary Rodham Clinton may be running her historic race to be America’s first woman president against the living embodiment of this country’s sexist id: an orange-tinted phallus in a FUCK HILLARY, GOD KNOWS SHE NEEDS IT T-shirt.This election presents the American public with a stark choice. Do you vote for a candidate ― even one you might find “unlikeable” ― who recognizes that women, Muslims, immigrants, Jews, working families, people of color and LGBTQ+ people are human beings deserving of equal rights? Or do you vote for one who does not?This is no longer about political party. It’s about existing in a country that demands its citizens think and engage beyond themselves. It’s about looking at the trajectory of history and moving forwards instead of craning or necks so far we fall backwards into a racist, divisive abyss. It’s about embracing love over xenophobia and outright bigotry. Donald Trump does not “know what is going on” when it comes to any of that. Let’s remember that come November.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
27,POLITICS,Donald Trump Thinks He's Doing Well With Women Voters,Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-gender-gap_us_5796b676e4b01180b530080b,"The real estate mogul, who has a documented history of sexism and misogyny, added: “Maybe I’m wrong.

I don’t know.”“Fifty percent of our country is men, where I am doing very, very well, record-setting numbers, folks,” he said. “That’s the good news. Let me give you the bad news. The women, I don’t know what is going on with the women here, but I think, I think I’m doing well with the women.”Trump asserted that his daughter Ivanka “is doing well with the women,” referring to her speech at last week’s Republican National Convention, which argued that Trump has long supported women and would close the gender pay gap and create more affordable child care programs as president.“I tell you, my daughter does well. Ivanka, she is doing well with the women,” he said. “She understands the real Donald, and I think we are doing well with women.”For the record, Trump’s favorability ratings and polling numbers among female voters are abysmally low, which makes sense, given that he has a history of calling women “fat pigs,” “dogs” and “disgusting animals.” Earlier this month, the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics aggregated 22 national polls and found that the gender gap between Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is a record 24 points.Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, did not help matters when last week he claimed that women would support Trump because the real estate mogul would make sure their husbands could “pay for the family bills.”But Trump, in typical Trumpian fashion, continued to brag about his female supporters.“Everywhere we go, we have massive crowds like this and so many women signs all over the place,” he said Monday. “Women for Trump.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
28,POLITICS,This Sleeper Issue Took Over The Democratic Convention's First Night,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trans-pacific-partnership-democratic-convention_us_5797b7a3e4b0d3568f84c875,The Trans-Pacific Partnership was suddenly on everybody's lips.,2016-07-26,Delegates protest the controversial trade deal during the Democratic convention in Philadelphia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5797d1651200007404a53945.jpeg?ops=crop_0_53_3493_1801%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― The first day of the Democratic National Convention was defined by powerful speeches urging party unity and angry protests rejecting those calls. But the convention hall was also abuzz with policy debates over the direction of the Democratic Party, and no single issue dominated there like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.And that’s kind of amazing. Most people think TPP is really boring, if they’ve heard of it at all. The controversial trade deal gets almost no play on TV news; it’s frequently buried in the back pages of newspapers. Even in the usually marginalized realm of stories about economic policy, it takes a backseat to issues like breaking up big banks or raising the minimum wage.But TPP was a huge deal on Monday night. Anti-TPP buttons and stickers adorned the shirts and backpacks of hundreds of delegates, while signs attacking the trade pact were hoisted across the convention floor ― only “Michelle” signs celebrating the first lady were more ubiquitous. And vocal protests from TPP opponents provided some of the most dramatic moments of the evening.We’ll get to the exciting part (fights!) in a minute. First, the basic facts: TPP is a trade agreement among a dozen Pacific nations, including the United States. It’s also a major foreign policy endeavor and a broad slate of regulatory standards affecting everything from prescription drug prices to greenhouse gas emissions. The deal, which has been signed but not yet ratified, gives corporations ― but not workers, consumers or nonprofit groups ― the right to challenge a country’s laws before an international court. So TPP is widely viewed as an expansion of corporate influence over policy decisions both at home and abroad.That angers a lot of traditionally Democratic constituencies. Labor unions, environmental groups and public health advocates have all cried foul over the pact, which is opposed by both the presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). President Barack Obama, however, considers TPP a cornerstone of his presidential legacy. And he has powerful allies in pushing the deal, including Republican leaders in Congress, much of the foreign policy establishment and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a top lobbying group for major corporations.Now, convention fights! TPP unrest was obvious from the opening gavel on Monday. Less than an hour into the event, protesters holding anti-TPP signs gathered on the convention floor, positioning themselves directly in front of the podium. Midway through a speech by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), they unfurled a banner and began chanting, “No TPP! No TPP!” They disrupted the remaining four minutes of the congressman’s talk.Cummings is a progressive. So are TPP opponents. But this wasn’t an unfocused act of frustration. During negotiations over the Democratic Party platform, Cummings had served as the chief defender of the trade deal, trying to block anti-TPP language to avoid “embarrassing the president,” as Heather Gautney, a pro-Sanders member of the platform committee, detailed in The Nation. Protesters on Monday were putting TPP supporters on notice: Even Cummings doesn’t get a free pass.The TPP agitation was heavily concentrated among Sanders delegates. Although both candidates oppose the deal, Clinton helped work on the pact during her time as secretary of state, and her vice presidential pick, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), supported the deal before joining the ticket. The choice of Kaine, in particular, has left many in the Democratic coalition skeptical about the strength of Clinton’s anti-TPP conviction.DNC speakers and presentations kept up the pressure throughout the night. The heads of multiple unions blasted TPP from the party-sanctified podium. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) mocked Donald Trump for relying on overseas labor for his line of clothing. A comedy video from former Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee and Ken Jeong did the same: Trump claims he’s against trade deals that ship jobs overseas, but he makes his shirts in Bangladesh! And his ties in China!It’s a clever dig ― although, like Kaine, Goolsbee is a recent convert. The economist has long defended free trade deals. In 2008, then an adviser to Obama’s presidential campaign, Goolsbee sparked a minor scandal when he was caught reassuring Canadian officials that Obama wasn’t really serious about renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement despite his campaign rhetoric. NAFTA is the blueprint for TPP.But the Sanders delegates against TPP aren’t all Rust Belt nostalgics longing for factory jobs of yore. One Pittsburgh delegate expressed opposition to the deal on environmental grounds, siding with the Sierra Club and other groups that expect the pact to increase trade in fossil fuels. A delegate from Iowa cited the lack of wage growth in Mexico after the passage of NAFTA and referenced the rights of the global poor. Yet another from California was concerned about the terms granting drug companies long-term monopolies, which would allow them to increase the price of prescription medications.These complaints share a common theme. For different reasons, the delegates are all worried that greater concentration of corporate power will erode living standards for ordinary people. TPP then is a perfect distillation of the dominant theme of Sanders’ campaign: Major corporations have too much power over America.The anti-TPP activism continued on the convention floor until the end of Monday night. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), arguably Sanders’ closest ideological ally in the upper chamber, received a lukewarm reception, peppered with occasional protest chants from Bernie voters still upset with her late endorsement of Clinton. The one issue that silenced the haters and elicited a genuine roar from the crowd? Her call to kill the trade deal.Then it was Sanders’ turn.“I am happy to tell you that at the Democratic Platform Committee there was a significant coming together between the two campaigns, and we produced by far the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party,” he said. Among the points of proof: It “calls for strong opposition to job-killing free trade agreements like the TPP.”That comment was something of a political finger in the party’s eye. Cummings’ efforts during the platform talks were at least partly successful: The platform does not explicitly reject the TPP. But it describes the kinds of deals the party would reject in terms that TPP critics say apply to the Pacific pact.“We will oppose trade agreements that do not support good American jobs, raise wages, and improve our national security,” the platform states. “We should never enter into a trade agreement that prevents our government, or other governments, from putting in place rules that protect the environment, food safety, or the health of American citizens or others around the world.”The Obama administration, of course, denies that any of these things apply to TPP. And activists in Monday’s crowd knew what the platform failed to do ― that’s why they targeted Cummings. But they also appreciated Sanders’ verbal maneuver. If Democrats broadly accept that the platform language is a rejection of TPP, it will be.So they cut off Sanders’ speech with another round of “No TPP! No TPP!” Then Bernie gave them marching orders: When Obama pushes for a vote to ratify the deal in the lame-duck session of Congress, it’s their job to stop it.Sanders spent much of his speech urging his followers to keep up the political revolution after the November election. A TPP vote in the lame-duck session could be their first major test."

A six-time All-Star and the 2011 NL MVP, Braun is the unquestioned face of the Milwaukee Brewers. But it hasn’t always been that simple.The 32-year-old Los Angeles native was suspended without pay for the remainder of the 2013 season and playoffs (totaling 65 regular season games) for violating the league’s drug policy through his involvement in the Biogenesis scandal.Braun, in the middle of his most productive season since, caught up exclusively with The Huffington Post to discuss the scandal from the fans’ perspective, as well as how he’s balanced fatherhood with baseball and why he wants to retire young. Oh, and he weighs in on Kevin Durant.You are the father of a 2-year-old. How do you manage that role with recognizing how important rest is?The sleep thing is challenging; obviously with a baby and a second baby on the way, I think your definition of a good night’s sleep is drastically altered. But obviously trying to get as much rest as possible to maximize recovery time, being more conscious of what I’m eating just to make sure that I’m putting quality food in my body and giving my body the best chance to recover.What is the winning ingredient for balancing fatherhood with being a ballplayer?It’s hard every day. Going on the road is more challenging than it’s ever been. Being away from the family is an extremely difficult, extremely challenging thing — thank God for FaceTime. But obviously I recognize how fortunate I am to be able to play this game; I recognize that, God willing, I’ll be able to retire at a young age and spend more time with my family. But certainly I think it’s more difficult than ever to go on the road. Especially when my daughter is really young, and we have a son on the way, and she’s just at an age where she’s just constantly learning and growing, evolving and figuring the world out, so it’s really tough to feel like I’m missing out on any part of that. Do you ponder retirement often?I mean, it’s impossible not to think about at some point, but I think if I were to give it too much thought it would take away from my ability to give myself the best chance to succeed now. So I try not to think about it much, but obviously now that I’ve gotten a little older and I have children, or a child and a second on the way, it’s something I’ve thought about a little bit.You have tasted postseason success in Milwaukee, but the team has struggled immensely since 2011. How do you go about your business during such a grind?When we were going through a stretch as a team where we were consistently competitive and putting ourselves in a position ultimately to play meaningful games in September every year, it was special. It wasn’t something I ever took for granted: I knew about the history of this franchise and I knew that obviously going to the postseason a couple of times in 2008 and 2011 were both really unique and special opportunities. So it wasn’t something I took for granted by any means.Looking at the game from a macro perspective, most small and mid-market teams have windows where they are more competitive than they are at other times, so I recognized that wasn’t always guaranteed and as we’ve gone through this transition. It’s kind of a fun experience for me in that I can help a lot of young guys transition into the Major Leagues, hopefully help them achieve some of their goals, their dreams, and help put them in a position where they’re able to succeed and ultimately help us as an organization get back to where we want to be. What then was it about being a Brewer that attracted you to remaining with the franchise through 2020? I love the city, I love the community, I love being involved in it, and my family enjoys the community. There are so many great people here ― I think just walking around the streets in Milwaukee, you realize the people are incredibly humble and down-to-earth and just genuine, sincere, good people. The fans have continued to support us even as we’ve gone through this transition that we’re currently in. The ballpark is phenomenal, we have a retractable roof, the weather is never an issue, we’re pretty centrally located when it comes to travel. So there’s a lot of things that I really love about Milwaukee and a lot of reasons I decided to commit to staying here. Also, you realize there aren’t too many athletes that have an opportunity to spend their entire careers in one city and there’s no guarantee that will happen with me but when I signed the long-term contract, obviously that was the goal and that remains the goal today.With that in mind, how has the city embraced you since the PED controversy and suspension? They’ve always been incredibly supportive of me. I think I’ve had so many people appreciate my involvement in the community and the efforts to give back and support different charitable foundations and different causes and that’s what’s most important. I think that’s the coolest part of our job ― I don’t think being a baseball player is that cool or that significant but because of the fact that I’m a baseball player and because I’m on this pedestal and in this position where I’m able to have a positive impact on other people’s lives ― that’s something that I’ve always taken a lot of pride in. It’s something the people have recognized to an extent and certainly thanked me for and that I continue to love doing.You want to be a Brewer your whole career. What was your reaction, then, to Kevin Durant leaving OKC for the Warriors? I don’t know. I wasn’t that shocked by it. I think you see some other great players move around in years past ― you see LeBron leaving Cleveland initially when he went to Miami and it’s not that shocking anymore. I think it’s more shocking probably to people who aren’t athletes. As athletes we recognize that it’s a business, it’s a profession and all I want is each and every athlete to do what’s best in their long-term interest and what’s going to make them happiest. So if he made that decision based on what’s going to make him happy and on what’s in his best interest, then I’m happy for him.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

A six-time All-Star and the 2011 NL MVP, Braun is the unquestioned face of the Milwaukee Brewers. But it hasn’t always been that simple.The 32-year-old Los Angeles native was suspended without pay for the remainder of the 2013 season and playoffs (totaling 65 regular season games) for violating the league’s drug policy through his involvement in the Biogenesis scandal.Braun, in the middle of his most productive season since, caught up exclusively with The Huffington Post to discuss the scandal from the fans’ perspective, as well as how he’s balanced fatherhood with baseball and why he wants to retire young. Oh, and he weighs in on Kevin Durant.You are the father of a 2-year-old. How do you manage that role with recognizing how important rest is?The sleep thing is challenging; obviously with a baby and a second baby on the way, I think your definition of a good night’s sleep is drastically altered. But obviously trying to get as much rest as possible to maximize recovery time, being more conscious of what I’m eating just to make sure that I’m putting quality food in my body and giving my body the best chance to recover.What is the winning ingredient for balancing fatherhood with being a ballplayer?It’s hard every day. Going on the road is more challenging than it’s ever been. Being away from the family is an extremely difficult, extremely challenging thing — thank God for FaceTime. But obviously I recognize how fortunate I am to be able to play this game; I recognize that, God willing, I’ll be able to retire at a young age and spend more time with my family. But certainly I think it’s more difficult than ever to go on the road. Especially when my daughter is really young, and we have a son on the way, and she’s just at an age where she’s just constantly learning and growing, evolving and figuring the world out, so it’s really tough to feel like I’m missing out on any part of that. Do you ponder retirement often?I mean, it’s impossible not to think about at some point, but I think if I were to give it too much thought it would take away from my ability to give myself the best chance to succeed now. So I try not to think about it much, but obviously now that I’ve gotten a little older and I have children, or a child and a second on the way, it’s something I’ve thought about a little bit.You have tasted postseason success in Milwaukee, but the team has struggled immensely since 2011. How do you go about your business during such a grind?When we were going through a stretch as a team where we were consistently competitive and putting ourselves in a position ultimately to play meaningful games in September every year, it was special. It wasn’t something I ever took for granted: I knew about the history of this franchise and I knew that obviously going to the postseason a couple of times in 2008 and 2011 were both really unique and special opportunities. So it wasn’t something I took for granted by any means.Looking at the game from a macro perspective, most small and mid-market teams have windows where they are more competitive than they are at other times, so I recognized that wasn’t always guaranteed and as we’ve gone through this transition.

But, according to new details released in court, his injuries could have been fatal. The production company responsible for the mishap, Foodles Production, is currently being tried for breaches in health and safety, according to The Guardian. The Disney subsidiary pleaded guilty to two of four charges at Milton Keynes Magistrates’ Court in London on Tuesday, relating to a breach of duty in relation to employees and a breach over people not employed by the company. Prosecutor Andrew Marshall argued that the oversight could have resulted in “a risk of death” and if it not for the door’s safety mechanism, Ford might not have made it out alive. “It could have killed somebody,” Marshall said. “The fact that it didn’t was because an emergency stop was activated.”A representative from The Health and Safety Executive likened the force of the door to being hit by a small car, adding that the incident was entirely foreseeable. “The British film industry has a world-renowned reputation for making exceptional films,” they said. “Managing on-set risks in a sensible and proportionate way for all actors and staff – regardless of their celebrity status – is vital to protecting both on-screen and off-screen talent, as well as protecting the reputation of the industry.”Foodles Production has proved to be cooperative with the legal proceedings, The Guardian notes, but is expected to challenge the level of risk of the accident during an official sentencing at the the end of August.

Americium-241, or Am-241, is commonly used to measure density and thickness in certain medical, industrial and commercial devices, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“When Am-241 powder is swallowed, absorbed through a wound, or inhaled it can stay in the body for decades,” the CDC states on its website.The CDC says cesium-137, or Cs-137, is commonly used in medical radiation therapy devices for treating cancer, as well as in industrial devices that detect material thickness and liquid movement. External exposure can cause burns, acute radiation sickness and death.Exposure to either Am-241 or Cs-137 may increase a person’s risk of developing cancer, according to the CDC.The thief also stole the employee’s debit card, Fitzgerald said.

Courtesy of the artists.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579652201200002a00a534ec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"In 2001, a Stanford art student named Jackie Sumell sent a letter to Herman Wallace, an inmate at Louisiana State Penitentiary, more commonly known as Angola. The letter read: “What kind of house does a man who lives in a 6-foot-by-9-foot cell for 30 years dream of?” The answer would take over 10 years to complete.Wallace grew up in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1971 he was convicted of armed robbery, a crime to which he admits, and sentenced to 25 years in an 18,000-acre maximum-security prison, once a complex of plantations, known widely as “the bloodiest prison in the South.”During his sentence, Wallace started the first ever Black Panther party inside of a prison, along with fellow inmates Albert Woodfox and Robert King. The three worked to educate their fellow inmates, improve race relations and mitigate the violence and sexual assault that occurred within prison walls. They organized hunger strikes and protests, protecting the new inmates from the cycle of sexual slavery that was the status quo. In 1972, Wallace, Woodfox and King were convicted of stabbing and killing 23-year-old prison guard Brent Miller. No physical evidence tied them to the crime. The testimony against Wallace, Woodfox and King, who came to be known as the Angola 3, was paltry. One of the case’s supposed eyewitnesses was legally blind, another rewarded for his statement. The accusation was largely understood to be a reaction to the activists’ political ties, considered “militant” by the white corrections officers and warden.The three men were indicted by an all-white, all-male grand jury. After his conviction, Wallace was soon removed from the general prison populous and placed in indefinite solitary confinement. For the next 41 years, he would spend 23 hours a day alone in a 6-foot-by-9-foot cell. Sumell first learned of Wallace’s story in 2001. King had been released from prison after 31 years and was telling the horrific story of his wrongful conviction to a group of artists in San Francisco. Sumell, a white, Long Island–born artist, wanted to do something. She wrote Wallace a letter. It would be the first of over 300 they’d exchange over the course of their 12-year friendship. In the midst of their written exchange, when the inhumanity of solitary confinement was making a legible mark on Wallace’s personality, Sumell received an assignment from a class at Stanford: Ask a professor to describe his or her most exorbitant dream home, a study on spacial relationships.“I struggled to balance the futility of my assignment — which reinforced the power dynamics of wealth, race, and privilege — with the stark reality of Herman’s condition,” Sumell wrote in her artist statement. She resolved, instead of asking a professor, to ask Wallace. Technically, “The House That Herman Built” does not exist, in that there is no physical structure that combines the many details Herman Wallace built up in his head ― the roses, gloxinia and delphiniums surrounding the premises, the pecan-colored cabinets, the panther peeking up from the bottom of the pool, the constant supply of snacks in the snack closet. And yet Wallace’s vision subsists in all its vibrant detail in his imagination, bringing a whole new dimension to the phrase “dream home.” Through envisioning every detail of his 3,500-square-foot suburban home, Wallace escaped the crushing limitations of his everyday existence. Through his collaborative project with Sumell, Wallace lived in two places simultaneously, a dismal, cramped cell and a picturesque home of his own creation. Although Wallace and Sumell didn’t build a physical house together, they did create an exhibition, titled “The House That Herman Built/Herman’s House,” compiling the letters and drawings they exchanged over the course of a decade. Sumell also creates a virtual tour through Wallace’s home, which he narrates, guiding visitors through the yellow kitchen to the ‘70s-style, shag-carpeted bedrooms and wraparound porch. “In front of the house I have three squares of gardens,” he says when approaching the door. “I would like for guests to smile and walk through flowers all year long.”The show also includes a life-sized, skeletal reproduction of Herman’s cell, based on his written descriptions and illustrated depictions. For visitors of the exhibition, the juxtaposition of the dream house’s fantastical presence and the confined cell’s physical reality mimic the dual reality of Wallace’s existence. The project, Sumell explained, has “become an international symbol of hope in the struggle to expose and ultimately end the inhumane practice of solitary confinement in the United States. It illustrates not only what is wrong, but also what is possible.” On Oct. 1, 2013, the courts overturned Wallace’s conviction, and after 44 years of imprisonment, 41 in solitary, he was finally a free man. He died three days later of liver cancer, surrounded by friends and family. “Herman’s legacy is not one of suffering and imprisonment,” Sumell continued, “it is one of justice and freedom, of dignity and fairness, of love and unwavering commitment to the people.”Although Wallace passed away before the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, his spirit is evident in the contemporary fight for racial equality in the criminal justice system and prison industrial complex. His story serves simultaneously as a devastating reminder of just how long the same hateful injustices have plagued our nation’s history and a triumphant tale of the human spirit’s ability to overcome the most nightmarish of circumstances with resilience, creativity and hope for humanity. Wallace and Sumell’s art activism project is currently on view at the American Visionary Art Museum in the group exhibition “The Big Hope Show,” comprising artists who used art to transcend unimaginable pain and struggle. The installation contains drawings and letters between the two, who grew to become best friends, including this letter from Wallace to Sumell, written in 2006: “I’m often asked what did I come to prison for; and now that I think about it Jackie, it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter what I came here for, what matters now is what I leave with. And I can assure you, however I leave, I won’t leave nothing behind.”“The Big Hope Show” is on view until Sept, 4, 2016, at the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. "

Wallace and Sumell’s art activism project is currently on view at the American Visionary Art Museum in the group exhibition “The Big Hope Show,” comprising artists who used art to transcend unimaginable pain and struggle. The installation contains drawings and letters between the two, who grew to become best friends, including this letter from Wallace to Sumell, written in 2006: “I’m often asked what did I come to prison for; and now that I think about it Jackie, it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter what I came here for, what matters now is what I leave with. And I can assure you, however I leave, I won’t leave nothing behind.”“The Big Hope Show” is on view until Sept, 4, 2016, at the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. "

He was then filmed hitting an imaginary pitch off of said dog owner ― Oakland Athletics’ pitcher Sean Doolittle.Doolittle’s girlfriend, Eireann Dolan, filmed the endearing 22-second play and posted it to Twitter Monday. She wrote that the child had “no idea who he was playing with.”Though he may not have known exactly who he was up against, the boy was surely giving it his all.In his first powerful swing ― though a strike ― he was seen spinning in a full circle before flashing a sheepish smile at Dolan’s camera and resuming his place alongside home plate.But in the next pitch, he positively nailed it, sending the ball “out of the park,” as Dolan proclaimed.It required a whispered nudge by Dolan but then the boy was feverishly seen running “the bases” as he circled Doolittle and his equally patient dog. The little lefty then hopped back to home plate, eager to do it again.“Sean was charged with the run,” Dolan noted with her video’s upload."

Lena Dunham, Shonda Rhimes, Mark Ruffalo, Kerry Washington and over 100 other celebrities released a signed initiative Tuesday pledging to unite against the hate that Trump promotes. The letter reflects the many groups that the GOP candidate has attacked over the years ― including people of color, those with disabilities, refugees, women, the working class and Muslims. “Donald Trump wants to take our country back to a time when fear excused violence, when greed fueled discrimination, and when the state wrote prejudice against marginalized communities into law,” the pledge reads. “His rhetoric and policy proposals exclude, degrade, and harm.” “Some of us come from the groups Trump has attacked. Some of us don’t. But as history has shown, it’s often only a matter of time before the ‘other’ becomes me,” the letter reads. Since Trump announced he was running for president, countless celebrities, including Chrissy Teigen, George Takei and Eva Longoria, have used their platforms to denounce the business mogul. On Monday night, Longoria schooled Trump during her speech at the Democratic National Convention and tore apart his disgraceful comments directed toward Mexican immigrants.“So when Donald Trump calls us criminals and rapists, he’s insulting American families. My father is not a criminal or rapist, in fact, he’s a United States veteran,” Longoria said. “When Trump cruelly mocked a disabled reporter, he was also mocking my special needs sister Lisa and many like her. When he said that a wife who works is a very dangerous thing, he not only insulted me, he insulted my mother who worked as a special education teacher for 40 years and raised four children while being a wife.” To sign the #UniteAgainstHate pledge, head here.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
