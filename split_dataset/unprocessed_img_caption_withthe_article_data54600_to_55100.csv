The company grew so big that she recently realized she needed to revise how it's run.Fisher spoke to The Huffington Post's executive editor for impact and innovation, Jo Confino, at the Sustainable Brands conference in San Diego this week in the video below.The clothing brand founder talked about the difference between what she called masculine and feminine leadership styles (around the 5:40 mark). Her company has recently become more masculine, she said.""The feminine is more listening and receptive kind of mode. And I feel like that has sort of helped me hear others, and work with others, and create a collaborative and intuitive kind of environment,"" she explained. ""I think we've done really well with this sort of feminine model, but we've kind of hit a point where we're too big almost and we need more structure. I never use the word 'structure' -- and 'strategy.' Those are sort of masculine words to me,"" Fisher said. By dubbing the two management styles masculine and feminine, Fisher noted that she didn't mean to suggest they align with actual gender: There are masculine and feminine traits in everyone. The masculine side values efficiency, she said.Lately, Fisher said, the company has brought in more men. One man in particular started talking about the differences between masculine and feminine leadership styles. She said she hadn't thought about management that way before. ""I always saw things moving organically and fluidly and intuitively and all of that. But now we have to be efficient and we have to be effective and we have to be focused and we have to make decisions more clearly,"" Fisher said. ""And we have to have more definition."" "

Party leaders are hoping Sanders will soon drop his presidential run.The Warren meeting on Friday fueled speculation that the senator from Massachusetts might be under consideration as Clinton's running mate. Asked in an MSNBC interview on Thursday whether she had discussed with Clinton the prospect of being vice president, Warren said she had not, nor had she been vetted.Having support from Warren would boost Clinton's ability to court highly motivated Sanders supporters who have been fired up against Clinton during the unexpectedly long primary battle. Warren and Sanders share views on issues such as reining in Wall Street excesses and fighting income inequality.Sanders said on Thursday he would remain in the race through the final nominating contest in Washington, D.C., next week but would work with Clinton to defeat Trump.Warren is also shaping up to be a no-holds-barred critic of Trump and they have had several spats on Twitter. Trump said on Friday that Warren was one of the ""least productive U.S. Senators,"" adding in a tweet: ""Hope she is V.P. choice.""President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden also announced their support of Clinton on Thursday, handing her a trio of endorsements expected to boost her standing heading into the general election campaign.But Clinton is dogged by the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server while secretary of state from 2009-2013.Emails between U.S. diplomats in Islamabad and State Department officials in Washington about whether to challenge specific drone strikes in Pakistan are at the center of a criminal probe involving her handling of classified information, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.Republicans have consistently criticized Clinton over her email use. ""We should not live above the law, and that is one of the cardinal sins that Secretary Clinton violated,"" House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Friday.Clinton has said she did not send or receive any information that was marked as classified and has accused the State Department and other government agencies of ""over-classifying"" her emails after a judge ordered them released to the public.(Reporting by Megan Cassella and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Frances Kerry and Alistair Bell)"
5,POLITICS,Supreme Court Says Judge Should Never Have Ruled In Death Row Case He Once Prosecuted,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-judicial-recusal-ronald-castille_us_5759ca6ae4b00f97fba7b2d4,Memo to Trump: This is what a biased judge looks like.,2016-06-10,"Before Ronald Castille (far left) was chief justice of Pennsylvania's highest court, he was the district attorney on this guy's case.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_9_72_4627_2857%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that Pennsylvania's former top judge violated the Constitution when he failed to sit out the case of a young man for whom he had recommended the death penalty back when he was district attorney.The high court's case was chiefly a dispute over when a judge's impartiality can be questioned -- an area that's become fodder for Republican presidential politics in recent weeks. But the legal journey of Terrance Williams, who at 18 was sentenced to die for murdering a man who may have sexually abused him, is far worse than anything an unhinged candidate may rattle on about.Williams' case illustrates the systemic failures of the criminal justice system -- from prosecutorial misconduct and use of false witnesses to tough-on-crime judicial politics and the arbitrariness of the death penalty.Justice Anthony Kennedy does a good job of summarizing the crooked road the case took in the Supreme Court's majority ruling.On the key point, Kennedy said that Ronald Castille, then chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, should have recused himself when his court considered Williams' appeal because nearly 30 years ago, he had been the district attorney who gave the green light to seek the death penalty against Williams.""Where a judge has had an earlier significant, personal involvement as a prosecutor in a critical decision in the defendant’s case, the risk of actual bias in the judicial proceeding rises to an unconstitutional level,"" wrote Kennedy, joined by his four liberal colleagues.""Due process,"" he continued, ""entitles Terrance Williams to a proceeding in which he may present his case with assurance that no member of the court is predisposed to find against him.”For a long time, Williams hadn't realized that Castille, who served on the state Supreme Court from 1994 to 2014, was ever really involved in his case. But Castille certainly knew how he felt about capital punishment: He campaigned to become chief justice on his record of sending 45 people to death row as Philadelphia's district attorney.Over the course of 26 years, Williams mounted numerous appeals to little avail until he finally came across information that a key witness had been offered a special deal to testify falsely against him and that prosecutors had failed to turn over information that might have exonerated him. Williams then sought access to the prosecution's whole file. That uncovered the memorandum signed by Castille that turned William's prosecution into a death penalty case, as well as other information critical to his defense.Learning all of this, Williams tried to get his sentence thrown out by Pennsylvania's high court. The defendant also specifically asked that Castille disqualify himself from the case, given his earlier participation as district attorney. The chief justice refused that request and then joined his colleagues in upholding the death sentence.Castille's involvement created ""an unconstitutional risk of bias,"" Kennedy wrote.""Chief Justice Castille’s participation in Williams’s case was an error that affected the State Supreme Court’s whole adjudicatory framework,"" Kennedy wrote. ""Williams must be granted an opportunity to present his claims to a court unburdened by any possible temptation ... not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused.""Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, disagreed and noted that all Castille did back in 1986 was make the decision to seek the death penalty -- and that any other misconduct or withheld evidence bore no connection to that decision.""The Due Process Clause did not prohibit Chief Justice Castille from hearing Williams’s case,"" Roberts said. He suggested that state ethics rules might be a better avenue to determining when a judge should recuse.Justice Clarence Thomas dissented alone to declare that this case didn't even implicate the Constitution.""This is not a case about the accused. It is a case about the due process rights of the already convicted,"" he wrote. ""Whatever those rights might be, they do not include policing alleged violations of state codes of judicial ethics."""

Biden also unleashed a series of blistering attacks against Clinton's opponent, presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who he said was ""literally undermining, and threatening and potentially doing damage to the constitutional imperative of an independent judiciary.""He called Trump's attacks on a Mexican-American judge presiding over lawsuits against Trump University ""reprehensible,"" ""racist"" and ""a dangerous attack on a vital pillar of democracy.""Trump last week said U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over lawsuits against Trump University, was biased against him because of his Mexican-American heritage.Biden said such attacks by a candidate from a major political party make Trump unable to be ""trusted to respect the independence of the judiciary as president.""""These are words of someone who sees our federal judiciary ... as a tool to manipulate to do what he calls 'to deal with the laws of our country,'"" Biden said. ""I don't think the framers envisioned a presidential candidate accusing a judge of being incapable of reaching a fair decision because of his ethnic decent.""I find Donald Trump's conduct in this regard reprehensible,"" Biden said. ""It is a dangerous attack on a vital pillar of democracy ... undercutting the legitimacy of a judge by suggesting that because of his heritage he's incapable of being fair. It is racist.""Clinton, who also has attacked Trump's comments, clinched the Democratic nomination earlier this week, according to The Associated Press.In addition to endorsements from Biden and Obama, the former secretary of state on Thursday gained an important endorsement from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).“I’m ready to jump in this fight and make sure that Hillary Clinton is the next president of the United States and be sure that Donald Trump gets nowhere near the White House,"" Warren said.This article has been updated to include additional comments from Biden."

Shut up and sit in the corner. I mean, seriously!""An exception to that Hollywood trend is the women-led ""Ghostbusters"" reboot which Clarkson said she ""can't wait to see."" When asked whether she was worried about the pressure surrounding the film and its performance at the box office, Clarkson acknowledged the harsh microscope it has been put under that projects spearheaded by women so often are.“Men make bad movies that bomb all the time but they’re like, ‘Oh, well, we didn’t do the marketing right,’” she said. “Eat me!”Having been in the entertainment industry for decades, Clarkson also shared her perspective on the lack of roles for older women. As Lee pointed out, ""Hollywood remains a challenging environment for women over 50 whose names don’t begin with Meryl."" What bothers Clarkson most, she said, is the lack of complex roles for women who dare to actually age.""These archetypal older women in movies can sometimes make my skin crawl,"" she said. ""It’s about the one dimension, it’s about the lack of any texture.”Clarkson is out to combat this sexism in entertainment and got a bit of a head start with Hollywood's pay gap problem. In May, ""House of Cards"" star Robin Wright revealed she demanded the same pay as Kevin Spacey after discovering she was being paid less. Clarkson did exactly the same thing -- eight years ago. She told The Guardian that after learning her male co-star was earning more than she was, she ""absolutely"" ensured she received the same pay. Read more of Clarkson's interview on The Guardian."

10,HEALTHY LIVING,Did Hillary Clinton's Win Make You Cry Happy Tears? Here's Why,Lindsay Holmes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-emotional-response_us_575ac6cde4b0e39a28ad5087,The human body is a magical (and sometimes uncontrollable) machine.,2016-06-10,"This is where we physically feel emotions in the body, according to researchers.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575b19f02200002d00f80570.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Hillary Clinton was named the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee on Tuesday, it was marked by numerous expressions of joy, pride, apprehension and anger -- all natural on the spectrum of emotions we experience on a regular basis (and certainly during an election season).But among supporters who cried or got chills and goosebumps, there's a pretty reasonable question: Why do emotions lead to physical symptoms? Turns out, feelings aren't just abstract thoughts. We have a physical reaction to our emotions as well -- and it's hardly within our control.Research shows that we experience physical changes based on how we're feeling. When it comes to so-called ""happy"" crying, the reaction is our body's physical way of regulating overwhelming positive emotions. A 2015 study by Yale University found that shedding tears when we're elated actually occurs because the body is calming itself down. Physical reactions even vary by emotion. One 2014 study even mapped where they occur in the body. Scientists discovered that elated emotions -- like love and happiness -- consume our whole being, with the core of the reaction occurring in our chest through an increased heart rate.And it's not just happy, warm-and-fuzzy moments that spark a physical response. Negative emotions can also prompt our bodies to behave in a visceral way.The same 2014 body-mapping study also found that anger and anxiety are concentrated in the chest through rapid heartbeat. Shame is activated more in the brain. Rejection or hurt feelings may also induce an upper body response.""Terms such as 'heartache' and 'gut wrenching' are more than mere metaphors they describe the experience of both physical and emotional pain,"" Robert Emery and Jim Coan, professors of psychology at the University of Virginia, explained to Scientific American. ""In fact, emotional pain involves the same brain regions as physical pain, suggesting the two are inextricably connected.""When it comes to the Clinton moment, specifically, another psychological process may be at play for those who have been fighting for equal representation. Researchers have long studied sexism and its influence on individual psyches: A 1999 cross-cultural analysis found that gender inequality can hurt a person's economic and personal growth. Other research also suggests that it can lead to reduced life satisfaction for large groups of individuals.Clinton's history-making nomination, in this sense, likely had a positive -- and immediate -- cognitive effect. Enter the tears.In short, as long we have emotions, we're going to have physical reactions to them. There's a cocktail of processes occurring when one moment triggers a strong feeling.

A quick glance at the headliners for this year's festivals across the U.S. reveals just how lopsided the lineups are.

The headliners for some of the city's top festivals like Governor's Ball, Electric Zoo and the newly-created Panorama are solely male, so The Other Festival's lineup of incredibly talented women stands out -- especially because it extends beyond music.The festival, which has been compared to SXSW for its mix of innovative speakers and emerging artists, boasts talent from various industries.

How did you come up with the idea for the festival?  My organization WIE [Women Inspiration And Enterprise] is focusing on helping more experienced women navigate the corporate workforce, [and] millennial women were the ones coming to events. They were very entrepreneurial, and coming up with all sorts of interesting ways of making money through social media, so I just really wanted to support and harness that creativity and entrepreneurial spirit. I was also particularly intrigued by, or really disturbed is a better word, by the music industry. The environment seems to be driven by women … and yet few of these festivals have female headliners. It just surprised me because when I think about the music business, I think about all these incredible powerhouse females driving it, and that's not really reflected in what we see. So I was inspired by those two factors to sort of bring them together into one powerful event. According to Entertainment Weekly, The Other Festival is the first ever all-female music festival in New York City. Are you surprised that that is the case in 2016?It's completely bizarre to me. I'm surprised no one's done it because there's just such a wealth of talent here across a number of creative spheres. I mean, I think it's been done in a form before … but that was a very, very, very long time ago. Also I feel like we're just in a very enlightened time at the moment, where female issues are at the fore. We have our first-ever female primary candidate and there's certainly a big sea change in terms of women's social issues; but for some reason the music industry feels like it's just a bit behind in the way that it views and positions women. And you know, I'm just getting to understand the politics of that. There's a lot that I've learned about how women are perceived and treated in the music industry that certainly runs counter to any other industry you could think of.I think women are still very commodified in the music business, more so than any other industry. So whether that's coming from the women in a position of strength or that's being driven by managers or by industry and industry expectations, who knows?In addition to supporting female speakers and performers, the organizers behind it are women as well. Was that a conscious decision on your part?Not necessarily. To be honest, my husband is in the background and he's a huge music lover, so he's actually been a huge source of support and ideas and a help in booking these bands. It's just an initiative that I felt very passionate about and wanted to create. I will say, there's a male-driven company I reached out to when I first came up with the idea because I wanted to partner with them, and they were very puzzled when I explained the concept. They were just like, ""We don't understand this language you're speaking."" Whereas every single woman I spoke to was like, ""Oh my God, I love it. Amazing."" So I'm naturally going to go with the people for whom this idea resonates -- that's just the way it is. Obviously, gender inclusion across various industries is extremely important, but was racial diversity also part of the equation for The Other Festival? Absolutely. This is about celebrating diversity in all its forms. So having women of color there and celebrated is important to me, as a black woman, and as someone who has come up against these issues. I want young women to have access to their role models, to see these women achieving and feel its possible for them, and I think its so much about that. It's so much about having people that you can look up to as role models because you can't be what you can't see. So I place a huge emphasis on diversity in everything that I do. Having said that, it's not really something that I consciously do. For me, it's just sort of quite natural. Like Rosario [Dawson] is amazing. I don't have to think, oh I want a Latina woman. I just think I want a brilliant actress who I think is inspiring and Rosario springs to mind. So in that sense, it wasn't hard to put this together and have diversity.

13,POLITICS,Members Of Congress Join Chorus Calling For Judge Persky's Removal,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brock-turner-aaron-persky-petition_us_57571166e4b07823f9517be0,Multiple petitions demanding the judge's removal have topped 1 million signatures.,2016-06-10,Reps. Ted Poe (R) and Jackie Speier (D) both think Judge Aaron Persky should lose his job.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575afb832200002d00f804ef.jpeg?cache=rGx14jsBz2&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Members of Congress are joining a growing chorus of people demanding the removal of the judge who handed down a six-month jail sentence to a former Stanford University student who sexually assaulted an unconscious woman.Over 1 million people signed a petition on Change.org asking the California legislature to start impeachment proceedings for Aaron Persky, the judge in the case. Meanwhile, more than 1 million people have signed separate petitions circulated by UltraViolet and MoveOn.org to ask the California Commission on Judicial Performance to remove Persky from the bench. Organizers spoke with with sexual assault survivors in San Francisco on Friday afternoon.As the petitions continue to rack up signatures, prospective jurors are also boycotting serving under Judge Aaron Persky, and elected federal officials are adding their support that Persky lose his job. Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democrat from California who sponsored legislation to reform how sexual assaults are handled on college campuses, told The Huffington Post this week that Persky should quit. ""I think he should resign,"" Speier said. She added, however, that it's ""a decision for the voters of Santa Clara County to make.""Rep. Ted Poe (R) from Texas, a former prosecutor and judge, also called for Persky to leave.""My personal opinion is the judge should be removed from the bench,"" Poe told HuffPost in an interview. ""But the people of California can make that decision.""Earlier this week, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said Turner's sentence was ""outrageous"" for ""someone who viciously attacked a woman.""The uproar began after Persky issued a six-month jail sentence with three years probation after he was found guilty of sexual assault, when prosecutors had requested six years in state prison. Public outrage mounted when a statement made by the victim circulated, and court records released showed Turner's father had referred to the assault as ""20 minutes of action.""In determining the sentence, Persky said, ""A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him."" He went on to cite Turner's clean criminal record and a belief that the former Stanford student would not commit another assault as additional reasons for the lenient sentence Many of the letters submitted to Judge Persky by supporters of Turner, and by the convicted sex offender himself, arguing for leniency, said that he would never have committed the crime if he hadn't been drinking. But Poe countered, ""Alcohol makes it worse -- it doesn't mitigate it, it makes it worse.""""Car thieves get more than 6 months in jail and this is a crime against a person,"" Poe said. ""The judge was wrong on this.""The activists are taking different routes to get Persky off the bench.A recall effort would require 20 percent of the voters in Santa Clara County's fall election to sign a petition, so the work couldn't be done in earnest until 2017. Complaints to the California Commission on Judicial Performance is asking that the agency find Persky engaged in misconduct, while petitions for the California legislature start impeachment proceedings for him. The petitions have attracted so much attention that Change.org established a special webpage to organize 10 of them together, titled the ""Justice for Stanford Sexual Assault Victim"" movement. Maria Ruiz, the author behind the Change.org petition that has topped 1 million signatures, told HuffPost she is also contacting members of the California Assembly to push for a vote to remove Persky. Another petition asking people to submit complaints to the Commission on Judicial Performance in California has more than 93,000 signatures.The commission should remove Persky to ""send a clear signal that rape apologists will never be tolerated as part of the criminal justice system,"" Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of the women's advocacy group UltraViolet, said in a statement. To garner support from Stanford parents and alumni, UltraViolet will also run a full page ad in the Stanford student newspaper's June 10th graduation issue.The design that will be used in the ad can be seen below:Persky has not commented on the case since he issued the sentence last week. Although Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen strongly disagrees with the sentence he said this week, ""I do not believe he should be removed from his judgeship.""_______"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), speaks during a campaign rally in Washington, D.C. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5759fe761500002f001b8a7a.jpeg?ops=crop_16_449_4184_2407%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Bernie Sanders delivered his typical stump speech at a campaign rally Thursday evening, choosing not to acknowledge President Barack Obama's endorsement of Hillary Clinton, his meeting with the president, or Clinton's claim to have won enough delegates for the Democratic nomination. “Next Tuesday, here in Washington, you will be having the very last primary of the Democratic nominating process,” Sanders told a crowd outside Robert F. Kennedy Stadium. “It would be extraordinary if the people of Washington, our nation’s capital, stood up and told the world that they are ready to lead this country into a political revolution.” It's not surprising that Sanders would want to pretend Washington voters could change the reality of the Democratic race. But his speech -- which didn't mention the words ""Hillary Clinton"" or ""convention"" -- seemed uniquely frozen in time. A recording of his remarks, except for the part about Washington at the end, would give few clues about when or where they had been given. He didn't mention that earlier in the day, Obama endorsed Clinton, who has won enough delegates for the Democratic nomination, or that he met at the White House with Obama and pledged to work closely with Clinton to defeat GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump.Sanders was somewhat more reflective than in past speeches, noting that his campaign had won 22 primaries and caucuses, garnered over 10 million votes, and broken small-dollar fundraising records. He listed places he had visited -- from Flint, Michigan, to Pine Ridge, South Dakota -- and implicitly advised the Democratic Party that could learn from his campaign’s successes. “We are here in mid-June and we are still standing,” he said. “We have showed the world you can run a winning national campaign without relying on Wall Street and fossil fuel and drug company donations.” Sanders decried corporate money in politics, income inequality, unemployment, climate change, federal drug policy, jobs transferred out of the U.S. and student debt. He pledged to reform the immigration system, health care system, campaign finance system and criminal justice system. (And other systems.) “Young people are catching on. They are the future of America, and they are damn determined to shape the future of America,” he said. “Real change never takes place from the top-down, it takes place from the bottom-up.”Roughly 3,000 Sanders supporters chanted, “Thank you, Bernie!” at the beginning of his speech, and, “Stay in the race!” near the end, as the sun set. They were as defiant as Sanders was. The Huffington Post had a difficult time finding supporters in the crowd who would admit they were ready to vote for Clinton, the party’s presumptive nominee, in November. “Hillary Clinton needs to win our votes, which means adopting some of Bernie’s platform,” said Keith Melchers, a 57-year-old D.C. resident, mentioning Sanders' proposal for free public university tuition. “She’s got to take on some of his agenda … I’m going to hold out to see what she does. I’m open, but it can’t be just, ‘Hey you’ve got to automatically support me.’ She has to come a little bit our way on our platform.” Susan Shufelt, a 69-year-old from Maryland, said she doesn’t think she could vote for Clinton.“I would feel terrible if [Sanders] just endorsed Hillary and that was it,” Shufelt said. “I want him to do something that will help get money out of politics and help reduce income inequality, the things he talked about during the campaign. I’m not hopeful because HIllary is so connected to money, her husband has his foundation, I don’t see any hope with her. … But I promised my friends I will keep an open mind, those who are a little less rigid than me.” Melchers said he’d be “delighted” if Clinton chose Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as her running mate. Others, however, said they didn't think Clinton could pick a vice presidential candidate who could make them feel comfortable with her nomination. And many said they weren't ready to even consider the possibility of voting for Clinton in the fall. They made noises of frustration at the question and characterized support for Clinton as “giving in.” “It’s the idea that we send a message to the establishment government that just because you chose Hillary, we’re not going to bow down to a lesser evil,” said Sufian Abulohom, 20, a student at American University. “It’s sending a message if you don’t pick Bernie Sanders, we’re not voting. … He’s going to send a message [at the Democratic convention] when he goes that he’s the best candidate to beat Donald Trump.” Not all of Sanders’ fans were so adamantly against Clinton. HuffPost found one supporter -- 17-year-old Virginian Meghan Gibbons -- who said she would vote for the former secretary of state in November.“I’ve always been a big Bernie supporter so I came out to see what his last, final hurrah was like,” said Gibbons. “I think he should rally behind Hillary, if nothing other than to try to prevent Trump from getting into office.""But April Washington, a 41-year-old D.C. resident, said she wasn’t afraid enough of a Trump victory in the general election to back Clinton. “Let the chips fall where they may, with that,” Washington said.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Thursday he'll vote for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, but still doesn't trust him with America's nuclear arsenal. ""I stand by everything I said during the campaign,"" Rubio told the Weekly Standard, when asked about a statement he made in February, before he dropped out of the presidential race, that he didn't want to turn over the U.S. nuclear codes ""to an erratic individual.""Rubio has doubled down on that claim before, telling reporters in May that his ""policy differences and reservations about Donald’s campaign are well-established."" Rubio said he would vote for Trump because he signed a pledge to support the Republican presidential nominee.Rubio recently told CNN he would be willing to speak on Trump's behalf at the Republican National Convention in July. Rubio bowed out of the Republican presidential primary in March.Others also have expressed misgivings about trusting Trump with the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) in March called a question about Trump potentially having the nuclear codes ""tough."" President Barack Obama and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton both have said the American people wouldn't trust Trump with the codes.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

The social media activists believe that Brock Turner, a former Stanford University student who was caught sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster last year, should receive a longer sentence due to the nature of his crime. ""Rape is a form of gender violence that is everywhere in the world,"" the group, known as the Free Chinese Feminists, wrote on its Facebook page with the hashtag #Solidarity4StanfordSurvivor. ""Sexist and racist justice systems have facilitated this by ignoring, dismissing and devaluing survivors' experiences.""The post made comparisons with gender injustices in China, where five activists were famously detained last year on the eve of International Women's Day. The women had planned to protest sexual harassment and were detained for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” Some 23 percent of men in China admitted to committing at least one rape, according to a 2013 United Nations study. ""A rapist who swims well is still a rapist! A judge who helps rapists [cannot] be a judge!"" read a sign held by one activist.Turner was a competitive swimmer; his father has faced scrutiny for mentioning his son's athletic accomplishments in a letter to the judge. After Turner was sentenced, hundreds of thousands of people signed a petition demanding that the judge, Aaron Persky, be removed from the bench.The Free Chinese Feminists could not immediately be reached for comment.

Uncollected rubbish has piled up in 10 of the city’s 20 arrondissements, or districts, affecting both tourist and residential areas. Strikers have also blocked access to waste processing centers and trash collection trucks in the city.The situation is expected to get worse: CGT union, which is representing the garbage collectors, has said it plans to continue the strike at least until June 14. French authorities dispatched private companies in the early-morning hours of Friday to help clear the estimated 3,000 metric tons of accumulated trash.""All the rubbish will be cleared up, starting now, today,"" Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said. ""It will take a few days obviously.""Strikes within the transportation sector could also affect the approximately 1.5 million soccer fans expected to visit France for Euro 2016, which is scheduled to take place in 10 cities around the country. Workers at state-owned railway company SNCF have been on strike for 10 days. Pilots striking this week led Air France, the country's national airline, to cancel between 20 percent and 30 percent of the flights it had scheduled for Saturday. Cities across the country have seen fuel shortages, as well as demonstrations and strikes in the nuclear, oil and transport sectors over the past few weeks. They're all part of a wide-ranging protest movement against a labor bill that would loosen workplace protection.Activists, most notably from the youth-led Nuit Debout (Up All Night) movement, have also staged large-scale protests across France to denounce labor reforms and express disappointment with President Francois Hollande. The demonstrations have been marked with strong clashes and violence between protesters and police. Hollande said in May that hundreds of police officers had been injured. Police in about 60 cities took to the streets on May 18 to protest the violence they say they had experienced during labor reform protests.Labor Minister Myriam El Khomri and CGT leader Philippe Martinez are scheduled to meet on June 17. Despite their mutual eagerness to sit down together, El Khomri told AFP Friday that the “government has not intention of withdrawing"" its labor bill.

With his comments, Welby drew into question how a self-proclaimed Christian can propose policies that seem to directly contradict the Christian ethos.Others have questioned Trump's religiosity given the aggressive, belligerent nature of his campaign, which has failed to resonate with many Christians. In February, evangelical newspaper The Christian Post published an editorial calling Trump a ""scam"" and urging evangelical voters not to support his campaign. ""Trump claims to be a Christian, yet says he has never asked for forgiveness,"" the editors wrote, referencing comments the businessman has made in several interviews.Even ultra-conservative commentator Glenn Beck agreed, saying on his radio show in March: “No Christian, no real Christian — I don’t mean a judgmental Christian, I mean somebody who is living their faith — no real Christian says, ‘I want that guy, that guy is for me.'""Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) renewed his efforts to end the federal ban on industrial hemp cultivation in a speech delivered Thursday.Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, hemp is classified under marijuana, but according to Wyden, hemp and marijuana are “very, very different in key ways.”“Industrial hemp does not have the psychoactive properties of marijuana. You’d have as much luck getting high by smoking cotton from a T-shirt as you would by smoking hemp,” Wyden said to his colleagues on the Senate floor.The senator believes the ban on hemp production has prevented “hardworking American farmers” from having the opportunity to tap into the growing demand for hemp products like soap, lotions and milk.“The hemp ban, in my view, looks like illegality for the sake of illegality,” Wyden stated.In January 2015, Wyden introduced the Industrial Hemp Farming Act, which would reclassify hemp and exclude it from the Controlled Substances Act. A bipartisan group of 12 senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) have supported the bill. If this legislation passes, it would have a significant impact on their states, as the federal ban has constrained local efforts to authorize commercial hemp production."

""The dab,"" an Atlanta-based hip-hop dance popularized by Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton during his MVP 2015-16 NFL season, is dead.In a Thursday morning interview with Charlotte radio WFZN-AM, Newton made a stunning declaration about his favorite touchdown dance: ""I have to put that aside,"" he said. Don't fret, Newton fans: He claims he's working on a new way to celebrate touchdowns during the 2016 season. ""I have time. I have until September to find out [a new celebration dance],"" Newton continued. Less than a year old, the dab had a strong, if controversial, run from fall 2015 up until February 2016's Super Bowl 50. Yes, the viral dance managed to stir some NFL fans last season, who were abhorred at Newton's dancing and apparent lack of sportsmanship. Newton, however, kept on dancing while respectfully understanding his critics, and eventually the rest of the NFL caught on. Newton's individualism in the face of critics was later celebrated. Newton's Panthers made an amazing Super Bowl run earlier this year, causing dabbing to reach peak popularity and mainstream reach. Meaning: It started to become lame. A few events that precipitated its downfall: A Fox affiliate thought the dance was named after Clemson football coach Dabo Swinney, Panthers owner Jerry Richardson showed off a weak dab, newscasters around the country tried it out on air, and a young San Antonio Spurs fan managed to dab 38 times in one NBA game. By Newton's Super Bowl 50 appearance (his team lost to the Denver Broncos), the dab was at peak saturation. Predictably, interest for the dance fell off a cliff right after February's big game.New season, new teammates and a new dance — Cam Newton's quest to repeat as NFL MVP is already off to a fresh, promising start.
