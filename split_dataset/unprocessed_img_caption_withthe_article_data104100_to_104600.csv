Marion was born a sharecropper's son, came of age during the Civil Rights movement, and became a fixture in D.C. politics for decades. As a leader with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Marion helped advance the cause of civil rights for all. During his decades in elected office in D.C., he put in place historic programs to lift working people out of poverty, expand opportunity, and begin to make real the promise of home rule. Through a storied, at times tumultuous life and career, he earned the love and respect of countless Washingtonians, and Michelle and I extend our deepest sympathies to Marion's family, friends and constituents today.Barry died early Sunday at the age of 78. His family did not release a cause of death.He first became mayor in 1979, serving three terms in office. In 1990, Barry was infamously arrested on drug charges as part of an undercover FBI investigation. He decided against running for re-election after his arrest, and ultimately served six months in jail after leaving his post. Barry was again elected mayor in 1994, and served until 1999. He also served three tenures on the D.C. city council, and was the representative for the city's Ward 8 at the time of his death. Read more on Barry's life here."

""Not in my wildest dreams do I expect the Paris agreement to close the gap to 2 degrees,"" de Boer told Reuters.China, the United States and the European Union, which together account for more than half of world greenhouse gas emissions, have indicated they want some sort of global accord in Paris, sharply raising the chances of success for the summit.""The prognosis is vastly better than going into Copenhagen,"" said Robert Stavins, director of Harvard University's Environmental Economics Program. ""The expectations (in 2008-09) were much too high."" CHINA FAVORS DEALThe new, looser model for a deal is a shift from the U.N.'s existing Kyoto Protocol, which obliges the European Union and a few other rich nations to cut emissions until 2020. But Kyoto only represents about 14 percent of global emissions.Last month, the European Union set a goal of cutting emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, shifting from fossil fuels towards renewable energies.And, in a joint announcement with China's President Xi Jinping on Nov. 11, President Barack Obama set a target of a U.S. emissions cut of 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 - 14 to 16 percent below the U.N. benchmark year of 1990.China, meanwhile, said it would cap its soaring emissions by ""around 2030."" It was the first time China has set a cap, but Beijing gave no numbers and studies by Chinese academics indicate emissions could soar by 30 percent by 2030. [ID:nL3N0T21YK)And Obama's goal faces a hostile Congress. Mitch McConnell, the incoming U.S. Senate majority leader, denounced the U.S.-China deal, as requiring nothing of China for 16 years while threatening ""havoc"" across in the United States.Still, Beijing's acceptance of a cap may change the dynamics of the U.N. negotiations. ""It represents significant pressure on other large emerging economies"" such as India, South Africa and Brazil, Stavins said.This year is on track to be the warmest since records began in the 19th century, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - despite cold snaps like one seen in the United States in recent days.A fall in oil prices to about $80 a barrel from $110 earlier this year may brake a shift in investments towards cleaner energies such as wind and solar power.Among other recent shifts, donor nations promised $9.3 billion in aid for a new Green Climate Fund to help developing nations cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to a changing climate.Marlene Moses, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said it was an ""important first step"" but well short of the $15 billion developing nations had urged.And a series of reports by the U.N.'s panel of climate scientists raised the certainty that human activities rather than natural variations are the main cause of climate change since 1950 to at least 95 percent.

3,WOMEN,Star Of TLC Show About Polygamy Says Father Molested Her,Andrew Hart,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rosemary-williams-my-five-wives-abuse_n_6205594.html,,2014-11-23,"FILE - In this Sept. 11, 2013, file photo, Brady Williams poses with his wives, from left to right, Paulie, Robyn, Rosemary, Nonie, and Rhonda, outside of their home in a polygamous community outside Salt Lake City. The newest polygamous family from Utah on reality TV says sharing their story with a wide audience has been liberating. The first of nine episodes chronicling the life of Williams, his five wives and their 24 children airs Sunday on TLC. A pilot episode aired last fall of the show, being called ""My Five Wives."" Williams and his wives said in an interview with The Associated Press that they enjoy being able live openly and not worry about who knows about their lifestyle. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fecb240000500098191e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A woman featured in a reality TV show about a polygamous family is going public about sex abuse she claims she suffered as a child in hopes of changing a culture of secrecy plaguing plural families in Utah.Rosemary Williams of ""My Five Wives"" on TLC says she was molested more than two decades ago by her father, Lynn A. Thompson and published her claims in a blog. He is the leader of the one of largest organized polygamy groups in Utah, the Apostolic United Brethren, or AUB.The AUB is estimated to be the second-largest polygamist church in Utah behind Warren Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints on the Utah-Arizona border. Unlike Jeffs' group, which has been plagued for years by allegations of abuse and child brides, the Apostolic United Brethren in northern Utah has a clean reputation.Thompson said the allegations were not true when contacted by The Associated Press on Friday. He did not immediately respond to a phone message on Saturday.Rosemary Williams says her father fondled her when she was 12 years old. She told The Associated Press that she does not plan to file a criminal accusation or a lawsuit against her father because she doesn't think that will do any good. She says she wants to prevent him from abusing others, especially given his recent appointment as president of the AUB, which has up to 7,500 followers across the West.Williams also hopes to be an advocate for abuse victims in patriarchal societies like the one she was raised in, where families are often fearful to report crimes out of concern they may be prosecuted under polygamy laws. She doesn't believe sex abuse is widespread among the polygamous group, but she wants mothers to be able to come forward and report it and other forms of abuse when they occur.""The reason people are afraid to say anything is because they are upholding somebody in a position of authority and they're taught to respect them,"" Williams said. ""They are afraid of the repercussions. They are afraid of Utah coming down on them and carrying their kids out of their home.""A search of criminal charges available online show no record of any criminal convictions for Thompson, and the Utah Attorney General's Office is unaware of any formal complaints submitted against Thompson, said spokeswoman Missy Larsen. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said he couldn't comment on the matter.David Watson, a spokesman for the AUB, didn't return multiple phone calls from The AP.Rosemary Williams is Brady Williams' third wife. He and his five wives and their combined 24 children are featured in the TLC reality show, ""My Five Wives."" They decided to do the show in part to demonstrate that polygamy can be healthy and stable. They live in a rural community outside of Salt Lake City Lake City where most people belong to the group Thompson leads.They no longer are members of the group. They slowly withdrew during the mid-2000s after re-evaluating their core beliefs. They still practice polygamy, but only because they are happy doing so, not out of the fear of hell or the promise of heaven, Brady Williams says.She said she recently confronted her father about what happened. He said he didn't remember and that he would pray to God to remember what happened. She reported the abuse recently to another high-ranking church leader, but nothing was done, she said.Rosemary Williams became choked up and was unable to talk while discussing the reaction she expects from family and friends who are still members of the polygamous group.""She knows that it will be very strong reprisal,"" said Brady Williams, explaining why his wife couldn't speak. ""Her family will probably disown her along with many of her friends.""There was no immediate response from TLC."

By Nov. 16, Swift had reached 35 million daily views, receiving an extra bump from the release of the song ""Blank Space"" on Nov. 10.Despite the increase in YouTube plays, Swift still sold 1.287 million copies of her most recent album, ""1989,"" during its first week of sales, reaching 2 million purchases after three weeks. In an interview with Yahoo! Music, Swift explained her reasoning for departing from Spotify:""All I can say is that music is changing so quickly, and the landscape of the music industry itself is changing so quickly, that everything new, like Spotify, all feels to me a bit like a grand experiment. And I'm not willing to contribute my life's work to an experiment that I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of this music. And I just don't agree with perpetuating the perception that music has no value and should be free.""Spotify CEO Daniel Ek responded to the removal of Swift's catalogue, writing, ""We started Spotify because we love music and piracy was killing it. So all the talk swirling around lately about how Spotify is making money on the backs of artists upsets me big time."" Ek noted that artists like Swift could earn $6 million per year from Spotify, but Swift's team reported back that she had received less than $500,000 through the previous 12 months.For more details on Swift's big YouTube boom, and an approximation of the return she can expect from the platform, head over to Mashable."
5,PARENTS,Attached at the Hip,"Margaret Klaw, ContributorFamily Law Attorney",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/attached-at-the-hip_b_6200908.html,"I have represented mothers of infants who do not want to be always available to them, who want time away, who want the fathers to share the burden as well as the joy. And if those parents are happier with that arrangement, doesn't that benefit their babies?",2014-11-22,Walk with the child in a baby sling. Breastfeeding,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e6a72250000350036d9c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My neighborhood is teeming with attached babies. They're peeking out from elaborate wraps which swaddle them onto the backs of their moms or snuggling into pouches strapped tightly to the chests of their dads. After the lights go out, they're sharing the family bed and breastfeeding off and on throughout the night, taking sips between naps. Attachment parenting is all the rage, which goes to prove there truly is nothing new under the sun. We return to our animal past, we acknowledge the wisdom of ancient cultures and the common practices of the developing world, and we claim it all as new and fresh.   I recently went to a seminar on attachment theory -- the social science underpinning the parenting practices of my neighbors -- and its relation to custody cases. Attachment theory is about the bond a baby forms with her parent or caregiver and the importance of that bond in later life. The idea is that a parent who is consistently available, attuned and responsive to an infant's needs allows that infant to develop a sense of security, a base from which she can explore the world. Children who are securely attached as infants, the theory goes, grow up with stronger self-esteem, are more self-reliant, have more successful social relationships and experience less depression and anxiety as adults. All of which makes sense to me at an intuitive level as a daughter, a mother and a family lawyer.But it's complicated. Pretty much, when we're talking about this type of parenting, we're talking about mom. What about the dark streak of regression in this vision, the look-back to times more oppressive, in actuality, than pastoral? What about the woman who does not want to use her body this way, who prefers to have her baby sleep in his own room so she can rest more soundly or have sex with her partner or read a magazine? Or the woman -- most women -- who needs to get up and go to work in the morning, whose infant cannot be attached to her body all day because she's running the cash register or cleaning the hotel room or trying cases? Are we bad if we don't want our bodies to be vessels? If we don't choose to breastfeed, if we dislike co-sleeping?Back in the seminar, I could see the hackles rising on the lawyers in attendance. We were shifting uncomfortably in our seats even before the psychologists began to address how this theory might guide courts in the establishment of parenting plans. We were all connecting the unspoken dots, worrying how this theory could be used by judges to minimize the role of divorced or separated fathers in the lives of young children. If supporting a baby's relationship with the parent to whom she is more attached is better for the baby, and if no extended periods of time should be spent away from mom while a baby (or toddler) is breastfeeding on demand, how can babies and young children become similarly attached to their dads? The notion, prevalent for so long, that fathers are inferior caregivers when it comes to babies or young children, is no longer embodied in the law. And the cultural norm has shifted as well. Most of my clients, both mothers and fathers, expect that dads will engage in hands-on, day-to-day parenting. And there is certainly lots of social science to support the importance of paternal involvement in children's lives. So, what do we conclude? If what's best for the child really is to maximize the role of the primary caregiver until she's 2 or 3, then dads should just suck it up. But if there is no hierarchy of attachment, then maybe the stress to the baby of spending time away from the primary caregiver will be outweighed by the opportunity to develop that same kind of relationship with her father. I don't know the answer. But I do know this: I have represented fathers of infants who ache to spend more time with their babies. And I have represented mothers of infants who do not want to be always available to them, who want time away, who want the fathers to share the burden as well as the joy. And if those parents are happier with that arrangement, doesn't that benefit their babies?Maybe the popularity of attachment parenting will swing the pendulum away from joint custody for young children. And maybe not. But one thing is certain: judges' determinations about what's in the best interest of children will always be informed by the common culture in which we all live. And right now, from my window, I'm seeing an awful lot of babies attached to their mothers' bodies."
6,WORLDPOST,The Disappearance Of 43 Mexican Students Is An Atrocity. But It's No Isolated Incident,Eline Gordts,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mexico-missing-students_n_6200842.html,,2014-11-22,"A university student is reflected in a glass display case containing the photos of the missing 43 students of the Rural Normal School of Ayotzinapa, Mexico, at the Central American University, UCA, in Managua, Nicaragua, Monday, Nov. 18, 2014.

(AP Photo/Esteban Felix)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9a8d092400008900042d02.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we look at the case of 43 missing students in Mexico and other disappearances in the country. Tens of thousands of Mexicans hit the streets of the capital on Thursday evening, angered by the government's response to the case of 43 students who went missing in Guerrero state in September. The group of students in a rural teachers' college disappeared on Sept. 26 on a trip to the town of Iguala. Prosecutors allege the students were killed by a local gang after police had handed them over to the criminals. Gang members told investigators they had killed the students and buried their bodies.The case of the missing students has put the high number of unsolved disappearances in Mexico once again in the spotlight. ""It is not just them,"" housewife Nora Jaime told the Associated Press during Thursday's demonstration, referring to the missing students. ""There are thousands of disappeared, thousands of clandestine graves, thousands of mothers who don't know where their children are.""The WorldPost spoke with Daniel Wilkinson, managing director of the Americas division at Human Rights Watch, about the disappearances in the country and the many Mexican families who live in insecurity about their fates of their sons and daughters.The disappearance of 43 students in Mexico's Guerrerro state has made headlines around the world, but hundreds of others are missing across the country. What is the extent of the problem?This is one of the worst atrocities we’ve seen in Mexico in many years, but it is not in any way an isolated incident. There have been many other cases of disappearances and forced disappearances -- when state agents are involved in disappearing people. At Human Rights Watch, we issued a report in early 2013 in which we documented 250 cases of disappearances, and 149 of them were forced disappearances -- involving state agents -- in various parts of the country. The full extent of the problem is hard to know. The government has acknowledged that there are more than 20,000 people who have disappeared or gone missing since 2007. How many of those cases are forced disappearances? How many of those people went missing the way people go missing in any country? It’s impossible to know. We do know from our own investigations and investigations by other organizations that a large number of those are forced disappearances. What we do know, too, is that there has been a consistent failure on the part of the authorities to investigate and prosecute these cases.How are these disappearances related to the drug violence ravaging parts of the country?This is definitely all happening in the context of the violence that has broken out since the previous government of President Felipe Calderón launched his war on drugs, and undoubtedly, a lot of the violence and the abuses have been committed by members of criminal organizations that are extremely violent. But again, it’s difficult to know because the crimes are so rarely investigated in a serious fashion. When we issued our report with 149 cases of forced disappearances, the attorney general's office promised to investigate. Now almost two years later, they have yet to obtain a conviction in a single one of these cases. It’s hardly surprising then that people would think they could get away with such a crime because the norm is impunity in cases of abuse by police and security forces. Why has the case of the missing students sparked so much outrage across Mexico?First, this case stands out because of the large number of people disappeared at one time. Second, it was carried out in such a flagrant manner -- with the students being attacked by police in the streets of the town of Iguala and then taken off. Third, these are students at a teachers’ college. The government often dismisses victims by saying they were probably involved in drug trafficking or crime, but this case cannot be dismissed that way. Finally, the frustration, the discontent and in many cases the desperation of people throughout Mexico who over the last few years have been seeing this incredible level of violence and abuse and impunity has perhaps reached a breaking point, and this was the case that crossed the line and tapped into this broader sense that something is fundamentally wrong and has to change. Mexico’s President Peña Nieto vowed at the start of his presidency to change the government’s approach to the war on drugs. Has this had any effect on the number of disappearances and the government’s approach to investigations?Peña Nieto promised change, but the change ended up being little more than changing the topic of conversation. He approached the issue of public security as a PR problem, and the strategy was little more than to stop talking about it. Clearly, that hasn’t worked. It has blown up in their faces and now they’re forced to respond in a way they haven’t been. In the case of the missing students, the president initially claimed it was not his problem, but rather a problem that had to be addressed by local officials in Guerrero state. He eventually had to backtrack, but it’s revealing that that was the initial attitude. If there's one aspect about disappearance you think our readers should know to understand the crisis, what would it be? It’s important to understand the nature of the crime. Disappearing someone is one of the cruelest acts that can be committed against people -- not only against the immediate victim but also against the family. Families are put in a situation where they have no idea what happened to their sons or daughters. It makes it very difficult to begin the process of mourning and puts them in a state of perpetual anguish, doubt and despair.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

I felt that a breaking point will soon be reached.A 30-foot effigy of Peña Nieto, its chest crossed by the presidential sash, would later be burned in the Zocalo. The sea of voices cried out for justice. Two violent incidents in Mexico City featuring small groups of mainly masked and hooded agitators, identified by television commentators as anarcos (""anarchists""), were given prominence on TV news programs throughout the day. Early in the afternoon approximately 100 young people, some with faces partly covered, were heading for Mexico City's airport when they clashed with hundreds of municipal and riot police intent on keeping access to the airport open. After an initial skirmish, two patrol cars were set on fire, several journalists were injured, 31 protestors were arrested and the main group was encapsulated by the police. Twenty of the detainees are students. Late in the night, as the mass of peaceful demonstrators drained out of the Zocalo, dozens of ""anarchos"" (as the TV news would have it) emerged from the midst and ran towards the National Palace on the east flank of the square. One of the building's monumental wooden doors had been rammed repeatedly and set afire during the previous mass demonstration on Nov. 9, as TV cameras filmed the assault, but police intervention was curiously late in coming. That night for nearly an hour attackers throwing sticks, stones, and Molotov cocktails surged back and forth with serried ranks of riot police who sprayed them with fire extinguishers. According to the Mexican news magazine Proceso, demonstrators who had remained in the Zocalo were rushed by the riot police and dozens were injured. In a letter published in Saturday's La Jornada, a university teacher who was wounded describes violent police aggression against peaceful participants who were trying to leave the square and who were beaten and sprayed with pepper spray, many falling on top of each other or fainting. Entire families who sought shelter huddling against the metal shutters protecting stores were attacked by riot police. Eleven people arrested in the Zocalo have been charged with acts of terrorism, attempted homicide and organized crime. The detainees include students, a swimming teacher, and a professional photographer who was arrested while leaving the Zocalo with a few friends, according to his son. Elsewhere in Mexico many more demonstrations took place. Again, TV reporting gave precedence to violence, as in San Cristobal de las Casas, in Chiapas, where a battle ensued between ransackers and storekeepers after stores were plundered and a bank trashed while the police stood idly by.Citizens' groups and opposition party senators  are now accusing the government of infiltrating agitators to justify repression and curtail freedom of speech and the right to protest. On Nov. 7, Mexico's Attorney General  Jesus Murillo Karam announced in a press conference that the 43 students had most probably been done away with in Cocula, not far from Iguala, their bodies incinerated for 14 hours at 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit in the municipal garbage dump on a pyre of tires, wood, and plastic refuse doused with gasoline and diesel fuel, and their charred, pulverized remains stuffed into garbage bags and thrown into the San Juan River. In a video, three alleged participants, their faces pixelated, described their labors in gruesome detail. The attorney general accused Jose Luis Abarca, the former mayor of Iguala, and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda, of having given the order for the students, who were interfering with a political event staged by Pineda, to be ""dealt with."" Murillo Karam regretted that only two bones were in good enough condition for a leading Austrian forensics laboratory at Innsbruck Medical University, that has previously identified the remains of the Romanovs and victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, to extract DNA samples for possible matching to the students or their families. According to the Institute of Legal Medicine's director, deciphering the DNA would take at least 10 weeks, and then further work would be done in Spain before the results could be made known. Earlier that day, the news and two bagfuls of ashes and bits had been presented to the families. Murillo Karam called an abrupt end to the press conference, saying ""I'm all tired out,"" which sparked a storm on Twitter. No one is satisfied with the explanations so far. People are still waiting for the forcibly retired governor of Guerrero to be questioned. They want to know what the so-called ""imperial couple"" of Iguala, who were firmly in bed with drug cartels, may have confessed since their Nov. 4 arrest in a lower-class neighborhood in Mexico City. They wonder who gouged out the eyes and stripped the flesh from the face of Julio Cesar Mondragon, an impoverished 22-year-old student whose daughter was born two weeks earlier, while he was still alive, who murdered a taxi driver and his female passenger when buses filled with students were fired on. But the $64,000 question is still why were the students kidnapped and, presumably, killed? Some family members cherish the hope that they are still alive and doing forced labor in a mine.  The past 56 days have seen marches, sit-ins, teachers' and students' strikes, looting in shopping centers and supermarkets, ransacking and torching of public buildings, seizing of toll booths, blockading of highways and mass fasting and prayer. During last weekend's three-day holiday, 14,000 hotel reservations were cancelled in Acapulco due to the resort city's recent unrest. Adding fuel to the flames, on Nov. 9 leading investigative journalist Carmen Aristegui published a report revealing that a sprawling $7 million dollar mansion in an upscale Mexico City neighborhood thought to be owned by Peña Nieto was in reality the property of an ad hoc real estate company belonging to a construction firm, one of whose subsidiaries was part of a Chinese-led consortium to build a high-speed rail line between Mexico City and the city of Queretaro. The contract was cancelled suddenly a few days before the news emerged, on the eve of a presidential visit to China. Millions have watched Angelica Rivera, Peña's soap opera star wife, on a prime time news program and on YouTube indignantly explaining that it is she who owns the house, which she has been paying for in installments, but that she will now sell her interest in it. In contrast, nearly 50 percent of Mexico's population lives under the poverty line. The government is betting that people will forget -- give up or give in -- but Mexicans are tired of monstrous corruption and impunity. They're not falling for the stale old arguments of ""a plot to destabilize the country"" and ""threats to the national project."" I keep thinking of the renegade newscaster in the 1976 movie Network exhorting viewers to yell out of their windows ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!"" What's next? The Inter-University Assembly has called for a nationwide strike and a symbolic taking of Mexico City on Dec. 1, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata's entry into Mexico City with their armies. Dec. 1 is also the second anniversary of Peña Nieto's swearing in as president. The future would seem to hinge on two bits of bone. If a match to the DNA of one or two students is discovered, will this be sufficient proof that all 43 perished on the pyre? Or not? And then what?More from The WorldPost on Mexico's missing students: Correction: A previous version of this piece incorrectly stated that protesters were sprayed with mustard gas. It was in fact pepper spray. "

Earlier this month, the actress and singer-songwriter surprised fans when she announced she'd tied the knot with longtime partner, Kari Strand, whom she proudly describes as ""the love of her life."" Callaway's wedding is just one of many personal milestones which take center stage in her new cabaret act, ""Turning Points."" The Tony-nominated performer says the show, which opens Nov. 23 at New York's 54 Below, is her ""most challenging"" piece yet and ""an exploration of songs about the major moments of my life"" which include her Broadway debut, her move to New York from Chicago and the death of her father. It's also fitting that Callaway's performances coincide with Thanksgiving week, as she calls the show a ""musical feast"" which ""celebrates the gifts that life gives us."" She says her planned set, which features the Ted Rosenthal Trio, includes standards, Broadway showtunes, jazz as well as original material. ""My show is a celebration of joy and of sorrow, and how competing truths can live together,"" Callaway, 56, told The Huffington Post in an interview. ""It's also about the how can we can still have a great life, despite all the anxiety and uncertainty. I've had such a rich life, so it's hard to know how many of the high moments I can do in a single show."" Early in rehearsals, Callaway said she and director Dan Foster also ""wrestling"" between two original songs she'd been about the events of 9/11, which were defining for her work: ""Ever since then I've felt much more focused about my mission as an artist, so I approach every moment with the awareness of the possibilities that are always around us…the possibility for connection and for loss."" Callaway is once again on a professional roll. Her latest album, ""From Sassy to Divine: The Sarah Vaughan Project,"" was released in September. In March, the star -- who came out publicly in a 2009 interview with The Advocate -- joined fellow composers Lance Horne, Stephen Schwartz and John Bucchino for ""Tyler's Suite,"" a choral song cycle dedicated to Tyler Clementi, the 18-year-old Rutgers University student who took his life in 2010 after reportedly being subjected to anti-gay bullying. Callaway said she felt inspired to participate in the piece because she felt ""deeply concerned by the very serious level of Internet bullying"" to which lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) teens are often subjected. ""The freedoms that the Internet has given people are beautiful in some ways, but can also be extremely destructive, as it was in this case,"" Callaway, who has befriended members of Clementi's family, said. ""Anytime anyone is chastised and exposed for being who they are and not being accepted is something that, to me, is a violation of human rights. We, as people, need to come together and insist that change be made."" If Callaway has her way, ""Turning Points"" will be yet another ""defining moment"" in a celebrated musical career. Ann Hampton Callaway's ""Turning Points"" plays New York's 54 Below from Nov. 23 -- 29. Head here for more information.  "

Bush is in Tanzania for a forum of regional First Ladies, hosted by his wife Laura, which will also be attended by First Lady Michelle Obama.AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ddfb240000500098f84d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A few weeks ago I wrote in a column that ""Election Day once again showed that our political system is broken -- voters went to the polls, sent a message, and then leaders will in the days and months ahead ignore what the public was trying to tell them."" And President Obama's recent announcement bypassing Congress with executive orders related to immigration reform puts a highlight on our broken democracy.We have two presidents who were given a great opportunity to fix the system in D.C. and provide common sense leadership, and both have forgotten that the means of governing needs work and just sought partisan ends. President Bush in the aftermath of 9/11 and President Obama in the days after his transformative election were each given a great window of opportunity by a huge majority of voters to lead in a different way. And both squandered this in the course of their time in office.Americans have voted for two presidents in a row whose main campaign message was they were going to bring the country together, fix the divisiveness in Washington, D.C., and build consensus across the aisle. And in the aftermath of the presidencies of Barack Obama and George W. Bush, the country is coming away more polarized and governance more dysfunctional. And both political parties have a growing demographic problem that will make it very hard for them to capture the hearts and minds of a majority of Americans while they still win elections (or more accurately lose less).I have talked for years, and pushed while I worked for President Bush, that the GOP has a growing Latino problem. Republicans can't ignore this fast growing part of the electorate and expect to be a majority party. Conversely, Democrats have a huge problem with white, working-class voters, especially males, that they must fix. Ever since President Clinton's re-election in 1996, Democrats have done considerably worse among white male voters even while winning elections. In the 2014 general election, Latinos represented 8 percent of all the votes cast and the GOP lost them by 26 points; white male voters were 37 percent of all votes, and Democrats lost this group by 31 points. The demographic vice is squeezing both parties.And simultaneously to all this there has been a consistent rise in voters who are fed up with both political parties and who are now calling themselves independent. Faster than the growth of Latino voters and the rise of the angry white male is a growing group of voters who are registering as something other than Republican or Democrat. In state after state, voters are opting out of casting ballots in primaries and are picking a third way to express themselves. For now, this has been heard in ways of a voice of consistent frustration or by voting each party out of office every two years, but at some point independent candidates will begin to find success. And then maybe this red/blue monopoly will be broken. One can hope, and also see it realistically coming.I agree with President Obama on the substance of what he has done on immigration and I support the compassion for folks who live in the shadows in our country, but I totally disagree with the manner with which he has done it. His party just lost a midterm election and if the president really wanted to fix things in this country he wouldn't have just stuck a finger in the eye of the opposition. The country keeps asking for the means of governing to be fixed, and President Obama's actions on immigration only exacerbates the governance problem.President Bush's and Obama's ""my way or the highway"" approach to leadership might get them to where they are going faster, but it is only going to leave us as voters more frustrated and less trustful of the journey in this road of democracy. Over the last 15 years, both sides are to blame for where we have arrived, whether it's Democrats fighting President Bush or the GOP attacking President Obama as either party holds Congress.When arrogance meets obstructionism, dysfunction is born and breeds wildly. And while President Obama's intentions I am sure were good, his recent actions on immigration will only compound the loss of leadership we all feel in this great country of ours. It is time each of us stands up and says enough is enough, and begin to demand more, starting with the communities in which we live.There you have it.--Matthew Dowd, Founder of ListenTo.Us, is an ABC News analyst and special correspondent.

At least three people were arrested during the protest. Brown was killed by Darren Wilson, a Ferguson police officer, on August 9. A grand jury is expected to decide this month if Wilson should be charged in the shooting.

McKesson is a key activist in the Ferguson movement and a member of the coalition that composed the list of rules.Slay, together with Missouri Department of Safety Director Dan Isom and St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley, issued a statement Friday that urged peace in the coming days and addressed the list of rules. Slay said that while some of the proposed rules make sense and are indeed already being practiced by law enforcement, others would make it difficult or impossible for officers to carry out their jobs. “The bottom line is that we have instructed our police officers to protect the protesters’ Constitutional rights,” Slay wrote on his website. “We have directed them to use more active tactics only when necessary to keep people safe or to protect property.”According to documents published online, police declined requests for officers to “wear only the attire minimally required for their safety,” saying instead that they will use protective gear when needed to protect fellow officers, and that the gear would not be used to intimidate protesters. They also declined requests to prohibit the use of crowd control equipment, including armored vehicles, rubber bullets, rifles and tear gas, saying the use of those tools and equipment will be left to law enforcement’s discretion. Another point of disagreement was the use of safe houses for protesters as “sacred ground."" While the unified command said they would honor those spaces, they also said that “life safety and exigent circumstances could be valid reasons to enter.” Law enforcement authorities also did not agree to provide protesters with 48 hours’ notice ahead of the grand jury’s announcement, saying that decision was beyond their control. In the past few nights, police have arrested a handful of protesters in Ferguson. Many fear that the presence of so many law enforcement officials, including members of the National Guard, will only exacerbate the situation if violence breaks out. “The police, with the arrests [from] the past nights, continue to provoke and agitate protesters,” McKesson told HuffPost in an email. “Justice is blind to blackness in STL.”In effort to maintain the peace, President Barack Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder and Michael Brown’s father have all addressed the public in recent days to call for calm and urge people not to resort to violence. “I thank you for lifting your voices to end racial profiling and police intimidation -- but hurting others or destroying property is not the answer,” Michael Brown Sr. said Thursday. “No matter what the grand jury decides, I do not want my son’s death to be in vain,"" said Brown. ""I want it to lead to incredible change, positive change, change that makes the St. Louis region better for everyone."" "

Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end?""Cosby has previously refused to answer questions regarding allegations that he sexually assaulted several women. In an interview with NPR's Scott Simon broadcast on Nov. 15, Cosby shook his head and remained silent when asked to respond to the claims. Cosby also refused to respond to the AP's Brett Zongker regarding the allegations, saying, ""No, no, we don't answer that."" He later requested, still on the record, that the AP interview be ""scuttled.""For more from Cosby, head to Florida Today. Singer's full statement is available at ABC."

Like many, I want a decision to be made, and want there to be peace in Ferguson. I was nervous that a decision would be announced, and that whatever the decision would be, others around me would make insensitive comments or declarations without a level of mindfulness or compassion about others around them.I am keenly aware that people have different beliefs and about ideas about the Michael Brown shooting, and what has been happening in Ferguson. I am grateful that I live in a country where people can have their own opinions and freedom of expression. I do not always expect others to agree with me. I do question the current day climate for civil discourse, mindful communication, empathy and understanding of a much a larger and complex social and political history and context.When the verdict about the Trayvon Martin shooting occurred in 2012, I vividly remember being home alone, and watching the verdict. I was shocked and disappointed. I was able to deal with my own emotions and feelings, and did not have to explain the emotions, nor put them in context, or connect them to a deeper historical legacy. For many of us, the shooting death of Michael Brown cannot be seen in isolation, nor will the grand jury decision. There are historical legacies and events that bring up questions of bias, profiling, police presence, protest, the valuing/devaluing of lives, and the tragic loss of a young Black man.Social media can often be often be an unscientific ""temperature check"" for the different viewpoints and expressions of confusion, fear, anger, disappointment and conscious and unconscious bias. In some ways, the world of short blogs and 140 characters is symbolic of the all too prevalent overly simplified analyses, and sensational headlines that might generation ""likes"" and ""retweets,"" but do not bring us to a better understanding of people, communities or our history.Mark Williams, in his book Ten Lenses: Your Guide to Living and Working in a Multicultural World, asks us to think about how our Legacies+ Layers= and Lenses and how we view the world. Williams explains that our ""layers"" are the aspects of our identity (race, gender, age, sexual orientation, language, ability, education, etc.) Our ""legacies"" are our ancestors' experiences.Sociology and anthropology have additional theoretical ways of looking at groups, identity and connection. What Williams offers us is a very simple and clear way to think about how events and life experiences impact the way we view the world.This could be a challenging model for those that believe that people need to ""get over"" things that have happened in the past. This is not to suggest that we do not acknowledge and celebrate progress, and the many changes that have been made a societal, national, and international level. It does however challenge us to think more holistically about the power and historical legacy of certain language, media images, and tragedies like Michael Brown's death.In October of 2014, the Wall Street Journal reported that Governor Nixon formed a commission that would ""to study and recommend ways to address underlying, systemic inequality."" The commission was formed after the protests and unrest, with the awareness that there is a legacy of inequality in Ferguson Missouri. It is a legacy that many have chosen not to see. The protest and unrest that followed the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson has been summarized by some with a generalized blanketing of individual behaviors to whole communities, and evaluations of complex situations with inaccurate collective blame. The virulent posts about looting and ""thugs,"" often assess the events in Ferguson with a focus on highlighted criminality, and generalizations of the protests as nothing more than rampant looting.I do not condone criminality or looting... nor do the majority of people in Ferguson, or those who support the people in Ferguson. My focus is more on the pain of the Michael Brown's family, the unrest after the shooting, and the legacies of inadequate educational access, poverty and related challenges.Michael Brown's father recently shared a poignant video message acknowledging what was happening in Ferguson. He shared that he wants the grand jury decision to lead to ""incredible change; positive change; change that makes the St. Louis region better for everyone."" He also cautioned that ""hurting others or destroying property is not the answer."" Civil Rights activist, professor and author Mel King views Ferguson through his experiences and the legacies of segregation and civil rights. In a recent interview he stated that ""no one addresses the crimes against humanity, and every time something like this happens (Ferguson,) it is a crime against humanity."" For King, Ferguson is tied to a much bigger picture, that includes his life experiences and a history of social justice, struggle, community empowerment, and civil rights.Dr. Ancella Livers, is a renowned Executive coach, and expert in leadership and leadership solutions. In her article entitled ""Skittles and Race in the Workplace,"" she talks about how the Trayvon Martin shooting is part of her consciousness, and connected to her worries and fears about her own sons. She writes ""I know that I am not alone. I know there are other mothers, sisters, aunts and friends out there who carry such fears about their brown sons, their gay ones, their Muslim and Jewish ones. But there are few places for us to share these worries and fears."" Her courageous vulnerability reminds us that the Trayvon Martin shooting is a legacy for her, and for others, and that is not something that can be checked at the door.Moving ForwardIn August, we read about a school that banned discussions about Michael Brown's death, and the protests in Ferguson. In the age of school shootings, and numerous challenges to healthy school communities, we can intellectually understand the desire to protect the students from information that could be scary and overwhelming. However, I also believe that there was perhaps a missed opportunity for learning. In my global diversity and inclusion and coaching work, I have learned that learning and dialogue about our layers, legacies and lenses can lead to better relationships at the individual and organizational levels. Banned topics do not cease to be discussed. Banning a conversation sends a message about a topic, and leads to discussions that often cannot benefit from diverse perspectives, life experiences, or the sharing of legacies.Moving forward, I would hope that we create conversations that allow for nuances, the learning of different legacies, and the connection to our national and global communities.Recent research in the U.K. linked happiness to a child's emotional health. They discuss emotional health as a predictor of future happiness. There are potentially severe implications and questions for children growing up reading about/seeing the news of Michael Brown's death, and the protests in Ferguson without healthy opportunities for support, sharing, and learning. What are some of the legacies that will impact children in the future? How can we help support and nurture the emotional health of all young people in an age of economic and educational disparity? How can we help children (and adults,) understand the different legacies that shape the way we view what happens our country and world? How can we help children process the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown so that they understand that all lives do matter? As we wait for the grand jury decision, I would advocate for a deeper awareness of the legacies, and an awareness Michael Brown's death, the protests in Ferguson, and the grand jury decision will indeed be a legacy for people around the world."

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae01362600003500811976.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Congratulations to Mia Love on being the first black Republican woman in Congress. On the night of her victory, Love remarked, ""Many of the naysayers out there said that Utah would never elect a black, Republican, LDS [Latter-Day Saint, or Mormon] woman to Congress. Not only did we do it, we were the first to do it.""But what exactly were the naysayers doubting? Surely it was not that a strongly Republican and heavily Mormon state could elect a Mormon Republican. And while there have been no Utah women in Congress recently, there have been three Utah women in Congress in the state's history, so the doubt was not about getting a woman elected either.The real question was whether a very white state would elect a black representative. But on Election Day, the voters of Utah's fourth congressional district elected Mia Love. Just as many people took the election of Barack Obama as a sign of a new post-racial America, some might take Love's election to mean that post-racialism has reached Utah. But the truth of the matter is that the election of a racial-minority candidate tells us very little about racial relations. Love received 50 percent of the vote. The political scientist Michael P. McDonald estimates that only about 30 percent of eligible voters in Utah actually voted, so Love was likely supported by about 15 percent of all eligible voters in Utah. In other words, the vast majority of people eligible to vote did not vote for Love. By no stretch of the imagination can we use their non-vote for Love to assess their racial attitudes.Additionally, we have no idea about the racial views of individuals who did vote for Love. Probably every American has supported a candidate about whom they were less than enthusiastic. Some Americans may have even voted for a candidate they disliked because they hated the candidate's opponent even more.With Obama we saw this dynamic specifically related to race with the ""racists-for-Obama"" vote. For example, in 2008, a man told a woman working for the Obama campaign, ""Ma'am, we're voting for the n*****."" Another Obama supporter stated, ""I wouldn't want a mixed marriage for my daughter, but I'm voting for Obama."" We don't know whether there were ""racists-for-Love"" voters.After the 2008 election of Barack Obama, many people declared America post-racial. This declaration was followed by large racial controversies around the arrest of Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., around unauthorized immigration from Mexico and Central America, around the killing of Trayvon Martin, around changes to voting laws, and around the killing of Michael Brown. It would be a mistake to ascribe any post-racial motives to the election of Mia Love.Mia Love is likely just the beginning of a new wave of Democratic, independent, and Republican elected officials of color. Many of these new elected officials of color will say Obama-esque things like Love's statement that ""these issues that we're facing in our country, they're not black-white issues. They're American issues."" They may even beat Obama's record for not talking about race. (In his first two years in office, Obama mentioned race fewer times than any Democratic president since 1961, according to research by the political scientist Daniel Gillon.) But it would be a mistake for us to take their post-racial, colorblind politicking to mean that the country is actually post-racial. This point was illustrated crudely and clearly by a recent Republican caller to C-SPAN who stated, ""This is about race. The Republicans hate that n***** Obama."""

Salinger at a bookstore in Washington, DC. J.D. Salinger, the reclusive author of 'The Catcher in the Rye,' has died at 91, his agent said January 28, raising tantalizing questions over whether the legendary writer might have left behind a hoard of unpublished works. AFP PHOTO/Mandel NGAN (Photo credit should read MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb66d722100000002c8b3b6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SPECIAL FROM Next AvenueBy Linda BernsteinLet me begin with this: The kind of YA (Young Adult) books that are marketed to teens these days (think The Hunger Games) didn’t exist when we boomers were in our teens.  In fact, I’d argue that the first actual YA book wasn’t published until 1967. I’m thinking specifically of The Outsiders by the then-teenage S.E. Hinton. Many of us devoured this novel, though our parents and teachers disapproved of it. The characters smoked cigarettes (Eeek! Smoking teens!) and participated in gang wars (Eeek! Fighting teens!). At the time, I had a slight awareness that there was something different about this book; my friends and I knew that someone our age had penned those pages for people our age. It was unlike anything we had taken off the library shelves before.That didn’t mean that we ever lacked reading material. There was plenty of fiction perfectly suitable for kids age 12 to 18. Some of these novels had been written with young people in mind (Treasure Island, for one). Many featured adolescent main characters. Most, however, had been intended for adult readers. Yet they resonated with younger audiences. As my friend Erin Martineau said the other day on my crowd-sourcing Facebook post, “I read Catcher in the Rye when I was nine or 10, and then every year after.”  So, for my list of the 10 books that shaped the boomer generation growing up, let’s begin there.The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger In brief: Holden Caulfield has a couple of bad days. Suspended from his posh Pennsylvania prep school, this adolescent walking-puddle-of-angst sloshes around New York City and spends some time in a seedy hotel until he can go home (so his parents won’t be immediately aware of his school troubles). He sees a few old friends, meets people who take advantage of him, tries to pay a prostitute to just talk to him (for which he gets punched in the stomach by her pimp), and, among other misadventures, brings his younger sister for a ride on the carousel in Central Park where he has a revelation about the meaning of life.Adolescent attraction: Ask any 16 year old, life is meaningless — at least sometimes. And Holden talks, and talks, and talks, and seemed to get inside our heads.Lasting lesson: Holden Caulfield verified our hopes that other teens were as messed up as we felt on bad days; in fact, some had it worse. But our thoughts and feelings were important, even if adults dismissed us, so said Salinger.Little Women by Louisa May Alcott In brief: Four sisters living in mid-19th century Massachusetts encounter life’s problems and life’s joys. Thus, they pass over the divide from being “little” (almost) women to true womanhood.Adolescent attraction: Well, there are the love stories, which all work out well, and the sentimental but moving death scene involving the lovely Beth. For some reason, teenage boys also get caught up in this book — maybe because there are a few “little men” whose story lines entwine with those of the March girls.Lasting lesson: Follow your heart. Even Amy, the youngest and most self-absorbed sister, ends up rejecting a wealthy suitor in favor of the man she loves.Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank In brief: While hiding in Amsterdam from the Nazis and living in close quarters with another family, Anne records her day-to-day experiences along with her thoughts and musings about life. Remarkably, Anne is genuinely optimistic about life and people. (Her father edited out some of the darker portions for the original publication. This material was restored in 1995.)Adolescent attraction: I imagine no teen picks up this book without knowing that Anne’s family was betrayed and shipped to a Nazi death camp, where she died just a few weeks before liberation. And yet the girl writing the diary seems so normal, so likeable. Even Justin Bieber, in one of the most cringe-worthy comments ever made by a narcissistic teen idol, expressed his wish that they could have been “friends.” Lasting lesson: People can live through a lot of stuff. Writing helps.To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee In brief: Six-year-old Scout Finch recounts how her father, the widower-lawyer Atticus Finch, defends an African- American man who has been accused of rape. Atticus’ inner nobility garners him the respect of the black community, but his two children still suffer at the hands of bigoted whites.Adolescent attraction: Just about everything in this book works against its being a stalwart of teen bookshelves. The narrator is six years old at the beginning (nine at the end), but she talks like an adult. The hero is her middle-aged father. The mystery involves an aging reclusive neighbor. And yet, this beloved novel is perfect for teens. Maybe it’s the vividness of the writing and the tension of the plot — along with a certain sophistication and a story accessible to teens — that account for its continuing popularity. It has never been out of print.Lasting lesson: From Atticus we learn (as do his children) that we must do what is right. From Scout and her brother we learn that adults can be cruel (like Bob Ewell) but also immensely kind (like Boo Radley).Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen In brief: Elizabeth and her older sister, Jane, find love and happiness in early 19th -century England.Adolescent attraction: The scene where Darcy and Elizabeth accidently meet at Pemberley (Darcy’s manor house) is probably the most romantic piece of writing ever. The humorous side-plots, ridiculous characters and witty ripostes are easily understood and appreciated by teens.Lasting lesson: Each time I read this novel (and I must have read it 15 times — and I’ve seen every movie and TV version as well), I am struck by how much time and emotional energy people waste by not being forthright in the first place. I am also reminded that scoundrels can con you, foolish people are everywhere, but good-hearted souls will stand by you in trying times.Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck In brief: Two migrant workers bear the emotional and economic brunt of the Depression as they look for work and try to pursue their dream of owning their own farm.Adolescent attraction: The vivid characterizations of the intellectually-challenged Lennie and the practical George make them people teens would want to talk to and wish to help. Curley’s wife’s provocative sensuality lends a sexual tension, which fascinates teens.Lasting lesson: Steinbeck thrillingly includes the reader in on the secret of the power of friendship. He enables the teenage reader to feel smart that he or she “gets” what George feels and why he does what he does.Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury In brief: In a dystopian future, books have been banned. Instead of putting out fires, “firemen” torch anything in print, and at the beginning of the book, an old woman who wouldn’t leave her burning home. Fireman Guy Montag steals a book from the old lady’s house. It turns out that he has actually been pilfering books for a while, hiding them in his air-conditioning duct. Finally betrayed by his wife and her friends, Montag is made to burn his own home, but also kills the fire chief. He escapes and finds a community of people who memorize books because they have faith there will come a time when people are eager for true knowledge and beauty.Adolescent attraction: Teens love dystopian fiction, and the one teenage character, an intellectual rebel, helps Montag question the policy of book burning. The story is scary and believable.Lasting lesson: In the end, there will be goodness and truth (which is actually the lesson of all Bradbury’s science fiction).The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald In brief: Nick Carraway moves into a small home next to the lavish estate belonging to Jay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire. In Nick’s social circle are his wealthy cousin, Daisy, and her husband, Tom, who is having an extra-marital affair with a woman named Myrtle. Nick eventually meets Gatsby, discovers the millionaire is in love with Daisy and orchestrates a meeting between the two. Tom grows jealous, and Daisy ends up killing her husband’s mistress in an auto accident. Gatsby takes the blame and is shot and killed by Myrtle’s husband. Nothing seems to touch Daisy and Tom. Disgusted by the empty lives of the rich, Nick decides to move home to the Midwest.Adolescent attraction: There is love. There is betrayal. There is an amazing story. There is someone who discovers that so much around him is a bunch of bullroar, something teenagers know instinctively.Lasting lesson: A powerful novel never leaves you.The Lord of the Flies by William Golding In brief: A group of British boys survive a plane crash on a remote Pacific Island. At first, three boys — Ralph, Jack and Simon — form a kind of ruling troika that helps preserve order. But things quickly break down, and the savage children turn on each other.Adolescent attraction: It’s a horrible adventure, but it’s still an adventure. Teens who finish the book inevitably ask themselves which camp they would have joined and whether they would have discarded their humanity to survive.Lasting lesson: How easily humans can discard the trappings of civilization!Animal Farm by George Orwell In brief: The animals on a farm revolt and drive off the irresponsible farmer. At first they are guided by “the seven principles of animalism,” and everyone is happy. After a while, though, one of the leader pigs (named Napoleon) takes over and changes the rules: All animals are equal, but now some are more equal than others. As the years go by, the pigs begin to walk upright, carry whips and in all respects resemble humans, their former oppressors.Adolescent attraction: Welcome to dystopia, again, one of the literary domains beloved by teens. Young readers understand Orwell’s allegory and feel intelligent, which they should.Lasting lesson: Things aren’t fair. Those in charge will perpetuate the imbalance. Don’t you forget it!  I know that I have left out some major players here: the Nancy Drew books, the Hardy Boys mysteries, Gone with the Wind. The list goes on and on. Let us know your picks in the comments below.Read more from Next Avenue: How science can cure age-related diseases Do you have diabetes and don't know it?

22,BUSINESS,Amazon Signs Lease For Possible Store In Manhattan,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-store-nyc_n_6204584.html,,2014-11-22,"The logo of US online retail giant Amazon is displayed on the Brieselang logistics center, west of Berlin on November 11, 2014. The center is one of nine in Germany. AFP PHOTO / JOHN MACDOUGALL (Photo credit should read JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb316d22200005700dbc7d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Soon, going to Amazon may mean more than just typing in a URL. The online retail giant has signed a lease for a massive space in midtown Manhattan that some speculate could become its first brick-and-mortar store. Located in the heart of the Herald Square shopping district, the space occupies about 470,000 square feet in 7 W. 34 St., a small office tower. Vornado Realty Trust, which owns the building, said in a press release Thursday that the lease will last 17 years.“We have leased this building primarily as corporate office space and we intend to sublease to other tenants the ground floor retail space,” Kelly Cheeseman, an Amazon spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement to The Huffington Post on Saturday.Cheeseman did not respond to repeated questions about whether a portion of the space will be used as a storefront. No plans for an experimental brick-and-mortar Amazon store have been announced, but an anonymously sourced report in The Wall Street Journal last month claimed that the space would house the company’s first physical store. According to the report, the space would function as a warehouse, with a limited stock for same-day deliveries within New York City, pickup, and exchanges and returns on products.Wendy Kopsick, a spokeswoman for Vornado, directed questions to Amazon. This past Friday, Amazon workers drove around New York in a refitted food truck, selling tablets, e-readers and Fire TV sticks to customers on the street -- which, if nothing else, suggests the company is willing to experiment with the distribution side of things.Opening a physical store would come with certain risks. It costs money to lease and manage a space, and to hire staff for a new operation. Despite founder and CEO Jeff Bezos’s seemingly ceaseless quest to explore new ventures -- one reason why the 20-year-old online bookseller now produces tablets and streams TV shows -- the physical retail market has eluded him. In many states, Amazon customers avoid paying a sales tax on purchases because the company does not have a physical outpost within those states' borders. (New York, however, does levy a tax on Amazon buys.)Still, e-commerce makes up only 6.5 percent of the $4.73 trillion retail market, according to the research firm eMarketer. And amid calls by investors to focus on profitability, that other 93.5 percent may look appetizing to Amazon.  "
23,POLITICS,Zephyr Teachout Keeps Preaching 'We Can Actually Do Something' About Corruption,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zephyr-teachout-corruption_n_6199984.html,,2014-11-22,"NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 09: Zephyr Teachout, a democratic primary challenger to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, greets voters outside a voting station at Public School 153 on September 9, 2014 in New York City. Teachout has gained unexpected traction in the primary season, campaigning on ending corruption in the state capital of Albany. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ddec1f00000002257712.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Earlier this year, Fordham law professor Zephyr Teachout emerged as a political star among progressives when she challenged New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary and performed far better than expected. Teachout received 35 percent of the primary vote and won over 20 counties despite raising little money. She ran on a strongly populist platform that emphasized the anti-corruption and anti-monopoly principles she hopes to bring to the fore of American politics.In that vein, Teachout also published a book this year titled Corruption in America: From Benjamin Franklin's Snuff Box to Citizens United, which traces the legal history of corruption. The book was intended, she said, to be a long letter to the Supreme Court's conservative majority showing how wrong they have been in major campaign finance cases.The Huffington Post sat down with Teachout after she gave a talk at the Washington office of the New America Foundation on Nov. 17 to discuss her campaign, her book, the principles that she discussed in both and what she plans to do next. (Teachout and this reporter worked together briefly at the pro-transparency nonprofit Sunlight Foundation from 2006 through early 2007.) The interview has been edited for clarity.In the past year, you challenged a sitting governor in a primary election who was embroiled in a scandal over shutting down his own anti-corruption panel. How did this run for office come about?I’ve been involved in politics for a long time. I was director of online organizing for Howard Dean’s [2003-2004 presidential] campaign. I’ve worked on a lot of hyper-local campaigns as well and worked on banking reform, other forms of organizing. So I was approached in March to see if I would consider running against Andrew Cuomo, and I said I would -- actually I said no immediately, no because I need to get tenure. And then about two hours later, I called back the person and said I really want to talk more about this, and I came into a meeting with the folks who were talking to me about it and spent about a month deciding to run. Because of New York’s system you can actually run on more than one party line, and I was initially recruited to run on a blend of the Working Families Party line and the Democratic Party line. I’m a Democrat. It was Working Families Party who approached me, but I was always planning to run on the Democratic Party line. So it was an interesting month. In your run, you had to get involved with the dirty part of politics -- raising money -- and Cuomo raised a lot --Yes, he did.-- raised a lot of money from hedge fund executives, a lot of Republican donors. How did you view the fundraising that you had to do?First of all, it was my job. If I was going to run for governor, to win -- and again I knew the odds -- I needed to raise as much money as possible. I had a wonderful finance director. We used some consultants who gave us advice on how to raise money. And I’ll admit at first I was pretty bad. [Laughs] I wasn’t good at the ask. I would make every excuse to avoid call time. What our consultants told us is that I should spend 40 hours a week in the first month fundraising. You’re supposed to make 30 dials an hour, which still to me seems unlikely. Of the hits you get, you’re supposed to get 25 percent of the number to give. And you start with friends and family. It was very awkward for me because the reason I wanted to run for governor had nothing to do with the sort of longstanding personal connections -- there was a sort of disconnect. It felt strange to call people to start talking about antitrust and schools and fracking, inequality. Honestly, a lot of early fundraising is based on people who believe in you, and that’s a hard ask. It’s much easier for me to ask people for money based on what I believe in than to ask them to back you as a person. We got better at it. The people who I called were much more comfortable with the interaction than I was. [Laughs] It was kind of a great surprise. I think our biggest donors were in the $4,000 to $20,000 range. In New York state, you can raise as much as $60,000 from an individual or $120,000 from a couple. You have to understand that I was up against Andrew Cuomo, who was getting $120,000 from a couple [who] then bundle $1 million from a couple of people. And I hated it, but it was my job. ... But I would often think this is not as bad a job as making $22,000 a year working at a crosswalk. And I would use that to motivate me. As terrible as this was, it was just part of what I got to do and it enabled me to do something I really cared about.Did you learn anything about what politicians have to put themselves through to raise that money?In some ways it’s not the individual call that is humiliating. Every call has its own virtues, especially if you’re talking to people you like, but there’s something almost hazing-like about it -- like a perpetual hazing of elected officials or candidates for office, who are constantly put in this situation of begging for $500 or $2,000 from a set of people whose decision whether to give $500 or $2,000 is gonna make a big difference in your campaign. And it’s this perpetual situation of begging and begging and being a sycophant in a lot of ways that I think has absolutely affected our politics in the last 30 years.Actually, I think the public feels it. There’s a lot of analysis of why people aren’t voting. Well, I think one of the reasons is it’s hard to vote for somebody who feels like they are, you know, in a fundamentally subservient position to the wealthiest Americans as opposed to a fundamentally leadership position. It’s not just about the message. It’s that people want to vote for leaders. They don’t want to vote for people who feel like they’re beggars. And the job right now is to be a very, very, very good sycophant.Do you think that attracts a certain type of person to the office?Well, I do think there are some amazing people who go into public life. Look, I’m not gonna criticize all politicians because I am one of them. Good luck with getting me to slam everybody! [Laughs] I think the bigger tragedy is the number of people who are turned off by it. I am a huge supporter of public financing, and I thought all the time about how different my job would be if we had public financing of campaigns in New York. First of all, I love talking to crowds. That’s also hard. It’s also work. It takes work to do the policy research, it takes work to learn about the town, it takes work to speak well. But if we had public financing of elections, I would have spent all of my time talking and listening to people because I would know that every $50 I raised would be matched by the state by $300 -- instead of spending so much of my time just making lists of people who make over $100,000 a year, in a lot of cases over $200,000 a year. It would have been hard, and I think in a way it would have served the public a lot more.You sort of got your start in 2003 doing Internet politics with Howard Dean. How does Internet politics translate to this more retail politics, and what did you bring from that experience to this campaign?I was the director of online organizing for Gov. Dean, which meant in practice a lot of human interaction because what we were doing was using this tool called Meetup to enable local groups to come together and build their own power and strategy. And my focus was really on the non-strategic states outside of Iowa and New Hampshire. So, actually, I hired some of the first programmers on any presidential campaign. We built tools to basically -- an early version of MySpace or what we now think of as Facebook perhaps. We built a social media network for our supporters. We built call systems so that people could call from afar. Now these are standard in campaigns. When there was about five months out, I felt like my basic job with tool building was done. So I went out on the road and visited 25, no, maybe 27 states in a 10-week road trip and went from group to group in the states -- not the key states that were Iowa and New Hampshire -- giving speeches about the campaign and then talking to the organizers. That was unbelievably valuable to actually have the face-to-face meetings and then to have the practice of giving speeches. I’m a huge fan of Emerson and the old tradition of giving talks as a way to connect. It’s something I always wanted to be good at. I actually at one point wanted to be a minister. I applied to divinity school and law school, and I got into a better law school so I went to law school. [Laughs] This is certainly engaging something that I’ve always wanted to do, and I got some training in 2003. But the key lesson that I learned in Howard Dean’s campaign was not about technology, but it was about power. Because we had three months to run this campaign against Andrew Cuomo, we could not build any tools and we did not have any money to buy the best tools. So we used Facebook and Twitter. But otherwise we had a very similar model -- we empowered local groups to do their own organizing, and that made a huge difference because we had a tiny staff until we raised money. I went to Poughkeepsie in June, and there were five reporters there because the local group had organized an event. We said we’d come if they organized an event. They called all the local papers, and we had an event and got in the local paper. Actually I went to over half the counties in the state, and a lot of the places where we did well were places where we got a lot of hyperlocal media coverage. And we got that local media coverage because we empowered local supporters. I won in the north country, where I never went, but I had this guy who we called the north country press secretary who was always getting me on the radio in the north country and with hyperlocal papers. And we just gave him the power to do that.You write a lot about corruption, a particular type of corruption, a conception of corruption. It seems like in your run against Cuomo, you were sort of running against an archetype of this --Yes!-- sort of the corruption you’ve been writing about.I felt like I was living my book so often, because one of the things the founders cared so much about was the corrupting force of centralized power. New York state has the most powerful governor, and the governor’s office repeatedly was corrupting local lawmakers and shutting them up from talking about real issues because he holds the power of the purse. I felt like I was living my founders’ fear of monarchy.I was sort of wondering, just looking at Cuomo -- a Democrat, a member of the traditional, historical party of labor and working people -- whether the policies that he is pursuing and adopting are representative of a larger shift in politics or society?Yeah, I wish he was not representative. He is kind of an outlier in how right wing he is as a Democrat in a deeply Democratic state. New York is 60 percent Democratic, 30 percent Republican, you know, and has an extraordinary Democratic tradition. And Andrew Cuomo is a Wall Street politician. He works for Wall Street. He works for hedge funds. The more involved they got, the more he became a spokesperson for charter schools, at the same time he was radically cutting public school funding and class sizes were increasing. You may not know this, but New York state is both the most unequal state in the country and has the most segregated schools. And Andrew Cuomo’s tenure -- cutting schools and creating more tax loopholes for the big banks and wealthiest New Yorkers -- was not helping in either of those trends -- in fact, hurting. What I do see is that there is a fight within the Democratic Party. There’s a fight for the soul of our country with big money, and that’s very serious. I think the house is on fire in terms of our democracy. We are very close to having nonrepresentative democracy in government because of how much candidates and elected officials work for their donors as opposed to the public. And then there is a fight within the Democratic Party which mirrors that, which is that some Democrats are becoming so corporate that they aren’t representing the middle class at all. I think Andrew Cuomo is like that. The trend is towards Democrats who are working for a new class of donors, who are big banks and concentrated power and who have a deep libertarian streak, who have a trickle-down economic theory. Andrew Cuomo’s economic theory is indistinguishable from [President Ronald] Reagan’s: trickle-down. And I don’t think it’s because Andrew Cuomo has that belief in a deep way. I think it’s because that’s where his donors are. A good friend of mine who I work with, [Harvard law professor] Larry Lessig, is sort of focusing on corruption in both parties, and I respect that and I would be thrilled to see more Republicans come out as populists as well. But, as a Democrat, I think that if we don't actually stand up for the FDR Democratic Party and the party that really cares about the middle class, then nobody is.Do you have any kind of conception or historical analysis about how we got here? When did this turn? When did politics so heavily begin to tilt toward the rich?There’s a few different moves. One is 1976 when the [Supreme] Court in Buckley v. Valeo strikes down spending limits. After the Watergate crisis, I think the country realized we were moving towards too much big money, and with great popular support [Congress] passed laws that limit campaign spending, which they have in most other countries. That got struck down by the court. And so, if spending increases, so does fundraising, and if fundraising increases, so does obligations to the donors.Also, you see that labor money formed a significant part of the Democratic Party funding base from, really, the 1936 election through the '70s. Though labor still tends to contribute to the Democrats as opposed to Republicans, the percentages of overall funding is much smaller such that, fundamentally, they don’t play the same bulwark role. They were really, really important in being a source of funding that’s basically small-dollar funding, because labor funding is based on dues, which is based on working-class Americans providing those dues. After 1896, most political money came from outside politics instead of inside politics. Before 1896, you have some business money, but you see more political money come from basically the spoils system, basically the people who were working in politics contributing to the party’s campaigns. After 1896. you have a private funding system in this country that has never been truly stable and has never provided a long-term meaningful way to be a political party that works for the working class. The closest we got was from the '30s to the '70s, when there was enough labor funding to basically allow Democrats to be more populist and care about inequality. After the '70s, you see this increasing of big money, and then it really gets exaggerated at a few points, like after [the Supreme Court's decision in] Citizens United. We’ve got to get rid of this private funding system because private funding inevitably leads to the corruption of politics. Right now, we don’t have a system of funding that allows you to be a populist Democrat and run for office, even if your ideas are wildly popular. We don’t have that system, we haven’t built it. In New York City, they’ve built it because they have a public funding system. In Maine, they built it. In Connecticut, they built it because they have public funding systems. But in a federal elections system, we don’t have that.We need to build a sustainable system for populists because Americans still want their public schools and they still want equality and they still want an economy that works for entrepreneurs, but that’s not where the big money is.In your campaign and in your talks about the book, you talk a lot about antitrust, mergers, acquisitions, trustbusting. I’m sure to a lot of people these seem like really old concepts, like why are we talking about this in the 21st century? I was wondering if you could explain why these are things that are so important to pay attention to.Thomas Jefferson wanted an anti-monopoly clause in the Constitution, and for most of American history, people have understood that you cannot have a truly responsive democratic power and radically concentrated industry. That if you have monopolies, whether it’s Comcast/Time Warner or what’s happening with the big banks, that they will take over government in so many ways. They will fund campaigns. They will become too big to fail. They will directly influence their employees. They will start having a feudal relationship with other industries, like the way Amazon in some ways owns part of the publishing industry and therefore owns our access to ideas in some way. A premise of democratic self-government is decentralized economic power. It’s also a premise of innovation. You see a lot more innovation when you have decentralized economic power. In 1981, Reagan basically killed antitrust law, and most Democrats went along with him redefining antitrust as something that’s just about efficiency. ... So, for 34 years now, we have had a critical American concept that has been taken out of American political life, and it’s amazing if you take a word out, if you take out a concept, it’s hard to organize around. Right now you say people don’t even know what I’m talking about when I say antitrust, honestly, or monopoly. But they know what I’m talking about when I talk about Comcast/Time Warner or what’s happened at the big banks, and I think we should revive this old Jeffersonian concept of trustbusting because we need to save our democracy. Because we have far too concentrated powers leading to less innovation, less power, less entrepreneurship and, most importantly, those monopolists are taking over our government. I don’t have any fantasy about the founders being perfect. They’re deeply imperfect, to put it mildly. They got race and sex wrong, and tragically and terribly wrong. But I do think at this moment in genuine crisis, it’s valuable to call back on some of the best ideas in American history -- one is the anti-corruption idea and the other is the anti-monopoly idea -- as deeply American ideas and revive them. I just think there’s a sleeping giant out there on anti-monopoly laws. I will tell you that if you get in a room, people believe that too much power is held by too few. It’s why they’re dropping out of politics. It’s why they’re despairing about their jobs. It’s why they don’t feel like the gifts that they bring to political or economic society are even being heard, because there’s basically a few very powerful forces.There are lots of excuses bandied about, reasons why the Democrats didn’t do very well in the 2014 elections or did worse than maybe expected, including that they didn’t run on anything. One thing that I noticed is that they did a lot of running against billionaires, wealthy corporate interests, but it sort of seemed disconnected from any potential policy response.Right, so you have to explain we can stop Comcast/Time Warner and see candidates out there saying I am going to try and stop Comcast/Time Warner, not just bad billionaires. Or we can break up the big banks. So candidates explicitly saying not only is JPMorgan a problem in campaign funding, but let’s actually talk about breaking it up. And, yeah, that’s real exciting leadership.A lot of the problem with campaign spending stems from the Supreme Court redefining corruption as strictly quid pro quo bribery.Some of it does but, to be clear, a lot of it doesn’t. The Supreme Court is responsible that we do not have spending limits, that we have fewer contribution limits and that corporations can get involved in campaigns. The Supreme Court is not responsible for the fact that we’ve never passed a public financing system. In fact, it’s perfectly constitutional to have the New York City-Maine-Connecticut system.There was that hearing in Washington where they condemned Citizens United recently. What exactly happened? It was Democrats holding a hearing against Citizens United.For the constitutional amendment [to overturn Citizens United].I’m fully in favor of a constitutional amendment. That would be great. But it’s too easy by half because you can sit there and say I want to overturn Citizens United, knowing full well it’s not going to happen. What we need is to take real responsibility. Don’t let your representatives just say that they’re opposed to Citizens United. You have to actively support public financing of elections. And don’t let them get away with just the opposition because our elected officials have to take at least half, if not more than, the responsibility. It should be toxic to support private funding. There’s no good theory that explains why private funding would lead to democracy. Like that doesn’t actually make any sense. It should be toxic to defend that.The Supreme Court’s notion of corruption, which you write pretty explicitly about -- it seems that the definition is not as narrow as they claim it to be over history.Yeah, the Supreme Court is totally out of touch. This 2014 case [McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission] is sort of amazing. Corruption is defined by a reference to a criminal bribery statute. If it’s not criminalized in a criminal bribery statute, it’s not corruption. Ask anybody else in history what corruption means, and they will say it’s not defined by a criminal bribery statute. It is this harder, vaguer, really important idea that private interests are taking over our public channels.Could you delve more into how the definition of corruption has shifted over time? How we got to this really narrow view?During the founding era, they talked about corruption all the time and their understanding of corruption was broad. It encompassed all those situations in which public officials use their public power for selfish ends, private ends -- whether it’s their own or maybe their sponsors' or maybe their donors' or maybe the king’s. But that was a broad understanding. And arguably, the Constitution was written as a kind of anti-corruption protection document. A document to protect against England and elsewhere. Then really until the 1970s, courts understood corruption in a broad way. You see references to Montesquieu sort of scattered throughout criminal and contract law cases dealing with corruption. Then starting in the 1970s and then accelerating in the last decade, corruption has come to mean only this criminal quid pro quo definition. The reason why that has mattered is because the Supreme Court will strike down any law that involves political spending unless it serves an anti-corruption end. So this is Citizens United -- they basically said limiting corporate spending does not serve an anti-corruption interest. Everybody knows this is crazy except the Supreme Court. [My] book is a long documentary letter proving that that not only doesn't make sense now, but that is an aggressive misunderstanding of over 200 years of history.How would you personally define corruption? At least in America.How would you define equality? How would you define love? Or even separation of powers? Or liberty? All of these, you understand that these are meaningful concepts, but you don’t try to make them a single sentence definition where you can answer it and put it in a statute. And corruption is more like those words than not like them.Broadly speaking then, I understand corruption in America to be when those with public power use it for private ends. But I think, like equality or with federalism, it’s a longer conversation.Do you think that American politics are corrupt?Yes! Clearly! Yes! I mean right now you see a blend of things with the revolving door and congressmembers going to become lobbyists. You see, pretty straightforward, people using public office for private ends, using Congress as a steppingstone to becoming a lobbyist. But then more broadly, the deep corruption comes from private powers. It’s Dan Loeb in New York spending $1 million to serve his own interests in the New York Senate elections. He’s a hedge fund guy. Or the Koch brothers. Or highly self-interested private parties using our public powers for their own selfish ends. And that’s the deepest corruption that I see right now.Do you think that this entrance into the public sphere by these wealthy private actors goes beyond just campaign funding? You have Bill Gates and the Waltons and you mentioned Dan Loeb and lots of other hedge fund billionaires in New York who fund, you know, charter school advocacy groups. How do you view this sort of new version of philanthropy that seems to overlap into political advocacy?Yeah, it’s a really great and complicated question because I’m not opposed to all philanthropy. Part of the reason that I’m such a trustbuster is that [Justice Louis] Brandeis said that you can have concentrated wealth or you can have a democracy, but you can’t have both. As a structural matter, we have given permission for this radically concentrated wealth that’s then used in a whole variety of ways. Some of which might be truly benevolent. A lot of which is questionable, like the advocacy groups that you’re talking about. So you’d have to give me a particular instance, but if we’re going to look at the system that allows it, you see this growing rise of quasi-feudal powers within what should be a capitalist democratic system.Are there any people out there sort of embodying this spirit? In the Progressive era, Lincoln Steffens, the journalist, was touring state capitals trying to uncover corruption and then started hearing about this guy Bob La Follette in Wisconsin. They kept saying, oh, he’s actually not corrupt and really believes in what he’s doing, and Steffens didn’t believe it until he went there. Are there people like that out there or on the horizon?I’m extremely excited about [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren. About [Sen.] Sherrod Brown -- every time I hear Sherrod Brown speak, I just want to hear him talk more. Warren, [Sen. Jeff] Merkley, Brown, [Sen. Al] Franken -- I’m missing some. Individually they’re very powerful, but as a club they’re even more powerful so that we have this potential truly trustbusting populist coalition in the Senate. I think it’s really important to give that shape and name and not just make it about personal politics. And all of those are senators that I’m extremely excited about.I think part of our job is to give permission to people to tell the truth about what they see. The value of trustbusting and Warren’s leadership, among other things, is to say you can talk this way. You’re not alone.What’s next for you in politics?Well, I’d love to run for office again. It’d sure be a lot easier if there was a public financing system. [Laughs] If you’re going to take on big cable and big banks and a big governor, it would certainly be helpful to have public financing because I know I can raise the money in small-dollar contributions. But I certainly hope to run for office again. I don’t know particularly what. In the meantime I’m probably back teaching and figuring out my next research project. And I’ll certainly be focused on these monopolistic powers and the existing laws that limit what we can do about these new giants and proposing new laws that can actually break them up. I think a lot of people know they’re giants but they feel totally powerless, so I feel like what I can contribute is to be able to say, no, we can do this. We can actually do something about it. And then I’ll be very involved in New York politics. We’ve got a [legislative] session where we have to protect our public schools, and the hedge fund money that came in during this state Senate election in New York was really anti-public school money. So I’m very, very concerned about what’s going to happen. Institutionally, I work with Every Voice [Action] and Mayday, both of which are groups that work on public financing of elections. But I would love to be a part of getting 30 people to run for office next year. If I can convince some people who think they aren’t candidates, they don’t fit the profile. You know, Andrew Cuomo sued me trying to get me off the ballot because I’ve been in the state for under five years, but I think deeper down it was because I didn’t own land. [Laughs] Because I didn’t have a lease for five years. You know, I’m just a renter. Well, we need more people who are renters running, who don’t fit the traditional profile, whose lives haven’t been defined around a kind of superficial ambition. So if I could be part of encouraging 30 new people to run for things on this platform, I’d be thrilled."

A European source said the chance of a final deal by Monday was ""very small.""The negotiations in Vienna between Tehran and six world powers - the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China - are intended to remove at least one source of potential conflict from the Middle East and its growing turmoil.Diplomats said a framework accord was still possible, but that weeks or months would then be needed to agree on the all-important details of how it would be implemented.They said continuing the negotiations - which have dragged on for more than a year, accompanied by a partial easing of sanctions - was preferable to letting them collapse and risking renewed tension. However, some said an extension could push the talks into a never-ending cycle of rollovers with few prospects of a final deal.Despite the differences, a senior U.S. State Department official said: ""We are continuing to take steps forward.""""The focus of discussions remains on an agreement, but we are discussing both internally and with our partners a range of options for the best path forward,"" the official added, without elaborating on whether these included a possible extension.The European source said there had been ""no significant"" progress on the main stumbling blocks - Iran's uranium enrichment capacity and the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear program.""The chances of reaching a deal in the next 48 hours are very small,"" the source said. ""Our feeling is that they (Iran's negotiators) don't have a lot of flexibility.""On Friday, diplomatic sources had said Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif were discussing new ideas to unblock the negotiations. KERRY BRIEFS ALLIESKerry, Zarif and European Union envoy Catherine Ashton met again on Saturday.""We hope we're making careful progress,"" Kerry said before a meeting with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. ""But we have big gaps. We still have some serious gaps, which we're working to close.""Diplomats said the foreign ministers of France, Russia and China might join the talks on Sunday for what could be a final push to clinch some sort of agreement.Iran rejects Western allegations that it has sought to develop an atom bomb capability, something that Iran's enemy Israel regards as an existential threat, and says the program is purely peaceful.Western officials say Iran is refusing to countenance curbing uranium enrichment, an activity that can have both civilian and military uses.Another stumbling block is sanctions, which Iran wants ended swiftly and not, as the West wants, suspended and then scrapped progressively as Iran fulfills the terms of a final deal.Earlier on Saturday, Kerry held a conference call with the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain, and separate calls with the foreign ministers of Turkey and Canada, a senior U.S. State Department official said.He also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly voiced his skepticism about any rapprochement with Iran. Tehran says it is Israel's unacknowledged nuclear arsenal that threatens regional peace and stability.
