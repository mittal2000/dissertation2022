0,POLITICS,There Are A Lot More Jobs. But That Isn't Helping Democrats For One Key Reason.,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jobs-growth-democrats_us_56d9d87ae4b0000de4047666,People aren't making more money.,2016-03-04,"President Barack Obama has presided over 65 consecutive months of net job growth, but wage growth remains slow.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d9da051500002a000b139f.jpeg?cache=MgAiEgPWt1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the economy created 242,000 jobs in February, it marked 65 consecutive months of net job growth -- the longest such streak in modern history.That, in itself, is undoubtedly good news. The growth has brought the official unemployment rate down to 4.9 percent -- low by historical standards. And labor force participation, which counts the number of people working or actively seeking work, is finally ticking upward. That indicates that people who may have given up on finding a job are starting to return to the workforce.The big question, however, is: Why isn’t the public more upbeat about the economy?Despite the sustained job growth, nearly 64 percent of Americans think the country is on the wrong track, according to HuffPost Pollster’s polling average.And this year’s presidential election has seen a surge of populist outsiders, the likes of which is unprecedented in recent U.S. history.Donald Trump is triumphing over his Republican rivals with a promise to “make America great again.” In addition to the racial and cultural connotations of Trump’s resentment-themed campaign, he is channeling Americans’ frustration over the economy and promising solutions that violate conservative orthodoxy on trade and other matters.On the Democratic side, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been able to mount a serious challenge to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. He has achieved success by implicitly running against President Barack Obama's jobs record, which he says has not been adequate to meaningfully boost the fortunes of ordinary Americans.The political landscape is especially confounding because a strong job market is usually a boon to the party of the incumbent president -- and by extension, the candidate that is most closely associated with him.But Hillary Clinton, who has wrapped herself in Obama’s mantle, has seen her favorability ratings go down in recent months. Polls suggest she would currently beat Trump by a solid margin in a general election matchup, but the projected outcomes are far less rosy if one of the other Republican candidates wins the nomination.One reason that the economy is not yet giving Clinton, or the Democratic party more broadly, the kind of political advantage that might be expected, however, is that wages have yet to grow substantially.In fact, in February, average hourly pay declined 0.1 percent from the previous month. That brings total average wage growth in the past 12 months to 2.2 percent, not enough, economists say, to create a difference people can feel in their lives -- particularly after the effects of inflation.The hours available to the workers who do have jobs also declined in February, by 0.2 hours.That may be because the jobs the economy created in last month are concentrated in precarious, low-paying sectors like retail, hospitality and social assistance.“All of this culminates in a very bad story, a very weak economy,” said Dan Alpert, managing partner of the investment bank Westwood Capital, and author of The Age of Oversupply: Overcoming the Greatest Challenge to the Global Economy. “This is going on in a presidential election year and you have Democrats saying, ‘We’re making jobs.’ And Republicans can say, ‘You’re making jobs, but you’re making crap jobs and wages aren’t rising.’”Josh Bivens, research and policy director of the progressive Economic Policy Institute, is less pessimistic than Alpert about the economy's trajectory. But he argues that people are especially disappointed with the sluggish wage growth, because their expectations have risen after years of consistent job growth.“People are going to be unhappy about the economy until it starts delivering reliable wage increases,” Bivens said. “In 2011 and 2012, we had jobs again, and wages were not up, but people were willing to be patient. Now, seven years into the official recovery, people are justifiably less patient.”Wages generally rise when there is so much demand for workers’ labor that employers must compete to hire them. The fact that they have not gone up, according to both Alpert and Bivens, is a sign that there is still slack in the labor market -- or room for the economy to create even more jobs before it risks overheating and pushing inflation too high.The reason for the slack, Alpert argues, is the persistent deficit in demand for U.S. goods and services left over from the financial crisis of 2008, together with vast global oversupply that has grown independent of the crisis.The relative strength of the dollar has compounded the problem by making U.S. exports less competitive abroad. That’s part of the reason why the higher-paying manufacturing sector lost 16,000 jobs in February.The solution, then, for economists who blame a demand deficit for lackluster wage growth, is fiscal stimulus: using government spending -- or alternately, targeted tax cuts -- to boost consumer demand.It’s what Bivens calls the “same old stuff” Obama used in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, only now the economy needs “a lot less of it.”Alpert notes that interest rates on U.S. debt remain at historic lows making it an opportune time for financing infrastructure spending, which would employ people immediately and benefit the economy in the long term as well.Of course, while fiscal stimulus may be the “same old” technique for jump-starting growth, it is likely to encounter the same old political resistance from Republicans and fiscally conservative Democrats. “Stimulus” itself became a dirty word during the Obama years thanks to relentless Republican opposition.For Keynesian economists, the insufficient size of the original 2009 Obama stimulus package created a Catch-22: on the one hand the sticker price of the bill was enough to shock the public, and on the other it was too little to fill the post-financial crisis gap in demand. As a result, the theory itself lost credibility.“It is all for the good, but for the ideological block in the road,” Alpert said of his proposed expansion of infrastructure spending. “We did it in the 1930s. It worked fine.” The Federal Reserve has a part to play as well -- by doing no harm. When the Fed raises its benchmark interest rate, as it did in December, it effectively puts the brakes on economic growth to head off inflation. In light of the sluggish wage growth numbers, Alpert and Bivens expressed hopes that the Fed would hold off on another rate increase when its decision-making body convenes again on March 15-16.“I don’t see them continuing on the way they said they will,” Alpert concluded. “They made an error in December.” "

Since it was an open primary, Linkins could pick a candidate from among either Republicans or Democrats. He chose Marco Rubio. ""I realized that what I wanted to do on Super Tuesday was cast a vote against fascism,"" Linkins told ""So That Happened,"" the HuffPost politics podcast. (The interview starts in the 56th minute of the podcast.) In other words, despite the fact that Linkins is a liberal, he felt it was more important to throw his support behind someone who could trip up Donald Trump than to pick between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on the Democratic side.Trump, the Republican front-runner, is a professional entertainer who recently said he would like to destroy American democracy by curbing the freedom of the press. ""He essentially has now indicated that he will fight the First Amendment,"" Linkins said. ""My thought was what needed to be done was to try to keep Donald Trump's delegate count down,"" he added. ""And that Marco Rubio probably needed a little bit of help to get over the 20 percent threshold to claim delegates away from Donald Trump.""Rubio wound up 31.9 percent of the vote in Virginia, compared with Trump's 34.7 percent.Linkins wasn't the only crossover voter who supported a Republican candidate in an open primary state, though some voted for Trump because they figure the eventual Democratic nominee will have an easy time beating him. Linkins does not agree with that strategy. ""I personally think you're always taking a chance with a dangerous nominee even if you think you can pick him off,"" he said.""So, That Happened"" is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney.

""I'm not running for president.""The 2012 Republican presidential nominee has emerged as one of Trump's toughest critics, trashing him in a Thursday speech as ""a phony"" and ""a fraud."" In his Friday interview, Romney said he won't vote for Trump even if he becomes the GOP nominee, and in the meantime, he will do ""everything within the normal political bounds to make sure that we don't nominate Donald Trump.""Conversely, if it came down to Trump versus Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Romney said he wouldn't vote for her either. He doesn't think it will come to picking between those two, though.""I intend to vote for our nominee,"" Romney said. ""I expect that nominee to be a real conservative, a real Republican."""
3,POLITICS,Polls Show The Supreme Court Blockade Is Hurting The GOP,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/liberals-see-signs-supreme-court-fight-hurts-the-gop_us_56d974bee4b0ffe6f8e8f0cd,"Voters don't like the move, including in the Judiciary Committee chairman's home state.",2016-03-04,Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley are stopping President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d977d41e0000b3007034d4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Democrats think the GOP blockade of President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee will hurt Republicans at the ballot box -- and liberal polling published Friday suggests it may be a factor.The Democratic-aligned Public Policy Polling's four new surveys for the group Americans United for Change point to four swing states that most observers have ranked as likely to stay in Republican hands: Arizona, Iowa, North Carolina and Missouri.In all of them, the polls find voters do not think their senators should leave the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia vacant for more than a year. Asked if they think it should be filled this year, convincing majorities in all four say it should.According to the PPP:It’s a 56/40 spread in favor of filling the seat in Iowa, 56/41 in Arizona and Missouri, and 55/41 in North Carolina. What’s particularly important in the numbers is the strong support for filling the seat among independents- it’s 60/38 in Missouri, 59/37 in Arizona, 58/38 in Iowa, and 55/38 in North Carolina. Independent voters will be key to determining whether these incumbents sink or swim this fall, and they want the vacancy filled.In all the cases, at least two-thirds of respondents think Republicans are wrong to reject a nominee before the person has even been named.While the PPP works with Democrats, their research is generally in line with non-partisan surveys, such as a recent Quinnipiac University poll in Ohio that found voters don't like the decision of Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) to back the court blockade.Exactly how much such feelings will impact the elections is unclear. A recent HuffPost/YouGov survey found people want the seat filled soon, but that the issue ranked near the bottom in importance to them.Still, the PPP surveys suggest an alarming trend for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the GOP chairman of the Judiciary Committee that is supposed to weigh appointments of judges. While the senators in the other three states already had poor approval ratings, the pollster has found repeatedly that Grassley is the most popular politician in the Hawkeye State, causing the PPP to recently dub his re-election this year a ""cakewalk.""But in this poll, Grassley's generally positive ratings have slipped to just 47 percent positive against 46 percent negative.""Voter anger over their Republican Senators’ unwillingness to consider a replacement for Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court could help make those seats competitive for Democrats this fall,"" PPP director Tom Jensen said.The surveys were automated and list a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points."

""I think CPAC is more conservative for the most part, and more grassroots, so it sends the message that maybe he doesn't feel welcome or he thinks he can get along without us. It divides the party and definitely isn't good for us.""Jenna Suchyta, another attendee, agreed. ""It shows a disrespect for us, the conservative base that's here,"" she said. ""We're the conservative political action committee. We care. We're here to act on our political views and he does not seem to care. He just says, 'Well, I don't need you, and I'm not gonna come talk.' That seems really disrespectful to us.""""I think that's a good thing. I don't actually think he's a real conservative,"" said Zach Bachmann, 21, a student at George Washington University. ""I think it's a good thing for the movement and I'm looking forward to hearing the other candidates get a chance to speak today.""One enthusiastic man decked out in Revolutionary gear yelled at Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-Texas), who was standing nearby, ""We stopped Trump from coming tomorrow!"" Gohmert and the gentleman then bumped fists.In lieu of Trump's appearance at CPAC, which is held just outside of Washington, D.C., at the Gaylord National Harbor Hotel and convention space, his campaign will make stops in Kansas, which is holding its caucus on Saturday, and Florida, which holds its primary on March 15.In its announcement Friday, the Trump campaign noted that Trump himself had attended CPAC for ""many consecutive years,"" and said he ""looks forward to returning next year, hopefully as president of the United States."" The statement also made a reference to ""Witchita, Kanasas [sic and sic],"" Trump's next stop.This year's CPAC, which began Wednesday and will conclude Saturday, has sported a healthy number of Trump supporters, many decked out in the candidate's bright red and immediately recognizable ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN"" regalia. But conversations with attendees suggest that Trump's reception here would have been mixed. Time and again, CPAC attendees, who pay upward of $300 to attend the conference, voiced skepticism about whether Trump really cares about conservative principles.Vanessa, a student at Grove City College in Pennsylvania, said she was supporting Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and that she's highly suspicious of Trump.Cruz is ""the most genuine conservative,"" she said. ""He's been very consistent across the board. I do not want Trump to win the nomination."" ""I don't believe Trump stands for conservative values,"" said Andrew, another GCC student.Indeed, this year's CPAC agenda, which includes keynote address on its main stage as well as smaller breakout sessions, has featured very little programming that could be considered supportive of the GOP front-runner. Right about the time Trump's decision to bow out of CPAC was being reported, Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, was railing against Trump on the conference's main stage, saying that he bases his platform ""off of what is in his best interest at that moment."" Eliot Nelson contributed reporting.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
5,POLITICS,Elizabeth Warren Questions Education Department's Competence Over Student Loan Fraud,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-student-loans_us_56d8a6b9e4b0ffe6f8e89f66,No one has been held accountable for a bungled probe into Navient Corp.,2016-03-04,The blistering letter comes as a key Senate committee prepares to vote on the confirmation of John King Jr. as Education Secretary.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has accused the Education Department of being unable to police its loans contractors and questioned whether it can be trusted to protect the 42 million Americans with federal student loans. The blistering letter to acting Education Secretary John King Jr. Thursday comes as a key Senate committee that Warren sits on prepares to vote on his confirmation for the post, days after the Education Department's inspector general accused his employees of misleading the public over a flawed investigation into student loan giant Navient Corp.The latest controversy at the Education Department concerns former Education Secretary Arne Duncan's 2014 decision to effectively ignore federal prosecutors, who alleged in a lawsuit that May that Navient deliberately cheated tens of thousands of active-duty troops out of millions of dollars, and instead launch his own investigation to determine whether the company had violated its lucrative government contract to collect borrowers' monthly payments.Breaking laws such as the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act -- the basis of the Justice Department's lawsuit -- would constitute a violation of Navient's contract with the Education Department. The law caps interest rates on student loans at 6 percent.At the time, a spokeswoman for Duncan said the probe would help determine whether Navient got to keep its contract. But the department renewed the contract before it completed its investigation. Last year, after the Education Department gave Navient a new contract and a pay increase, it cleared Navient and its other major loan contractors of wrongdoing in what its inspector general described this week as a bogus investigation marred by errors and other anomalies.""To date, the department has done nothing but generate excuses for why it will not act to hold Navient accountable, and has put no serious effort into trying to remedy -- or even identify -- this problem to the extent it occurred,"" Warren said in her letter.The inspector general's report raises ""serious questions"" about whether the department and its Federal Student Aid unit ""can be trusted to protect the millions of borrowers under its care,"" she added.Warren has previously said the Education Department's kid-gloves treatment of its loan contractors put it at risk of becoming a ""lapdog,"" rather than the watchdog that the public expects.The Education Department may soon give Warren another reason to worry: It recently asked its loan contractors to review their files to determine whether any military members were overcharged on their student loans, but the department won't say whether it'll audit or require another party to double-check what its contractors report. Matt Lehrich, a department spokesman, didn't answer detailed questions.Instead, Lehrich said in a prepared statement that the department is ""deeply committed to providing a first-rate experience for all student loan borrowers, especially women and men in uniform."" The department may give refunds to some borrowers as a result of yet another review.""Given the serious and basic flaws here, do you feel that the Office of Federal Student Aid is equipped to do these kind of reviews?"" Warren asked King as part of more than two dozen questions she demanded answers to ahead of King's confirmation vote.She also asked him whether he'll move a key loan contractor oversight unit out of the department's Federal Student Aid office, and Warren demanded copies of all communication regarding the department's investigation between Navient and the student aid office.Other Warren requests could make Education Department officials equally uncomfortable. She asked King to identify key officials who made certain decisions at key points before, during and after the investigations into loan contractors. These included who decided not to punish Navient despite the Justice Department's lawsuit, considering that the Education Department's probe was so troubled that the inspector general determined its findings were basically meaningless.The department's inspector general said the Education Department misled the public when it claimed in a statement that its contractors incorrectly denied active-duty troops their federal right to a cheaper loan ""in less than 1 percent of cases."" The error rate actually was 16 times higher. Warren wants to know who approved the press release, and whether responsible officials remain in their positions.""We need to get to the bottom of how this happened -- and who allowed it to happen -- to ensure that it does not happen again,"" Warren said.The Massachusetts Democrat also asked King whether the Education Department has a policy that excuses a certain number of mistakes by its loan contractors, and what level of abuse would actually warrant punishment.In December 2013, the Education Department admitted that it had declined to levy any fines on Navient's predecessor company, Sallie Mae, despite secret determinations over the previous 10 years that found the firm had harmed borrowers and incorrectly billed taxpayers, among other failures.Regulators at the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Warren's brainchild, reckon that loan servicers' sloppy practices toward military members are a good indication of how they treat all borrowers.With about 1 in 4 student loan borrowers either in default or behind on their payments, some policymakers fear that student debt may hold back a generation of Americans from fully participating in the economy.The fact that nearly all federal student loan borrowers are eligible to make monthly payments based on their earnings has led some senior government officials, such as Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin, to question why the Education Department's loan contractors allow any borrowers to default at all.""If a servicer is unable to provide adequate service to those who have special protections under the law, it raises questions about whether it is agile enough to deal with the complexities of the larger population of borrowers facing hardship,"" said Rohit Chopra, formerly the nation’s student loan watchdog at the consumer bureau, in 2013.Chopra now works at the Education Department. The department refused this week to make him available for an interview."

Ben Carson is out of the race but no one else seems likely to benefit all that much. And a Marco Rubio comeback is looking unlikely. This is HuffPollster for Thursday, March 3, 2016.MORE GOP VOTERS WOULD BE SATISFIED WITH RUBIO OR CRUZ AS NOMINEE THAN TRUMP - Sean Trende: “In a night filled with surprising statistics, three pairs of numbers in particular stood out on Super Tuesday: 56, 56, and 47. These are the percentages, respectively, of voters in Arkansas who said that they would be satisfied if Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump won the Republican nomination....[A] majority of voters in Arkansas were not okay with Trump as the nominee. Yet Trump won the vote there by three percentage points, along with a near-majority of the state’s delegates. We see this in other states. Consider Virginia….Forty-three percent of Republicans said they would be satisfied if Cruz were the nominee, 59 percent said they would be satisfied if Rubio were the nominee, while 44 percent said they would be satisfied with Trump as the nominee….Or look at Texas: 68 percent were satisfied with the prospect of a Cruz nomination, 59 percent with the prospect of a Rubio nomination, and only 43 percent with the prospect of a Trump nomination.” Trump is winning because the party is split - More from Trende: “The fractured Republican field is skewing the results. Tuesday night, Trump won seven contests, Cruz won three, while Rubio won one. Had it been a race between just those three candidates (or perhaps substituting Kasich for Rubio), it probably would have looked much different: Cruz winning four, Trump winning four, and Rubio/Kasich winning three….For example, without Kasich’s 4.2 percent support in Texas, Rubio probably clears the necessary vote threshold to win delegates there (and vice versa). Rubio lost Virginia by three percentage points; if he had won, say, two-thirds of Kasich’s 9.4 percent, he probably wins the state. Rubio probably prevented Kasich from winning Vermont (and vice versa). On the other hand, Carson’s 6 percent may well have kept Cruz from closing the 2 percent gap between himself and Trump in Arkansas, and kept him out of second place in Georgia.” [Real Clear Politics] But polling data shows Ben Carson's supporters are likely to scatter - HuffPollster: ""National polls taken before Super Tuesday show Carson at an average of about 9 percent. If all of Carson's supporters were to now gravitate toward someone else, that could be a considerable bump for whichever candidate picks them up. The problem, though, is that Carson's backers look less like an orderly voting bloc and more like a jumble of a fruit salad, split mainly between Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and businessman Donald Trump. In NBC/SurveyMonkey polls conducted during the past week, 25 percent of voters backing Carson named Rubio as their second choice, with 24 percent picking Cruz, 21 percent going for Trump and another 10 percent choosing Ohio. Gov John Kasich. Recent Morning Consult polling shows a similar divide, with Carson supporters splitting 29 percent for Cruz, 25 percent for Rubio, 19 percent for Trump and 8 percent for Kasich.""

That's all there is to it (and you can unsubscribe anytime).EXIT POLLS SHOW ELECTORATE IS MORE POLARIZED THAN IN 2012 - The Economist: ""One marked difference this year from recent American primary elections is that—when presented with the choice of describing themselves as conservative, moderate or liberal—more Republicans identify as conservative and more Democrats as liberal. This was true for the first four states that voted this year: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina—and for all the states where exit polling was available on Super Tuesday. Primary voters, [it] seems, are becoming more polarised."" [Economist] A RUBIO COMEBACK IS LOOKING UNLIKELY - Andrew Prokop: ""With about 29 percent of delegates already allotted, Rubio is so far behind that it's hard to see how he can win the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot. Indeed, he'd need to win nearly two-thirds of all remaining delegates to pull that off — a highly implausible feat….To put Rubio's challenge even more starkly: He needs 1,237 delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot, but has only 109 or so. And there are only around 1,744 unallotted delegates left. That means that to reach that magic number of 1,237, Rubio needs to win about 64 percent of all remaining delegates in the GOP nomination contest. That's a share that seems absurd based on his tallies to date — he's won just about 15 percent of delegates so far."" [Vox] CHRISTIE SEES FALLOUT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT OF TRUMP - Heather Haddon: ""Gov. Chris Christie’s endorsement of GOP front-runner Donald Trump has hurt his standing among New Jersey voters, according to a new poll. Overall, 30 percent of registered voters approved of Mr. Christie’s handling of state affairs, while 61 percent disapproved, according to a new [Fairleigh Dickinson] University PublicMind poll.

The anger that’s out there is directed at the malfunctioning government in Washington — and this anger is mostly on the Republican side. Americans overall have a dim view of where the country is headed: 36 percent think we’re on the right track, and 60 percent say we’re headed in the wrong direction, in the January Washington Post-ABC News poll.

It added no criminal charges would be brought in the February incident that raised questions about pockets of intolerance at one of the state's biggest universities.University President Michael Young, who has described the incident as heartbreaking and intolerable, called on the university community to renew its respect for inclusion and diversity.""We are launching our students into a world where they will need to work with everyone to be successful in addressing the great societal challenges that we, as a country, face,"" he said in a statement.Initial reports said more than one university student was suspected of making the racially charged comments but the university on Wednesday did not make clear how many students may have been involved.""One of the many students interviewed is no longer associated with Texas A&M University,"" Young said. The university has been investigating reports that at least one student directed racially charged remarks at a group of students from Uplift Hampton Preparatory in Dallas, a charter school with a student body mainly compromised of racial minorities.Last year, 94 percent of its graduating class went to college and nearly every one of those students was the first person in his or her family to go to college, according to the school.African-Americans comprise less than 4 percent of the student body at Texas A&M, university data shows. African-Americans made up 12.5 percent of the Texas population in 2014, U.S. Census data showed.University police interviewed those involved in the incident and has concluded its investigation, police said in a statement.(Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Sandra Maler)"

Paul LePage (R) questioned Thursday the eligibility of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to be president, citing it as a key reason he decided to throw his support behind Donald Trump. LePage told radio host Howie Carr that his two daughters were born in Canada, and they had to be naturalized as U.S. citizens even though he was born in America. ""So I have a question there,"" LePage said.Cruz was also born in Canada, but he maintains that he fits the constitutional requirement that a president be a ""natural born citizen"" because his mother was born in America.LePage said he didn't think Cruz could be president because he believed his daughters were also ineligible.""They can't. I know they can't. I've already looked into it,"" he said. LePage was Chris Christie's most loyal surrogate, frequently appearing with him on the campaign trail. When the New Jersey governor dropped his Republican presidential bid and endorsed Trump, LePage quickly did the same -- even though just a week earlier, he had been plotting an effort to take down the GOP front-runner. LePage said Wednesday that he also didn't think that Cruz, as a first-term senator, had enough experience to occupy the Oval Office. Cruz has been dogged by questions about his eligibility -- driven by statements by Trump -- even though legal scholars largely agree that he is able to be president. This week, a judge in Illinois tossed out on procedural grounds a lawsuit from a Ben Carson supporter challenging Cruz's presidential run."

Just 4 percent view 2016 as a paragon of normalcy.Older Americans, with the added benefit of hindsight and historical context, are even more likely to see 2016 as exceptionally strange. Eighty-four percent of those age 65 and older consider this year's election especially weird, while just 71 percent of millennials say the same.The 2016 election racks up a few more dubious superlatives, according to the poll. Sixty percent consider it more interesting (or maybe ""interesting"") than most elections, and 55 percent believe it's unusually divisive. Republicans, facing the livelier of this year's primary, are more likely than Democrats to agree on both counts.In one aspect, though, this election falls short: Just 19 percent of Americans think it's been more focused on the issues than past contests.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted March 2-3 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is quickly becoming the Washington-backed Republican alternative to Trump, has been particularly vocal, accurately calling Trump University a ""fake school.""But Rubio's attacks on Trump University are at odds with his past support for other alleged fraud factories: Troubled for-profit colleges, many of which also have been accused of duping prospective students into enrolling with false claims, preying on the poor and vulnerable, graduating few and causing financial ruin for many.Unlike dodgy for-profit colleges, at least Trump University didn’t stick taxpayers with the bill.For-profit schools such as Corinthian Colleges Inc., ITT Educational Services, and DeVry Education Group have collectively reaped about $100 billion over the last five academic years from taxpayers in the form of federal student loans and grants, Education Department data show.While government authorities have accused Corinthian, ITT, DeVry and Trump of similar misdeeds -- namely, misleading prospective students -- only Trump’s for-profit venture provoked criticism from Rubio.The for-profit college industry has funnelled at least $59,000 to Rubio and associated political committees for his federal campaigns, according to the Miami Herald. Alex Conant, a Rubio spokesman, didn’t respond to a request for comment.Rubio’s relationship with Corinthian was particularly cozy.The since-shuttered for-profit college chain once had more than 110,000 students spread across more than 120 campuses in North America under the Everest, WyoTech and Heald brands. Various state and federal authorities have sued the company alleging it cheated its former students.In June 2014 -- some eight months after California Attorney General Kamala Harris sued the company, alleging mass fraud -- Rubio asked the U.S. Department of Education to demonstrate “leniency” toward Corinthian after the department delayed the company’s previously quick access to cash from the federal student aid program. The department was probing allegations that Corinthian falsified records about its former students’ success getting jobs in their fields.Three months later, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued Corinthian for allegedly misleading prospective students with bogus claims about former students’ success in the workforce. The career-focused school, the consumer bureau alleged, inflated the percentage of former students who got jobs in their fields.At one of Corinthian’s Georgia campuses, according to the consumer bureau’s lawsuit, employees at Everest College concocted fake employers that the school claimed had hired its students. Everest employees then had their friends falsely verify the employment. A representative for Rubio later said that the lawmaker was simply trying to protect Corinthian students from “having their educations disrupted.” Corinthian filed for bankruptcy last year. Thousands of its former students have since petitioned the Education Department to cancel their loans on account of Corinthian’s alleged frauds.Rubio similarly went to bat for for-profit colleges last year. The senator reportedly was among a group of federal lawmakers urging Education Secretary Arne Duncan to abandon proposed rules that would deny federal student aid to career schools that graduated students with too much debt relative to their eventual earnings.A study last year of federal data by a Treasury Department economist and a former Treasury intern found that 1 in 5 students who left a for-profit college in 2011 -- after having borrowed from the federal government to pay for classes -- were unemployed in 2013.The typical for-profit college student borrower who left school in 2011 and found a job earned less than $21,000 in 2013, according to the study. The typical recent high school graduate makes about $25,000 annually, Education Department data show.For-profit college defenders argue that their schools serve students shunned by traditional public and nonprofit colleges. Their students are typically poorer, they argue, and often the first in their families to attend college. For-profits, the industry’s boosters say, provide opportunity.But offering that opportunity comes at a tremendous cost. For-profit colleges are responsible for an outsized share of defaults in the federal student loan program. Though its student borrowers made up 29 percent of all students who recently entered repayment, they were responsible for 39 percent of all defaults that occurred within the first three years payments were due, Education Department data show.Rubio has largely been silent on those for-profit college issues, despite what many decry as a waste of limited taxpayer resources.He also hasn’t said much about victims in his home state of Florida who attended a for-profit school that used provocatively dressed former strippers to recruit students.Last November, a federal jury convicted Alejandro Amor, the owner of now-defunct FastTrain College, of stealing from the government. The Justice Department alleged that FastTrain enrolled students who couldn’t read, coached some to lie on their applications for federal student aid and routinely falsified records.A federal prosecutor said that FastTrain sold prospective students a “phony dream,” the Miami Herald reported.A search of the Nexis news database reveals no records of Rubio even once discussing FastTrain, which took tens of millions of dollars from taxpayers while leaving its former students on the hook for loans that paid for credentials of questionable value.It’s unclear how much of that money former FastTrain students will be able to repay.But that may not matter to Rubio. If elected president, he wants to “modernize” the college sector by allowing “low-cost, innovative higher education providers” to tap taxpayer cash in the form of federal student loans and grants.If Rubio has his way, it could even allow Trump to resurrect his “university."""

The Justice Department alleged that FastTrain enrolled students who couldn’t read, coached some to lie on their applications for federal student aid and routinely falsified records.A federal prosecutor said that FastTrain sold prospective students a “phony dream,” the Miami Herald reported.A search of the Nexis news database reveals no records of Rubio even once discussing FastTrain, which took tens of millions of dollars from taxpayers while leaving its former students on the hook for loans that paid for credentials of questionable value.It’s unclear how much of that money former FastTrain students will be able to repay.But that may not matter to Rubio. If elected president, he wants to “modernize” the college sector by allowing “low-cost, innovative higher education providers” to tap taxpayer cash in the form of federal student loans and grants.If Rubio has his way, it could even allow Trump to resurrect his “university."""

18,SCIENCE,The Unexpected Reason It's Healthy To Feel Shame,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shame-psychology-evolution_us_56d4428ce4b0871f60ebf5c9,Evolutionary psychologists explain why we sometimes get that sinking feeling of not being good enough.,2016-03-03,Evolutionary psychologists say that shame serves an important social function.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d44de61500002a000b0e59.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Carl Jung, the Swiss founder of analytical psychology, called shame a ""soul-eating emotion.""Following the Jungian model, author and shame expert Dr. Brene Brown has called the emotion the ""swamplands of the soul"" -- something that makes us see ourselves as defective and worthless.People often confuse shame with guilt, but Brown says there's an important distinction between the two: Feelings of guilt revolve around ""I did something bad,"" but shame has more to do with the feeling of ""I am bad.""Shame has been linked to addiction, perfectionism, depression and low self-esteem. Sounds like a pretty unproductive emotion, right? Well, new research suggests this maybe not be entirely true. Shame has evolved to serve the important function of being a social defense, according to a study published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.This adds some nuance to the traditional belief that shame stems from a feeling of being deficient. ""We've been puzzled by these very prominent hypotheses in social psychology that shame really isn't about people's concerns over how others see them,"" Dr. Daniel Sznycer, a psychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the study's lead author, told The Huffington Post. ""It didn't make sense to us that shame would be completely divorced from concerns about the evaluations of others."" Similar to the way pain protects us from things that hurt us physically, shame may protect us from things that threaten our social identity, the research suggests.In other words, ""the function of shame is to prevent us from damaging our social relationships, or to motivate us to repair them,"" Sznycer explained in a statement. It makes us care what others think of us, and helps to us determine the ""social cost"" of a particular behavior or action. There's a clear evolutionary advantage to securing positive relationships and being valued by others. Humans once lived in small, cooperative hunter-gatherer groups, Dr. John Tooby, an anthropologist at the university and a co-author of the study, said in the statement. ""In this world, your life depended on others valuing you enough to give you and your children food, protection and care,"" he said. ""The more you are valued by the individuals with whom you live ... the more weight they will put on your welfare in making decisions. You will be helped more and harmed less."" To conduct the study, researchers created 24 fictional scenarios depicting behaviors or personal traits that could lead to social devaluation, such as physical weakness, stinginess and infidelity.For each scenario, one group of participants was asked to rate how negatively they would view someone else if they performed that action or had that trait. Another group was asked how much shame they would feel if those things were true of themselves. Participants reported devaluing themselves and others at nearly equal levels. Other emotions, like anxiety and sadness, did not have the same similarities in magnitude. Cross-cultural similarities among the 900 participants in the U.S., Israel and India revealed that shame had a similar effect in different social contexts -- reinforcing the notion that it is a universal emotional experience.""We observed precisely what you predict if the function of shame is to guide your choices to factor in the values of those you interact with,"" Sznycer noted in the statement."

He faces one count of larceny and five counts of using another person's identification without consent.Anita Morrison, 86, who found Love-Robinson through an online search, claims he cashed several checks stolen from her home during visits to treat her for “severe” stomach pain.An arrest report said the Doogie Howser-wannabe “criminally used” Morrison’s checking account to make $34,504 in car and credit card payments, per the Sun-Sentinel. Morrison said she was fooled into believing that the young man was a doctor who could help her.“Maybe I wanted to believe because I was in such pain,” the octogenarian told the newspaper last month. “I just went along with it.”This is Love-Robinson’s second brush with the law in less than a month. In mid-February, he was arrested for allegedly operating a fake medical practice in West Palm Beach after an undercover agent reportedly visited the New Birth New Life Medical Center and Urgent Care and was given a physical exam and medical advice by Love-Robinson.Love-Robinson's grandfather, William Robinson, told the Sun-Sentinel at the time that the arrest was the result of a misunderstanding. He claimed his grandson, who officials said referred to himself as “Dr. Love,” was certified to practice holistic medicine by online schools, and that he hadn’t actually been seeing patients himself. Love-Robinson, however, has been accused of masquerading as a doctor before.According to the Palm Beach Post, when Love-Robinson was 17, he was allegedly caught “roaming the halls” dressed as a doctor at St. Mary’s Medical Center in West Palm Beach. Authorities did not believe he saw any patients or performed treatments so he was not charged.After Love-Robinson’s court appearance on Wednesday, his attorney Andrew Stein lauded his client’s “entrepreneurial spirit.” “He has the entrepreneurial spirit of someone like a Donald Trump or Bill Gates,” Stein said, according to WPTV. “I’ve never met somebody, and I'm much older obviously, who has such entrepreneurial spirit… If it was channeled maybe in a different direction, things could be different here today.”It's unclear if Love-Robinson entered a plea on Wednesday; however, he was granted a supervised release and ordered to undergo a mental health assessment within 48 hours, WPTV reported.Last month, Love-Robinson told ABC News that he “currently hold(s) a PhD,” though he refused to specify what field it was in or where he obtained it. On Facebook, he allegedly claimed to have certificates from the American Alternative Medical Association and the American Association of Drugless Physicians."

She also agreed with his decision to skip Thursday's debate.""I think maybe there's a bigger plan in the picture for Dr. Carson. I'm glad he doesn't have to participate in the debate because it's a brawling match and he's the gentleman of the five,"" Steveson said. ""I don't know if he's withdrawing. It's not official if he's withdrawing, and wherever he goes, he has over 1 million people supporting him and I believe we'll all stay with him.""Steveson, who volunteered with Carson in Iowa, said that she was attracted to his honesty, integrity and humility and that she didn't think he'd been treated fairly during the Republican debates.""The debates are entertainment basically, and instead of concentrating on the issues, it's like the media wants them to go at each other. And because he won't participate in that, he's just a sideshow,"" she said.After Carson's almost-withdrawal announcement, Donald Trump began asking for the former neurosurgeon's supporters to back him. Sen. Ted Cruz had similarly urged other Republicans to drop out of the race and unify behind him on Tuesday.Steveson said she could not vote for Trump alone, but would consider the possibility if he named Carson as his running mate.""I just don't believe he is a great example of my evangelical beliefs,"" she said. ""I never thought I would hear myself say, 'I will not vote.' In the last election, I had friends who didn't vote because they want to go with the establishment, and I thought I'd never do it, but I've said it.""As for Cruz, Steveson said she couldn't support him because his campaign sent out a misleading report that Carson was dropping out the night of the Iowa caucuses, which she said hurt Carson in that state.Jonah Wendt, another supporter volunteering at the CPAC booth, had a bit more somber reaction to Carson's announcement.""He only ran because he thought God opened the door for him to run for president, and he said that he would only stop when he felt God was closing the door,"" Wendt said. ""And given that we've had however many states vote and he has not done better than fourth in any state, he has made the determination that God has closed the door on him running for president.""""It's solemn,"" Wendt continued. ""People are like, 'What's gonna happen?' There is this sobering reality because some of the people here are like, 'He's gonna keep running,' and he's really said he's not."""

The moment we'd have seen that trademark Harry smirk and those piercing blue eyes we would have concocted some sort of ""The Prince and Me"" scenario and walked out of the party as fourth in line to the throne. We're still working out the details. This -- among other things -- is what separates us from Margot Robbie, who explained her royal mixup to Jimmy Fallon on ""The Tonight Show."" According to the ""Wolf of Wall Street"" actress, she bumped into Prince Harry at a housewarming party, but didn't recognize him because he ""wasn't wearing a crown.""Instead, Harry opted for some plebeian glasses (stars, maybe they are just like us!), which can be seen in the bottom left of the photo above, leading Robbie to mistake him for Sheeran.
