That fact alone has led to her famously fickle friendships with some bold-faced name and an air of mystery that was somewhat blown after she inspired The Devil Wears Prada. Welcome to the fascinating world of Anna Wintour, the world's most famous magazine editrix. By a lot.The tiny powerhouse with the pageboy bob is currently wrapping up her annual tour of fall Fashion Weeks around the globe, including New York, London and Milan. With all eyes on her, she seemed to play it chic, but safe, sticking largely to many kinds of conservative but colorful sheath dresses with a statement necklace, an occasional cardigan and Prada sandals. She looked flawless hitting shows by Thakoon, Michael Kors, Tom Ford and Altuzarra. Her Prada coat with gold trim, pointy pumps and matching accessories at the Versace show in Milan was dripping with the kind of style perfection only she could attain. While in Italy, she chatted up A-list actress Amy Adams in the front row of the Max Mara show, then sat with Kate Moss at Gucci. Earlier in New York, she sat next to Sarah Jessica Parker, a fashion icon in her own right, at the Calvin Klein 2015 spring collection, wearing an olive green and black striped dress. She also attended Victoria Beckham's show in a white sleeveless dress with a floral pattern, holding her place in a front-row seat next to the designer's ridiculously sexy husband, David Beckham. In London, she hit the Hunter Original show with gal pal Stella McCartney and attended the Burberry show in a maroon lace dress paired with a dark turquoise trench coat. What else would you expect from the woman who said she would never wear head-to-toe black?Wintour has been the editor in chief of Vogue since 1988, and at 64 shows no signs of slowing down. Last year, she was also made creative director of Vogue's parent company, Condé Nast. She has the power to make or break designers -- big and small -- and many a celebrity seeks her out for the coveted approval and friendship for the mercurial fashion world to see.But for the rest of us couture civilians, we'll have to wait for spring to again have our moment with Queen Anna, the kingdom's most stylish monarch.Read more at http://nowitcounts.com"
1,HEALTHY LIVING,The Best Yoga Film of 2014: Get a Sneak Peak Here,"Shannon Sexton, ContributorAward-winning journalist, magazine editor & content strategist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-yogananda-was-before-_b_6006756.html,,2014-10-20,2014-10-18-Yogananda_at_AfroAmerican_Yoga_Center.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-18-Yogananda_at_AfroAmerican_Yoga_Center-thumb.jpg," (photo credit: Self-Realization Fellowship, Los Angeles, California)Yogis, meditators, and spiritual seekers, make a movie date. Awake: The Life of Yogananda, is screening in 35 cities and counting through November. And as yoga documentaries go, this unconventional biopic is gripping, inspiring -- dare I say, epic, even. In fact, Awake has already won three awards and received accolades from the yoga glitterati, including Ram Dass, Marianne Williamson, and Russell Simmons. Co-directed by two yoga-practicing filmmakers (Oscar nominee Paola di Florio and Sundance winner Lisa Leeman), Awake explores the life and teachings of Swami Paramahansa Yogananda, the author of the influential Autobiography of a Yogi and the founder of the Self-Realization Fellowship. Featuring interviews with scientists, yoga teachers, and direct students of Yogananda, the film becomes a kind of who's who of celebrities, including Deepak Chopra, Krishna Das, and the late George Harrison and Ravi Shankar.Awake also captures intimate -- and at times heartbreaking -- moments of the guru's life. Through slow-mo, sepia-toned reenactments, archival video footage, newspaper clippings, audio recordings, photos, and a narrative spun in Yogananda's own words, the filmmakers hook the viewer emotionally from the get-go.Intrigued? Here's a sneak peek of Awake, including archival photos of Yogananda, color stills from the film, and quotes from an interview I conducted with the filmmakers, Paola di Florio and Lisa Leeman.The Saint (photo credit: Self-Realization Fellowship, Los Angeles, CA)""It's not easy to make a film about a saint,"" DiFlorio and Leeman told me. ""We're storytellers, and good narrative usually requires conflict, struggle, and a protagonist with human flaws. We searched for skeletons in Yogananda's 'closet,' and while we found certain provocative allegations along the way, there was nothing to back them up. As we dug deeper into his life, however, we discovered that he faced major obstacles, many of which the public was unaware of...""Despite being recognized as a ""spiritual genius,"" the filmmakers told me, Yogananda endured severe criticism and even racism in the Deep South, from people who felt threatened by him and his message. ""Persecution, betrayals by students and close friends, and even financial ruin ensued,"" they said. ""But Yogananda rose like a phoenix through the ashes of his demise, not only to regain his own purpose in life, but to inspire others to do the same through his example."" And there was their story.The Renegade (photo credit: Self-Realization Fellowship, Los Angeles, CA)Quite the renegade of his day, Yogananda tackled social and political issues head on. For example, when he learned only white people would be allowed to attend his lectures in Washington, DC, in 1927, he says in the film, ""I defied this and founded an Afro-American ... center to teach my Negro brethren."" (Pictured above.)And when it was still against U.S. law to ""mix races,"" Yogananda publicly married an Indian man and an American woman. In doing so, he taught by example his ultimate belief that we are all one.The Independent Thinker (photo credit: Self-Realization Fellowship, Los Angeles, CA)Yogananda was also a vocal supporter of Mahatma Gandhi. According to Leeman, he lectured about him at Harvard. He visited Gandhi's ashram in Wardha, India in 1935 (see photo above). And he even gave Gandhi -- at his request -- a lesson in Kriya Yoga, an ancient meditation method he learned from his own guru, Swami Sri Yuketswar, and taught to his students in India, Britain, and America, the film reports.""We discovered that Yogananda was put on a government watch list and kept under surveillance by the FBI and the British authorities, who were probably concerned about the growing independence movement in India,"" Leeman says.The East-Meets-West Mystic (photo credit: Self-Realization Fellowship, Los Angeles, CA)In an era of xenophobia and religious bigotry, Yogananda emphasized that all spiritual paths lead seekers to a profound experience of oneness. The guru's love and respect for Jesus and his ability to embrace the teachings of Christianity and yoga at the same time made his teachings accessible to a Western audience.The Sold-Out Speaker (photo credit: Self-Realization Fellowship, Los Angeles, CA)During his heyday in the West, the film reports, Yogananda lectured to full houses across the country on topics such as yoga and meditation; the universality of Hinduism and Christianity; how to cultivate willpower; how to be happy; and even how to attract a soulmate. The Teacher (photo credit: Self-Realization Fellowship, Los Angeles, CA)According to Awake, Yogananda taught his students hatha yoga as a way to prepare the body and mind for meditation. He encouraged his students to use their body as a living laboratory, in which they could conduct experiments and observe the results firsthand.The Divine (photo credit: Self-Realization Fellowship, Los Angeles, CA)""I think yoga is in the midst of maturing in this country,"" Leeman observes. ""Practitioners and teachers are shifting from postural-only hatha yoga to a wider palette of yogic practices. More people are recognizing that yoga is a set of tools that is available to people of all faiths, and also to people of no faith, to cultivate peace and connection to life around them, and to their our own inner selves.""""With this film, we hope to broaden the definition of what 'yoga' means in the West, beyond asana practice,"" DiFlorio adds. ""It is about awakening to our true nature, to who we really are. Through Yogananda's story, Awake invites us to recognize the divinity, or oneness -- not only within ourselves but within everyone and everything around us.""The Guru  (photo credit: Self-Realization Fellowship, Los Angeles, CA)""Yogananda broke down his teachings for us in volumes of step-by-step lessons on how to live,"" DiFlorio told me. ""They lead us to a fundamental truth: We are not the body. We are 'the ocean of consciousness,' as he would say. Meditation is about remembering that and experiencing it over and over again. I can't think of a better way to live."" For more information, watch the trailer, visit Awake's website, or check out a longer slideshow version of this article on YogaJournal.com."
2,ARTS,State of Art,"Carmen Pelaez, Contributorfilmmaker, writer, actor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/state-of-art_b_6006944.html,,2014-10-20,2014-10-18-ClaudiaCatalogue017_ThePregnantGod_LR.jpeg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-18-ClaudiaCatalogue017_ThePregnantGod_LR-thumb.jpeg,"I first came upon Claudia Paneca's work when The Invisible Dog Art Center in Brooklyn hosted one of their first annual open studio events. As I wove through the wonderfully diverse and extremely talented maze of artists, her work stood out because its depth wasn't betrayed by its simplicity. I wondered when director of ID, Lucien Zayan, would give her her own exhibit and it took a few years, but it was well worth the wait. STATE OF MATTER, Cuban born Paneca's first US solo exhibition, used the time to grow into itself. Devoid of contrivance or pretense, the forms and sculptures all feel organic and recognizable even though they are completely born of Paneca's meditations. Made mostly of porcelain, every piece seems to pulsate as it inhabits THE GLASS HOUSE, a greenhouse like exhibition space connected to Invisible Dog. Smartly curated by Gaelle Porte, it's the kind of show that takes you in, making you feel connected on a cellular level to the world you've stepped into. I really enjoyed being a part of that world, so I asked Paneca how she created it.What is State of Matter?State of Matter is a ritualistic meditation to explore the dialectics of matter and non matter through a personal vocabulary of images, writings and symbols. I was inspired by questions like: What is matter? Is conscience a state of matter as some cutting edge scientists propose? What is the essence of a material, an image and the artistic gesture? How does one incorporate more ""poetry of Being"" into the hyper materialistic society that we live in today? How did you choose the materials you wanted to work in?I chose to work mainly with porcelain clay because It fascinates me. All clay has a special memory (the propensity to return to a shape previously held) but that memory is even more present in high-fired porcelain. Clay is a material that carries a lot of information, energetically, historically, symbolically, and I use it as encoded symbolic data through this project. Clay as metaphoric matter. The central piece for the State of Matter exhibition is a ring made of raw porcelain clay on top of a black wood that describe different states of the material: moist, dry, dust. This ephemeral installation is a meditative metaphor of the cycle of life in our own state of matter. All pieces emanate from this central core.How did the space influence your work?When I got the chance to do my first solo exhibit in a non-traditional space The Glass House ended up being the ideal place to because its a space where the ""inside"" and the ""outside"" merge. This project grew from a deep meditation. The black canvas behind the white pieces were a way to incorporate that meditative space from which all the works came to light. The idea that the pieces inside The Glass House will look like specimens growing in a greenhouse was very close to the ideal. I felt like cultivating an interior space in a public place. In sunny mornings the play of light and shadows inside The Glass House takes all the black and white works to another dimension.After seeing STATE OF MATTER, I thought a lot about the fleeting state of the art world. About the legendary critics that are tired of the carelessness with which shows are curated and audiences who instantly forget those artists desperate to glibly impress so they can cash out. Fortunately for us, Paneca understands that the best way to impress is by making an indelible impression. One that poetically reflects our cellular collectiveness and speaks to that which we can all understand but may not be able to verbalize. Its these kinds of shows that keep the state of art strong."
3,ENTERTAINMENT,"Susan Downey on Producing The Judge, Starring Robert Downey, Jr. and Robert Duvall","Nell Minow, ContributorMovie critic, corporate governance analyst",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/susan-downey-on-producing-the-judge_b_6008106.html,"The Judge is the first film from Team Downey, the production company founded by longtime Hollywood producer Susan Downey and her husband, highest-paid actor in the world Robert Downey, Jr.",2014-10-20,"Usually I don't post anything like this, and really I don't take photos of people often at all, but we were out walking around Comic Con, and we came across a small group of people that started making a bunch of noise. We walked down to see what was going on, and at first we commented that there weren't enough fans (maybe 20) for anyone famous to be showing up, over the course of the next 10 minutes after saying that we saw Robert Downey Jr, William H. Macy, Will Ferrell, and countless other less famous stars. Of the celebrity shots I got I liked this one the best because Robert Downey Jr. jumped on the side of the car and saluted the crowd just before being driven away. He was acting very much in the character of Tony Stark. After I chose my favorite image from the day I quickly realized I have no idea how to process portrait shots, so this just has some basic exposure, contrast and color adjustments done in Lightroom.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb483593c000066000ca203.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Judge is the first film from Team Downey, the production company founded by longtime Hollywood producer Susan Downey (""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,"" ""RocknRolla"") and her husband, highest-paid actor in the world Robert Downey, Jr. His blockbuster franchise films as the larger-than-life iconic heroes Iron Man and Sherlock Holmes are wildly entertaining, but it is a welcome departure to see him in a straight dramatic role in a movie of great warmth, humor and wisdom.Downey gives his most complex and layered performance as Hank, an arrogant criminal defense attorney from Chicago who returns home for his mother's funeral and ends up defending his father (Robert Duvall) in a homicide trial. The cast also includes Billy Bob Thornton as the prosecutor, Vera Farmiga as Hank's high school sweetheart, and Vincent D'Onofrio and Jeremy Strong as Hank's brothers. Susan Downey said, ""In telling the story, we really wanted to make sure it felt like real people going into real situations. It is not the movie version of it. So whether it was one of the leads or down to even our day players, it was just important that they felt authentic."" Farmiga plays Maggie, a single mother still living in the small Indiana town Hank left as a teenager. She is a capable, confident woman who knows who she is -- and who Hank is. That was really important to us. Obviously this movie is interesting because we have a lot of strong male leads in the movie between the two Roberts and the brothers, but the heart of the movie is really Vera's character. And there's also the missing female presence, the mother who passes away at the beginning. This is a bit of a blanket statement but I think that there is some truth to it, if Dad passes away, the family is probably still getting together for Thanksgiving. But if Mom passes away, she is kind of that pin in the grenade and you just don't know where everything is going to scatter after she is gone. Downey explained that the hilarious jury selection scene, one of the movie's highlights, was the suggestion of first-time screenwriter Bill Dubuque. Another scene she especially loves is when Hank first returns to Indiana and sees his brothers at the funeral home. The first thing his older brother (played by D'Onofrio) says to him is ""Where did you park?"" That was Robert's favourite moment and that was something that Vincent brought to it. That was not in the script. He did it. I've seen it a thousand times, and the great thing about seeing it again and again is that the performances are so layered. When you get such good actors they are always giving you something. And I just love Robert's reactions in that scene.The original script had Hank go for a run. But Robert Downey, Jr. told David Dobkin he wanted Hank to find his old bicycle at the family house, and he wanted the character to have the exact make and model he rode himself when he was a teenager. They managed to track one down for him, and it is a wonderful scene, seeing Hank begin to reconnect to what he loved in his old home.Susan Downey is very proud of The Judge. It was such a powerful journey for Hank to go on. The starting point is the guy who has it all. And then we get to watch it get stripped away. He has to deal with what was underneath all of that and the stillness and the reserve from a performance standpoint that that took. I really enjoyed it because it was a different performance than we've seen for a long time and it showed for me the entire spectrum of his talent, from making me laugh to making me cry. "

Twitter: @TonyaCornelisse . Photo by Bobby Quillard.Have you heard of Tonya Cornelisse? Say whaaaaaat? Get with the program, people.Tonya has two film projects being released within five months of each other. Did I say two films? I meant FOUR films! She is set to star in Yellow, alongside Melanie Griffth, then a scifi/horror film Lost Time. Next comes A Leading Man where Tonya plays a modern day 'Samantha Jones' and finally she's featured in Pele, which is produced by Imagine Entertainment's Ron Howard. Now print this paragraph out and hang it on your wall. Did you do it yet? Did you do it yet?But let's just say you're more into theatre. Tonya just finished performing the role of 'Shelly' in the revival of Sam Shepard's Pulitzer Prize winning play Buried Child at the Whitefire Theatre in Sherman Oaks, CA. I'm sure you'll be able to see her in future theatre. But for now, if you see her walking on the street, say to her, ""You GO girl!"" Really, say that. I mean it. Then she'll know you read this.You're having a breakout year with the release of four film projects! But you also love to do theater. Tell us the story about how you got your Actors Equity card.Ah. Great question! I was 17 years old and graduated high school early (FYI, this is not because I am sort of a Doogie Howser but due to my mother needing to get me out of the house at age four, as opposed to five - I was a handful).I moved straight to NYC upon graduation from conservatory and desperate to ""work"" with real professionals in front of a real audience, I auditioned for the touring company of Charlotte's Web when they needed a last minute replacement. I got the gig and was on a plane to Jacksonville, Florida (God save me). I eventually went back to NYU and finished my degree...haha! I am very proud to be part of that union.What is it with you and horror films?I don't shy away from things & err, go for the gut! :-) I actually grew up watching Night of the Living Dead and loads of Hitchcock and old suspense films. I am a huge fan of Twin Peaks and was obsessed at a very young age with the genre. As an actress, it was something I never even thought about it really - doing a film based on the genre, but there is something with that elevated level of reality rather it be comedic or tragic that is very challenging and wonderful to attack ~ you get to go there and to do it well. To answer your question though, it is just a project to project basis for me when it comes to approaching a project.West Coast or East Coast?East Coast. 1,000%. It's my roots. NYC will always be calling me home. That said, I'm no hater of the West Coast ... it definitely has a place in my heart.What's your favorite place in the world?This is probably going to sound pretentious but it so isn't - CAFE ST. REGIS. It's a diner ... in Paris - haha. It's the little tiny haunt that has been there forever on the Île Saint-Louis off the Seine river - I spent a very long, very rainy afternoon in there a few years ago playing Gin Rummy - with a few bottles of champagne and a couple orders of french fries. This gang of Gerard Depardieu characters were part of the furniture at the bar and had a huge camera that we kept taking loads of photos that they were supposed to send ... I never saw or heard from them again. It was like it never happened. First place that came to mind ~ ahhhh...Who are your favorite actors and why?Gena Rowlands is an icon of mine. Woman Under the Influence, Gloria. That's my deal. I want to do films like that - all the time! Peter Falk was one of the best ever in my opinion. I think Robin Wright Penn, Jessica Lange and Jane Fonda are all turning out really interesting and inspiring work right now!Have you ever made a mistake while doing live theatre?Mistakes happen in a play every performance you see ... unless, it's missing an entrance ... then we call them happy accidents & seize the moment ! The great thing about live theatre is it's like life - one big messy rehearsal - that's the performance, that's the actual life itself.You've won several Best Actress Awards. Who does the actual nominating for these awards? Did you go out and celebrate?I've never been one to turn down a glass of bubbly so.... When in Rome - In terms of the nomination process, I have no idea - monkeys & ponies? I appreciate it though! Thank you mysteries ones! ... who get Meryl Streep on that ballot every.year. Haha!You've played so many diverse characters. Do you ever bring your REAL self into any of your characters?To quote the late, oh so great Robin Williams ""The more personal you make it, and the more specific you make it, the more people will relate to you"". That is my answer to that one in a shell of a nut.One, of the most recent memorable characters (for me) was Starla in YELLOW ... this chick! Yellow was written and directed by Nick Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands plays my grandmother (see above to how happy that made me). Starla is a single mom and living paycheck to paycheck in rural Oklahoma .. she's got a mouth to put a gaggle of truckers to shame and not ashamed of her extremely dysfunctional families past, present and future. Scrappy and sassy are words that come to mind. She struts, as opposed to walk. I had the best time with this one.You're doing voiceover work for the #HIDDENseries audio books. How does that work? I read the manuscript straight off my iPad in a sound booth at a sound studio with a very fancy audio engineer. I am recording it right in Hollywood. I love this series....go get it! I am not just saying that as I am the ""voice"" of it. It has demon sex in it!Anything else you'd like to say?Be nice to animals. Be nice to your mom. Twitter & Facebook is my name @TonyaCornelisse if you fancy. I will mostly be obsessing on the return of Twin Peaks and inappropriate kids drawings."

That's why many cruises enhance their holiday offerings to lure families onto the ships. Disney Cruise Line's Halloween on the High Seas - spooky (but not so scary) -- cruises during the shoulder season between summer vacations and the winter holidays. However, Disney Cruise Line's not the only fleet to offer special themed cruises for during fall and winter holidays. Take a look at how you could leave the stress of the holidays in your wake onboard a family cruise. (TRIP PLAN: See how one family is celebrating the Thanksgiving holiday.) Halloween  Chip & Dale at Disney's Halloween on the High Seas (Photo Credit: Matt Stroshane courtesy Disney Cruise Line)Jack-O-Lanterns, trick-or-treating, spooks, and spirits are all to be found during Halloween themed cruises. Disney Cruise Line offers costumed characters (Chip & Dale has Keystone, Cop & Robber were particularly adorable), monster mash dance parties, trick-or-treating, and a two-story tall pumpkin tree that ""blooms"" over the course of any cruise during September and October. Norwegian Cruise Ship (Photo Credit: Flickr/Tom Mascardo)""Frightfully Fun"" is how Carnival Cruise Line describes its Halloween celebration with a Halloween Hunt, dive-in Halloween movies, and Casino Witching Hour Tournaments. Norwegian Cruise Line provides themed specialty cocktails - such as a Transylvania Tea, Frankenberry and Eyeball Martinis. Norwegian's dinner buffets on October 31 are filled with carved pumpkins, elaborately ghoulish chocolate showpieces, and spooky treats including pecan and caramel ""spiders"" and pumpkin bars. ThanksgivingWhy bother cooking a huge feast and hosting the relatives when you can let the cruise line handle it for you? Lisa Picket, hotel director for Disney Cruise Line's Disney Dream, recalled a family reunion of 75 people spending Thanksgiving at sea, and said many families return each and every year for the holiday. Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's Adventure Ocean kids' program features Thanksgiving themed story-time, activities and crafts; while Norwegian Cruise Line's passengers can have their traditional pumpkin pie dessert in liquid martini form. Plus, families don't need to worry about missing the big game, as NFL football is broadcast live aboard most ships -you can even watch outdoors, poolside on the jumbo LED Funnel Vision screen of Disney Cruise Line. Christmas/Hanukkah  Disney Cruise Line Christmas (Photo Credit: Kent Phillips courtesy Disney Cruise Line)For Hanukkah, menorahs are lit each evening and services are held on both Norwegian and Disney Cruise Lines. Royal Caribbean offers Hanukkah-themed shows, games and food lasting all eight days of the holiday. However, just like on land, it's Christmas where the cruise lines go all out.Like the ""Halloween on the High Seas"" sailings, Disney sets the standard for the season with its ""Very Merrytime Cruises."" In addition to all the regular cruise entertainment, these voyages include Mickey's Tree-Lighting Magic where holiday-dressed Disney characters sing carols and light a three-deck tall Christmas Tree, Winter Wonderland Ball (with Santa & Mrs. Claus), Dickens-inspired carolers, as well as a holiday party on deck during all November and December cruises. Many other cruise lines add special holiday decorations and Christmas trees, treats, and feasts such as the Royal Dutch High Tea with fanciful holiday cookies and pastries on Holland America, and a Gingerbread House and Holiday Village on every Norwegian Cruise Line ship. Additional Christmas festivities on Royal Caribbean ships include meet & greets with Santa Claus and his elves, holiday movies, and ice skating parties. Santa Claus also appears on Carnival Cruise Line (he gets around quickly), toting a sack of gifts to distribute to all the youngsters.

8,GREEN,'Water Cops' Hunt For Sprinkler Scofflaws As California Remains Parched By Drought,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-drought-water-cops_n_6010308.html,,2014-10-19,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA - JULY 15: Sprinklers water a lawn in Golden Gate Park on July 15, 2014 in San Francisco, California. As the California drought continues to worsen and voluntary conservation is falling well below the suggested 20 percent, the California Water Resources Control Board is considering a $500 per day fine for residents who waste water on landscaping, hosing down sidewalks and car washing.

The buzz of a sprinkler system gave them away on a day that the city, desperate to save water amid California's ongoing drought, had forbidden watering.""If I can get a good picture - if there's a lot of water - I'll cite them,"" he said.California is in the third year of a devastating drought that has led farmers to fallow nearly half a million acres of cropland, threatened fish hatcheries and shrunk drinking water supplies for some communities.To get people to conserve, many municipalities and regional water agencies have hired ""water cops"" like Brown to enforce state conservation rules.Cities have even asked people to turn their neighbors in, and some have created smartphone apps to make the process easier.Brown, 46, a father of four who was hired by the city as a meter reader, said he picked this area because he has fielded numerous complaints from neighbors about water wasters.Camera and citation book in hand, he parked the car a few houses down and got out, walking swiftly to the house where the sprinklers were on. A flash illuminated the building's facade, then all was dark again.Brown headed back to the car and wrote up the citation. A check of his laptop showed that the residents had not been cited before, so instead of a fine of up to $500, they would get a warning. On a second offense, they would have to attend a meeting on how to save water. Third time, a fine.The city of Sacramento has about a half-dozen employees enforcing conservation rules. Like Brown, they go out on Friday mornings before dawn, patrolling neighborhoods. When they're not patrolling, they field phone calls from residents turning in their neighbors, hopping in their cars to check out serious reports on the spot.Water use in the city dropped 25 percent in August over the same month in 2013, the most recent month for which information is available, state data showed.Statewide, residents and businesses cut water use by 11.5 percent in August over the comparable 2013 period, enough to fill nearly 40,000 Olympic-size swimming pools.Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, credits new rules and tougher enforcement with much of the change.""Regulations make better results than voluntary exhortations,"" she said. ""People want to know that everybody else is doing it.""In August, the water resources board implemented statewide rules that prohibit watering gardens enough to cause visible runoff, hosing down driveways or asphalt, and operating non-recirculating fountains.Regulators also allowed municipalities to set mandatory cutbacks and levy fines against those who do not comply.In Los Angeles, the city has received 4,400 reports of water wasters this year, resulting in 2,200 warning citations, said Michelle Vargas, a spokeswoman with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.L.A. has kept one water cop on the beat full-time since the state's last big drought in 2009, but it added three more this summer after the new statewide regulations went into effect.The Southern California city of Long Beach is offering residents a water-waster app for their smartphones, making snitching quick and easy by allowing users to report neighbors and businesses for hosing down sidewalks, watering during the heat of the day or having a break or leak in their water lines.Sometimes, Brown says, reports from vindictive neighbors lead him to visit a property only to find that no violation has taken place.""I tell them I'm not going to cite you just because they call on you,"" said Brown, who carefully documents every case with photographs and a brief report. ""There has to be evidence."" (Editing by Douglas Royalty)"

It said four more mortars were fired on Sunday.The month-long battle for Kobani has ebbed and flowed. A week ago, Kurds said the town would soon fall. The United States and its coalition partners then stepped up air strikes on Islamic State, which wants to take Kobani in order to strengthen its position in northern Syria.The coalition has been bombing Islamic State targets in Iraq since August and extended the campaign to Syria in September after Islamic State, a group that espouses a rigid interpretation of Islam and initially fought Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, made huge territorial gains.Raids on Islamic State around Kobani have been stepped up, with the fate of the town seen as an important test for U.S. President Barack Obama's campaign against the Islamists.NATO member Turkey, whose forces are ranged along the border overlooking Kobani, is reluctant to intervene. It insists the allies should also confront Assad to end Syria's civil war, which has killed close to 200,000 people since March 2011.""We had the most intense clashes in days, perhaps a week, last night. (Islamic State) attacked from three different sides including the municipality building and the market place,"" said Abdulrahman Gok, a journalist in Kobani.""Clashes did not stop until the morning. We have had an early morning walk inside the city and have seen lots of damaged cars on the streets and unexploded mortar shells,"" he said. CAR BOMBSThe Observatory reported two Islamic State car bombs hit Kurdish positions on Saturday evening, leading to casualties. A cloud of black smoke towered over Kobani on Sunday.A fighter from one of the female units of the main Syrian Kurdish militia in Kobani, YPG, said Kurdish fighters were able to detonate the car bombs before they reached their targets.""Last night there were clashes all across Kobani ... this morning the clashes are still ongoing,"" she said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The Observatory said 70 Islamic State fighters had been killed in the past two days, according to sources at the hospital in the nearby town of Tel Abyab, where Islamic State bodies are taken. Reuters cannot independently confirm the reports due to security restrictions.The Observatory said some Syrian Arab fighters from the Revolutionaries of Raqqa Brigade, who are fighting alongside Kurdish fighters, had executed two Islamic State captives.""One was a child of around 15 years old. They shot them in the head,"" he said.Islamic State have also used executions throughout their campaigns in Syria and Iraq, killing hundreds of enemy combatants and civilians who oppose their cause, according to Islamic State videos and statements.Welat Omer, a doctor caring for the few remaining civilians in Kobani, told Reuters by telephone that he was looking after 15 patients, including children and the elderly.""We need medicine, including antibiotics and milk for the children, and medicine for the elderly, who have heart conditions, diabetes and high blood pressure,"" Omer said.Hundreds of thousands have fled Islamic State's advance. Turkey hosts about 1.5 million Syrian refugees, including almost 200,000 Syrian Kurds from Kobani.Ankara has refused to rearm beleaguered Kurdish fighters, who complain they are at huge disadvantage in the face of Islamic State's weaponry, much of it seized from the Iraqi military when the militants took the city of Mosul in June.Turkey views the YPG with suspicion for its long-standing links with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a 30-year armed campaign for self-rule in Turkey.President Tayyip Erdogan was quoted in the Turkish media on Sunday as saying Ankara will never arm the YPG through its political wing, the PYD.""There has been talk of arming the PYD to establish a front here against Islamic State. For us, the PYD is the same as the PKK, it's a terrorist organization,"" he was quoted as saying.This stance has sparked outrage among Turkey's own Kurds, who make up about 20 percent of the population. Riots in several cities earlier this month killed left than 35 people dead.
