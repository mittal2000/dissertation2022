0,POLITICS,Obamacare Exchanges Falling Far Short Of Smoking Cessation Requirements,Jesse Rifkin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-smoking_n_6972098.html,,2015-03-31,"WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 25: U.S. President Barack Obama pauses as he speaks during an event marking the 5th anniversay of the Affordable Care Act March 25, 2015 at the South Court Auditorium of Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, DC. President Obama spoke on the benefits of the legislation. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e691763230000be15de0a32.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Only one state in the country makes sure that Affordable Care Act consumers have access to smoking cessation programs as the law requires, according to a report released Tuesday.The ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, mandates that the health insurance policies available through exchanges set up under the law cover all seven FDA-approved tobacco cessation medications without cost-sharing. Yet today's report from the American Lung Association found that only West Virginia did so for all its available marketplace plans -- a feat no doubt helped by the fact that it's the only state with only one such plan. (Other states have anywhere from two in-state plans, to up to 18 in New York.) Meanwhile, five states -- Arkansas, Hawaii, Mississippi, South Dakota and Vermont -- had no plans offering all seven medications as required.""About 70 percent of all smokers want to quit, and people who are on Medicaid and who have been historically uninsured are those with the highest smoking rates,"" Erika Sward, assistant vice president for national advocacy at the American Lung Association, told HuffPost. ""This is really an area where states need to focus if they’re going to save lives and reduce the tobacco-caused burden.""Of the 348 health insurances issuers available through exchanges, the organization found that only 144 (or 41.4 percent) listed all seven tobacco cessation medications. Of those, only 60 explicitly mentioned that there was no cost-sharing as required by law, meaning no co-payments or deductibles. While some plans that didn't explicitly mention this feature may indeed provide the medications at no cost, the report noted that omitting this risks implying there was cost-sharing charged to any patients oblivious to the requirement.Thirteen states plus the District of Columbia run their own marketplaces, while the rest are federally run. Compliance was slightly higher in state-run marketplaces versus federally run, but the difference was not statistically significant.Only three states have half or more plans in compliance (six in 10 plans were compliant in California; three of five plans were compliant in Minnesota; and three of six plans were compliant in Louisiana). The top five states by percentage of plans in compliance are California, Minnesota, Louisiana, Wisconsin and Maryland. Numbers were not immediately available regarding the percentage of beneficiaries covered under plans in compliance, as opposed to percentage of plans themselves.In some ways this is symptomatic of a broader problem: the lack of follow-through on many of the consumer protections in the law. Alleged violations have ranged from insurers using drug formularies to exclude sicker high-risk patients, to complaints that the ""narrow networks"" of providers and hospitals on some plans are so narrow that people can't see the doctors they need. In theory, the ACA is supposed to prevent such practices.The seven FDA-approved smoking-cessation medications required for coverage are bupropion, varenicline, nicotine nasel spray, nicotine inhalers, nicotine gum, nicotine patches and nicotine lozenges. While virtually all plans cover at least two or more of the medications -- 98.9 percent cover bupropion, for example -- Sward argued that still isn't enough.""We know that there's not just one way that helps people quit smoking. What science shows, what evidence shows, and what the Affordable Care Act requires is that the more options smokers have to help them quit, the more successful they will be,"" said Sward. ""Is covering two forms of medication better than covering zero? Yes. But is it enough to prevent the number-one cause of preventable death in this country? No.""CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story reported that 12 states had more than half of plans in compliance with federal regulations, and that the top five states by percentage of plans in compliance were West Virginia, Minnesota, Oklahoma, California and North Dakota. In fact, only three states have more than half of plans in compliance, and the top five states by percentage of plans in compliance are California, Minnesota, Louisiana, Wisconsin and Maryland.Jonathan Cohn contributed reporting."

In today's day and age, HIV is a manageable chronic disease much like diabetes. We have come a long way since the onset of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s. The havoc it wreaked within the NYC gay community left many casualties behind. I think often of how my fate could have been so different if I was born in 1961 as opposed to 1981. I can still remember the heroes of my youth who fought this disease so valiantly. The young, brave Ryan White taking on a society's discrimination with all his courage. The handsome and inspiring Pedro Zamora of The Real World who helped me to not only put a face on HIV, but a face on what it meant to be gay and living a life of dignity and truth. The charismatic Maurizio, the partner of my older cousin Sandy, who had been an Italian model in his younger years, gracing the pages of magazines. In 2000, he passed away from an HIV-related complication. Another life lost on a pile of so many before. The ultimate devastation for Sandy, whose photo album of friends was a graveyard of men long gone.About a year into being diagnosed it was necessary for me to start taking medication. My T-Cells were getting lower and lower. At the time I was unemployed and receiving government assistance. If I didn't have Medicaid my life would have been in jeopardy. And this is where the latest assault on the Affordable Care Act (""Obamacare"") and the Supreme Court of the United States come in. This is where I must make a resounding call for a single payer health care system. In today's day and age in the most industrialized country in the world, no one should be dying because of lack of quality care and access to that care.For the approximately 1.2 million Americans living with HIV in the United States, HIV should now be a manageable condition with access to life-saving medications and quality care. However, a report published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in the beginning of 2014 found that over 700,000 people between the ages of 19-64 were still uninsured. The authors of the report estimate that this number would be reduced by 200,000 as a direct result of the ACA. Though the ACA is of great importance to this segment of the population, an estimated half a million people remain uninsured.Single payer health care is the final answer. In a nutshell, single payer is universal health care. Giving everyone access to state funded health care, health care would be recognized as a basic human right rather than a commodity.It is important that we understand what is at stake right now and make sure that we don't go backwards. We must solidify what we have in place in order to move forward. The same folks with the same right-wing agenda who brought you the 2012 Supreme Court ACA battle (National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius) are it again! Part II features the same cast of characters, including Michael Carvin, the plaintiff's attorney, who once again is trying with all his might to cripple the ACA. United States Solicitor General, Donald Verrilli, is being forced to defend the government's position for the second time. 2012's NFIB v. Sebelius case hinged upon the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion. With some exceptions (religious objectors, undocumented immigrants and incarcerated individuals), the individual mandate part of the ACA requires everyone to maintain a minimum level of health insurance for themselves and their tax dependents. Those who do not satisfy the individual mandate will face a financial penalty, also known as the shared responsibility payment. The individual mandate of the ACA was upheld by a slim 5-4 Supreme Court decision, where, in a surprise twist to many, Justice Roberts sided with the four liberal justices of the court (Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan).The ACA also expands Medicaid eligibility. Funded by both the state and federal governments Medicaid provides health insurance to people with very little income. Though this program is a voluntary system for states, at this time all states participate in the program. Under the ACA expansion, Medicaid would now cover all people under 65 with household incomes at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). In 2012 this was $14,856 per year for an individual and $30,657 per year for a family of four. Pre-ACA Medicaid coverage by and large excluded non-disabled, non-pregnant adults without dependent children, unless states got waivers to cover them. Unfortunately, Medicaid expansion was limited by the Supreme Court when they allowed states to choose whether or not they wanted to expand Medicaid enrollment. Only Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor found Medicaid expansion to be constitutional. Currently 28 states plus D.C. have expanded their Medicaid coverage, five States are considering expanding, and 19 states have decided against expansion.The Carvin case now before the Supreme Court, is the right's latest effort to take down the ACA. Carvin argues that the law holds that Federal subsidies will be given to states with exchanges that were ""established by the State."" With only 14 states setting up their own exchanges so far, the Federal Government has had to set up the exchanges for most of the remaining states and in some cases partner up with them. Carvin seeks to create chaos and unravel the ACA by applying a phrase of four words in the most literal of ways, in an effort to make the case that people in those states with federal exchanges should not be given subsidies, because they were not set up by the State. People in those states who are making use of the exchanges are by and large dependent upon federal subsidies. The ACA would be in serious jeopardy with so many people removed from the health insurance program. Costs for those remaining on the program would skyrocket, resulting in a crushing blow to the ACA, from which the program and the new law might never recover. Essentially right-wing ideology would triumph at the cost of people's lives.The ACA has been the biggest health care expansion since 1965, when Medicare and Medicaid became law. To all the critics of the ACA, we can agree with its shortcomings while understanding that it lays a foundation for us to build upon. I recently attended a health care panel where one man reminded everyone in the room of what President Obama had to go through to get this law enacted. Obama, he said, came out of this period of time with arrows coming out of his back. I am grateful for this law, because I clearly understand that it is means for the poorest people in this country. I would not be here today if it wasn't for the free, quality health care I was given in the form of Medicaid. As we know, even with government assistance, many Americans are saddled with high health care costs and are forced to navigate an often complex system.I support the ACA and I advocate for a single payer national health insurance system. With this system in place, all medically necessary services for every United States resident would be covered. For-profit healthcare would disappear. Patients wouldn't be burdened with obstacles to care such as premiums, deductibles and co-pays. The Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act (H.R. 676) seeks to create a single payer system here in the United States. This is what HIV+ people, LGBT people, people of color and those who are living in poverty desperately need. This is what we all need in order to be a society in which our ideals are realized rather than sold off.We can't go backwards, there's just too much at stake."
3,EDUCATION,"The PDP Farce -- Wink, Wink, Nod, Nod","D. A. Russell, ContributorAuthor, Vietnam veteran and math teacher, Dartmouth College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-pdp-farce-wink-wink-n_b_6971736.html,PDPs - Professional Development Plans (usually referred to as Professional Development Points by teachers) - are the primary means of giving teachers needed training during their careers.,2015-03-31,2015-03-30-1427743458-1452198-021PDPDevelopment.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-30-1427743458-1452198-021PDPDevelopment-thumb.jpg,"PDPs - Professional Development Plans (usually referred to as Professional Development Points by teachers) - are the primary means of giving teachers needed training during their careers. All teachers are required to take additional training, and be credited with PDPs in order to be re-certified to teach. All schools conduct internal training programs that award some of the required PDPs periodically, but in addition teachers must find outside sources of training that qualify for most of their PDP credits.PDPs could be a good thing for teachers and education. After all, there are a number of topics that would be valuable for all teachers that are too rarely covered, such as: diversified learning, ""explaining"" versus ""presenting,"" class discipline, evolving technology, and engaging students. But once again the Career DoE bureaucrats have taken a good goal, and twisted it into a costly, ineffective farce via their mismanaged implementation. The problem is that there is a mandated need for so many PDPs (else they lose their license and jobs) that teachers have to scramble to take whatever credit-offering courses they can find. But there are a limited number of useful courses available, and only part of them provided by the schools.  There are always topics required by state DOEs that qualify for PDP credits - such as training for standardized test proctoring, or annual review of restraint training. In addition, most schools carefully choose new topics relevant to their school each year. But these programs typically cover no more than one-fourth to one-third of the PDPs required to renew a teaching license. So a cottage industry has now grown into a major industry to churn out new ""content"" every few months that can be sold to teachers and schools to meet PDP requirements. The result is exactly what you would expect - the drive in the PDP industry is to create something new and salable - not necessarily anything that helps education. Teachers are mandated to find PDPs, so the PDP industry gets to work and invents new ""content"" to sell. In recent years, much of this new content has either been ""check-the-box"" training that is nothing more than a rehash of old material and will be ignored by the attendees, or it is a new fad-du-jour that someone cooked up to sell a course regardless of educational merit. Teachers routinely sit at these PDP conferences with a ""...wink, wink, nod, nod, this is really useful..."" view of the meeting. Everyone attending knows it is a costly, time-consuming farce. The goal is to get through the meeting, get the certificate that awards the mandated PDPs, and then go home and forget all the nonsense you just heard. For extended versions of this and other of D. A. Russell's blogs about  the real issues in today's education system, please visit: https://liftingthecurtainoneducation.wordpress.com/Now clearly, not all PDP conferences and classes are bad. But I can only recall a handful in the past decade that had nuggets a good teacher could use. One of the best half-day PDP sessions I ever attended was about ways to discipline with humor and engage today's child centered on an excellent book by Barkley. Another was a course with practical tips on diversified learning strategies. Most of the other commercial PDP courses were a complete waste of time.Example: The Power of ""I""A now-dead fad called ""The Power of I"" is the poster child for the ills of the PDP system. Thousands of schools across the country jumped on this program a few years ago to fill a half-day of PDP training, and yield a few precious PDP credits for their teachers. The program was a huge financial success for its developers. On the surface it was a program designed to help get students to do more homework. In reality, it was a program designed by someone who had absolutely no idea what teachers face in the classroom, and appears to know absolutely nothing about the psychology and expectations of a child.The basis for ""The Power of I"" was: never give a child a zero for a missed assignment, instead give them an ""I"" for ""Incomplete."" By some mysterious process this would incent the child to finish the project at a later date. Somehow in the rush to create saleable PDP content, the creator believed he could convince experienced teachers that this was an effective way to get students to do more homework. Many of us watched with trepidation as several of the newer teachers gave ""The Power of I"" a try. We watched as the term ended and the homework still had not been made up. We watched as the teacher asked in bewilderment what grade should be submitted for the end of the term report card if a student still had an ""I"" for three scores, and refused to make up the assignments. It was frustrating and sad to witness the hard lesson the new teacher learned about educational PDP fads, when the students did exactly what the experienced teachers expected. The student preferred the ""I"" to the zero because it let them safely skip the work, yet kept them out of trouble at home for weeks by hiding the zeroes. They gladly accepted the zero at the end of the term rather than make up the work - knowing they could use the excuse at home that it was too late, and they would just have one ""punishment"" all at once rather than having had to face the parent for each zero along the way. Worst of all, by labeling failure with the relatively nice term of ""incomplete,"" we enable the child to duck his/her responsibility. The child knows he/she simply blew off the assignment, but the school tells them it's okay because it is just ""incomplete."" The school has made it official - skipping assignments is okay.  It doesn't have to be this way!There are many more like the ""Power of I"" that could be cited to make the point about useless PDP content. If I had to try to put numbers on my years of PDP training history, I would guesstimate the following:Useful PDP content: 20% Rehash of old, known material: 50% Useless fad content: 30%But PDPs could be good for teachers and education if we just reduced the number required (so that there was no longer the need to purchase useless filler training) and follow training best practices. For any training program to succeed, any world-class trainer will tell you it must meet three criteria:• Focused on the needs of the individual • Focused upon the needs of the job • Provide added value specific to the individualThe overall PDP program fails these criteria for the bulk of the PDP training that is available. Much of the training is just a repeat of prior years where 90% of the audience has been through the same presentation a dozen times before. We need to fix this! KIRKUS and CLARION both praise the acclaimed book ""...from the unique perspective of a classroom teacher"" about our failing education system: Lifting the Curtain: The disgrace we call urban high school education.  The 2nd edition includes dozens of teacher submissions from across the USA and nine  new chapters. Please get a copy HERE or on Amazon."
4,EDUCATION,The Barriers to Technology in Education,"Suren Ramasubbu, ContributorCo-founder & CEO, Mobicip.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-barriers-to-technolog_b_6961708.html,"For technology within the classroom to be effective, there must be noticeable benefits resulting from it and concerted studies are required to quantify the effects of technology on education.",2015-03-30,2015-03-28-1427567160-3976209-ScreenShot20150328at10.59.09AM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-28-1427567160-3976209-ScreenShot20150328at10.59.09AM-thumb.png,"Co-authored by Lakshmi, a Mobicip blogger who is just as passionately opinionated about the juxtaposition of technology, parenting and education.Despite the apparent proliferation of technology in the education sector, education experts often bemoan the languidness of technology insertion especially into conventional K12 classrooms. Such complaints arise from comparing education to the industrial sector. In industry, the goals and effects of technology can be measured by quantifiable metrics such as productivity and net profit. In education, there are no such metrics. Is the goal of education reaching more children and teaching more existing material, or fostering creativity and independence among them? Any teacher would answer that it must be a mix of the two, but is there a golden ratio? Given the fuzziness of this ratio, how much technology insurgence will support this ratio, and how?Educational technology is a vast interconnected web of specialties; digital lessons, scheduling, modeling and simulations, internet enabled interactions, virtual classrooms, identity and cyber security management systems, faculty evaluation systems and data analytics must interplay. While there are numerous technology developers who cater to production of specialized digital tools for industry, the number of companies investing in educational technology is more modest. This is largely because the education sector hesitates to invest in technological innovation. For example, for every dollar spent on education in 2005, only 3.5 cents was spent on technological materials, tools and services. The excuse for such poor investment in technology has been the unwillingness or inability of schools to free up teacher time for adequate training, a time that is taken as ""sunk cost"". Furthermore, decision makers in education tend to view new ventures as risky, because education is time-constrained, and mistakes could be costly in terms of meeting educational milestones.The situation has, however, improved over the years; in 2014, American K-12 schools were expected to spend $9.94 billion on educational technology. The proposed $125 million competitive-grant program by the Obama Government to promote high school redesign, with a particular focus on science, technology, engineering, and math, or STEM also bodes well for educational technology as it could somewhat mitigate the budget issues that have, in the past few years, given rise to the ""Bring your own device"" or BYOD system in schools.Budgetary constraints are only one of many barriers to technology insurgence into education. The sales cycle to bring technological tools to education continues to be a daunting prospect, given the complexity and levels involved in decision making. Thus, introducing a new technology into education requires an ""aye"" from state policy people, academic consultants, school board members, district curriculum policymakers, special education department, office of research and assessment, the chief information officer, the director of IT and the principals and deans of schools. Paper pushing through all these levels often delays and sometimes hampers technology introduction. The average sales cycle for educational technology is, in a very optimistic estimate, about eight months to merely gain a foothold into a few schools in a district, and this rate of sales locks up capital and is not lucrative from the business standpoint.The business of edu-tech is, however, not bleak. A recent report in EdSurgeUS states that educational technology companies raised a total of $1.36 billion in 2014. However, much of the technology and products developed went into non-K12 markets. The following figure summarizes the main markets targeted by edu-tech companies. As can be seen, many of the edu-tech companies offer educational products for children and young students for use during leisure time and not as an add-on or supplementary school curriculum.The K12 public school system is not a lucrative commercial target for edu-tech companies because it does not have the features required to attract and sustain a strong entrepreneurial activity in the tech-tool business. This is a result of poor management practices, governance and culture, as well as funding and resource allocation logics.Teachers and instructors are often the loci of technology use in education and so, its effective blend into conventional education largely depends upon the instructors' epistemological views. Research has identified four instructor profiles that encourage or hamper the insurgence of technology in education. These classes of instructors use technology for four different goals - information transfer, application and clarification of concepts, exchange and development of ideas and for exploration and sharing, collaborative knowledge-creation, and development of process awareness and skills. As we move from information transfer to development of process awareness and skills, we see a shift from ""spending on IT because parents and politicians want to see computers in the classroom"" to ""investing in IT"" for true educational blending.According to the NMC Horizon Report: 2014 Higher Education Edition, a serious barrier to technology in the classroom is the lack of effective training to teachers and instructors, which in turn is driven by lack of funding, low administrative support, paucity of formal digital literacy agendas, and ambiguity around the definition of digital fluency. In a Walden University-commissioned 2010 study titled Educators, Technology and 21st Century Skills: Dispelling Five Myths, 783 teachers and 274 principals or assistant principals were interviewed about the effects of technology use on student learning and skills. The study found that teacher-preparation programs did not adequately equip teachers to incorporate technology into classroom instruction.The education sector has reached a critical point where it must accept that the way society seeks and engages with knowledge has changed in this digital era. Ignoring or resisting the insurgence of technology into the classroom may lead it down the way of the newspaper industry where many longstanding businesses failed because they ignored the influence of technology on their audiences. Thankfully, such apathy does not exist in education, even if the adoption of technology has been slow. A report by the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers titled ""Access, Adequacy, and Equity in Education Technology,"", provides the following recommendations to ease technology insurgence into K12 system: improvement of classroom access to hardware, software, and the Internet, enhancing technical support to both teachers and students, strengthening of professional development around the instructional uses of technology and enlisting teachers unions to advocate for tech funding and support.For technology within the classroom to be effective, there must be noticeable benefits resulting from it and concerted studies are required to quantify the effects of technology on education. When it can be conclusively proven that technology within schools aids in meeting their educational objectives, it would become easier to charter effective district technology plans, budgeting and education reforms. Such educational reforms that incorporate technology as an integral part of it will require meticulous planning and long-term vision for it to sustain its impacts on education."

Thomas Piketty's book ""Capital"" explores the idea that wealth is now more concentrated than income. According to the U.S. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the top 3 percent of Americans earn 31 percent of income, but they also own 54 percent of all assets. Wealth gains have far outstripped income gains.""Hard Times"" by Tom Clark and Anthony Heath tells the other side of the story -- income inequality. It confirms what most of us already sense, that happy times are here again for some, while others -- and in fact most others -- continue to struggle in the aftermath of the 2008 Financial Crisis. It describes how desperate life has become for the working poor in the US and the UK. As the authors pessimistically conclude about their subjects, 'it is outright impossible to offer them any reassurance about when their hard times will end.' The data they serve up is as devastating as the personal interviews that make their conclusions inescapable.Both Piketty and Clark say that politics, not economics, will determine the future. However, the economy will certainly be a major focus of upcoming election debates in both countries. The real question is, will the electorates in the US and the UK stage a revolt? Will the minimum wage, unemployment, and income inequality take center stage? Will the Invisible Man become visible? Wealth vs Income Inequality  On the other end of the spectrum, extreme wealth is highly visible. Oxfam's Wealth, Having It All and Wanting More puts the wealth of the world's richest eighty people into perspective:The wealth of these 80 individuals is now the same as that owned by the bottom 50% of the global population, such that 3.5 billion people share between them the same amount of wealth as that of these extremely wealthy 80 people.What policies can counter this? Oxfam has an ambitious list, which includes the obvious along with the impossible. ""Hard Times"" offers a simpler prescription: 'Jobs, fairer shares, and a decent safety net'. Without a doubt, it all begins with jobs that produce both income and a social dividend. This is true globally.Case in point: does anyone believe that the Middle East can become peaceful when 80 percent of young men there are unemployed? Or that Spain can prosper with a 50 percent youth unemployment rate? Should we be surprised at the sociology of Ferguson and the conflict between citizens and the police in the US in areas of high unemployment? Multiple system failures have combined with a drastic shift in the job market due to outsourcing, technology, and overall productivity gains to create a large group of people who will never be able to catch up. In terms of a safety net, a recent success -- the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has resulted in an impressive jump in health care coverage, especially for young people. But the ACA was hugely expensive politically to implement, and entitlements cannot replace jobs.The Hourglass EconomyLooking deeply at inequality with one very sharp lens can shed light on the worldwide challenge. ""Hard Times"" is focused on the English-speaking world, particularly the US and the UK. The inescapable conclusion for me after reading this book is that if rich developed countries can get things this wrong, where does hope lie for the developing world?It is worth taking a look at the Charles Dickens novel of the same title. ""Hard Times"" was a counterargument to utilitarianism, the idea that a good society was one that produced the greatest happiness for the largest number of people. It was also a call to humanism, a view that happiness and a good life could not be based upon a mathematical average. Clark's book says that an existing trend towards inequality strengthened as a result of the Great Recession. But the underlying logic of what true equality means is the same. Even if overall economic conditions have improved on an average basis, as they have today, that is far from saying that suffering has been eliminated. Clark's argument, as highlighted in the subtitle of his book, The Divisive Toll of The Economic Slump is that in fact the misery has intensified even if the world as a whole has grown wealthier. More jobs have been created, but they don't pay as well. Growth has been restarted, but the wealthy are the primary beneficiaries as their assets increase in value.So how does the Great Recession differ from the Great Depression?

Thomas Piketty's book ""Capital"" explores the idea that wealth is now more concentrated than income. According to the U.S. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the top 3 percent of Americans earn 31 percent of income, but they also own 54 percent of all assets. Wealth gains have far outstripped income gains.""Hard Times"" by Tom Clark and Anthony Heath tells the other side of the story -- income inequality. It confirms what most of us already sense, that happy times are here again for some, while others -- and in fact most others -- continue to struggle in the aftermath of the 2008 Financial Crisis. It describes how desperate life has become for the working poor in the US and the UK. As the authors pessimistically conclude about their subjects, 'it is outright impossible to offer them any reassurance about when their hard times will end.' The data they serve up is as devastating as the personal interviews that make their conclusions inescapable.Both Piketty and Clark say that politics, not economics, will determine the future. However, the economy will certainly be a major focus of upcoming election debates in both countries. The real question is, will the electorates in the US and the UK stage a revolt? Will the minimum wage, unemployment, and income inequality take center stage? Will the Invisible Man become visible? Wealth vs Income Inequality  On the other end of the spectrum, extreme wealth is highly visible. Oxfam's Wealth, Having It All and Wanting More puts the wealth of the world's richest eighty people into perspective:The wealth of these 80 individuals is now the same as that owned by the bottom 50% of the global population, such that 3.5 billion people share between them the same amount of wealth as that of these extremely wealthy 80 people.What policies can counter this? Oxfam has an ambitious list, which includes the obvious along with the impossible. ""Hard Times"" offers a simpler prescription: 'Jobs, fairer shares, and a decent safety net'. Without a doubt, it all begins with jobs that produce both income and a social dividend. This is true globally.Case in point: does anyone believe that the Middle East can become peaceful when 80 percent of young men there are unemployed? Or that Spain can prosper with a 50 percent youth unemployment rate? Should we be surprised at the sociology of Ferguson and the conflict between citizens and the police in the US in areas of high unemployment? Multiple system failures have combined with a drastic shift in the job market due to outsourcing, technology, and overall productivity gains to create a large group of people who will never be able to catch up. In terms of a safety net, a recent success -- the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has resulted in an impressive jump in health care coverage, especially for young people. But the ACA was hugely expensive politically to implement, and entitlements cannot replace jobs.The Hourglass EconomyLooking deeply at inequality with one very sharp lens can shed light on the worldwide challenge. ""Hard Times"" is focused on the English-speaking world, particularly the US and the UK. The inescapable conclusion for me after reading this book is that if rich developed countries can get things this wrong, where does hope lie for the developing world?It is worth taking a look at the Charles Dickens novel of the same title. ""Hard Times"" was a counterargument to utilitarianism, the idea that a good society was one that produced the greatest happiness for the largest number of people. It was also a call to humanism, a view that happiness and a good life could not be based upon a mathematical average. Clark's book says that an existing trend towards inequality strengthened as a result of the Great Recession. But the underlying logic of what true equality means is the same. Even if overall economic conditions have improved on an average basis, as they have today, that is far from saying that suffering has been eliminated. Clark's argument, as highlighted in the subtitle of his book, The Divisive Toll of The Economic Slump is that in fact the misery has intensified even if the world as a whole has grown wealthier. More jobs have been created, but they don't pay as well. Growth has been restarted, but the wealthy are the primary beneficiaries as their assets increase in value.So how does the Great Recession differ from the Great Depression? During the Depression, the poor suffered the most. But in what Clark calls our new hourglass economy, the middle class, not just low wage earners, has perhaps been damaged most of all, losing their formerly comfortable lives.For poor people to be left behind as average incomes rise is nothing new in the Anglo-Saxon economies; but--in Britain at least--for stagnation to have set in the middle like this, and at the height of a so-called boom, is something disturbing and different.

The communities, losing tax dollars, are canceling needed road work. The companies are talking about the similarities between now and the 1990s when half of the nation’s steel firms disappeared. Members of the Congressional Steel Caucus are worrying about the effect on national security if America can’t make its own steel for guns and tanks.Virtually everyone who testified last week at a Congressional hearing on the state of steel fingered bad trade as the culprit in the current collapse. Lawmakers, steel company executives, industry group leaders and a vice president of the United Steelworkers (USW) union all agreed on this. Foreign firms, particularly those operating in non-capitalist countries, are violating international trade regulations. Those rules also require American companies, communities and workers to forfeit a pound of flesh before trade enforcement can occur. They’re failing America.Photo of Save Our Steel Jobs rally in Pittsburgh in May 2014 by Chelsey EngelJust seven days into 2015, U.S. Steel said it would lay off 636 workers at its Lorain, Ohio, tubular plant. Before January’s end, the company announced it would furlough 2,000 workers at three locations in Alabama and Texas. In February, U.S. Steel disclosed plans to close its Gary, Ind., coke plant, displacing 300 workers. Early in March, U.S. Steel revealed the loss of another 83 jobs at its Gary Works, for a total of 780 there this year, as well as 412 at one of its iron-ore operations in Minnesota. Later in March, the company said it would indefinitely shut down its Granite City, Ill., mill and lay off 2,080 workers. It’s relentless. And that’s just U.S. Steel. Other U.S. producers furloughed workers too.Steel executives told lawmakers last week that the job cuts are a direct result of foreign companies dumping steel in the U.S. market. “American steel companies are being irreparably harmed by illegal trade practices,” U.S. Steel CEO Mario Longhi said.China produced as much steel last year as the rest of the world combined. It continued doing so despite dwindling demand within China as both its real estate development and economy cooled.China sends the excess steel overseas. Last year, China exported more steel than any country this century. And the numbers are still rising. China’s steel exports rose 63 percent in January from a year earlier.The USW and U.S. producers have won trade case after trade case involving Chinese-made steel because it violates international regulations forbidding government subsidization of exported products. Those improper subsidies lower the price. When trade regulators determine that Chinese producers violated international rules and place tariffs on a particular steel product increasing its price, China ships a different one. In addition, though it’s not considered in trade cases, China manipulates the value of its currency so that its exports are cheaper.At the Congressional hearing last week, John Ferriola, CEO of Nucor, a non-union steel company, described the situation this way:  “Blatant foreign government support of their steel industries has resulted in a glut of global steel production. A brazen disregard for international trade rules has led to the dumping of steel products in our market. As a result, one in three tons of steel sold in the U.S. today is produced abroad by less efficient, less safe, and less environmentally friendly countries. Our government must take a much tougher line with countries that break the law.”This is not whining from uncompetitive producers. The European Union, Korea, Australia, even low-labor-cost India, are investigating whether China is dumping steel in their countries in ways that violate international law.U.S. Steel’s Longhi talked about the consequences for national security if nothing is done. “We do not build a steel plant in an emergency,” such as war, he told lawmakers last week. Instead, he said, “we rely on it” to already exist and quickly fulfill national needs.He noted that during World War II, his company produced 90 percent of the steel used to make 21 million military helmets.“In a moment of exceptional need for the steel required to maintain its strength, America makes a local call,” he told the Congressmen. It doesn’t call China.Dumping means companies like U.S. Steel and Vallourec USA that have invested billions in modernizing and expanding their American mills face financial difficulty. The same is true of furloughed workers and their communities.Granite City Mayor Ed Hagnauer said that while the U.S. Steel plant in his town was shut down in 2008, ten times as many residents sought help at food banks. Granite City business owners are concerned about U.S. Steel’s indefinite shut down beginning in May because mill jobs pay good, middle class wages that 2,080 laid off workers will not have to spend.The lost jobs also mean lower tax revenues for towns and school districts. In Lorain, Ohio, now hit by layoffs at Republic Steel and U.S. Steel, Mayor Chase Ritenauer said that to balance the budget he would have to consider scaling back city projects and leaving job vacancies open.For this to stop, USW Vice President Tom Conway told the Congressmen at the hearing, trade laws must be fixed. “I understand aggressive enforcement of trade laws, but aggressively enforcing a lousy law does not get you much,” he said.“The continual failure and weakening of our laws is killing us, and it is time to rewrite our laws,” he added.The laws should not require draconian damage before trade sanctions can be imposed, he said, and Congress must stop the swindle called currency manipulation.No new trade deals, such as the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), should be approved without these changes, he said. In addition, Congress certainly should not prohibit itself from amending proposed trade agreements by fast-tracking them, he said, because the price of bad trade is too high."

They know stress is a normal and expected part of lifeNo one gets a ""Get out of Stress Free"" card in this game.In fact, we need a healthy amount of nervous system activation to get through our days -- working and parenting and all the other important things we do require our energy and engagement. You know that list that ranks all the stressful life experiences that people can encounter? There are bad things on that list, like the loss of a job or the death of a loved one. But there are also good things on the list, like getting married, buying a house, and having kids.Change is constant, and change often creates stress.Non-stressed-out people know this. They know stress will show up in their lives, so they're less likely to be knocked down when it does.  2. They understand that what makes us stressed out is how we perceive the stressorStress researchers Richard Lazarus and Susan Folkman at UC-Berkeley have defined stress as, ""a particular relationship between the person and the environment that is appraised by the person as taxing or exceeding his or her resources and endangering his or her well-being"" (from Jon Kabat-Zinn's Full Catastrophe Living).This definition of stress clearly indicates that stress is about our relationship to events and our perceptions of them. If you view a particular event as a threat (to your physical, emotional, or social well-being), then you'll likely experience it as stressful. If you choose to reframe the event, perhaps as an opportunity, then it may not be stressful at all.Non-stressed-out people know to take a deep breath, and assess the situation. They try to see it like a camera would, noticing what is actually happening, instead of rashly interpreting the event from their limited perspective. And in that short period of time, a whole world of options open up.3. They know when they are stressedHas this ever happened to you? You get home from work, make dinner, start getting the kids ready for bed... and then a small infraction by your child sets off a wildly disproportionate reaction from you.You were probably stressed out all day, and didn't even know it. We often spend our days in a state of low-grade fight-or-flight arousal, and then even the slightest stressor can set us off.Non-stressed-out people are in tune with their bodies. They notice the tense shoulders, the furrowed brow, the tightening chest, or whatever their stress signals are, and then act (see below) to defuse the stress energy before it explodes.4. They know they have power and choiceResilient people have a sense of efficacy. They know they have a choice in how they respond. Jon Kabat-Zinn writes, ""They view life as a challenge... and assume an active role in [it].""They understand the serenity prayer -- they know they can change the things they control, and they choose to live in wise relationship with the things they cannot.5. They have a sense of meaningNon-stressed-out people know the why behind their actions. They act with purpose and intention. Even the most mundane task can have meaning -- for example, cleaning our home is a way of honoring our surroundings.And when things go wrong, Non-stressed-out people find meaning in that, too.""What we think are our failures are not failures. They are gifts -- revealing extremely useful information -- if we are open to being mindful of everything that unfolds in our lives, in a day, or in a moment, and putting it all to good use as grist for the mill."" (Jon Kabat-Zinn)What Non-Stressed-Out People Do  1. They practice mindfulnessWith mindfulness, we learn to pause. We learn to see things as they actually are. We learn to drop the story, which only exacerbates the stress, and choose wise action.The practice of mindfulness is what allows us to notice and experience the buildup of stress, instead of suppressing it. When we ignore and internalize stress, it never gets released.Think of the zebra in the wild, who gets startled by a lion, and bolts away in a flight response. Once he's safe, the stress has been released from his body, and he calms down and takes a nap. He doesn't worry about what might have happened had his offspring had been eaten, or agonize over when the lion will return. (See Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers).If we ignore our stress, it builds up and we never return to a calm baseline. Mindfulness gives us a basic awareness of our stress. And then we can develop healthy restorative practices.""Under duress we don't rise to our expectations, we fall to our level of training."" -- Bruce LeeSo resilient people train.2. They exerciseExercise releases feel-good hormones and a bunch of other chemicals that promote resilience and well-being.3. They get adequate sleepHow clear-headed are you without good sleep? It probably goes without saying that we're much more likely to resort to habitual reactions when we're tired. Jon Kabat-Zinn says that resilient people build up a ""bank account"" that they can draw upon during tough times. Sleep, exercise, healthy food, and meditation are the most important deposits we can make!4. They make time for relationships and intimacyWe are social beings. Simply sharing our frustrations and talking about what's bothering us can relieve a great deal of our stress.5. They put themselves in timeoutNon-stressed-out people make time for themselves. They nurture the hobbies that fulfill them and give their minds a break from day-to-day busy-ness. They go for a walk or read a good book or savor a delicious meal. They know thatself-care is not selfish.They do the things that feed their bodies, hearts, and minds. Janice Marturano, in Finding the Space to Lead, writes, ""Such moments -- when we fully inhabit our bodies and our senses are at work on more than an internal storyline, checklist, or rehearsed conversation -- are what give life true meaning.""*****Stress may be a given, but being stressed out doesn't have to be!This post first appeared on Sarah's blog Left Brain Buddha.

9,BUSINESS,Lessons for Entrepreneurs From Lee Kuan Yew,"Shastri Purushotma, ContributorBaha'i writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lessons-for-entrepreneurs_1_b_6961416.html,"While there is much to learn from this remarkable statesman and the transformative experience of Singapore that could fill many volumes, I would like to focus in the short space here on a few key lessons that entrepreneurs and companies can take from the founding and rapid growth of Singapore.",2015-03-30,2015-03-28-1427563037-3262485-SingaporeAirlines.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-28-1427563037-3262485-SingaporeAirlines-thumb.jpg,"President Obama described Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew as ""a true giant of history who will be remembered for generations to come as the father of modern Singapore and as one the great strategists of Asian affairs."" While there is much to learn from this remarkable statesman and the transformative experience of Singapore that could fill many volumes, I would like to focus in the short space here on a few key lessons that entrepreneurs and companies can take from the founding and rapid growth of Singapore:(Photo: Corbis Images)1. Get the Basics RightIn a superb interview with Nathan Gardels, Minister Mentor Lee surprisingly (or not surprisingly for anyone who has lived in Singapore) cited ""air conditioning"", in addition to multicultural tolerance, as being critical to Singapore's rise. He described air conditioning as ""perhaps one of the signal inventions of history."" In addition to air conditioning, it is interesting to reflect on the intense focus Singapore has placed on ensuring that basics are met: public safety, cleanliness, affordable (and delicious) food, transportation, and access to at least basic housing. The parallel lesson for companies is never to lose sight of the fundamentals of operating a business: do all employees have their basic needs met? Is efficient infrastructure in place? Is your company's website and social media presence at least respectable, if not appealing? Investing in good infrastructure is seemingly obvious, but damaging to the growth of your organization if neglected.2. The Power of Service and ReputationLong before the days of Yelp, Lee Kuan Yew knew the power of a delighted customer and the corresponding effect this would have on reputation. Singapore Airlines was one example of how the relentless focus on customer experience could become a powerful differentiator in an otherwise seemingly generic marketplace. I remember flying on both Singapore Airlines and Aeroflot (at the end of the Soviet Era) and literally laughing at the difference - both flew you from point A to B, but while one began each flight with hot face towels, the other welcomed you with buzzing flies to share your seat space. Customer satisfaction has a powerful network compounding effect that is all the more pronounced in the age of social media: one happy customer tells another, and with the passage of time the snowball's momentum is startling. So ask yourself, is your company providing the equivalent of hot face towels, appetizing food and hundreds of movie channels to your customers, or are you forcing them to share their seats with unwelcome frequent fly-ers?3. The Power of EducationThe ability to continuously discover and share knowledge on a systematic social scale may be one of the features that distinguish human beings from animals. At the national level, two starkly contrasting recent examples speak volumes about the power of education. One is the case of Singapore, where government policy ensured its population received the highest levels of education possible, and enabled a small city-state with no natural resources to achieve one of the highest levels of GDP per person in the world. On the contrary, in Iran, there is a concerted effort by the government to ensure that entire segments of the population are deliberately blocked from access to higher education: women are banned from studying in many fields, and Baha'is (the largest religious minority) are excluded entirely from access to higher education and imprisoned for even trying to informally educate, in their own living rooms, students banned from university. Yet in its own odd way, the fact that the government of Iran goes to such lengths to take such deplorable actions is also demonstrative of the power of education, especially in todays knowledge-based, connected world. If there is such power in education at the national level, there must also be parallels for companies. One thought is to ensure that not just your staff (which is obvious), but all stakeholders: customers, partners, and investors / board members, have ways to be continuously educated about the latest advances in your industry, and what your company is learning. It's worth thinking through how to optimize knowledge flows in the ecosystems in which your company operates. Recent trends in customer support processes are just one example: by continuously educating your customers and using new social media tools, these same empowered and knowledgeable customers can then help educate other customers, powerfully extending the reach and effectiveness of your company's support system.4. The Power of a United Vision As mentioned earlier, besides air conditioning, Lee Kuan Yew cited harmonious multiculturalism as Singapore's key to success. It is the same idea as the motto of another relatively young nation that has achieved quite a lot since it's founding on July 4, 1776: E Pluribus Unum. After race riots at the time of independence, Singapore took quite a number of practical steps to achieve this multicultural society. As an example: from the earliest age, children in schools are required to learn two languages - English as a common language for all, as well as one of three ""mother tongues"" of the most predominant ethnic backgrounds in Singapore. In addition, the religious and cultural holy days of all the races are treated as national public holidays. In companies too, the challenge of maintaining a common vision between different departments is ongoing and vital. Just as Singapore worked out ways to walk the path of E Pluribus Unum with practical feet, companies such as HGST and Reebok are discovering the unexpected benefits of such activities as mid-day Crossfit workouts, where barriers between departments and among executives and frontline workers are obliterated in common pools of sweat and new bonds of cross-departmental collaboration are formed. Clearly, the list of lessons we can learn from the experience of Lee Kuan Yew's transformation of Singapore could go on for a long time. I can only hope in the short space here to share a few quick reflections that hopefully are helpful and stimulate further thought. What do you think? Have you ever lived in or visited Singapore, and if so what reflections do you have from that experience? I would like to conclude with the thought that at this crossroads of Singapore's history, its people can take pride and consolation in the fact that while the earthly life of a great statesman has come to an end, the principles that he exemplified are timeless, and will if reflected on and applied continue to guide the Lion City as an outstanding contributor to an increasingly interconnected world civilization."

The orchestra rose to their feet as the last of their bold notes danced off the curved walls and undulated ceiling of the concert hall. ""Ladies and gentlemen!"" exclaimed Stuart Chafetz with a showman's bravado. His smile was a wide, warm beam lighting a friendly face. ""Ladies and gentlemen, I proudly present to you, your hometown orchestra!"" The conductor's hand was outstretched to include all of those now standing behind him. Each holding their instrument, they assembled every age and race. ""Your hometown orchestra, the Hawai'i Symphony Orchestra!"" The applause was a loud, fast roar, a surprise that turned me around. A wide sea of faces was rising, standing. Shiny eyes, bright smiles and flashing hands reflected the lights from the stage. Against the back wall stood those who could not get a seat to the sold-out performance. The balcony, swollen, hovered above, alive with motion. It was glorious. It was unanimous. In the audience, two governors, an Italian prince and his princess, actor Jim Nabors and a delegation of consul generals also rose with applause. So did John Dean, the president of Central Pacific Bank, whose invocation before the show stressed the community of the symphony. In front of me, an elderly spry man, whose suit, shirt and shoes were splattered with every mad color, yelled, ""Bravo! Bravo!"" In the seat next to mine, a raven-haired matron in reserved black was applauding with wild verve, a release from the tension she had harbored during the finale. I could feel her arm, taunt with fear, quivering next to mine. On stage, two gold men, almost naked, moved slowly, with fierce deliberation. Their faces were grim, reflecting their physical tension. Joined by hard hands and arms of muscle and legs forced against gravity, the two acrobats pushed their bodies into a moving sculpture of physics that defied the belief of one's own eyes. The matron next to me was tense, shaking erratically. She wiggled higher against the back of her seat. The orchestra was a thunder. The grim majesty of Finlandia by Jean Sibelius (1899) changed the rhythm of every heartbeat in the room. Every beat in the music was a reflection of movement in the dance of steel by the two giants on the stage. Jarek & Darek are strongmen, hand-balancing acrobats. Smooth as granite, almost twins, they have been performing together for twenty-five years, racing the pulse of their audiences. Tonight, they were the final act of a collaboration between the Hawai'i Symphony Orchestra and Cirque de la Symphonie, an international circus of high art and movement. Returning to human form, Jarek & Darek took to the stage and bowed deeply. The audience, and the raven-haired matron, applauded aggressively, a release of fear, dire expectation and time-stopping suspense. Soon to be celebrating its tenth year, the Athens, Georgia based troupe has been performing with the nation's finest symphonies. This night was Cirque de la Symphonie's first with the Hawai'i Symphony, an orchestra that has recently and ecstatically risen from the ashes of bankruptcy and reorganization. The troupe presents a circus for the symphony. ""It's all about the music,"" says Bill Allen, Executive Director of the cirque. Performances, on stage or flying high above, are choreographed to the symphonic score. ""The visuals provide a three dimensional effect for the concert goer, amplifying the concert experience for all patrons. People who have not previously been classical music followers suddenly appreciate their local symphony in an entirely new way."" Looking up is a symptom. Christine Van Loo and Alexander Streltsov were dancing sixty feet above the audience, tethered to the stage by gravity and flowing silk fabric. Like swans, they flew. Tchaikovsky's waltz from Swan Lake is given a greater grandeur when the birds can leave the pond.My guest nudged me in the ribs and whispered, ""A lot of my students are in the audience tonight."" Andrea Torres was looking up and beaming with admiration at Christine Van Loo. Light in the sky, aerialist Van Loo is weighted with awards, accolades and seven consecutive national gymnastic championships. Two nights ago, she hosted a special class at Samadhi Hawaii, the islands' foremost aerial academy. I was there to witness the awe-struck students. Torres, the elegant Samadhi founder, says, ""Christine generously reached out to us! The students are so grateful to learn from a seasoned professional, someone who has performed before so many audiences."" As one who prefers hip-hop to Hayden, I loved the most contemporary number. American composer John Williams wrote an incredible score for the Witches of Eastwick. His ""Devil's Dance"" came alive with a wicked performance by Andrey Moraru. His costume and angular long limbs referenced Disney's Jack Skellington from Nightmare Before Christmas. His white make-up and smeared red lipstick evoked Heath Ledger's ""The Joker."" All pop profundity aside, Moraru is an Eastern European circus-trained dancer and acrobat with a specialty in hand-balancing whose most recent claim to fame is a finalist on America's Got Talent. Now that's pop! His performance of great force and athletic agility was delivered with such humor and effortless grace, that the nervous matron seated next to me seemed to be enjoying herself. Andrey Moraru shared a flirtatious acrobatic dance with one of the shows most beguiling performers Aloysia Gavre. She is a saucy sprite. A wide, engaging smile outshines her flaming red hair. Her unconventional beauty and laughing eyes won my heart. A veteran of Cirque du Soleil and director of several contemporary troupes, Gavre is held earthbound by her own Los Angeles Cirque School. Her prowess as a choreographer is touted by the Executive Director of Cirque de la Symphonie. Bill Allen says, ""I send her a piece of music and she ingeniously integrates cirque artistry to provide a fine arts level of choreography."" Later in the show, Aloysia Gavre takes to the air with her specialty, aboard the aerial hoop. The sparkling threads throughout the show are two key performers. A mistress of grace and agility, Elena Tsarkova is a consummate performer. Her circus credits are international, extensive and impressive. She performs a beguiling dance of acrobatic contortion; its sensationalism is overwhelmed by its graciousness and beauty. With comic Vladimir Tsarkov, Elena Tsarkova presents a classic quick-change act that stupefied the audience. In the lobby after the show, I overheard gaggles of women trying to figure it out. This mime can juggle! An audience favorite, Vladimir Tsarkov brought humor to the evening and a welcome relief from the acts of suspense and derring-do. His odd duck character was an audience favorite. The fancy of aerial flight creates very serious safety and technical demands. High tension wires ground and support a metal truss from which performers hang and fly. A man wearing many hats, Alexander Streltsov also serves and protects the cirque as Technical Director. He works with each concert hall to install the equipment. Then he takes to the sky to give the equipment a test fly. Aerial artist Alexander Streltsov grew up in the circus, the scion of a circus family. His goals and passions are the fire that founded the Cirque de la Symphonie. His drive and skill have earned him a gold medal at the Festival Mondial Du Cirque De L'Avenir in Paris, the Olympics for acrobats. This night, in an airborne duet with Christine Van Loo, Streltsov became the envy of all circus audiences everywhere, the Flying Man. With graceful ease, the acrobat flew above the orchestra and out over the awe-struck audience. Icarus, Superman, the iconic flight touches us deeply and primitively every time. Across the country, symphonies, both large and small, endowed and struggling, are seeking new ways to attract an audience. A depressed economy has hampered disposable spending and charitable giving. The convenience of our hand held devices and wall-size screens have clouded the true joys of a live performance. The visuals of Cirque de la Symphonie allow us to cognitively see music and therefore appreciate the orchestra in an entirely new way. Each phrase and note is given an added and welcome distinction. In truth, this circus troupe is not the headline act but merely an ocular lens that compliments and emotionally heightens the musical score. The Hawai'i Symphony Orchestra remains the star of the show.This year marks the 50th Anniversary of the Blaisdell Concert Hall, constructed to present the state's orchestra that was founded in 1900. Rising high like a phoenix, the newly conceived Hawai'i Symphony Orchestra is building strong and fast upon a solid new foundation. ""The enduring dedication of these talented musicians of the Hawai'i Symphony is awe inspiring!"" says conductor Stuart Chafetz, ""It is abundantly clear that musical excellence has been, and will always be, a priority! Onward and upward!!!""Gordy Grundy is an O'ahu based artist and arts writer. His visual and literary work can be found at www.GordyGrundy.com"

I applaud Irish-based Ryanair for offering such a wide selection of budget-friendly flights to destinations throughout Europe and Africa (yes, you can take RyanAir to Morocco) and wish we had a similar airline in America. However, there are a few things you should know, before booking that seemingly ""too good to be true"" 20 euro round-trip ticket, that are guaranteed to make your Ryanair experience significantly more enjoyable (or tolerable, depending on the situation).  1. Map out your trip ahead ... way ahead!Ryanair notoriously flies out of the most obscure airports in every city, so make sure that time management remains a priority when finalizing the details regarding your departing flight. While public transportation (bus, metro, tram) is usually the most economical option when traveling to the airport, sometimes splitting a cab, regardless of price, with your fellow study-abroaders might be the best option. Not only are Ryanair flights usually at the crack of dawn, but the airport will more than likely be located off the beaten path. After all what is more important, saving a few euros attempting to take public transportation or actually making the unbelievably cheap flight that you managed to book?2. Hand luggage only.Always remember to bring hand luggage only -- ""hand luggage"" meaning a carry-on bag, which for students usually happens to be an oversized (and almost too large to fit in the luggage sizer) backpack. If you don't, Ryanair will not think twice about charging you an arm and a leg! Ryanair is very strict on their carry-on policy, and everything must fit in one bag in order for you to not get charged extra; ladies you cannot even bring a cross-body bag in addition to your one carry-on, unless it fits inside your carry-on, or you are able to hide it underneath your coat without getting caught. If backpacks aren't really your thing, you will see many stores in whatever city you're studying in that offer ""Ryanair Approved"" roller boards, but why waste the money when you can just stuff the backpack that you probably brought with you from home?3. Wear as much clothing when traveling as possible.Wearing three shirts, two jackets, two scarves and your clunky boots may sound like a lot, but when push comes to shove, it is better than paying that additional money for an over-sized bag. Sure, you may feel like you're taking a trip to the Arctic with all those layers on, but I promise you won't be the only one doing it! Remember everyone is flying Ryanair for the same reason... it's cheap -- no one is trying to spend any more money than they absolutely need to!4. If you have to take a bus from the gate to your plane, try stand as close to the doors as possible.Most Ryanair flights don't board and deplane directly at the gate since it's cheaper to do it on the tarmac, so more often than not you'll have to take a bus to your plane. There are no seat assignments on Ryanair (unless you pay for it) and whether or not you get a coveted window or aisle seat is all up to how fast you can run... no, but seriously! So in order to have the best chance at a prime seat, make sure you stand as close to the bus doors as possible so you can have a head start on all the other passengers once everyone starts running to the plane (unless of course you are an Olympic-level sprinter, then don't even sweat it).5. Don't plan on having leg room.Ryanair truly puts the ""ultra"" in ultra low cost airline (yes, those are the exact words from the website) because I've never seen an airplane with so many rows of seats! I'm convinced that in order to maximize the number of available seats and profit, Ryanair minimizes the amount of space in between each row of seats, which means significantly less leg room.Now, I suppose it could have been that I had on too many layers of clothes or that my overstuffed backpack took up too much room under the seat, but nonetheless, nine times out of ten, I was not exactly comfortable. However, at the end of the day what do you really expect when you pay next to nothing for a ticket?6. Bring snacks.Ryanair is no different from most American airlines; they charge a ridiculous price for food, too! It's always better to be prepared than hungry, so just bring something with you.7. Ryanair prides itself on being on time, but don't always count on it.Sure the Ryanair website states that around 90 percent of their flights reach their respective destination on time, but just like all airlines, sometimes things don't go according to plan. However, whenever your Ryanair flight is on time, make sure you're mentally prepared to be awoken to the blaring sound of the William Tell Overture (yes, the horse racing music) and boisterous applause upon landing. As if it wasn't 7:00 in the morning and you weren't sitting inside an airplane with an all lemon yellow interior right? It's really not that bad once you get used to it, but your first time is definitely a shocker!To this day I remain thankful to the study abroad student I happened to cross paths with in the security line in Rome who was kind enough to share with me the tips of the trade regarding travel on Ryanair. While Ryanair will always be Ryanair (trust me once you experience it, you will know exactly what I'm talking about) I promise you will come to know and love Ryanair (quirks and all) during your time abroad!

And by ""over it,"" I mean you're over just about every aspect of childhood being hijacked by commercialism and marketing. Halloween merchandise starts appearing in August, Christmas decorations arrive soon thereafter and even birthday parties have gotten insane with the idea that stuff, stuff and more stuff is the norm. Well, thank God Easter is still safe. I mean, it's a holy day. It's kinda, like, sacred. It's special, and yet simple. It's an uncomplicated spring day, with kids skipping around the backyard looking for eggs, then maybe a drive to Grandma's house to eat a spiral sliced ham and eagerly bite the head of that chocolate bunny behind the clear cellophane. Right? WRONG. Easter, like every other holiday, celebration and manageable childhood party, has been hijacked. Taken over by aisles and aisles of things. Big things. Little things. Shiny things. Wireless things. Now, it's not enough to give the kids a little straw basket with jelly beans and cream-filled eggs. According to a TV commercial a large retail giant is currently airing, my kids should wake up on Easter morning to brand new bikes. B-I-K-E-S. And iPads. And baskets overflowing with Lego sets, dolls and DVDs. What the marshmallow peep is that all about? I cannot be alone in thinking all of us moms are overwhelmed enough. Are feeling 'guilty' enough. Are feeling 'less than' enough. Are chasing a picture of holiday perfection that for the average family is just unreachable. And then the guilt with it? Don't even get me started. Not gonna go there. How about we just do Easter like how we were brought up doing it? What is so wrong with that? My parents put nickels, dimes and quarters in plastic eggs and hid them around the house. Finding and then snapping open an egg with three quarters in it was the biggest thrill. And if you got the egg with the one dollar bill in it? Score! As little girls, we wore matching dresses, bonnets and gloves and went to church and stayed after in the hall to eat glazed donuts and drink OJ out of tiny cups. After, we went through our pink (un-monogrammed, GASP!) fake straw baskets, digging under the lime-colored Easter grass looking for chocolate coins, jelly beans and if we were lucky, a chocolate bunny and maybe a plastic bracelet or necklace we could wear for the day. We would head to grandma's house, where we would swim all day with our cousins, between shoving candy in our mouths and waiting on the huge dinner she was preparing. At day's end we were exhausted and content, having had a taste of what our laid-back summer would be like. Our parents did nothing over-the-top special. There were no Pinterest-perfect crafts or pricey gifts. But yet, I can recall a day that took place over 30 years ago with perfect clarity. Easter Day involved family, not things. It was about being together for brunch, not getting on new bikes. And somehow, we felt loved and special without the excess. What a concept. This Easter, I will not buy into the ""buy everything"" culture. We will do our own simple thing -- hide some eggs, open some candy, go to mass. We will visit Nana, have dinner together and let the kids play with their cousins. And we will leave the TV off, because I'm sure there is a car company airing a commercial where the Easter Bunny leaves a $65K luxury vehicle topped with marshmallow peeps in the driveway Easter morning.

But he is also a part of a very dysfunctional, incompetent and corrupt machine ill-suited for producing the reforms he promised in Washington.",2015-03-30,"NEW YORK, NY - MARCH 26: Ashraf Ghani, President of Afghanistan, speaks at the Council On Foreign Relations on March 26, 2015 in New York City. President Ghani has been touring the United States this week, he comes to New York on the heels of meeting with President Obama in Washington D.C. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc148622400003300e48295.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As was expected the Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, pushed the reset button putting the Afghan U.S. relationship on a different and much better path. This was a welcome relief both in Washington and Kabul. The relations between the two countries had precipitously deteriorated during the previous regime due to Hamid Karzai's belligerent posture and language towards the U.S., culminating in his refusal to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA). For the first time an Afghan President went out of his way to publicly acknowledge the United States sacrifices in terms of blood and treasure. In many forums, President Ghani rightfully thanked the American service women, men, and civilian personnel who served in Afghanistan and the taxpayers who have footed the bill for Afghanistan's stability and reconstruction since 2001.In addition to expressing gratitude for the U.S. efforts in the White House and at the joint session of Congress, Mr. Ghani also talked at length about the problems plaguing Afghanistan and a pledge to solve them. In return, President Obama agreed to slow down the pace of American troop reduction in Afghanistan. The U.S. will maintain the current force level of about 10,000 through the end of 2015. Additionally John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, announced a much needed aid package valued at $800,000 called the ""New Development Partnership."" The development partnership is significant because it is linked to the progress of the reforms that Mr. Ghani enumerated. These reforms include the eradication of corruption, the establishment of the rule of law and justice and women's rights among others. The Washington establishment who had grown wary and tired of Karzai's acrimony was elated by what they heard from Mr. Ghani. Consequently, there is a renewed optimism that the new Afghan President and his Government of National Unity (GNU) will deliver on the promises made.While President Ghani's démarche is a necessary and good first step, given the political climate and the track record of how slowly the GNU has moved in the past six months in office with regard to institution building and other issues, we need to be cautious.To begin with, the cabinet of the GNU is not yet complete due to lingering political disagreements despite the brave face Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah, the Chief Executive, put on in Washington. The Afghan President submitted a list of 16 for the vacant cabinet posts before his departure for the US. But the Afghan Parliament has not yet acted on it. According to sources in Afghanistan, the tug of war for power between the two former presidential rivals is continuing. The Afghan constitution does not define a role for a chief executive post. Furthermore, Rashid Dostum, a powerful warlord from the north and the Afghan First Vice President, is unhappy because he feels marginalized by both Ghani and Abdullah. His support during the presidential elections was crucial for Ghani's triumph against Abdullah.The former Afghan President, Hamid Karzai, blamed the U.S. for ills plaguing Afghanistan. But in a sharp departure from his predecessor, Mr. Ghani has recognized and acknowledged the endemic corruption within the government. Understanding the problem is the first step to solving it, but eliminating corruption is a tall order in Afghanistan. To eradicate corruption, Mr. Ghani needs to clean house first. His entire administration has been divided between former warlords such as Dostum and even Abdullah from the Northern Alliance, etc. and their surrogates who feel entitled to owning a piece of the government in Kabul and the provinces. These people, responsible for the culture of impunity and corruption will not go away voluntarily. They are also a part of the GNU in a tenuous political alliance and to sideline them will probably result in the collapse of the government.Tackling corruption cannot be accomplished in the absence of a robust rule of law which is almost nonexistent in Afghanistan. The Taliban have very successfully exploited this vacuum to extend their reach in many areas by setting up their own courts. The U.S. has spent millions of dollars in the past several years promoting the rule of law to no avail due to corrupt Afghan officials. Mr. Ghani in the past had referred to Mr. Dostum, now his First Vice President, as a ""known killer."" Dostum has been accused of committing mass murder and other excesses in the north. How a ""known killer"" can be trusted to work for the rule of law is a burning question in the minds of many Afghans.Mr. Ghani boasted about appointing four women to cabinet posts which is commendable for putting women's rights on the agenda. But as Mr. Ghani was embarking on his trip to Washington last week, a mob lynched a 27 year old woman, Farkhunda, in plain daylight in the center of Kabul while police watched. Worst, the Interior Ministry spokesman said that her lynching was justified as she had insulted Islam. Although the government has vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice, this is not an isolated case and it requires a fundamental societal change which could take many decades.President Ghani is an educated and competent man and as such is a welcome face in the leadership of Afghanistan. But he is also a part of a very dysfunctional, incompetent and corrupt machine ill-suited for producing the reforms he promised in Washington."
15,POLITICS,The ALEC-Backed War on Local Democracy,"Mary Bottari, ContributorThe Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC Exposed",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-alec-backed-war-on-lo_b_6961142.html,"Corporate interests that spend hundreds of millions a year on state and federal lobbying have grown accustomed to getting what they want at the federal and state levels, but it is much harder to assert corporate control over America's 22,553 municipal and county governments.",2015-03-30,2015-03-28-1427556023-6867707-Stop_Meddling_City_Hall600x350px.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-28-1427556023-6867707-Stop_Meddling_City_Hall600x350px-thumb.jpg,"Coauthored by Brendan FischerAfter the town of Denton, Texas passed a ballot initiative banning fracking in November 2014, the oil and gas industry reacted with outrage and swiftly filed suit. Politicians in the state capitol responded with a fusillade of bills to preempt local authority over public health and safety and to subject local ballot initiatives to pre-approval by the state attorney general. There was even a bill to end local home rule altogether.The tiny town of Denton was not alone. From New Jersey to Oregon, on topics as diverse as minimum wage, paid sick leave, community broadband, e-cigarettes, and GMOs, state politicians are stepping up their efforts to destroy a bedrock principle of U.S. governance -- the right of municipal and county authorities to legally and appropriately enact and strengthen laws that reflect local needs and priorities.Corporate interests that spend hundreds of millions a year on state and federal lobbying have grown accustomed to getting what they want at the federal and state levels, but it is much harder to assert corporate control over America's 22,553 municipal and county governments.Preemption is part of a one-two punch corporations and politicians are using to block the advance of progressive policies at the local level, where these policies are most likely to be enacted. Just as they have done in Texas, industries and trade associations are also filing a barrage of lawsuits against local governments to frighten off other localities considering the same option. For example in Trenton, New Jersey, six trade associations -- the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce, New Jersey Food Council, New Jersey Restaurant Association, New Jersey Retail Merchants Association, and the state branch of the National Federation of Independent Business -- have gone to court to challenge the results of the November 2014 earned sick days ballot measure. A preemption bill is also looming.A diversity of industries are pursuing this aggressive strategy against grassroots democracy, but what may be surprising to some is that a group dedicated to individual liberty and ""limited government,"" which in 2010 authored a model bill recommending that local governments block and preempt stricter state and federal laws, is at the center of it all.Dual-Track Strategy Outlined at ALEC: Preemption and LitigationWhen cities like Seattle and Los Angeles took action to ""raise the wage"" in 2014, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) jumped into action. The Guardian reported that ALEC and its local government offshoot the American City County Exchange (ACCE) ""launched an aggressive dual-track mission that combines legislation and litigation in what ALEC calls a 'new battleground' over worker compensation.""At an ACCE meeting in December 2014, Cara Sullivan, who heads ALEC's Commerce, Insurance and Economic Development Task Force, explained: ""Perhaps the biggest threat comes from the local level."" Her solution? ""One solution that ALEC has passed is state legislation that preempts the polities from within the state from raising the minimum wage higher than the state level."" If this sounds like an strange talk to be giving a room full of city and county officials it is. And it gets stranger. Karen Moreau of the American Petroleum Institute's New York lobbying group also lectured the local officials on the danger of local control. ""It really hit me when I visited a Holocaust museum here a couple years ago in DC,"" Moreau said, ""and I wandered through the exhibit that describes the rise of Hitler and describes the rise of Fascism, and how Fascism actually takes hold, and it struck me because it was so similar to what I see happening in our small towns on issues like fracking.""What do grassroots advocates think of it all?""It is clear what is going on here. They want to stop our momentum. So they're expanding their toolkit to try to undo democracy and delay justice,"" said Ellen Bravo, Executive Director of Family Values @ Work, which advocates for paid sick days. ""They will fail, but in the meantime, they will make many families less economically secure and less healthy,"" Bravo added.We have seen this play before. It was drawn up decades ago by the tobacco industry with the help of ALEC legislators to fight local public health restrictions on smoking, tobacco and tobacco advertising to youth.As CMD has reported, ALEC's relationship with the tobacco industry started around 1979, when ALEC Executive Director Kathleen Teague wrote to the Tobacco Institute seeking financial support. In 1981, Tobacco Institute leaders attended ALEC's ""Exclusive White House and Cabinet Briefing"" with President Ronald Reagan and his cabinet.ALEC legislators worked with the industry on a strategy to get weak, permissive state smoking laws passed in order to prevent cities and towns in the state from enacting stricter smoking laws. One 1994 document shows the industry crowing over passing laws in 18 states to preempt localities from restricting smoking and their efforts to target 19 more states in 1995.By 2000, the industry had systematically and successfully enacted preemption legislation in the majority of states. The preemption not only put the lives and health of millions at risk, it sucked a lot of air out of burgeoning grassroots movement.""I think we all recognize that building genuine grassroots movements is one of the few ways left that 'We the People' can still protect our own health and safety, whether in the workplace or in the community,"" Mark Pertschuk from the watchdog group Grassroots Change explained to CMD. ""The most devastating thing about preemption is that it destroys grassroots citizen movements. This is why interfering with local control is such a high priority for the industries that support state (and federal) preemption.""Since the Reagan era, Phillip Morris/Altria and Reynolds Tobacco have continued to bankroll ALEC, vote as equals with legislators on ALEC ""model"" bills, serve at times on ALEC's governing board, and sponsor swank cigar parties at ALEC meetings. The ALEC library of bills directly benefits ALEC corporate members and includes measures to preempt: local wage ordinances, pesticide and GMO restrictions, public broadband, internet taxation, rent control, gun control, cell phone regulation, charter school authorization, and more.As ALEC observer Rep. Chris Taylor of Wisconsin reported, ALEC's guiding principle supporting big business ""turns the small-c conservative ideal of individual liberty and local control on its head.""Below, we detail recent preemption efforts in three categories.Minimum Wage ""Whack-a-Mole""The dual-pronged strategy of legislation and litigation is being used to thwart local minimum wage laws.ALEC has long pushed bills like the ""Living Wage Preemption Act,"" which aims to block local boosts to the federal minimum wage. Multiple states have adopted ALEC preemption, and last year in Oklahoma, Governor Mary Fallin (an ALEC alumnus) signed laws to prohibit cities from raising the minimum wage or enacting paid sick days. Another Oklahoma bill introduced this session would bar local laws requiring government contractors to pay a living wage.In Washington State, soon after Seattle's City Council took the historic step of enacting a $15 minimum wage, ALEC member the International Franchise Association sued in federal court to block the law's implementation, making the extraordinary claim that it ""discriminates"" against franchises like McDonald's in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. A District Court judge rejected the lawsuit, but it appears the IFA is planning to get its case before the U.S. Supreme Court: it has hired Paul Clement, a conservative super-lawyer who has argued 74 cases in front of the nation's highest court, including the challenge to the Affordable Care Act. In 2014 and 2015, wage preemption bills were introduced in the state which would kill the Seattle wage hike.In Los Angeles, another massive trade association, the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA), sued after the city raised the wage to $15.37 for hotel workers.Representatives of both IFA and the AHLA spoke at the December ACCE meeting about their plans to thwart local wage increases.Brian Crawford from AHLA ""urged conservatives to launch populist campaigns against wage increases by adopting the mantra that higher pay hurts ordinary Americans,"" reports The Guardian.Crawford compared the industry's battle against local wage laws to a game of Whack-a-Mole: ""We're trying to beat them down when they pop up.""Paid Sick Days PreemptionThe spread of paid sick day preemption laws is also tied to the corporate bill mill and benefits ALEC members like the National Restaurant Association. Eight states enacted paid sick day preemption after Wisconsin's anti-paid sick day measure was handed out at ALEC's 2011 meeting with a National Restaurant Association executive in attendance. In most states where a paid sick day preemption bill has been introduced, its sponsor has been an ALEC member.In Pennsylvania, where Philadelphia enacted a paid sick day law in February, ALEC member Sen. John Eichelberger amended a Senate preemption bill so it would apply retroactively. Eichelberger was simply offended that Philadelphia would exercise local control.""The amendment was introduced because we do not want to allow municipalities to try to sneak in changes to local ordinances before this bill is placed into law,"" he said. Rep. Seth Grove, an outspoken ALEC member and frequent sponsor of ALEC legislation, is also pushing a bill to block cities from enacting paid sick day laws. (Grove tried, but failed, to push similar measures in previous sessions.)In addition to pushing ALEC legislation, low-road employers have used the courts to block paid sick day ordinances.For example, after seven New Jersey cities enacted paid sick day initiatives last year, a group of big business lobbies (including affiliates of the National Restaurant Association and Chamber of Commerce) sued to block Trenton's law, throwing an array of tenuous legal arguments at the wall.""They couldn't defeat it at the ballot, so they filed a lawsuit to delay it, and perhaps intimidate other cities from trying,"" Bravo said.The lawsuit claims that, because New Jersey regulates temporary disability benefits and family leave, the state ""occupied the field"" of sick leave, prohibiting local governments from addressing the issue. The suit also claims that paid sick days amount to an increase in the minimum wage, since a worker is paid when they are home sick. But a worker who benefits from a paid sick day law doesn't get extra pay; it means they won't be docked pay when sick.""A minimum wage earner without paid sick days is actually earning a sub-minimum wage,"" Bravo explained.Fracking and Drilling ""Public Liberty"" Under ThreatHydraulic fracturing, or fracking -- a controversial method of gas and oil extraction that injects a high-pressure mixture of chemicals, water, and sand into underground wellbores -- has been linked to earthquakes and contaminated water resources. Dozens of cities in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania have banned the practice in recent years. Concerned citizens in Denton, Texas went up against the the state's most powerful special interest and approved a fracking moratorium as a ballot measure in November 2014.But the powerful oil and gas industry is fighting back against such efforts with a lawsuit and with help from ALEC legislators.In the Texas legislature, Rep. Phil King, who currently holds the highest position in ALEC as the group's national chair, sponsored a bill to preempt Denton and other cities from banning fracking or other oil and gas operations.In New Mexico, House Majority Leader (and ALEC member) Nate Gentry is pushing a bill to block local regulation of oil and gas drilling. His proposal would even preempt local zoning laws requiring oil and gas setbacks from schools or environmentally-sensitive zones. Legislative leaders in Oklahoma are also pushing a bill to preempt local fracking regulation.In Ohio in February, the state Supreme Court outlawed local bans in a lawsuit brought by industry. And in Texas and New Mexico, even more draconian bills have been introduced to penalize localities by withholding state funds if they dare to regulate fracking.Adam Briggle, Vice President of the Denton Drilling Awareness Group, says grassroots democracy is under threat. ""It's not just our air, water, health, safety, and our property values,"" said Adam Briggle, Vice President of the Denton Drilling Awareness Group.""It's not just our air, water, health, safety, and our property values,"" said Adam Briggle, Vice President of the Denton Drilling Awareness Group. ""But it's to exercise our right, what I would call public liberty, which is having a say that impacts you in important ways. And so we exercise what I consider grassroots local democracy.""Texas officials, backed by oil and gas campaign contributions, filed suit against Denton a day after the law took effect. Oil and gas interests also launched separate litigation.Permanent Preemption Peddled as ""Compromise""Although it has primarily been ""Big Government Republicans"" pushing state bills to block local control, in some cases Democrats have signed-on to the measures, often as part of a ""compromise"" for short-term gains and often at the behest of corporate interests. This is most common in states where statewide legislation, such as a minimum wage increase, is likely to pass. Rather than fighting a losing battle against the law, business lobbies promote the addition of preemption language as a way to stave off local efforts in the future.Last year, for example, Democratic-controlled Rhode Island raised the state minimum wage to $9, and also blocked local governments from enacting higher local wages. At the time, Providence was considering a $15 minimum wage, and the restaurant and hotel industries pushed the preemption measure to block the local law.Last month, Democrats in the Illinois Senate passed a bill to raise the statewide minimum wage to $11, but under pressure from the state National Restaurant Association affiliate, the measure also preempts a recently-enacted Chicago law that raises the wage to $13/hour.In New Mexico, the National Restaurant Association affiliate has stated that it will support a higher minimum wage, as long as it is coupled with preemption.Although coupling a minimum wage increase or other progressive legislation with preemption may bring a short-term benefit, it has long-term consequences in communities across a state.""Local communities must continue to stand up for the rights of those neglected by the state,"" said Briggle, ""or we will not only risk our health, but also lose the last venue in which we can take control of our own destiny."""
16,POLITICS,The ALEC-Backed War on Local Democracy,"Mary Bottari, ContributorThe Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC Exposed",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-alec-backed-war-on-lo_b_6961142.html,"Corporate interests that spend hundreds of millions a year on state and federal lobbying have grown accustomed to getting what they want at the federal and state levels, but it is much harder to assert corporate control over America's 22,553 municipal and county governments.",2015-03-30,2015-03-28-1427556250-6760563-leg_city_council_tx.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-28-1427556250-6760563-leg_city_council_tx-thumb.jpg,"Coauthored by Brendan FischerAfter the town of Denton, Texas passed a ballot initiative banning fracking in November 2014, the oil and gas industry reacted with outrage and swiftly filed suit. Politicians in the state capitol responded with a fusillade of bills to preempt local authority over public health and safety and to subject local ballot initiatives to pre-approval by the state attorney general. There was even a bill to end local home rule altogether.The tiny town of Denton was not alone. From New Jersey to Oregon, on topics as diverse as minimum wage, paid sick leave, community broadband, e-cigarettes, and GMOs, state politicians are stepping up their efforts to destroy a bedrock principle of U.S. governance -- the right of municipal and county authorities to legally and appropriately enact and strengthen laws that reflect local needs and priorities.Corporate interests that spend hundreds of millions a year on state and federal lobbying have grown accustomed to getting what they want at the federal and state levels, but it is much harder to assert corporate control over America's 22,553 municipal and county governments.Preemption is part of a one-two punch corporations and politicians are using to block the advance of progressive policies at the local level, where these policies are most likely to be enacted. Just as they have done in Texas, industries and trade associations are also filing a barrage of lawsuits against local governments to frighten off other localities considering the same option. For example in Trenton, New Jersey, six trade associations -- the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce, New Jersey Food Council, New Jersey Restaurant Association, New Jersey Retail Merchants Association, and the state branch of the National Federation of Independent Business -- have gone to court to challenge the results of the November 2014 earned sick days ballot measure. A preemption bill is also looming.A diversity of industries are pursuing this aggressive strategy against grassroots democracy, but what may be surprising to some is that a group dedicated to individual liberty and ""limited government,"" which in 2010 authored a model bill recommending that local governments block and preempt stricter state and federal laws, is at the center of it all.Dual-Track Strategy Outlined at ALEC: Preemption and LitigationWhen cities like Seattle and Los Angeles took action to ""raise the wage"" in 2014, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) jumped into action. The Guardian reported that ALEC and its local government offshoot the American City County Exchange (ACCE) ""launched an aggressive dual-track mission that combines legislation and litigation in what ALEC calls a 'new battleground' over worker compensation.""At an ACCE meeting in December 2014, Cara Sullivan, who heads ALEC's Commerce, Insurance and Economic Development Task Force, explained: ""Perhaps the biggest threat comes from the local level."" Her solution? ""One solution that ALEC has passed is state legislation that preempts the polities from within the state from raising the minimum wage higher than the state level."" If this sounds like an strange talk to be giving a room full of city and county officials it is. And it gets stranger. Karen Moreau of the American Petroleum Institute's New York lobbying group also lectured the local officials on the danger of local control. ""It really hit me when I visited a Holocaust museum here a couple years ago in DC,"" Moreau said, ""and I wandered through the exhibit that describes the rise of Hitler and describes the rise of Fascism, and how Fascism actually takes hold, and it struck me because it was so similar to what I see happening in our small towns on issues like fracking.""What do grassroots advocates think of it all?""It is clear what is going on here. They want to stop our momentum. So they're expanding their toolkit to try to undo democracy and delay justice,"" said Ellen Bravo, Executive Director of Family Values @ Work, which advocates for paid sick days. ""They will fail, but in the meantime, they will make many families less economically secure and less healthy,"" Bravo added.We have seen this play before. It was drawn up decades ago by the tobacco industry with the help of ALEC legislators to fight local public health restrictions on smoking, tobacco and tobacco advertising to youth.As CMD has reported, ALEC's relationship with the tobacco industry started around 1979, when ALEC Executive Director Kathleen Teague wrote to the Tobacco Institute seeking financial support.

In times of the selfie, Grindr and Instagram, when our relationship with our body has become a source of self-punishment, consumption and shame, this show creates a mirror where to look at to see the good and the bad in us. From those who try to run away by obsessively running marathons to those who can only find a social life in rubbing their muscular bodies against other ones exactly like theirs, our time seems to be one in which the body is more used to cover (and, of course, magnify, our own insecurities) than to disclose. This is why, I was not only interested in the exhibition itself, but also in the way the critics have interpreted. The first critic that I read was The Guardian's post-Victorian, chauvinist-like Jonathan Jones, who could only find fascination in the fact that such a ""collage"" of works had been secured by the ""British Empire."" Far more interestingly and, potentially, intelligently, The Evening Standard's Brian Sewell perceived (and, in my opinion, exaggerated) the erotic component of this show. In his own words:I am inclined to believe that the Ancient Greeks were well aware of the erotic charge in sculpture. It is clearly demonstrated by the myth of Pygmalion, a kingly sculptor who fell in love with the ivory figure of a girl that he had carved, and reinforced by the record of the cult statue of Aphrodite at Knidos (Turkey), which proved to be of such stimulating beauty that her marble buttocks always bore the stains of semen. And then carries on by saying: There was, I presume, no erotic charge for the viewer or the sculptor of the earlier Greek sculptures of the standing male nude, the kouros, made six, seven and even eight centuries B.C. -- archaic is the word for them. Hieratic, they are simplified to broad shoulders, slim waists and prominent buttocks; Egyptian influence plays a part, Mesopotamian too.So, according to Brian Sewell, eroticism is directly linked to naturalism. What about the link between presence and love? These were images that did not represent a person or deity, but presented it before them. They conjure them and made them appear in the same way that we believe that a polychromed sculpture actually is the Virgin Mary when we go to church. Perhaps that is why we might actually dare to kiss her and touch her. It is not just arousal, but love. The truth is that the body in Ancient Greece was the expression of an ideal social order. The Greek kouros was a mannequin, formulaically composed to provide the essential elements of ideal manhood with strong, even features, long, groomed hair, broad shoulders, developed biceps and pectoral muscles, wasp waist, flat stomach, a clear division of torso and pelvis, and powerful buttocks and thighs. Self satisfaction in the possession of arete was projected by the archaic smile that enliven the otherwise deliberate blankness of expression in these statues. As the sixth century B.C. drew to its close, the kouroi increasingly soften the hard angular forms of their older brothers, exhibiting a burgeoning naturalism instead. In some late examples, it is almost as if a living figure trapped inside the kouros were trying to break free. The Kritian boy seemed to herald a new style of human representation, but the resulting figure type was a vehicle for the same values as those embodied in the kouros. And the same could be said of Myron's Diskobolos and Polykleitos's Doryphoros for they embody the balance of opposites that Athenians believed was what goodness required. The beautiful for the Greeks was not the erotic, but the good. In fact, they were aroused by virtue.That is the main difference between the Greeks and us, and that is why a Pygmalionized Brian Sewell only seems to understand the difference between nakedness and nudity as determined through power and sex. Is that because of the contemporary malaise, or is it just another chapter of that complicated post-victorian, love-hate relationships between the British and their bodies. This show will make you think."

Let us begin with the least of these, hobbits Frodo and Samwise. Frodo is given the ring by his uncle Bilbo. Frodo's mission is to destroy the ring, which represents the apple that destroyed Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Frodo's disciples represent different walks of life mimicking the motley crew of twelve that Christ assembled for himself. Some of Frodo's followers sought fame (Boromir), while others sought the truth (Aragorn the true heir of Isildur refusing to take the throne).  On the road to Mordor, there is internal strife (dwarf versus elf) and a Judas, Boromir. When the group detours in the caves to avoid the eye of Sauron, things fall asunder. Sauron has corrupted a great wizard, Saruman, a former friend of Gandalf. Saruman has fallen to darkness like Lucifer. In the cave, Gandalf must give his life and descend into hell fighting Balrog, a great demon, to save Frodo and the others. Chaos descends as they escape the cave into the forest assuming Gandalf is dead.However, a new savior emerges in Aragorn. Help comes via Arwen, who sacrifices her eternity as an elf. As the disciples scatter, Frodo and Samwise encounter darkness (Gollum) on their journey. Smeagol's lust for the ring makes him depraved enough to kill Deagol, not unlike Cain killing Able. Gollum is also the Judas that betrays Frodo. Gollum is so reprobate that he is beyond redemption.  In Twin Towers, we see the resurrection of Gandalf the grey into Gandalf the White. He is a redeemed savior returning on his white horse, Shadowfax. Like the disciples who feared the sight of the resurrected savior with holes in his hand, so too does Aragorn, Gimli and Legalos fear the initial sight of Gandalf the White. However, through adversity there is a bond. They continue to fight to aid their hobbit brother to finish his mission. Even Merry and Pippin show signs of growth. Together they assist Gandalf in destroying Saruman's stronghold over King Théoden. Théoden and his people become believers and follow Aragorn and Gandalf on their journeys to save Minas Tirith and aid Frodo.  In Return of the King, Armageddon happens between Sauron and Zion (aka Minas Tirith), the white city of kings. Not only is the battle against Sauron and the forces of darkness, but also the struggle of humanity in the form of the steward. Denethor's refusal to recognize Aragorn as the rightful heir endangers the lives of citizens and his lone surviving son, Faramir. Man's struggle with lust, pride, and arrogance has always been his downfall. However, the king returns to his rightful throne (Aragorn and Arwen) to establish a new earth.Harry Potter  Some Christians prohibited children from reading and watching Harry Potter because of the witchcraft and wizardry. In spite of the witchcraft, religious symbolism abounds. Like Christ, Harry's birth is shrouded in awe and amazement. Unlike Christ, Harry is unaware of his savior qualities - humility and meekness. Like Christ, Harry upsets the religious establishment, the Ministry - wizardry elite, as well as Voldemort and his cohorts. His presence is a threat to all. Tom Riddle (aka Voldemort) is Lucifer, a bright, brilliant, powerful, and arrogant wizard. Tom Riddle's power of deception is so great that even good wizards were deceived until it was too late and he fully embodied Voldemort.  Harry's disciples grow with him at Hogwarts as he matures. His parents' Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore have always watched over the young savior, knowing he was the key to defeating Voldemort. There is a Judas, but he is redeemed. Snape represents a Judas and the Apostle Paul. During Voldemort's early reign as the dark lord, Snape was a loyal follower and persecuted members of the Order of the Phoenix. However, once the dark lord lost his physical form and his powers were diminished, Snape, once a death dealer, like Saul, is transformed into a Paul becoming the cornerstone of the Harry Potter riddle. Like early Christians that doubted Paul's conversion, others at Hogwarts assume Snape is still loyal to the dark lord. Only Dumbledore knows that Snape has sought forgiveness and redemption. Like John the Baptist, Dumbledore and Snape must die to make way for the real savior, Harry.Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Nevel become Harry's disciples equally performing signs and wonders. Remus, Hagward, Sirius, and the Weasleys round out his discipleship outside of Hogwarts. Unlike Christ who knew his birth was as a sacrificial lamb, Harry does not know until the end that he too must give up his life to save others. Like Christ's meeting on the Mount of Olives, when Harry receives the revelation of his fate, the spirit of his parents along with Sirius appear to encourage him to be not afraid of his mission. Like a lamb to the slaughter, Harry goes willingly to meet Voldemort.  From dementors, death dealers, Malfoy, and Voldemort, Harry has been tried and persecuted physically, mentally, and spiritually. The people that once praised him within the Ministry, like the crowd that threw flowers at Christ on the donkey to Jerusalem, later rallied against him for crucifixion. Malfoy, Harrry's tormentor throughout his time at Hogwarts, turns into the robber next to Christ at the crucifixion seeking redemption. Malfoy does not betray Harry to Belatrix. Even Malfoy's mother lies to Voldemort about Harry's death to secure the redemption of Malfoy. Harry's death by the dark lord is his salvation. As the devil rejoiced over the crucifixion of Christ, so too Voldemort glories in Harry's demise not realizing it is his own destruction that has been orchestrated. Harry's resurrection gave victory over darkness and salvation to his followers, who assuming him dead, became even the more fervent in their resolve.

As entrepreneurs, leaders, business owners of organizations small and large to succeed in the new world we need a new operating system; one that sees us move from a 'competitive' way of doing business to that of a 'collaborative' workspace. To do this effectively and to future proof ourselves, collaborative working is going to require a melding of both our hearts and minds.Often when people talk about working collaboratively, there still seems to be quite a bit of, to put it bluntly, scorn attached to it, particularly within traditional corporate structures. As leaders we have always been encouraged to walk our own path, to forge our way to the top in a fairly ruthless way with little engagement and often, with very little assistance. 'Collaboration' is still seen by some as an airy-fairy concept -- a kind 'hug it out' team exercise used to raise morale, rather than a firm concept to base future business practices on.But the truth of the matter is this.To succeed in a climate of uncertainty, mistrust and rapid-fire technological change, the only constants we have are each other -- so how are we to proceed and succeed if we aren't willing to trust and engage, rather than isolate ourselves and forge ahead alone? There is absolutely nothing wrong with healthy competition, and wanting to have a bottom line that is a nice solid black rather than a glaring shade of red, but when it is a matter of always turning inwards, and not being willing to share ideas, to look outwards and see the value in what others have to offer -- then it becomes an issue. That is when we close ourselves off and start to lose through stubbornness and business pride.There are so many real-time examples of companies and entrepreneurs who are willing to put aside traditional boundaries and think outside the corporate square for the good of each others' futures, that it's impossible to be blind to the benefits of a collaborative commercial space.There is the groundbreaking work of NASA and LEGO collaborating and Coca-Cola working with ECO Plastics in the UK to reduce greenhouse emissions and improve recycling methods. Reebok, Desigual and Cirque du Soleil work together to produce a range of exercise gear and programs, as do PUMA and Sagem (Smartphones) and Adidas and Sennheiser (sports headphones). The common thread in every one of these examples is the realization by their management teams of the inherent value that a collaborative approach provides. Without the input of a sporting goods company for example, the technical gurus are not going to get the best feedback on what an athlete wants; without the technical excellence, the athletics side of the equation will fall down in terms of clarity of sound and functionality.The crossover is what makes the products pop.And of course, when all is said and done, what makes a company shine is not what it produces, but the people that do the producing. It is those who ideate and create, who put their hearts and minds into creating innovative products and concepts who are the true 'shares' of any company. So ask yourself this question as a leader, and as a broker in your own business:Do you want to make an investment in your future, or in your past?If your answer is 'the future', then be prepared to collaborate, not just compete."

What may seem like random acts of violence are not so random;- About the inestimable and disproportionate human and economic toll taken by that very small percent of individuals whose serious mental illness impairs their capacity to recognize they are sick and to take steps to ensure their wellbeing and that of their communities.I fear that Lubitz's story will unleash a fresh round of fear and vitriol regarding people with mental illness. I fear that simplistic reactions known not to work (like ""lock them up and throw away the key"") may again be seen as attractive answers to problems whose solutions can be understood but difficult to achieve. I fear that work towards protecting the public's safety will be lost in the fog of the war of words that are already descending upon us in the wake of this latest tragedy.Andreas Lubitz does not fit the familiar profile of a person with serious mental illness who goes on to kill others and (typically) himself. Lubitz reportedly was not a loner, did not have a long history of isolation and alienation from family and friends, did not have an undetected mental illness (and he was presumably in treatment), and maintained at least a patina of competence and responsibility. As far as is known to date, he was not a terrorist. He apparently left no notes to explain his actions or take responsibility for the lives he took.We thus face a different set of problems to tackle if we are to find direction from the wreckage of Flight #9525 and the fate of its passengers and their families. I want to propose two paths for protecting the public as well as protecting people with serious mental illnesses. They call for real time performance information on those entrusted with our safety. First, we need to revisit the limits of privacy, balancing both individual and community rights. Second, we need to consider measures that could reduce the risk of another deadly scenario, especially the potential for employing technological advances to identify problems before it is too late.Privacy often takes the quality of a hallowed right, especially in this country. But privacy is not universal or unlimited. Privacy, particularly in mental health, can have both its needed place and its proper limits, especially when circumstances may be life-threatening. Those whose service involves our safety have that as their primary and overriding responsibility. Regular, random drug testing is a common example for many service employees whose work involves the health and safety of others. Yet organizations whose employees are directly responsible for the public safety -- like doctors, police, firefighters, bus drivers, nurses, and pilots -- usually are not contacted when an employee is deemed medically not safe to work, as we painfully see with Germanwings (and Lufthansa). Has privacy trumped public safety? Would not the public safety be served if select groups of service workers with jobs that can impact safety and are in treatment for a medical condition (including psychiatric, neurological, and certain chronic illnesses that can impair cognitive functioning) consent to having their doctor report to their employer should they be determined unfit to work? Andreas Lubitz would not have flown that day were that the case. Impaired physicians and nurses would not endanger their patients were that the case. The right to return to work when fit would have to be guaranteed. Safety must always be the first priority, and the privilege of serving others should rest on that principle.However, professions, mine included, do not have a stellar record of protecting those they serve. Do we have reason to believe that professional organizations or corporate entities can be trusted to protect their clientele? Self-interest, concerns about liability, and economic forces too commonly eclipse the integrity of purpose that is their mission. R. Buckminster Fuller did not believe pressure could change people or organizations when he said, ""You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."" We need something besides the imposition of external regulations and reporting requirements to achieve real and lasting change. Advances in technology and data systems may now allow for a new models of monitoring that heretofore were not possible.We can, thus, today pursue a second, and parallel, path that adds clear measures to monitor all individuals with direct responsibility for others, such as the service personnel mentioned above and others whose work places the public safety in their hands. Here technology may offer feasible solutions that in the past were too intrusive and burdensome. In NYC, for example, a combined multi-year effort by NYS and NYC monitored a very high-risk group of individuals with serious mental illness using administrative data to identify when they failed to attend their medical appointments or pick up prescribed medications, or had a sudden re-emergence of acute illness as evidence by ED or hospital admissions. This work focused on the clinical providers, not the patients, responsible -- where data alerted everyone involved about who was not doing well. Responsibility then lay with the provider organizations to act when patients were not succeeding. This initiative now is evolving into more accountable care organizations to ensure that those in trouble are reached and engaged.This high risk initiative (or others like it) is, however, far too limited and focused on individuals with known histories of serious problems. That appears not to be the case for Lubitz or many others who have flown below the radar of responsible monitoring. What could work are real time measures of the performance of service personnel, agreed to by those given the privilege of bearing the responsibilities they do. Wearable devices far beyond Fitbit are emerging that can track and report changes in social behavior and functioning that correlate with impaired performance (often the result of illness) thereby alerting service organizations (as well as caregivers and health professionals) that a person's capacity to do his or her job may be compromised.We don't want someone with a fever of 105 degrees operating heavy machinery or flying a NASA mission. We don't want someone whose cognitive capacities are transiently impacted by a mental (or other medical) illness or drug use driving our bus or operating on our abdomen. When someone is impaired, he or she needs to stand down, or not be allowed to work, until their functioning is again normal, as evidenced by real time performance measures. Perhaps a universal approach used for all workers the public relies upon for safety even could avoid the traps of diagnosis and stigma we see when a mental disorder limits functioning. We need professions and service organizations to invite innovation from technology companies researching human performance measurement to build, test, and promote solutions that serve the public safety. We can find answers that balance individual liberties with collective needs, that prioritize safety, and that create the expectation that with certain privileges comes accountability for performance. Regaining the public trust and professional pride are possible. But we will need a different glide path than that we have been on. We can use Flight #9525 as an impetus and a reminder that delays only invite yet another collective grave and failure of will when prevention could be possible. The views expressed here are entirely my own. I take no support from any pharmaceutical or device company.

The battle left five people dead and forced the international airport to close. The heavily armed troops, who are allied with Shiite militia in control of the capital Sanaa, advanced inside the airport perimeter but the Hadi loyalists managed to secure the runway, security sources said. AFP PHOTO / STR (Photo credit should read STR/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1487c2400003600229ed3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yemen, like Afghanistan, has a long reputation as a quagmire for foreign invaders. Saudi Arabia could break its teeth there if the U.S. does not constrain it. Astonishingly, Yemeni events have now conspired to bring about the supposed intervention of some 10 regional powers in one of the most hyped events in the Arabian Peninsula of recent times. Most of this proxy war makes little sense: the threats emanating from Yemen are distorted and exaggerated, the stakes are actually relatively low (except for Yemenis), any imposed settlement is highly elusive, and the costs to those engaged may be high. For the U.S., it can be once again something of a lose-lose situation, where the enemy of my enemy is often also my enemy. There are fourth myths about Yemen that need to be sorted out:The first myth is that this war represents yet a new front on a massive regional Sunni-Shiite struggle. The reality is that a great deal of this struggle is heavily among Yemeni Shiites themselves. Yes, the Houthis, who are now well on the way to seizing leadership of the entire country, are indeed Shiite. They are Zaydi Shiites to be specific (also known as Fivers, believing in five imams) -- who differ significantly from Iranian Shiites (mostly Twelvers). Indeed, among the various schools of Shiism, Zaydism is theologically closest to Sunni Islam. Sunni and Shia have co-existed quite well in Yemen over long centuries. Zaydi imams ruled most of Yemen for hundreds of years as an Imamate, until some 60 years ago when an Arab nationalist revolution displaced them. But the Zaydi Shia remain a major force in the country (some 40 percent) and are dominant in the north. Furthermore, the two most important tribal confederations in the country are also both Zaydi. So was the former president of Yemen for 32 years, Ali Abdullah Saleh (overthrown in the Arab Spring and who now may be secretly supporting the Houthis). The Houthis are simply one regional Zaydi clan who happen to be rebelling for an end to what they saw as discrimination and the corruption of Saleh and his successor -- both Saudi-supported Shiites. Typically the Houthi movement takes the form of a revivalist movement seeking cleaner government and a ""purer Zaydism."" The second myth is that the Houthis represent the cutting edge of Iranian imperialism in Arabia -- as trumpeted by the Saudis. The Zaydi Shia, including the Houthis, over history have never had a lot to do with Iran. But as internal struggles within Yemen have gone on, some of the Houthis have more recently been happy to take Iranian coin and perhaps some weapons -- just as so many others, both Sunni and Shia, are on the Saudi payroll. The Houthis furthermore hate al-Qaeda and hate the Islamic State. And more recently they have denounced the U.S. as well for its past support to the government in Sanaa that was suppressing the Houthis. The third myth is that Saudi Arabia is fighting to ""preserve stability in the Arabian Peninsula."" What the Saudis are doing is fighting to maintain overlordship in the Arabian peninsula (an Arabian Monroe Doctrine). A century ago, the Saudis seized traditionally Yemeni areas in the southwest corner of Saudi Arabia and forcibly imposed radical Wahhabi views there. Riyadh has always loathed Yemeni feistiness, independence, its revolutionary politics, and even its experiments with democracy. The Saudis have traditionally sought to buy off as many tribal and political forces as they can in Yemen -- Sunni or Shiite -- to try to maintain their shaky and shifting form of dominance.But now it's about more than just Yemen. In the wake of the Arab Spring, Saudi Arabia has sought to forge a broad counter-revolutionary force to block any further regime change in the Arab world; it brands its new campaign as some kind of pan-Arab Sunni movement designed to face an ostensible ""Persian/Shiite threat."" With a lot of money and the support of insecure Gulf rulers, the Saudis now seem to have orchestrated some grand Sunni front to invade Yemen to ""meet the looming Iranian threat."" From Riyadh's perspective, Tehran has supposedly pocketed Iraq, is successfully keeping Assad in power in Syria, threatens Bahrain, stirs oppressed and restive Shia within the Saudi Kingdom, and now bids to control Yemen, thereby ""encircling the Peninsula."" Ironically, the promising U.S.-Iranian nuclear talks raise further fears in Riyadh that Washington will no longer be a predictable member of the demonize-Iran camp.Much of this paranoia reflects fevered authoritarian Saudi thinking. Never mind that Persians have never in centuries invaded the Arabian Peninsula. Shiite majorities, as in Iraq and Bahrain, have indeed demanded democratic processes that hugely empower them politically. But since the Saudis in recent years have all but declared war against Iran and created a massive anti-Shiite front -- mostly to preserve Arabian and Egyptian autocrats --Tehran has reciprocated; it is happy to try to keep the Saudis off balance in Yemen at quite limited cost. But it is absurd to believe that Tehran is in a position ever to call the political shots in obstreperous Yemen. And the fear that the Houthis in power want, or are even capable of shutting down the Bab al-Mandab entrance to the Red Sea is a fantasy. The fourth myth is that the U.S. has support in Yemen. Whatever support it has is extremely limited; its interests and policies in this dirt-poor country over the last decades have focused almost exclusively on counter-terrorism. In the process, the U.S. backed the three-decade dictatorship of Ali Abdullah Saleh and has been conducting dozens of drone strikes in the country that have caused many civilian deaths and stirred much anger. Under the present turmoil, the U.S. has felt compelled to close its embassy and has largely decamped to Riyadh. Washington now helps advise the 10-nation anti-Yemen campaign from Riyadh in what looks increasingly like some grand Arabian armada run amok. The choices for the U.S. are poor. But Houthi dominance in Yemen need not be a disaster in itself. They are blood enemies of the militantly anti-Shiite forces of al-Qaeda and ISIS. Still, the Houthis will be deeply suspicious of U.S. intentions, especially now that the U.S. is working with Yemen's arch-enemy, Saudi Arabia. For that matter, the Houthis are not fanatics and will not be able by themselves to control Yemen unless they work with the broad array of political and religious forces and ideologies that make up the Yemeni mosaic.But we now face a major new factor. The new, ailing Saudi King Salman -- or more precisely his activist, powerful and ambitious son -- now are bidding for a historical transformation of the Kingdom's long-standing cautious and defensive foreign policies. We should remember that the history of Saudi Arabia shows its Wahhabi forces sweeping twice across the Peninsula to the Persian Gulf in some kind of Arabian Manifest Destiny. The Saudis' small Gulf neighbors may not find it so comfortable to support a new, more geopolitically ambitious Riyadh -- with its radical Islamic ideology and its virulently sectarian regional vision. Nor should the U.S. A massive, unnecessary -- and likely failing Saudi effort --to take over Yemen in this counter-revolutionary spirit may augur dangerously for the stability of the Peninsula in the future.

This question was asked by my son at age 4. It was asked just after we were served our drinks at a busy diner my sister and I had stopped at for lunch with the kids. My sister looked up at me with surprise and her eyes began to brim with tears. I was completely caught off-guard and lost for words. I stared at my son's cherubic face and my heart ached over how I could possibly explain such a complex diagnosis in such a public place while honoring his curiosity and right to understand himself. ""Why is school so much easier for all the other kids? Why am I the only one having a hard time? What's wrong with me?""   These questions were asked by my second son at age 8. For many years, he had an innocence and lack of awareness about his struggles. In third grade, that started to change. I knew it was time to tell him his diagnosis when he started to doubt himself as a person. It was time that he knew that he was not a ""bad"" kid who didn't listen or couldn't understand, but an amazing child who was able to do what he did each day despite the challenges autism created for him. It was time for him to understand the gifts that autism had given him, but also embrace and know why other things were a challenge. ""I feel like I don't belong here.""  This was said by my third son at age 7 when I arrived at the nurse's office at school after being called for a prolonged meltdown that could not be calmed. I knew then that it was time to talk about autism. He deserved to know that he was not alone. That he had a community. And I knew he no longer belonged in an integrated classroom. It wasn't working. Later that year, he was moved to a sub separate language-based classroom and it brought him such peace. He later shared with me, ""At my old school, I used to wonder what was wrong with me every day. Now I don't even think about it. I just learn.""I am the mother of four children, three of whom have autism spectrum disorders. I have had to look three little boys in the eye and share their diagnosis with them. It was always hard. It was always painful. It was always scary for both of us at first. But from my experiences, I have learned two things to be true.The first is that there is no correct answer about when to tell your child about their diagnosis. This was true in my house alone. My boys have three very different levels of autism, and they were told at three different ages, and in three different ways. My oldest son had put things together at a very young age from all the doctor and therapist appointments and simply asked the question. For my other boys, I knew it was time to tell them when they began to be more aware of their differences and doubted themselves because of them. Every parent knows their own child best. You know when they might be ready to understand and handle the information. Be open to the suggestions and stories of others, pay close attention to your child's feelings and maturation and then do what you feel is right for your child and family. The second thing I know to be true is that sharing the diagnosis with your child allows them and your family to fully embrace all that autism means for them and the wealth of resources available. There is so much help available and a wonderfully supportive autism community that is hard to take advantage of if you haven't shared the truth with your child. I believe strongly that the truth sets you free. It is hard for any person to make the most out of their situation in life if they are not able to embrace it or talk about it with others. I feel strongly that keeping anything hidden encourages the notion that there is something shameful about that which is not being discussed. Dr. Brené Brown states wisely that ""shame needs three things to grow exponentially in our lives: secrecy, silence, and judgement."" Although I cannot control the judgement of others, I can empower my children by erasing secrecy and silence. It is not something to be ashamed of, and we will never positively change the public's perception of autism if we as parents treat it as such.Many parents feel paralyzed by figuring out how to approach the initial discussion. I kept the first conversation simple, creating space and encouragement for questions and whatever feelings came up. It differed slightly for each boy, but the overall conversation went like this: ""Every person has things that are easy for them and things that they are working on. Your brain works in a very special way that is called autism. It means that some things that are hard for other people, like remembering numbers and all the states and capitols, are easy for you. But it also means that some things, like understanding conversations or what people are trying to say, can be hard for you. It is why sometimes noises, smells and the feeling of things bother you too. But it also means that you are amazing for how hard you work to get through it all! There are a lot of strategies we can use to help make the things that are tough a bit easier. There are lots of people in the world with autism and so many of them have done amazing things. Would you like to learn about some of them?""They each responded differently. My oldest, who was the youngest at the time of the conversation, was very matter-of-fact about the whole thing. My youngest son said, ""My friend Tommy has autism, I can't wait to tell him I have it too!"" With my second son, it was the most heartbreaking. His eyes immediately filled with tears. He cried and yelled, ""Well, I don't want it!"" His older brother came in from the other room and hugged him and said, ""It's OK, Jack, I have autism too. It will be OK. We will be OK."" We all held each other tight for a long time. It was one of the saddest days I've had on this journey.  After the initial tough conversations, however, things only got better. We spend a lot of time talking about the gifts of autism. We read and watch programs about the many talents and successes of people who are on the spectrum. We attend the AANE art show and admire and support such talent in person. We have helped each of the boys to find what areas bring them joy and where their talents shine. My oldest son has won his middle schools trivia competition for two years in a row and belongs to the chess club. My second son sees art in everything and creates it everywhere. My youngest son loves to create games and has a heart so open and an enthusiasm for life so big that his love and spirit are contagious to all he meets.We face the struggles that autism brings openly and involve each of the boys in working on their own strategies and solutions. We emphasize that the challenges of autism are not character defects but simply a difference in the way their brain is operating. When they have been able to view their troubles in this way, they have been able to work on their difficulties without feeling bad about who they are. Having autism, is like having anything else. A person who has diabetes has to adjust their diet and monitor their sugars, but it does not define them as a person. They are in fact to be admired for the extra effort that is required to keep their blood sugars healthy when everyone else around them has a body that does it with no effort at all. The same is true of people living with autism. Such bravery, such tenacity of spirit is required to walk in their shoes. I often take the time to gaze into each of my boys' faces and tell them, ""You, my friend, are my hero.""My boys are now 14, 12, and 9. If you asked them about their experiences, I know that would be open and willing to share that they have autism. I am sure that they would tell you that they have many difficult days, but that there are also many special things about the way their brains work too. Most importantly, I am certain that they would tell you that they are proud of who they are, and that is all any mother can hope for."

She mentioned that it was an easy hike, and it was in fact moderate with rocks acting as steps much of the way. The added bonus was the river that flowed alongside the trail the entire ascent. Since both my friend and I are avid photographers, it took us a little longer to do the hike than it probably would most people because with the flowing river, canyon walls and wildlife running about, the photo-ops were abundant, and we took advantage of every single one.

Photo Credit Heather Hummel PhotographyThe reward of climbing up through the canyon was when it broke out into the breathtaking view of Hanging Lake. One can't help but pause and take in the unexpected waterfalls and the pristine lake reflecting the sky, canyons and trees above. Who would think that at the top of a canyon sits this magical place? I never would have. Thankfully, my friend knew of it and shared this wondrous place with me.  Photo Credit Heather Hummel PhotographyWant to find out more?

Three No. 1 seeds are still afloat and plenty of rich storylines exist. Along with Kentucky's pursuit of the perfect season, three remaining schools are within 350 miles of Indianapolis, allowing ticket prices on the secondary market to reach record-breaking highs in 2015.According to TiqIQ, the average secondary price for All Sessions strip tickets is $1,996.01. That ticket honors all three upcoming games at Lucas Oil Stadium, including both Final Four matchups and next Monday's championship game. The cheapest available All Sessions strip ticket is currently listed for $635. That marks the most expensive average and get-in price on the secondary market since at least 2011. Prior to this year, the highest average price for All Sessions strip tickets was $1,514.21 in 2014.Prices won't lessen much when searching for single-day tickets. Final Four Semifinal tickets on TiqIQ currently average $1,081.44 and the cheapest available is priced at $396. NCAA Tournament championship game tickets own an average price of $754.95 and the get-in price starts at $280 on the secondary market.Alongside Kentucky, No. 1 seeded Duke and Wisconsin will also be in the mix this Saturday in Indianapolis. Michigan State is considered the outlier in this year's Final Four, but Tom Izzo's Spartans have asserted themselves as East Regional champs and will look to take down Duke this weekend. Following their bout, Kentucky and Wisconsin will throw down later Saturday evening.Of course, close campus proximity has also allowed ticket prices to skyrocket this year. While not considered a traditional Midwestern state, the University of Kentucky is located less than 200 miles south of Indianapolis. The University of Michigan is just 250 miles north while the University of Madison-Wisconsin is 330 miles to the northwest. Duke is the furthest campus from Lucas Oil Stadium at 600 miles, but no distance is considered too great for fans when the college championship is up for grabs.With commutes being mapped out in the days prior to Saturday's tip-off, the 2015 Final Four is jam-packed with backstories. Kentucky's hope to go a flawless 40-0 is obvious, but the level of talent has increased with every round and the Wildcats will likely welcome their toughest challenge yet against Wisconsin. The NCAA Tournament hasn't welcome three No. 1 seeds in the Final Four since 2008, but that hasn't discouraged Michigan State. Izzo's ""underdogs"" get a bad rap in the penultimate round after distinguishing themselves as one of the most dominant teams in the tournament this year.Coach K will have the opportunity to play for his fifth national title with a win over MSU on Saturday. Duke's head coach could inch closer to John Wooden's record-setting 10 championships and would cement himself as number two all-time with a hoisting this year, breaking ties with Adolph Rupp."

Duke, along with Wisconsin, Kentucky and Michigan State, will head to Indianapolis for the Final Four this weekend. The championship game will also be held in the state next Monday.Michael Schoenfeld, Duke's vice president for public affairs and government relations, issued a statement on Monday in response to Indiana's newly passed law, saying the university shared the NCAA's concerns (emphasis ours):Duke University continues to stand alongside the LGBT community in seeking a more equal and inclusive world, and we deplore any effort to legislate bias and discrimination. We share the NCAA’s concern about the potential impact of the new law, and will be vigilant to ensure that our student-athletes, supporters, and indeed all citizens and visitors are treated fairly and with respect.The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was signed by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) last week. Under the measure, individuals or corporations are allowed to cite their religious beliefs if sued by another party, and many critics believe it would allow businesses to legally discriminate against others, specifically the LGBT community. The University of Wisconsin-Madison also raised concern with the law, per a statement from Chancellor Rebecca Blank:Diversity and inclusion of all people are core principles at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.A spokesperson for Wisconsin's athletic department said the department supports the statement issued last week by The Big Ten Conference, of which it is a member. The conference's statement read:The Big Ten Conference and its member institutions believe in promoting an inclusive environment in which athletic competition can operate free from discrimination. The conference is aware of the bill that was recently signed into law in the state of Indiana and will further review its impact at the next scheduled meetings of its administrators, presidents and chancellors. And a statement from Michigan State University President Lou Anna K. Simon read:While there has been much discussion about the new law passed in Indiana, we hope the citizens and lawmakers of that state can reach a consensus on how to best welcome all people, regardless of background. Here at MSU, we are guided by values embedded in our rich heritage as a leading land-grant university. Inclusion is foremost among our values - treating all members of the community with fairness and dignity. Duke's statement follows that of NBA analyst Charles Barkley, who called the bill ""unacceptable"" and suggested that sporting events such as the Final Four and the Super Bowl should not be held in states with such legislation. The NBA and the WNBA also came out strongly against the law, as did their respective teams in Indiana, all promising inclusion at their events. The NCAA itself also spoke out following the law's passage last week, expressing concern about how it ""could affect our student-athletes and employees.""HuffPost has also reached out to Kentucky for comment, which has not yet been returned. UPDATE: The story has been updated to include comments from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Michigan State University."
