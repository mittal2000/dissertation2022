0,POLITICS,This Town Is Encouraging Teachers To Carry Guns. Here's Their Reasoning.,Sebastian Murdock,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/teachers-guns-okay-oklahoma_us_56b50fcbe4b04f9b57d9a561,Do you feel safe yet?,2016-02-06,New signs posted on the grounds of Okay Public Schools in Oklahoma warn that staff members may be armed.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b51f0e1f00000d01217752.jpeg?cache=TAvfZdzcYF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A small rural town in Oklahoma has decided that the best way to prevent a hypothetical mass shooting at their schools is to arm teachers with guns. So far, approximately 5 percent of all teachers at Okay Public Schools are packing heat, according to Superintendent Charles McMahan. At the beginning of the current academic year, the Okay Public School Board of Education instituted a policy laying out how teachers with a concealed carry permit could obtain permission to bring a gun to school. On Monday, the policy drew a little more public attention. The old ""Gun Free School Zone"" signs were replaced with new signs warning that armed staff members ""may use whatever force is necessary to protect our students,"" the Muskogee Phoenix reports.""No specific incident caused us to pass this policy,"" McMahan said. ""But with everything that's going on in the world, we've heard that you may possibly see more attacks from radical groups looking for children.""The town of Okay has a population of roughly 650 people and only one local police officer. Law enforcement officers from nearby Wagoner take about 10 minutes to respond to any given situation, McMahan said.""If a shooting situation were to happen, which we pray it never will, seconds matter,"" he said.Along with having a concealed carry permit, teachers participating in the program must have a certificate from Oklahoma's Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training, receive a psychiatric evaluation and take a shooting course three times a year. Participating teachers must have their weapon on them or secured in a lockbox, according to the policy. The guns must be .45 caliber or less. And McMahan said they must be ""name brand"" guns.But what if an angry or upset student gets hold of a teacher's firearm? What if a gun is lost on school grounds? What if a teacher accidentally discharges the weapon?""The risks are outweighed by the threats that are out there,"" McMahan said. ""The chances of a student getting ahold of one of the guns would be very, very slim.""What if police mistake an armed teacher for an armed suspect during an actual shooting?""Not really a concern to us, as we have identifiable gear,"" he said. According to the policy, armed teachers wear an identifying badge, hat or jacket. ""We do realize this could put us at risk, but that is the chance we take to keep our students safe.""Perhaps the most important question is simply: Do armed civilians actually stop mass shooters? McMahan believes they do. The evidence suggests only when they're former military or law enforcement themselves.As The New York Times' Andrew Rosenthal points out, multiple ""good guys"" with guns can make an already chaotic scene more dangerous:About the only thing more terrifying than a lone gunman firing into a classroom or a crowded movie theater is a half a dozen more gunmen leaping around firing their pistols at the killer, which is to say really at each other and every bystander. It's a police officer's nightmare.Around 20 states have laws allowing adults to carry licensed guns into schools, according to The Washington Post. McMahan said he was inspired to post the warning signs after a suggestion from law enforcement and because a north Texas school implemented the same policy in 2014.The superintendent said he hasn't received any negative feedback regarding the policy, though he clarified that he was ""not counting Facebook comments."""

""That’s not what I was trying to say. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, of course! But I did that literally just to say you don’t have to label yourself, and then everyone was like, 'Lily Rose Depp comes out as gay!'""Depp said that her sexuality is ""not anybody’s business"" and she is going to ""date whoever I’m going to date.""In November 2015, her father responded to his daughter's original social media post. ""She’s got thousands of followers on social media, and they were all taken completely by surprise... But not me,"" he said. ""I already knew because she tells me everything -- she’s not afraid to say anything to me. We’re super-tight and I’m very proud of our relationship. Lily’s really together -- she’s a sharp kid and one of the smartest human beings I have ever met.""Sexuality fluidity is becoming increasingly common among young people. A study released in August 2015 found that nearly one-third of American millennials identify as something other than straight, as compared to 14 percent of baby boomers.This move away from strict sexual and gender labels was, in part, the inspiration for The Huffington Post recently changing the name of its section for sexual and gender minorities to HuffPost Queer Voices.Also on HuffPost:"

8,FIFTY,Looking For Mr. Right? This Is Why You Should Stop,"Joe Seldner, ContributorJournalist/Producer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dating-after-50_b_9113110.html,"I'm a big fan of hope. I've stood on the edge of some grim and horrific precipices, and managed to avoid falling into them because of hope. I've experienced injustices and cruelty, and survived, even thrived, because of hope.",2016-02-06,Mature man looking at his reflection in mirror in bathroom,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb675f9220000ba01dccf97.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I'm a big fan of hope. I've stood on the edge of some grim and horrific precipices, and managed to avoid falling into them because of hope. I've experienced injustices and cruelty, and survived, even thrived, because of hope.But hope does intersect with reality, and sometimes, reality needs to win. Back in my most active dating years, I would see profiles of the same women (and yes, I'm sure the same is true of men) on dating sites year after year - after year. Full of hope at 55, 60, 65. Full of clichés about seeing the glass half full, about finding true love, about soulmates, about not settling.I'm confident hopefulness is reassuring to them. But most of these people will not find true love. They will not connect with their soulmate (a concept I have long found damaging and unhelpful.) They may well find someone compatible and kind and fun and wonderful, as long as they don't adhere to the ridiculous notion that anything but your ideal mate is ""settling."" But many will end up alone. Maybe even most will.Hope does collide with reality now and then.There may be more quotes about hope than about any other subject except perhaps love. When you do a simple ""images of quotes about hope"" Google search, here's just a smidgen of what comes up: It isn't just the romantic universe where these two concepts have trouble coexisting.  I see ""mature"" men and women (let's say 50 and over) all the time these days looking desperately for work -- maybe meaningful employment, or more often, just something to keep themselves afloat, to pay those bills that never subside.These are often accomplished, hard-working people, many of whom endured years of soul-crushing jobs, or some of whom maybe were lucky and had work they enjoyed, even loved, but who now can't get their emails returned or resumes viewed, and whose prospects for the next 10, 20, 30 years are bleak if not downright non-existent.They look at a world of emerging tech companies and wonder how they can fit in. They hope they can. Reality usually says otherwise. Adding to the ice bath of reality, their children, brandishing college degrees and frequently -- Himalayas of debt, often can't find work either. These people over 50 struggle to support themselves, and now have to help support the children. This wasn't the plan. But it is the reality.The seekers of true love and of ways to make a living can and should remain hopeful. But they should also keep a firm grasp on reality. I'm not trying to harsh anyone's day. Quite the opposite, I think coming to grips with reality can be cathartic, even rejuvenating. There isn't anything wrong with recognizing, even embracing, the realization that Mr. Right isn't going to ride in and swoop you up (or at our age, strain to lift you out of your chair), or that your dream of starting your own wildly successful business isn't going to materialize.And I'm not really talking about Big Dreams. Most of the over 50 or 55 set understand intellectually, if not emotionally, that their goals really should be finding someone caring and decent and fun, and getting a job that pays them something, though probably far less than they made before and certainly far less than they need.If you're over 55, it would be wise to accept that George Clooney is out of reach, that playing pro baseball was never possible, that breaking into the billionaires club is a whole lot less likely than scrimping to pay your bills and scaling back vacations from the Greek Islands to seeing your kids (who may be in your basement, or you in theirs.)Yes, yes, yes, it is possible you will find true love. It is possible you will have that successful second or third career, it is possible that life you envisioned for yourself after graduating from Princeton or Cal State or Hometown High will fall into place. I am an absolute believer in reinvention and creating a new self.But it is more likely these things won't happen, and it gets more likely with each passing month.The question is, does reality equal despair? It shouldn't. If you were married for 25 years and it didn't work out, why yearn for that ""true love"" now when that sweet, considerate, fun-loving guy who isn't your dream is perfectly fine? If you worked for decades and maybe saved some money and put the kids through college and then got laid off or replaced by someone younger, why be despondent about what didn't happen when there are other -- though yes, probably lesser -- opportunities out there?Hope is vital. It keeps us going in the face of what we know in our hearts are closed doors and shrinking opportunities.But reality is not something to be ignored. Reality opens doors and provides opportunities.

For those of us traveling along the often lonely road outside of the gender norms created, taught, learned and transmitted in this world, there are a few things you can avoid doing in order to help smooth the path and alleviate some of the rough brush we encounter along the way. 1. Please do not take on the role of Bathroom Police.It is safe to assume that people are capable of choosing the right restroom for themselves. While it is valiant of you to fluff your cape and turn into Captain Safe-a-Stall, rest assured that 99.9 percent of the time, we are quite competent in our restroom selections. Your nobility is noted but stepping in to notify us of which restroom we have walked into is by no means necessary. You handle your business, we'll handle ours.2. Please do not tell us how we should dress to avoid confusing others.  While we are generally pretty understanding of the fact that our gender presentation doesn't fit neatly into the folds of all you've been taught in this world, we really don't desire your assistance in repackaging us so we can fit in. We've seen the commercials, been exposed to the magazine ads, undergone our own indoctrinated-into-the world experience and came out of it all having decided how we wish to express who we are. Rather than assisting us with squeezing neatly back into the folds of what make sense to you based on what you've adopted, try to peel your folds back a little to make room for who we are instead.3. Please do not tell us how much easier life would be if we conformed to gender norms.Although we really do appreciate your yearning to aid us in an easier go-of-it in this world, it is pretty likely that we have considered the benefits of conforming on more than once occasion and ultimately decided against it. Rather than attempting to educate us on how much easier life would be if we conformed, it would be really helpful to direct your educational endeavors in the direction of those who do not accept us as we are. I promise you, if conforming to the status quo was an option in alignment of what would make us happy and at peace with ourselves, we would have done so long ago."

In fact, whether from friend or foe, even mild criticism is viewed as an existential threat prompting Israeli officials to unleash a torrent of abuse in an effort to silence and/or punish critics. And given new initiatives being rolled out in Israel and here is the US, by Congress and some state legislatures, this effort to silence critics is endangering free speech and the search for peace.This worrisome tendency was on display in recent weeks as Israelis reacted with striking vehemence to remarks by United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, and US Ambassador Daniel Shapiro.In a speech to the Security Council, the Secretary General decried the ""unacceptable levels of violence and polarized public discourse"" that has taken hold in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. He condemned the Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians and insisted that ""the full force of law must be brought to bear on all of those committing crimes--with a system of justice applied equally for Israelis and Palestinians alike"".But Ban went further, observing that ""security measures alone will not stop the violence. They cannot address the profound sense of alienation and despair driving some Palestinians...Palestinian frustration is growing under the weight of a half century of occupation...[and] as oppressed peoples have demonstrated throughout the ages, it is human nature to react to occupation, which often serves as a potent incubator of hate and extremism"". The Secretary General went on to express his concern with recent Israeli announcements to expand settlements in the occupied lands, urging them to: stop the demolitions of Palestinian homes and confiscation of Palestinian lands; address the humanitarian situation in Gaza; and to take concrete steps to improve the daily lives of the Palestinian people--noting that all of these behaviors made more difficult the achievement of an Israel-Palestinian peace.Ban offered, as well, a series of steps the Palestinians needed to take to end their internal divisions, put their house in order, and end incitement against Israel. In an address to an Israeli think tank, Ambassador Shapiro echoed some of Ban's concerns, noting ""we are concerned and perplexed by Israel's strategy on settlements. This government and previous Israeli governments have repeatedly expressed their support for a negotiated two-state solution -- a solution that would involve both mutual recognition and separation ... Yet separation will become more and more difficult if Israel plans to continue to expand the footprint of settlements.""Shapiro also criticized the way Israel governs in the occupied lands, saying ""too much Israeli vigilantism in the West Bank goes on unchecked,"" he said. ""There is a lack of thorough investigations ... at times it seems Israel has two standards of adherence to rule of law in the West Bank -- one for Israelis and one for Palestinians.""The Israeli reactions to both Ban and Shapiro were predictably harsh. Ban was accused of demonstrating a ""double standard"" with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that the United Nations had ""lost its neutrality and moral force"" and charging that Ban had given ""tail wind to terror"". Netanyahu also called Shapiro's observations ""unacceptable"". The Ambassador was accused demonstrating a ""double standard"" and was crudely dismissed by a former Netanyahu aide as a ""little Jew boy"" courting favor.  All of this heightened hyper-reaction to criticism plays out against a backdrop of dangerous moves by Israel and its supporters in the US to not only defame and politically punish critics and in some instances to go further by making criticism illegal. In Israel, steps have been taken to punish teachers and artists and the Knesset is considering a series of measures and the passage of a new law that target domestic critics in an effort to blacklist them as ""traitors"".Meanwhile, here in the US, the Department of State has issued guidelines on anti-Semitism which, in addition, to including examples of displays of ""hatred toward Jews...Jewish institutions and religious facilities"" also goes down a dangerous path terming as anti-Semitic ""applying double standards by requiring of [Israel] behavior not expected of any other democratic nation"". And several state governments have passed laws prohibiting efforts that call for boycotting, sanctioning, of divesting from Israel because of Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The net effect of all these measures will be to silence critics and to deny them not only their right to speak out, but to peacefully organize and act to affect change in Israel's policies in the occupied Palestinian lands.There is a certain irony in all of this because in their hysterical use of charge of ""double standard""--i.e. that Israel is being ""singled out for criticism""--it is Israel's supporters who are themselves guilty of a ""double standard"", since, if they were to have their way, it is Israel which would be singled out as the only country that cannot be criticized. In the end, Ban and Shapiro are right. Israel's behavior is doing grave damage to the Palestinian people and to any hope for peace. And their critics are wrong. It is not a double standard to criticize Israel and it is most certainly not anti-Semitic. In fact, the overreaction to criticism harms our political discourse, damages the effort to combat real anti-Semitism, and because it serves to enable destructive Israeli policies, it makes a just peace a near unattainable goal.

11,QUEER VOICES,Correcting Legalized Bias: India and its Struggle to Decriminalize Homosexuality,"Jyoti Puri, ContributorProfessor and Chair of Sociology, Simmons College. Author, Sex...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/correcting-legalized-bias_b_9171014.html,The last chapter of the legal campaign to decriminalize homosexuality is unfolding in the Indian Supreme Court.,2016-02-06,"Indian gay rights activists celebrate after the country's Supreme Court agreed to review a decision which criminalises gay sex in New Delhi on February 2, 2016. India's top court agreed to review a decision which criminalises gay sex, sparking hope among campaigners that the colonial-era law will eventually be overturned in the world's biggest democracy. AFP PHOTO / SAJJAD HUSSAIN / AFP / SAJJAD HUSSAIN (Photo credit should read SAJJAD HUSSAIN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafe01f250000cf0037fe97.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The last chapter of the legal campaign to decriminalize homosexuality is unfolding in the Indian Supreme Court. It is considering a ""curative petition"" in which lawyers are making the last-ditch arguments in favor of decriminalization. Created in 2002, the curative petition in the Indian legal system provides an aggrieved party one last opportunity to appeal a final ruling after all else has failed.  This is the culmination of a more than decade-long battle to overturn the antisodomy law, first introduced by the British colonial state in 1860. The campaign's breakthrough came in 2009 when the Delhi High Court furnished a historic decision in favor of decriminalization. However, through another curious feature of the Indian legal system, this decision was subsequently appealed in the Supreme Court by a ragtag group that was not even part of the original proceedings. Going against trends toward greater social acceptance within India and worldwide, two presiding Supreme Court justices unexpectedly overturned the high court judgment in 2013, re-criminalizing homosexuality in a nation that has the second largest population in the world. Despite this setback, the Supreme Court showed a glimmer of hope by agreeing to revisit its 2013 ruling through the curative petition - the vast majority of which are readily dismissed. Curative petitions have to adhere to narrowly defined parameters. As legal expert Alok Prasanna Kumar notes, they can be filed due to failure of justice (the petitioner was not heard by the court) or the undisclosed biases of the presiding judges that adversely affect the outcome. In this case, three senior apex court judges announced that the curative petition would be considered since the matter is of constitutional importance.Even with this encouraging development, the question of legal bias is entirely pertinent to the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling upholding the criminalization of homosexuality. The issue here is the extent to which judges, who are expected to be impartial arbiters, reflect pervasive cultural prejudices. These biases were clearly evident when the justices opined in the 2013 verdict that using the mouth as a sexual orifice goes against the order of nature. Also, when the unofficial transcripts (the Indian legal system does not release official transcripts) described the decidedly odd nature of the questions related to homosexuality asked by the justices during the hearings, they revealed the difficulties of two justices delivering a fair and objective ruling in a country with the second largest population in the world.   To be sure, not all justices share these cultural prejudices, as the Delhi High Court ruling attests. Indeed, as my own extensive research on this issue among state officials indicates, they hold a range of opinions, including the view that while they may not know much about homosexuality, they believe that gay and lesbian people should have the right to make a personal choice about their sexuality.  Legal bias also relates to institutional inconsistency. Mere months after the Supreme Court delivered its shocking verdict on re-criminalizing homosexuality in 2013, it furnished a path-breaking ruling affecting transgender persons and others who do not subscribe to gender binaries (woman and man). This judgment sought to correct society's moral failure to embrace different gender identities and expressions. Momentous as this decision was, it raises the question of how transgender persons or those who identify as third gender could be legally protected while same-sex sexual activity is still criminalized. For example, a transgender woman would be vulnerable under the antisodomy law for being sexually intimate with someone who also happens to have a male body. Ensuring social justice on account of gender identity is not going to be enough as long as homosexuality itself is outlawed.In the vast majority of cases, curative petitions are quickly dismissed. Surely, it is an encouraging sign that on February 2, 2016 the senior justices also announced that the curative petition would be heard by a full bench of five justices, led by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. While the legal process is expected to take months, there is every reason to be cautiously hopeful about the outcome. It is imperative to underscore that this is the apex court's last opportunity to live up to its promise as the font of justice. Difficult and complicated as it may be for the court to reverse its 2013 ruling, it is in a position to rewrite the history of homosexuality in India."

Its greater implication, whether Sanders wins or loses, is that America's crony capitalism will no longer go unchallenged. Thus Hillary Clinton and her husband, along with many others, are increasingly trapped by the wealth, credentials, and insider status they have pursued so fervently - because they derive from a corruption whose nature and consequences can no longer be concealed. America's financial elites are now so corrupt, arrogant, and predatory that political leaders beholden to them can't even pretend to deliver economic or political security, much less fairness or progress.And now, finally, Americans are running out of patience. In addition to Bernie Sanders, there's Elizabeth Warren, Zephyr Teachout, and even movies - The Big Short has (deservedly) grossed $100 million. Everything suggests that American politics is now truly, fundamentally, up for grabs - a hugely exciting but also terrifying prospect. In America, the Great Depression yielded Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal; but in Europe, it created Hitler and Mussolini. America's reaction against its corruption and decline could show us at our best - or our worst.Indeed, this is the Democratic establishment's rejoinder to Bernie Sanders: he's a wonderful dreamer, but impractical - he can't get elected, so we'd get Trump or Cruz, and furthermore even if Bernie was elected, he couldn't get anything done. Look at Dodd-Frank and Obamacare, they say - those laws barely passed. No way could Bernie break up the banks. Only a pragmatic, moderate insider can get anywhere.Actually the truth is exactly the opposite. American insider politics is now so corrupt that nobody within it can get anything done. But by stepping outside of the rules, you could do a great deal. Let's take a concrete example - the banks.Start with Hillary Clinton. The sound bite is that Goldman Sachs paid her $675K for three speeches. The full reality is far worse. She, her husband, and their advisers have history with the banks going back decades. Bill Clinton made Robert Rubin, former president of Goldman Sachs, his Treasury secretary, then appointed Larry Summers and Laura Tyson to succeed him, and re-appointed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Fed. Together, they let the banks run amok; in fact, they helped them. They repealed Glass-Steagall, banned the regulation of derivatives, refused to use the Fed's authority to regulate the mortgage industry, and did nothing as massive securities fraud permeated the Internet bubble. Then Rubin became vice-chairman of Citigroup, while Tyson joined the board of Morgan Stanley. Bill Clinton, Rubin, Summers, Tyson, and Greenspan all share major responsibility for the 2008 global financial crisis, and none of them have been remotely honest about it.Since leaving office, both Bill and Hillary have made millions of dollars giving speeches to banks while being remarkably quiet about prosecution of financial crime, not to mention the Obama administration's appalling record since the crisis - zero prosecutions, bankers in senior regulatory positions, inviting bank CEOs to state dinners dozens of times, et cetera. Now Hillary says she'll rely on Bill for economic policy. Bad idea. The financial sector became a pervasively criminal and economically destabilizing industry largely through Clinton policies, and now Hillary takes their money. When pressed, Democratic insiders concede all this, but then say, well, OK, the financial sector is just too powerful to rein in, but think of what Hillary could do in, say, education.Let us therefore take a brief tour of the Education Management Corporation (EDMC), one of the most repulsively predatory companies in America. EDMC specialized in exploiting poor people seeking to better themselves educationally. It used fraudulent marketing, luring students into paying high tuition - by taking out student loans signed over to EDMC. EDMC kept all the money, but provided abysmal schooling with high dropout rates. EDMC made huge profits while poor students wasted time, obtained no skills, and dropped out with crushing debts.EDMC raked in $11 billion this way. Assuming, say, $11,000 per student, EDMC screwed one million poor Americans. Eventually the Justice Department sued, but as usual the settlement was a wrist-slap with no criminal prosecutions, no admission of guilt, and no financial relief to victims.But why am I telling you all this?Well, now. Who devised EDMC's strategy, aided by relaxed Federal regulation? Who was EDMC's largest shareholder, buying 41% of the company in 2006?Goldman Sachs.Now, Hillary, when you and Bill have your little cocktail parties for the Clinton Foundation in Goldman Sachs offices, when you give your speeches to Goldman Sachs executives, when you chat them up for donations, when you meet them at White House state dinners, just how frequently do you bring this up?OK, Hillary ain't so great. But could Bernie do any better? Well, he could appoint an Attorney General and a head of the DOJ Criminal Division who haven't spent their careers defending corporate criminals, and then invite the Justice Department to put lots of bankers in jail. (There is overwhelming evidence to justify doing so; for details, read this, or chapter 6 of this.) Bernie could also appoint an Antitrust Division head who would actually investigate the cozy, cartel-like arrangements that pervade finance, and bring major cases against the banks. He could appoint a Federal Reserve chair who would require banks to divest assets and operate safely, plus regulating bankers' compensation so that if you caused a disaster, you couldn't profit from it. All this can be done without a single new law, and both Bill Clinton and Obama could have done them too.Now, can Bernie Sanders get elected? And are we willing to take the risk that if he loses, we'd get an insane Neanderthal like Trump or Cruz running the country? Honestly, I'm not sure. For one thing, Bernie had better stop calling himself a socialist. But I'm damned sure that if he was elected, he'd do a lot more than Hillary Clinton would. And I think that the American people have figured this out."

My work with the poor and the incarcerated has persuaded me that the opposite of poverty is not wealth; the opposite of poverty is justice... I’ve come to believe that the true measure of our commitment to justice, the character of our society, our commitment to the rule of law, fairness, and equality cannot be measured by how we treat the rich, the powerful, the privileged, and the respected among us. The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned.”Bryan Stevenson’s inspiring and best-selling book Just Mercy shares some of the fruits of his lifelong fight to push our nation closer to true justice. In January our nation took two more steps forward in the ongoing struggle to treat children like children and ensure a fairer justice system for all, especially for our poor and those of color.In 2012 Bryan Stevenson won the landmark United States Supreme Court case Miller v. Alabama banning mandatory sentences of life in prison without parole for children 17-years-old and younger. Until then the United States was the only country in the world that routinely condemned children convicted of crimes as young as 13 and 14 to die in prison. After that ruling most states that had sentenced youths to mandatory life sentences gave them the opportunity to argue for reduced sentences or apply for parole. Seven did not: Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana and Pennsylvania. Three of these, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and Michigan, accounted for more than 1,100 of the 1,200-1,500 inmates still imprisoned for crimes committed as children. A January 25 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Montgomery v. Louisiana made clear that the Miller decision must be applied retroactively in every state. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the decision, “The opportunity for release will be afforded to those who demonstrate the truth of Miller’s central intuition — that children who commit even heinous crimes are capable of change.”One of Bryan Stevenson’s searing stories in Just Mercy is about a child sentenced to life in prison without parole. Ian Manuel pled guilty to armed robbery and attempted murder for a crime he committed with two older boys when he was thirteen. He was incarcerated at Apalachee Correctional Institution in Florida, an adult prison, and sent to solitary confinement: “Solitary confinement at Apalachee means living in a concrete box the size of a walk-in closet . . . If you shout or scream, your time in solitary is extended; if you hurt yourself by refusing to eat or mutilating your body, your time in solitary is extended . . . In solitary Ian became a self-described ‘cutter’; he would take anything sharp on his food tray to cut his wrists and arms just to watch himself bleed. His mental health unraveled, and he attempted suicide several times. Each time he hurt himself or acted out, his time in isolation was extended. Ian spent 18 years in uninterrupted solitary confinement”—despite calls from even his victim about his inhumane confinement.Tragically Ian Manuel’s story is not unique. The same day the U.S. Supreme Court decided Montgomery v. Louisiana, President Obama announced a ban on solitary confinement in the federal prison system for all children and youths, and for adults incarcerated for “low-level infractions” in an executive action that should serve as a model for all states and local jurisdictions. The President wrote solitary confinement “has been linked to depression, alienation, withdrawal, a reduced ability to interact with others and the potential for violent behavior. Some studies indicate that it can worsen existing mental illnesses and even trigger new ones. Prisoners in solitary are more likely to commit suicide, especially juveniles and people with mental illnesses. The United States is a nation of second chances, but the experience of solitary confinement too often undercuts that second chance. . . . In America, we believe in redemption. We believe, in the words of Pope Francis, that ‘every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes.’ We believe that when people make mistakes, they deserve the opportunity to remake their lives. And if we can give them the hope of a better future, and a way to get back on their feet, then we will leave our children with a country that is safer, stronger and worthy of our highest ideals.”Reaching that vision of America—the one that believes in redemption and hope and equal justice for all—is the goal Bryan Stevenson has been striving for throughout his life. His critical victories over 30 years exonerating innocent death row prisoners and helping ensure fairer treatment for others, along with his earlier success before the U.S. Supreme Court in Roper v. Simmons that banned the execution of children have convinced him you cannot make a difference and create justice until you get close to the people who are struggling. He has said, “All of my clients are broken. They’ve been broken by poverty. They’ve been broken by racism. They’ve been broken by inequality. They’ve been broken by injustice. . . . When you’re broken you need grace. When you’re broken you need love. When you’re broken you need fellowship. When you’re broken you need understanding. When you’re broken you need vision.” Bryan Stevenson is unwavering in that vision and in lifting his voice of great moral clarity at the forefront of the struggle. Every new hard-earned and overdue victory should remind us all that we must keep moving towards greater justice for all."
15,COLLEGE,Higher Education Group Roiled By Sexual Assault Claim Against Board Member,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/asca-sexual-assault_us_56b38334e4b01d80b24556c3,The organization trains administrators to handle sexual misconduct cases on campus.,2016-02-05,The Association for Student Conduct Administration has been rocked by a sexual assault allegation from one board member against another. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b3ace81f00000d012175c4.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A top official in a higher education group representing administrators who handle student misconduct cases resigned after a fellow board member accused him of sexual assault. Jill Creighton accused Jason Casares of sexual assault during a fraternity advisers conference in December. Both of them were board members of the Association for Student Conduct Administration, a group that trains and provides guidance for college officials dealing with student misconduct, including sexual assault.Creighton released a letter dated Feb. 3 that is being circulated widely among college administrators just as an annual ASCA conference began in Florida on Thursday. In the letter, Creighton said Casares ""took advantage"" of her and is under investigation for a ""sex offense,"" and said she's taking a leave of absence from the organization.Casares denies the charges, but resigned his position following an investigation by an outside law firm hired by the ASCA board. Police in Fort Worth, Texas -- where the conference and alleged assault took place -- confirmed to The Huffington Post on Thursday that they received a sexual assault report against Casares just after 9:30 p.m. on Dec. 9. Since there is an open investigation in connection with the report, Fort Worth police said they could not release further details. On Thursday morning, ASCA's Board of Directors released a statement to its members saying that Casares resigned his position on Jan. 29, but that came after an investigation that cleared him of the accusations. Each year, the ASCA board rotates the members elected to the positions of president-elect, president and past president. Casares had been the current president-elect, and Creighton had been elected president-elect for the 2016-17 term. Creighton said she is protesting against ASCA for not canceling Casares' presentations on campus sexual assault investigations at the group's annual conference this week, and for not living up to the group's own ideals. Her letter said she still plans to attend the conference. ""If you see me during the conference, don’t avoid me,"" she wrote in her letter to colleagues. ""I may be upset, I may look defeated, I may even be crying, but I need your strength and support. I am here. I am not leaving. I can be both a survivor and your President-Elect. I declined to take on the role of president right away, though the bylaws permitted it, as I still need time to heal, and to become more seasoned as a leader."" Creighton declined to be interviewed for this story, but said briefly that her reason for going public was to help the organization improve its handling of such matters and to help the organization's practices reflect the care and concern she and her colleagues apply to their students. She also noted that going public was a risk to her professional life: ""I have everything to lose and nothing to gain.""Casares declined to comment directly, but attorney F. Anthony Paganelli said on his behalf that Casares completely denies the sexual assault accusation. The whole process of the ASCA adjudication was supposed to be kept confidential, Paganelli said, adding, ""We are very disappointed that she made any statements at all.""The ASCA board declined to provide further comment. Casares is an associate dean of students and director of the Office of Student Ethics at Indiana University in Bloomington. He has spoken at conferences about sexual violence investigations, while ASCA was busy taking on new members and speaking with members of Congress about the issue amid increased scrutiny of how schools handle campus rape. During an interview with HuffPost in October, Casares mentioned that American culture overall needed to change to address sexual violence. ""We can't even sell hamburgers without a half-naked female eating a burger, and that's problematic,"" Casares told HuffPost, in reference to Hardee's commercials. He said too many students arrive on campus believing a woman must be drunk in order to have sex. Creighton said in her letter that the incident between her and Casares happened after drinks. ""I made the mistake of letting my guard down while socializing with Jason about Association business,"" Creighton said in her letter. ""Jason took advantage of me after I had had too much to drink. I filed a criminal complaint with the police in Texas, and then decided that I felt unsafe in ASCA. I also could not stand the hypocrisy of Jason parading his expertise on Title IX, knowing how he had behaved with me. While I knew it could blow up in my face, and that I had nothing to gain but my own sense of safety, I asked ASCA to impeach Jason.""ASCA hired an independent investigator from the law firm of Hutcheson Bowers LLP to conduct an investigation and present findings to the board. Creighton's claims could not be substantiated, the law firm concluded, and so the complaint was resolved in Executive Session.""The complaint resolution process has come to a close for the Association and we are focused on the future and moving forward,"" ASCA's board said to members on Thursday. ""We hope that all of our 1,025 conference attendees have a fulfilling conference experience and we look forward to providing an update to all of our members regarding the accomplishments from the past year and the priorities for the upcoming year.""Creighton said she was not informed of the details of the internal sanctioning. Paganelli, the lawyer representing Casares, said his client only resigned after the investigation concluded and after he was ""exonerated"" against the charges.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) agree on goals -- and how differently they imagine achieving them.Both Clinton and Sanders support universal health care. That is, both Clinton and Sanders think everybody should be able to pay their medical bills and that only the government can see to that. Both Clinton and Sanders agree that achieving this goal requires action -- even now, with the Affordable Care Act in place -- because millions remain uninsured and millions more with coverage still struggle with their medical bills.But that’s where the agreement breaks down.Clinton wants to build on the existing system -- to use the infrastructure that Obamacare has created and improve it incrementally, adding new protections against out-of-pocket costs and getting moderately tougher with the prescription drugs.Sanders, by contrast, wants to replace existing insurance arrangements with a single, government-run program that would insure everybody and provide far more generous coverage than exists today.In an early debate exchange, Clinton explained why she favors this step-by-step approach. She thinks the Affordable Care Act achieved a great deal and, more important, she doesn’t want to start a whole new reform effort.“I don't want us to start over again,” Clinton said. “I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for health care.”Sanders responded that it was unconscionable to leave people uninsured -- and that he thought the only path forward was to blow up the status quo and build something new, even if it takes a political revolution to do it.“Every major country on earth, whether it's the U.K., whether it's France, whether it's Canada, has managed to provide health care to all people as a right, and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are,” Sanders said. “So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can't do that.”Is Clinton too complacent about the way things are -- or too timid about seeking change? Could Sanders actually overcome the political resistance -- not just from special interests, but also from wary voters -- that his plan would provoke?How you answer that probably says a lot about which candidate you support.Read the latest updates on the Democratic debate below:"

He explained that he hopes to leave the state relatively successful as he heads to events he has already planned leading up to Republican primaries elsewhere, including South Carolina's on Feb. 20 and Nevada's caucus on Feb. 23.The third state the governor mentioned was the most surprising: Michigan, where the primary is held on March 8. For Kasich to mention that contest is a sign that he believes his campaign will survive past the 12 primaries held on March 1, Super Tuesday, and those that follow before the Michigan date.The candidate has been telling voters he will drop out of the race, however, if he does poorly in the Granite State.That means ""seventh place or something,"" Kasich told Fox, indicating what the bar would be for him to quit. The governor is currently polling fourth in New Hampshire, according to HuffPost Pollster's aggregation of polls.Kasich's optimism in the Fox interview was in keeping with what he is trying to pitch as the general tone of his campaign and the value of it in a packed race where many candidates are beginning to sound similar. ""Our ads are positive and they're different,"" the presidential hopeful said.He even tried some New Hampshire-specific humor, saying his campaign was ""built on granite, not built on sand.""Kasich has tried to project himself as a relatively moderate, experienced contender. Though he has condemned marriage equality and has weakened labor rights in his home state, the governor emphasizes government's role in caring for vulnerable citizens and has been less harsh on undocumented immigrants than his rivals. Real estate mogul Donald J. Trump currently leads the New Hampshire polls, according to HuffPost Pollster, with 33 percent. The next three candidates are all relatively close: Sen.

18,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton's Governing Vision Receives Affirmation... From Bernie Sanders,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders_us_56b4c9a1e4b08069c7a6ef96,"By his own accounts, Sanders is a ""progressive who gets things done"" too.",2016-02-05,Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have been talking about governing styles in their campaigns for the Democratic nomination.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the hotter debates happening in the Democratic nominating contest is really a dispute about governing style. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has argued that she's best-suited to be president at a time when the legislature is under control of the GOP because she's an operator, a ""progressive that gets things done."" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) counters by saying that Clinton's style too often leads to a watering down of liberal policy, or the easy acceptance of more moderate policies. And yet, at Thursday night's debate, Sanders described an accomplishment of his that essentially validated Clinton's theory of how she'd govern as president.How has Sanders presented his own theory of his presidency? He's repeatedly said that he'd overwhelm GOP legislative opposition by unleashing a grassroots movement behind his aims. He refers to this, often, as a mistake that President Barack Obama has made during his presidency -- the failure to use his coalition as a source of public pressure.This is a fair critique of Obama, and Sanders is hardly the first person to make it. And one can certainly point to the tea party as a group that demonstrated the tidal effect of a grassroots revolution. Public pressure from the right definitely accomplished two things: It created an opportunity for a range of conservative ideas and policies to grow in acceptance, and it got enough people elected to change the complexion of Congress. Of course, it also created a situation in which GOP machers like former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) could no longer govern effectively. It's still fair to say that the governing vision Sanders describes for his presidency is an abstract one. But what happens when Sanders describes how he's governed as a legislator? Suddenly, things get a lot more concrete. Here's how Sanders responded to MSNBC host Rachel Maddow during a discussion on privatizing the Department of Veterans Affairs (emphasis mine):MADDOW: Sen. Sanders, you, as a congressional leader on veterans issues and the Veterans Committee, you've worked in a very bipartisan way with Sen. John McCain and others on veterans issues. Is the right contour of the fight, the way she's talking about this issue?As Jonathan Chait pointed out Thursday night, as a presidential candidate, Sanders ""rejects ... the political model that treats pluralism as the normal model of political action"" and ""believes the interest of the public is not divided, it is united, and only the corrupt influence of big business has thwarted it."" But by his own account of the process by which this legislation was passed, the public pressure failed, and he had to go back and cut a deal, the end result of which was nevertheless, to his mind, ""the most comprehensive VA health care bill in the modern history of this country.""Now, perhaps Sanders is motivated to inspire a political revolution because he's seen bills fall short of the mark through this type of governance. And there is, of course, no guarantee that Clinton, were she in a similar position, wouldn't have settled for much less in the way of a piece of VA legislation.But he sure sounds like he's proud of what he accomplished in this instance, and for a minute there, it sounded like he was similarly enthusiastic about the way in which it was accomplished. And it was accomplished despite the corrupting influence of corporate outsiders and the ideological opposition of the Republican caucus.Sanders is right on the merits when he talks about the corrupting influence of money in politics, and history has proved that revolutionary populism can sometimes overcome those influences. But in this instance, what he describes validates the premise of Clinton's candidacy.Jason Linkins edits ""Eat The Press"" for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast ""So, That Happened.""

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- possibly partly last-minute undecided voters chose him and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) over Donald Trump. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b5038b1800006f0080b622.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the aftermath of Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) surprise Iowa win, pollsters have been trying to figure out why he and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) surged beyond expectations, even as businessman Donald Trump flopped. The reasons why pollsters got it wrong could be key to understanding how much trouble Trump faces in New Hampshire and beyond, and how accurate surveys of future primaries will be.There are two main theories:-- Polls screwed up in predicting which people would actually show up to the caucuses. Most analysts had predicted that high turnout would benefit Trump, but the record turnout instead brought out many of his detractors, including ""traditional,"" evangelical voters, while many of his backers stayed home. -- Voters changed their minds after most polls were finished. Undecided voters broke last-minute for Cruz and Rubio, and those backing Trump or other candidates decided at the last minute to switch sides.There is good evidence for both theories thanks to polling from SurveyMonkey that found significant momentum building toward Cruz and Rubio in the final week of polling, as well as an increasing share of evangelicals in the electorate.Now there's more hard data on exactly how big a role each of those factors played. Monmouth University -- which, like most other pollsters, found Trump ahead -- went back and recontacted 263 of the Republican voters it had originally talked to, finding evidence that both theories were true.Nearly a quarter of voters who'd supported Trump in Monmouth's final poll never ended up voting, compared to just 13 percent of Cruz and Rubio supporters.But the more important factor was the 21 percent of those who did make it to the polls but ended up switching their vote. Those switches largely worked in favor of Cruz and Rubio. Much of the last-minute shift is probably owed to Cruz's superior ground game. SurveyMonkey found that Cruz supporters were significantly more likely to get letters, emails and phone calls reminding them to vote. (It's also possible that some voters didn't want to admit to pollsters that they'd backed a losing candidate.)But Monmouth also found that half of the voters who jilted Trump were ""unhappy with his candidacy, including both his personality and ... his decision to skip the final debate,"" which came after most Iowa polls had left the field.“Donald Trump didn't go to the last debate. That made me think he didn't deserve it,"" one voter told pollsters.If Trump's numbers naturally crumble as voters start paying more attention, it ""would be the worst-case possibility for Mr. Trump,"" the New York Times' Nate Cohn wrote. ""It would mean his support really might evaporate ahead of future contests, as voters focus on other candidates and as he faces even more attacks. ... If skipping the last debate did it, then he can simply avoid making the same mistake again.""Ironically, despite his well-publicized fondness for touting polls conducted by other people, Trump hasn't done any of the internal polling that could help him answer those questions.“He doesn’t understand it as a predictive or testing tool,” a Republican strategist told NBC. “He’s only interested in ‘Am I ahead or behind’ -- which is the least important thing if you’re using polling for predictive purposes.”The reasons for the misfire also highlight a major limitation of primary election polling: While surveys remain pretty accurate on the whole, they're not particularly well-equipped to predict highly volatile races -- like, say, the New Hampshire primary.""The only thing that would have improved our model enough to reflect the final outcome would have been a time machine,"" Monmouth's Patrick Murray said in a statement. ""The polling industry is tackling a number of methodological challenges in our industry right now. Unfortunately, the ability to manipulate the time-space vortex is not one of the technological innovations we are currently exploring.”Until pollsters figure that one out, expect the occasional election night surprise. Monmouth's post-Iowa survey surveyed 263 of the 500 likely Republican caucusgoers polled in their final pre-Iowa survey."

Rand Paul (R-Ky.), former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R). But Republican voters would be fine with seeing the field get even smaller, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll.A majority of likely Republican voters think that every candidate save Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), businessman Donald Trump, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson should drop out. (The survey was conducted in part before Paul and Santorum's announcements, but finds ample support for the idea of them ending their respective campaigns.)The other GOP candidates whom voters say they wouldn't miss much include former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore.Even Carson is teetering on the bubble -- 43 percent say he should quit the race, compared to the 12 percent or fewer who say the same about Trump, Rubio or Cruz.About two-thirds of likely Republican voters are either satisfied with or enthusiastic about the Iowa caucus results. A 57 percent majority say that Cruz's win in Iowa is a sign that he's a serious challenger to win the Republican nomination. But an even stronger majority, 67 percent, say that Trump's Iowa loss is just a temporary setback.Trump is widely considered the favorite to win in New Hampshire's primary on Tuesday, but there's less certainty about his ability to become the eventual nominee.Instead, the predictions are about evenly divided among three candidates -- 29 percent think Rubio will win, 27 percent think Trump will and 24 percent think Cruz will. No other candidate is considered the likeliest nominee by more than 2 percent of respondents.Of the leading three, Rubio enjoys the highest net favorability, with GOP voters 52 points more likely to rate him positively than negatively, compared to a 34-point rating for Trump and a 35-point rating for Cruz.On the Democratic side, both former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) remain largely popular among likely primary voters, with Sanders especially well-liked. They have a 53-point and 65-point net favorability rating, respectively.Democratic voters consider both of their candidates viable contenders. Fifty-nine percent say Sanders' strong showing in the Iowa caucus marks him as a serious challenger to Clinton, but just a quarter of respondents believe his Iowa performance is a sign of trouble for the Clinton campaign.Looking ahead, a 53 percent majority expect Sanders to win in New Hampshire, but few expect him to clinch the nomination.

24,POLITICS,"Bernie Sanders Made Jewish History, Yet No One Seems To Be Kvelling",Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-jews-new-hampshire_us_56b3ca98e4b01d80b245adc1,"New Hampshire's Jews -- yes, they exist -- aren't even talking about it.",2016-02-05,Rabbi Robin Nafshi of Temple Beth Jacob leads discussions at the True Brew Barista coffee shop in downtown Concord.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b3d01b1800006f0080b52d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CONCORD, New Hampshire -- At a semi-circle table at the back of the True Brew Barista in downtown Concord, Rabbi Robin Nafshi of Temple Beth Jacob holds court on Thursday mornings. Congregants, or really anyone who wants a friendly ear, are invited to take a seat. They talk about spiritual journeys, cultural concerns and political happenings in the state capital. Nafshi is practically a fixture at the nearby statehouse. Last week, she testified there on three separate items: a bill on genetically modified foods and the implications for Kashrut dietary law, a debate over whether to give Christian prayers preferential treatment at the state's executive council (not surprisingly, she's opposed), and a proposal to suspend the death penalty.But even in a place where -- as Nafshi describes it -- politics is ""the state sport,"" there is one topic that rarely if ever gets discussed: the faith of the presidential candidate seemingly destined to win New Hampshire's Democratic primary next week.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is already a historic figure. He is the first Jewish candidate to win delegates in a presidential primary or caucus -- in fact, the first non-Christian presidential candidate to win a delegate. Come Tuesday, he is likely to be the first Jewish candidate to win a presidential primary election.But Sanders' faith is approached almost as an afterthought -- a biographical addendum that neither he nor his supporters find worth discussing. ""It's a guiding principle in my life -- absolutely it is,"" Sanders said at a Democratic forum in Derry, New Hampshire, on Wednesday night. But, he added, ""everybody practices religion in a different way.""For the state's small Jewish population -- Nafshi claims there is only one other person in Concord who wears a kippah ""and he just moved to Florida"" -- this has sparked a mix of emotions. Like the handful of other New Hampshire Jews interviewed for this piece (and yes, it was a reportorial feat to find that many), Nafshi feels an obvious sense of pride that Sanders has broken barriers like his Democratic rival (Hillary Clinton being the first female candidate to win the Iowa caucus) and his potential Republican opponent (Ted Cruz being the first Hispanic candidate to win any primary contest).But it is not so much pride in Bernie himself as it is in the place Judaism now occupies in the American cultural fabric.""It has provided real education to America about the fact that Jews come in all shapes and stripes,"" Nafshi said. ""That no, we are not all keeping kosher or observing the Sabbath -- that the way American Jews live our lives is as diverse as any group of people, perhaps even more diverse. I think that's one of the things that has been really quite educational with his candidacy.""If there is one defining feature about Sanders' Judaism, it is how un-defining it is. The senator doesn't wear his faith on his sleeve in part many suspect because he isn't really all that religious. He was born Jewish, lost relatives in the Holocaust and spent time on a kibbutz. But as professor Pamela Nadell, a prominent Jewish-American historian at American University, put it, ""He is just not actively involved in the contemporary Jewish community."" No clearer evidence of that could have come than on the day of the Jewish new year this past September, when Sanders traveled to Jerry Falwell's Liberty University, of all places, for a campaign speech. But it's true in his personal life as well. As Jonathan Sarna, a professor of American Jewish history at Brandeis University, noted, Sanders is married to a non-Jew and his grandchildren are Christian (while Donald Trump has Jewish grandchildren). ""He is totally secular,"" said Sarna. Sanders' public persona is so secular in fact that many of the people interviewed for this piece said they hadn't even considered his faith. ""It didn't even dawn on me until tonight,"" said Moriah Gavrish, 31, of Derry, who is a strongly leaning Sanders supporter.Others simply viewed it as a hip oddity that only added to the candidate's allure. ""It is a plus. It is a nice quality. I think highly of myself and I'm a Jew. It is new. It is trendy,"" said Jack Johnson, 19, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, who stood outside the town hall forum on Wednesday. Alongside him was Justin Reynolds, 26, who lives in Derry. The two could probably be described as Bernie Bros. ""Have we ever had a Jewish president before? I don't think so. It would be cool. We have a black president. Let's do it!"" said Reynolds.To the extent that reactions like these reflect a cultural assimilation, they have heartened Jews in New Hampshire and elsewhere. But if indifference to Sanders' Judaism was the main theme in discussions of the topic with New Hampshire's Jewish voters, foreboding was the secondary one.Should Sanders end up winning the Democratic nomination, not everyone is convinced that his religion will remain so politically innocuous.""We are in a climate where it is not just [politically tricky] to be a Jew, obviously. It could be anything,"" said Rabbi Jonathan Spira-Savett of Temple Beth Abraham in Nashua, when asked if he was worried that the senator's Judaism might be used in subtle or not-so-subtle ways against him in a general election. ""It could be to be a Muslim, to be a woman, to be black, to be gay, any of those things. We are certainly not at the point in our society where those things are off-limits in some segments. And, yeah, I would think about that and would worry about that.""Others are certain that Sanders' religion would be used against him in a general election contest. ""It is rather curious that it hasn't been brought up, but I would hope that thinking people have moved beyond that,"" said Peter McVay, of Atkinson, New Hampshire. ""Of course it will be [brought up in the general election], but certainly not by those who are thinkers.""Whether Sanders' religion ultimately is raised and whether the fallout is damaging are two very different things, of course.Sitting in the back of the coffee shop, Nafshi recalled how vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman -- a far more observant Jew than Sanders -- was pressed during the 2000 campaign about his faith's effect on his public life and how there was no apparent negative consequence for the Democratic ticket. If it didn't matter then, she suggested, it likely wouldn't now: ""It would be hard to critique a president based on his religion when he will tell you first and foremost he has no religion.""Lieberman went on to run for president in 2004 and never won a delegate. Through a spokesperson, the former Connecticut senator declined to comment for this article. Since Lieberman's bid, there have been many more examples of Jews either ascending to high office or aspiring to it. And for Jewish-American historians, that alone suggests the country is, indeed, comfortable with the prospect of one in the White House. In an age when presidential candidates from Al Gore to the Clintons and Trump ""all have Jewish family members and when there are three Jewish justices on the Supreme Court and when Michael Bloomberg might also throw his hat into the ring, a Jewish candidate is just not that newsworthy,"" Sarna argued. ""If we had a mainstream Mormon,"" he asked referencing Mitt Romney, ""why not a Jew?"""

The weekly HBO show is just one piece of a broader push into TV throughout 2016.

The thing about being new and innovative, you have to try a lot of things first to find out what works because it hasn’t been done before.”Smith said they're still determining how to cover stories like the 2016 election in ""a Vice way,"" a challenge that has been ""the whole structural, sort of algorithmic Rubik’s cube.""This moment for Vice, Smith said, is ""a once in a lifetime opportunity.""""We’re in the right place at the right time, with the right show, the right time for the cultural zeitgeist and the right platform partner,"" he said.

27,POLITICS,Undecided Democrats Want More Debates Between Sanders And Clinton,Janie Velencia,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-more-debates_us_56b3cabde4b08069c7a6a559,It probably would help them decide.,2016-02-05,A new poll finds that 41 percent of undecided Democrats would like to see more debates held between Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b3d2341a00002d00ab20a9.jpeg?cache=WeYgYY0Oaa&ops=crop_175_145_3451_2118%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Undecided Democratic voters say there have been too few presidential debates, according to a poll released Friday morning. The poll, conducted by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling for ""The Agenda With Ari Rabin-Havt"" on Sirius XM, finds that 41 percent of undecided Democratic voters, which make up 14 percent of the poll, express dissatisfaction with the number of debates held between Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. About one-third of the undecideds are satisfied, however, and say the Democratic party has held the right number of debates. Twelve percent say it has held too many. Overall, half of all Democrats in the poll are satisfied with the number of debates while 30 percent think there haven't been enough. Sanders supporters are twice as likely as Clinton supporters to say there have been too few debates, by a margin of 20 percent to 42 percent. The Democratic National Committee first announced the Democratic debate schedule, which included six debates, in May of last year. Since then, the Sanders campaign has continuously objected to the schedule, arguing that there were too few debates and they aired at odd times, making it difficult for people to tune in. In February, the campaigns reached an agreement to add four more debates to the schedule that both sides deemed acceptable. The first of the set was held Thursday night in New Hampshire and the next is set to take place in Flint, Michigan, on March 6. Clinton currently leads Sanders in a hypothetical national primary election. According to PPP, 53 percent of likely Democratic voters in the poll would vote for Clinton and 35 percent would vote for Sanders. Similarly, Clinton leads by a 14-point margin in the HuffPost Pollster average, which aggregates all publicly available polls. PPP surveyed 517 likely Democratic primary voters on landlines using automated phone technology on Feb. 2-3. Also on HuffPost:"
28,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: New Hampshire Primaries Could Bring More Surprises,"Natalie Jackson, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-hampshire-primary-outlook_us_56b49ce7e4b04f9b57d92d0d,“The New Hampshire primary is famous for things going bananas at the last minute.”,2016-02-05,About a third of 18 to 29-year-olds name social media as most helpful type of source for learning about the 2016 presidential election,http://www.journalism.org/files/2016/02/PJ_2016.02.04_election-news_0-02.png,"Pollsters warn that the New Hampshire primaries could offer surprises. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are maintaining their comfortable leads in the Granite State, but Marco Rubio seems to be surging. And your age probably determines how you get your news about the election. This is HuffPollster for Friday, February 4, 2016.OPINIONS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE CAN SHIFT QUICKLY - Steve Koczela: ""The polls in the first-in-the-nation primary have been pretty stable in recent weeks, in terms of the story they are telling and the amount of variation between polls. Donald Trump has remained way ahead of a rotating cast of second- and third-place runners in the Republican race, and his support level has been stable. And Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders holds a sizable and apparently widening lead on the Democratic side. But the New Hampshire primary is famous for things going bananas at the last minute, so a clear race now is very different than a foregone conclusion. And with a come-from-behind win for Republican Ted Cruz in Iowa Monday night, anything could still happen. [WBUR] Trump has a solid lead but there is room for surprise - Nate Silver: ""[W]hile we’re mostly taking a wait-and-see approach...I feel reasonably comfortable with the following three conclusions: Trump remains the favorite in New Hampshire. Even if you expect Trump’s numbers to decline further and for him to underperform his polls on Election Day, he starts with a pretty big cushion. Rubio is the most likely candidate to knock Trump off. That’s the conclusion of polls-plus, which gives Rubio a 16 percent chance of winning New Hampshire. Rubio has gained more ground than Cruz in the polls we’ve seen so far, and he’s better-suited to New Hampshire. Volatility remains really high. Like Iowa, New Hampshire is a hard state to poll. For one thing, the post-Iowa bounces may not be fully ‘priced in’ yet.” [538] RUBIO RISES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AFTER STRONG FINISH IN IOWA - Four new polls, conducted completely after the Iowa caucuses, show Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) getting a boost from his strong finish Monday night. Donald Trump still leads the field, averaging 33 percent in the HuffPost Pollster average, but Rubio is up to an average of 14 percent from 10 percent just a few days ago. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) does not seem to be gaining much from his Iowa win, staying at a fairly consistent average of 13 percent. [CNN/UNH/WMUR, ARG, NBC/WSJ/Marist, UMass Lowell/7 News, HuffPost]SANDERS MAINTAINS LARGE LEAD - Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) is holding on to a 22-point lead in New Hampshire after running a very close race in Iowa, according to the HuffPost Pollster average. There is some evidence Clinton could be surging: A tracking poll from the University of Massachusetts-Lowell and 7 News shows Clinton up 10 points compared to their pre-Iowa polls. Notably, though, post-Iowa polls from CNN/University of New Hampshire/WMUR and NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist show no change in the race. Sanders has 58 percent support in the HuffPost Pollster average, and Clinton is far behind, averaging 36 percent. [CNN/UNH/WMUR, NBC/WSJ/Marist, UMass Lowell/7 News, HuffPost]PRIMARY POLLS ARE IMPERFECT - Nora Kelly: ""The conventional wisdom going into the Iowa caucuses held that, if voter turnout was high, Donald Trump would take the state...But what actually happened Monday night confirmed another, perhaps quieter suspicion among primary-cycle observers: that Cruz’s ground game, and greater support among evangelicals, would carry the day. For those shocked by the GOP results, take heart: Iowa is notoriously fickle, and not even top pollsters firmly predicted a win for Trump or Cruz, despite assumptions to the contrary. And it’d be wise to steel yourself for more unpredictability in the minutes, hours, and days leading up to next week’s primary in New Hampshire. 'We really do tend to look at [polls] as if they are somehow predictive...The best you can do is approximate and, if you’re a pollster, hope that the trends don’t shift on you,' David Redlawsk, the director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Poll, said with a laugh. 'But they often do.'” [Atlantic] Lessons from past New Hampshire surprises - Steven Shepard: “[I]t’s worth recalling the most famous example of the failure of pre-election surveys to predict the outcome of the New Hampshire primary....[In 2008, Hillary] Clinton stormed from behind in the race’s final 24 hours, leading pollsters – including the industry’s professional organization, the American Association for Public Opinion Research – to conduct thorough reviews of industry practices. Their most basic conclusion: Polls that stop days before the primary miss important shifts in voter preference that occur right up until Election Day. [Politico]DO LOW RESPONSE RATE MEAN LESS ACCURATE POLLS? - HuffPollster: ""Pollsters face a growing obstacle in gathering Americans’ opinions: getting people to answer their calls. The proportion of people called who answer the survey -- in pollster jargon, the 'response rate' -- has dropped dramatically over the last few decades as Americans have changed how they interact with the world…. A 2012 report from Pew Research, one of the nation's most reputable pollsters, showed a 9 percent response rate, compared to nearly 40 percent in the late 1990s…. Americans' increasing unwillingness to answer their phones makes conducting telephone polls trickier and more expensive. But whether it also makes surveys less accurate hinges on something called ""nonresponse bias"" -- whether the people who answer polls, as a group, hold different opinions from the ones who don't. So far, that hasn't really been the case."" [HuffPost] LIKELY PRIMARY VOTERS RELY ON CABLE TV FOR ELECTION NEWS - Damon Beres: ""Most Americans prefer cable news to social media and websites when learning about the election, a survey published Thursday indicates. Ninety-one percent of U.S. adults say they got new information about the election in the past week, and 24 percent of those say cable TV news was the ""most helpful"" source. Social media came in second, with 14 percent calling it the most helpful, putting it on par with local TV (also 14 percent), while 13 percent favored news websites and apps. The survey also found that cable TV is the most prominent source for people who are ""very likely to participate"" in a primary or caucus. That said, the findings, which were gathered by the Pew Research Center, change dramatically depending on which age group you're looking at.

Hillary Clinton's candidacy has a very compelling mission: She'll hold fast against the GOP's attempts to roll back the accomplishments of the Obama administration. Bernie Sanders presents himself equally compellingly: Holding what's been gained isn't good enough; real progress requires a revolution. For a time, this was a heady debate about the future of a party. But as we entered this week, it's taken a personal turn and is now, essentially, a pissing contest over who's more progressive. At this week's debate, Clinton and Sanders were drawn into this argument from the outset.""Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals,"" Clinton said. ""I've been fighting for universal health care for many years. We're now on the path to achieving it. I don't want us to start over again.""She went on to stake out goals on a range of issues, all of which fell short of the mark Sanders is personally seeking. The difference, Clinton said, is that Sanders' ""numbers just don't add up.""Sanders struck a civil chord, but objected to the idea that he would ""start over again."" ""I'm on the health, education, labor committee [which] wrote the Affordable Care Act. The idea I would dismantle health care in America while we're waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate.""The argument continued, however. Clinton made note of the fact that many Democrats would not be deemed sufficiently progressive under Sanders' definition, from President Barack Obama to the late Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone. Sanders insisted that this whole conflict began when Clinton, earlier in the campaign, self-proclaimed herself as a moderate.""I said I'm a progressive that likes to get things done,"" Clinton responded, ""Cherry-picking quotes doesn't get things done.""There is, of course, one thing that's revealed a fundamental difference between the two candidates and that drives both the thoughtful and the petty aspects of their rivalry. That thing? Wall Street, and its specter of influence that Sanders has, not so subtly, suggested governs Clinton's decision-making. Clinton has, in past debates, done herself no favors with her bizarre ripostes to Sanders' accusations -- the most famous of which is the claim that her relationship with powerful financial institutions is a mere byproduct of their geographic proximity to the Sept. 11 attacks.On the debate stage, that divide once again featured prominently, with Sanders framing Hillary as part of an implicitly corrupt ""establishment."" ""What being part of the establishment is,"" Sanders averred, ""is in the last quarter having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street.""Clinton responded that this was an ""insinuation"" -- ""If you've got something to say, say it directly. You will not find that i ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received... I think it's time to end the artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeks and let's talk about the issues that divide us.""And that was just the first half-hour of this debate.There's no doubt that Sanders presents a unique problem for Clinton. She sees the near future as one in which she -- a proven warrior against Republican slings and arrows -- serves as a lonely bulwark against the dismantling of progressive accomplishment. But Sanders is selling glittering visions of a progressive revolution. It's up to Clinton to sell her mission as the more realistic, and to point out that Sanders is going to get his teeth kicked in by an angry and entrenched GOP and that he's had it pretty easy being an independent winning elections in safe Vermont.For a while, it looked like we'd have a debate over these competing visions. That it's skidded into this contretemps over who has the purest progressive bona fides is bad news for both candidates. For Clinton, it's simply a war she can't win and should avoid fighting in the first place, lest she become more reactive than strategic. And for Sanders, the pettiness cuts against the respectful tone of competitiveness he laid out from the outset, and it's starting to make him look less like a principled revolutionary and more like a conventional politician. It's a street fight tailor-made to sow resentment and depress turnout, and you have to imagine that the GOP candidates do not mind it one bit.Also on this week's podcast, Fordham law professor Zephyr Teachout, who made a surprisingly strong showing in her upset bid to unseat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has set her sights on New York's 19th Congressional District. She's aiming to apply her work in fighting corruption to one of Washington's most broken institutions, and she joins us today to tell us how she'll get there.This week, reform-minded Wisconsin Republican Rep.

33,POLITICS,Chris Christie Will Charm The Hell Out Of Nancy Pelosi As President,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-president_us_56b4f621e4b01d80b24629b8,"Get ready for chocolates and airplane rides, Leader Pelosi",2016-02-05,Chris Christie is confident he could charm House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b4f6cb1800006f0080b60f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Stratham, N.H. -- Gov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.) on Friday pledged to be a charmer of a president, dispensing airplane rides and chocolate gifts to recalcitrant Democrats in order to win their votes.“Nancy Pelosi would be on Air Force One every time she turns around,” Christie said of his tactical approach to Hill outreach. “Come on Nancy. Let’s go take a ride. Take the M&M’s. It will be fun, I don’t care.”“If I’m president, I will be given the greatest tools to be able to do this that anybody has had in their life, the greatest home field advantage ever,” Christie added. “You have the White House, Camp David, Air Force One, Marine One, if you can’t persuade somebody to do something with all that, you are in the wrong business. Right now I’m just doing it on my charm and good looks for God’s sake.”Chris Christie, political seductress, is not an image that quickly comes to mind for those who best know him as the brash, insult-spewing, truth-telling Republican governor of a Democratic-leaning state. And indeed, it’s not exactly the image that Christie has been cultivating in recent days on the trail, where he has made his best attempt to rip the political flesh off Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) after the Senator’s unexpectedly strong third-place finish in the Iowa Caucus.Christie still had tough words for Rubio at Friday’s stop at the Timberland factory in Stratham, New Hampshire -- accusing the senator of being in over his head when it comes to potentially running the country.But the tone of the town hall was decidedly geared towards presenting Christie as collaborative, not combative. And for a governor squeezed between an unapologetic wing of his party’s candidates and several other moderate governors, it seemed like a tactical readjustment in the closing days of the New Hampshire primary.At times, Christie seemed to actively portray himself as willing to buck conservative orthodoxy. He noted his support for legislation prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from buying firearms and even conceded that he might not be able to repeal Obamacare without the help of Congress.“If somehow the Congress is split, then it becomes a lot harder right, because you will need Democrats who voted for Obamacare to vote to repeal Obamacare,” he said.Christie then went on to praise George W. Bush for two conservative heresies: No Child Left Behind and immigration reform. He didn’t say he supported either legislative effort. But he complimented the former president for working across the aisle to try and get them done.The riff was meant as a way to dig at President Barack Obama for not doing the same. But Christie didn't stop there.“You also have guys on our side who are no walk in the park to deal with,” he added, before singling out just one.“I mean, we closed down the government in 2013. That was a brilliant strategy. I remember asking Senator [Ted] Cruz at the time: ‘What’s the end game?’ ... He said to me, ‘Governor, we close down the government, Barack Obama will capitulate and he will sign a repeal of Obamacare.’ I said, ‘Let me tell you something. I’ve dealt with this guy a heck of a lot more than you have. Personally, there is not a chance.’ They could take his family hostage. He’s not going to repeal Obamacare.”"

If you believed the reports or that one ""Oprah"" episode or the doozy that is Lawrence Wright's Remembering Satan, Satanic ritual abuse was probably a frequent witching-hour pastime in your neighbor's barn. Which brings us to ""Regression,"" a new horror movie directed by Alejandro Amenábar (""The Others""). The Huffington Post has an exclusive clip from the 1990-set film, which opens domestically this weekend. The clip begins with Ethan Hawke talking to Emma Watson about someone having ""summoned the devil."" That someone includes her father, who has been accused of violating her during a sadistic act. But neither remembers the crime (this was common during SRA panic), so Hawke plays a detective investigating the allegations and ""Harry Potter"" co-star David Thewlis plays a psychologist uncovering their memories.Watch the clip below.

39,POLITICS,Michigan GOP Whitewashes Rick Snyder's Role In Flint Water Crisis,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flint-water-rick-snyder-gop_us_56b4cda7e4b01d80b245fb36,They probably shouldn't have published this infographic,2016-02-05,"The Michigan GOP seems to think that Gov. Rick Snyder is the hero of the Flint water crisis, but the facts tell a different story.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b4cff01800002d0080b5bf.jpeg?ops=crop_0_237_5184_2518%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The Michigan Republican party would like you to know that Gov. Rick Snyder (R) has been busy trying to heal the city of Flint while the malevolent Obama administration has only stood in the way.That's the message of an infographic the state party started putting out on social media on Thursday. The light blue water droplets on the left represent actions Snyder has taken since October, when his administration admitted its own mistakes created a crisis in Flint, a city whose 100,000 residents still can't drink the water because of high lead levels. The dark blue droplets supposedly show unhelpful actions taken by the Obama administration, such as the refusal to declare a federal disaster area in the state (it declared an emergency instead). Though Snyder and Michigan Republicans have approved tens of millions of dollars in assistance for Flint residents, The Huffington Post asked the Michigan GOP if the infographic might be more complete with a drop on the left side for ""caused the crisis"" and maybe another for ""ignored repeated warnings."" The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality has repeatedly admitted -- most recently on Wednesday -- that it should have made sure Flint's water was treated to prevent it from leaching lead from the city's pipes. Lead is a deadly neurotoxin that can cause permanent brain damage in children. The agency's director resigned in December.Last year state officials brushed off warnings of higher rates of lead poisoning and Legionnaires' disease, telling Flint residents their water was safe even though it looked and tasted bad. Flint residents had been complaining ever since an emergency manager appointed by Snyder oversaw the city's switch to the Flint River as its water source in 2014. In February of last year Flint residents protested in the streets; this week they brought bottles of brown water to the U.S. Capitol. The graphic does make a fair point that the federal Environmental Protection Agency helped the state downplay an alarming June 2014 memo drafted by Miguel Del Toral, an EPA official who started investigating the lead problem early last year. The EPA has since fired its regional manager and issued an emergency order that accused the state's environmental regulator of continuously dragging its feet. Another dark blue droplet complains the Obama administration denied Snyder's request to expand a federal nutrition program for moms with young kids so that more Flint children could have access. But federal data show that statewide, the Snyder administration is only connecting half of eligible kids to the program to begin with."
40,BUSINESS,The Limits Of Obama’s Favorite Economic Theory,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-nudges-behavioral-economics_us_56b25b28e4b08069c7a5cea3,Sometimes a nudge isn't enough.,2016-02-05,President Barack Obama believes in subtly helping steer people away from predatory financial products. But sometimes a firmer hand may be needed.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b3ae641800002d0080b4ff.jpeg?ops=crop_0_109_1589_1641%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Economic theories don't usually get their own executive orders. But last summer, President Barack Obama changed that.In September, the president issued an order, titled “Using Behavioral Science Insights to Better Serve the American People,” that essentially requires the federal government to use what Cass Sunstein, a Harvard Law professor, and Richard Thaler, a University of Chicago economics professor, call “nudges.” What's a nudge? Basically, it's a decision you make about the way choices are presented. In what order do you list someone's options? How do you describe each one? If you are asking someone to fill out a form, how long is it? How easy is it to understand? Where do you get it and where do you turn it in? And, crucially, what do you make the default option? Is it ""click here to subscribe,"" or ""click here to unsubscribe""? Opt-in or opt-out?Some policymakers are strongly pro-nudge because they can be a cheap, simple and effective way to steer people in a particular direction, and help them make better choices -- or, anyway, what the policymakers believe to be better choices. Other people are uncomfortable with nudges, objecting to the whole idea of officials trying to exert a subtle influence in the name of advancing a policy agenda. But there's no such thing as no nudges: As soon as you try to present someone with options, you have to communicate those options somehow. And every possible method carries a nudge of some kind.Obama has faith in the power of nudges. But how far do they actually get you? In a new paper, John Campbell, a professor of economics at Harvard, argues that sometimes a nudge is not enough. In many cases, strong, explicit regulation -- especially when it comes to consumer finance -- makes more sense.Among economists, the general presumption is that ""people know what they are doing, they’re consenting adults, leave them alone,” Campbell told The Huffington Post. But in some cases, like when it comes to consumer finance, this is almost certainly incorrect: A lot of us don't fully understand the financial services available to us, and some businesses are happy to take advantage of that. Campbell says his work shows that there are scientific reasons lawmakers should feel “comfortable intervening in markets to protect people from themselves.”Intervention is necessary, he says, because disclosure and financial education aren’t enough to protect consumers. Lawmakers can legally require businesses to make certain information public, but it's easy to camouflage that information with colorful fonts and lots of extraneous words. Meanwhile, it's great to educate people about financial products, but businesses can always make those products more and more deliberately confusing.Thaler told HuffPost in an email that he doesn't think he and Campbell really disagree.“Sunstein and I have never argued that nudges can solve all problems,"" Thaler wrote. ""We need regulation to prevent and punish fraud, for example.”Thaler said he thinks Campbell “underestimates the power and flexibility of [automatically pre-selected choices] as policy instruments.” But he agreed with Campbell’s core point.""People have great difficulty with financial decisions and we need to help them out,"" Thaler wrote. ""Moreover, neither education nor disclosure are sufficient. I have been saying similar things for years, just not as well!”Campbell acknowledges that Sunstein and Thaler's nudges sometimes work. And when they do, they can have a major positive effect.“It’s almost like a free lunch: We’ve made some people better off, we’ve hurt nobody,"" he said. ""Libertarians can be happy, and paternalists can be happy. My point in this paper is to say, 'Yeah, that’s great when you can do it, but you may need to go further.""Regulators, particularly the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Campbell and Thaler both sit on the agency's academic research council), are moving beyond nudges.Campbell says this is happening in the regulation of short-term credit, such as payday and car-title loans. You can nudge people away from using overdraft protection -- which allows bank customers to run a negative balance, but only if they repay the loan at a high interest rate -- by giving people the choice to sign up if they want it, instead of being automatically enrolled. But nudging people away from payday loans -- short-term, high-interest loans, secured by the borrower’s next paycheck, that often send people into a tailspin of debt -- is not as easy.In that sense, Campbell's work formalizes the limit that's implicit in the name of Sunstein and Thaler's concept. Sometimes people need more than a nudge."
41,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton's 'Tough On Wall Street' Speech Wasn't Very Tough,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-wall-street_us_56b423e0e4b08069c7a6c432,"She didn't tell Wall Street to ""cut it out.""",2016-02-05,Hillary Clinton might not have been quite as tough on Wall Street as she has suggested.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b425041a00002d00ab20ca.jpeg?cache=nZ3KV6T7kf&ops=crop_33_20_3467_1920%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton has repeatedly said she told Wall Street to ""cut it out"" during a 2007 speech she gave at Nasdaq. The speech itself, however, is far more sympathetic to Big Finance than Clinton's presidential campaign rhetoric has suggested.By December 2007, the economy was already in recession. Widespread abuses in the mortgage market were not a secret. Big banks had not only issued predatory loans and packaged them into disastrous securities, they had financed specialty mortgage firms who had issued their own garbage loans.In her speech, Clinton did not absolve Wall Street of responsibility. But she didn't exactly pin the blame for what was about to become a Wall Street crisis on, you know, Wall Street.""Now, who's exactly to blame for the housing crisis? Well, that's always a question that the press and people ask and I think there's plenty of blame to go around,"" Clinton said. ""Wall Street may not have created the foreclosure crisis, but Wall Street certainly had a hand in making it worse.""Billions of dollars in foreclosure fraud settlements suggest that Wall Street was, in fact, responsible for the foreclosure crisis. Clinton was a senator from New York at the time. Although Clinton belittled calls from ""the press and people"" to pinpoint responsibility for the financial mess in 2007, those demands would intensify dramatically after the bailouts began in 2008.After referencing stagnant wages, rising gas prices and rising home heating costs during the speech, Clinton said: ""Now these economic problems are certainly not all Wall Street's fault -- not by a long shot.""The St. Louis Federal Reserve and others have concluded that, in fact, wild swings in oil prices are driven in part by Wall Street speculation.Clinton didn't totally let financial firms off the hook.""If we're honest, we need to acknowledge that Wall Street has played a significant role in the current problems, and in particular in the housing crisis,"" Clinton said. ""I believe Wall Street shifted risk away from people who knew what was going on onto the people who did not.""But her proposed solution was for Wall Street to find a ""voluntary solution"" to the mess. If big banks and hedge funds couldn't eventually cut a deal with one another, she raised the terrifying prospect that she would ""consider legislation"" to deal with it. That legislation? Exonerating ""mortgage servicers"" -- many of which were owned by big banks -- from lawsuit liability if they modified loans to help families stay in their homes.This threat was pointless. Servicers were already legally required to modify mortgages if doing so would help keep people in their homes and protect investors from losses on foreclosures.Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chair Sheila Bair had been making far more aggressive calls for anti-foreclosure action for several months before Clinton offered her version.

DiChristina pointed out in her Facebook post that a strip of bare midriff can't possibly put a student at bigger risk for MRSA than a man in the gym wearing a muscle tee.

Anonymous tips are fine, the police said.""With this machine, if you try to manipulate or damage it in any way, it snaps a picture of you, which is odd because it's a photo machine,"" said Batavia police detective Kevin Bretz.""I don't think he paid for the pictures,"" Bretz said.The detective said the alleged theft occurred in November, but the police department was just able to recover the photos this week after the machine was repaired.(Reporting by Fiona Ortiz; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)Also on HuffPost:"

A new generation of crusaders is in town.Thanks to the kid-friendly design firm, KidMob -- which teaches kids to tackle community-based issues with skills like 3-D modeling and printing, technical drawing and using power tools -- children missing limbs got to swap their bulky prosthetics for superhero cyborg arms they created themselves.“We'd like these kids to begin to solve their own problems and create their own solutions, recognizing that they have options beyond what is available on the market,” Kate Ganim, KidMob’s co-director, told The Huffington Post. “Also, we'd love for the kids to see themselves as super-abled rather than disabled.”During KidMob’s workshop, appropriately named Superhero Cyborgs 2.0, kiddos designed some truly badass prototypes including “Project Unicorn,” a five-nozzle glitter shooter by 10-year-old Jordan Reeve and “Water Gun 3000,” a water gun arm activated by elbow movement by 12-year-old Sydney Howard.The five-day workshop started out with a little improv to help the kids feel comfortable with their ideas, get the creative juices flowing and come up with their own “super power.” Then a few skill-building activities like 3-D printing and scanning, plaster casting and sewing are taught. And, on the last day, the children presented their prototypes to an audience of 40-plus adults.But how exactly are the arms built?“That's what the kids are there to figure out!” said Ganim.It sounds like a big responsibility, but Ganim’s budding cyborgs were guided and assisted by KidMob’s crew, which included a volunteer prostheticist and a group of passionate graduate students from California College of the Arts.There were also professional designers like Andreas Bastian on hand, who works for the multinational software corporation Autodesk, which sponsored and hosted the event at its facilities.The kids were also buddied up with one or two professional designers who can help them continue developing their prototypes and create more refined forms.This workshop, which is the second for KidMob, is very near and dear to Ganim’s heart. Her sister was born without a hand, and growing up she observed how limiting prosthetics could be. But in 2014, Ganim, heard about Robohand, a company that makes 3-D-printed machined limbs, and decided to connect the dots.KidMob decided to test print and assemble a Robohand of their own and saw kids’ eyes light up.“We were seeing kids accepting these devices with a lot of excitement about having this ‘cyborg’ arm,” Ganim said. “Which, as designers, led us to wonder why we're limiting the functionality to that of a typical hand, when these devices could do almost literally anything -- and things way cooler than hands are capable of doing!”Inspired, KidMob set up its first Superhero Cyborg workshop at Brown University School of Engineering in July 2014, in which children came up with ideas like jet-boots that propel one into the air and can collect garbage and an underwater lasso.Though Ganim has witnessed tons of cool kiddies coming up with brilliant ideas and creative solutions, there was one moment during Superhero Cyborg 2.0 that made her particularly proud. It happened on the second-to-last day of the workshop and involved a 10-year-old named Riley Gonzalez, who made a hand with detachable bow and arrow. He was having a difficult time figuring out how to make a complicated component for his prototype, when the crew at KidMob handed him an already assembled hand he could build off of due to time constraints. Riley rejected the shortcut.“He asked if it would be OK for him to continue using the pieces he was already working with to come up with a solution on his own,’” Ganim said. “Figuring things out was the reason why he came to the workshop.

47,POLITICS,Trump's Momentum Could Be Petering Out As New Hampshire Vote Approaches,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-new-hampshire_us_56b52d48e4b08069c7a76a12,The talk in the GOP -- and elsewhere -- is that the real estate mogul is faltering.,2016-02-05,"Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump speaks at a rally at Great Bay Community College on Thursday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The real estate mogul took second place in the Iowa caucus on Monday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b52dca1a00002d00ab21f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Republicans who aren’t in Donald Trump’s camp and independent polltakers and experts here are increasingly convinced that the fear-peddling billionaire is losing momentum and could even lose on Election Day.“I’ve been convinced since day one that he would not win in the end,” said Andy Smith, the respected dean of New Hampshire polling and a teacher at the University of New Hampshire.Key insiders for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) of course say the same thing -- but they are saying it with much more conviction than they did a few weeks ago.“We have a chance to catch him,” insisted former Sen. John Sununu, who is a key figure in Kasich's campaign. “People are looking for ways NOT to vote for Trump.”More than a third of voters have said they definitely would NOT vote for Trump, a very high number at the same time that there is a huge undecided vote, Smith told The Huffington Post in an interview. “There is a ceiling on his support, not a floor.”Though Smith's latest poll puts Trump at 28 percent and his nearest competitor -- Rubio -- at 15, Smith thinks that there is time for Trump to fall further, and perhaps for Rubio, Kasich or Cruz to catch up to him.“Right now it is a slow leak in the tire, but the tire could also explode,” said Smith. “Don’t forget that in 2004, Howard Dean fell 14 points in one day after his meltdown in Iowa.”On television, Rubio ads are in particularly heavy rotation on local stations, aimed at women and low-information voters who are slow to make up their mind and are still available.At the same time, Cruz is being hit on TV with a barrage of negative “independent” PAC ads aimed at shaking loose his support.GOP types continue to disparage Trump’s ground game here, especially after watching him underperform by 6 points or more in Iowa.For example, other candidates harvest large amounts of data before and at local events, either in person or via apps such as Eventbrite. Trump’s team gets a minimum of information and then does little to follow up on it, operatives say.“The big rally is not how you do it here,” said David Carney, a longtime GOP operative and campaign manager in New Hampshire.Saturday night’s ABC-run and RNC-sponsored debate at St. Anselm College will likely be Trump's last test before New Hampshire voters head to the polls.In this case, he will not only be fending off the substantive attacks of others. He will also be trying to fight off the still-under-the-radar but real sense that he could become a two-time loser.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
