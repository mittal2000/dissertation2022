The song's opening lyric -- “I’m going to love you / until you hate me” -- has now taken on a whole new meaning.Ora, the former Jay Z protégé and sometimes sister to Christian Grey, recently invoked the most sacred of pop diva anthems ""Lady Marmalade"" in hopes of remaking the song with today's stars (no shade to Christina Aguilera). ""Lady Marmalade"" first debuted on pop airwaves in 1974, but was covered by Pink, Christina Aguilera, Mya, and Lil' Kim in the best performance you've ever seen at the 2001 MTV Movie Awards.“It’s always been my goal to create another 'Lady Marmalade,'” Ora told The Sun, per NME. “I’m trying to round up the troops. I think it would be me, Miley [Cyrus], Charli XCX -- she’d be fun -- and Iggy [Azalea].”Azalea, the world's No. 1 punching bag, might have learned something in her year of intense public scrutiny and agreed that some things are better left alone.Charli XCX took to Twitter to voice her support for the project, but then later deleted her tweet. No word yet on how Miley Cyrus feels.Also on HuffPost: "

Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) is proposing a bill to prohibit government officials from using private email servers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561d40bd1400002b003c81e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A House Republican proposed a bill Tuesday that would bar the use of private email servers like the one used by Hillary Clinton during her tenure at the State Department. The bill, introduced by Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), would prohibit secretaries of executive departments within the U.S. government from using private email servers for official government business.Cramer announced the legislation on the same day as the first Democratic presidential debate, which Clinton is set to participate in. “This legislation ensures no Department Secretary may use a private server for emails and storage of electronic data. It is in the interest of national security to ensure our nation’s secrets and communications between our top leaders receive the highest level of protection,"" Cramer said in a statement.Cramer characterized the legislation as aiming to protect electronic communications and records ""under constant cyber-attack by terrorist organizations and more frequently by foreign governments."" He also hinted at the ongoing controversy over Clinton's use of government servers for private emails, which was ultimately revealed by the House Benghazi Committee's probe after it requested documents from the State Department related to the terrorist attack. “The use of private email servers may inhibit the preservation of all records and electronic communications,"" Cramer added, ""which may be needed for Congressional, civil or criminal investigations.” "
2,POLITICS,Half Of U.S. Democrats Want Joe Biden In The 2016 Race,"James Oliphant, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-2016_us_561cf4b8e4b050c6c4a2ad11,Biden won't be at the first Democratic debate.,2015-10-13,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The drumbeat for Joe Biden to jump into the 2016 presidential race is growing louder.Almost half of the nation's Democrats want the vice president to enter the field and challenge front-runner Hillary Clinton, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll.The results come as speculation surrounding Biden's intentions has intensified, with reports having him close to a decision. The declared Democratic presidential candidates, including Clinton and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her closest rival, will take the stage Tuesday night in Las Vegas for the first party debate.Biden will not be there, but 48 percent of Democrats surveyed in the Reuters poll wish he were a candidate, compared with 30 percent who said he should stay out. Independents were split on the question, with 36 percent saying Biden should stay in and an equal share believing otherwise.But support for Biden's entry into the race does not translate into equal passion for his candidacy. Just 17 percent of those surveyed said Biden would be their first choice, while 46 percent would back Clinton. Biden would also run behind Sanders, who remains the favorite of one fourth of Democrats surveyed.Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist in Florida with Draft Biden, a political action committee established to lay the groundwork for a Biden run, said more voters would be likely to supportBiden once he has officially launched a campaign.""There's an element of people - they know they like him, but they're not willing to give him their vote yet,"" Schale said.Former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, ex-Senator Jim Webb of Virginia and Lincoln Chaffee, a former governor of Rhode Island, comprise the rest of the Democratic presidential field.Clinton has been perceived as increasingly politically vulnerable as questions persist over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state in the Obama administration. That controversy has helped stoke the fires for a late-in-the-game Biden shot.Even so, Clinton continues to command large organizational and financial advantages, as well as the lion's share of the Democratic electorate, as the Reuters poll confirms.Those close to Biden told Reuters that the vice president, still grief-stricken over the death of his son Beau from brain cancer in May, has not yet settled upon a course of action and is determined to stay true to his personal timetable.Media reports last week had aides to Biden consulting with the Democratic National Committee about upcoming deadlines for qualifying for state primary ballots. Several are as early as November, meaning that Biden will have to reach a decision soon or risk being left off the ballot in some primaries.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted from Oct. 7-12 and surveyed 1,431 adults, including 580 self-identified Democrats. The credibility interval, which is similar to the margin of error, was 3 percent for the broader survey and 4.7 percent for the survey of Democrats.

Its reviews carry significant weight for independent music followers, and have been credited with helping boost artists’ careers. The site boasts 6 million unique visitors per month. The deal “reinforces our commitment to building Condé Nast’s premium digital network, focusing on distinctive editorial voices and engaging high-value millennial audiences,” Sauerberg said in an email to staff. Santarpia, who brokered the deal and to whom the staff at Pitchfork will report, praised the publication's “authenticity,” crediting the company with “identifying what’s next and bringing credibility to artists and music that they believe in.” He said the acquisition will allow Condé Nast to boost Pitchfork’s infrastructure while it maintains its editorial voice.“Pitchfork will continue to run just as it always has, but with the extra resources Condé Nast can bring to the table,” he said.Pitchfork President Christopher Kaskie, who, along with founder and CEO Ryan Schreiber will remain at the company, said the sale will allow the publication to expand its offerings.“As much as we’ve created a sustainable company for ourselves, we were maxing out in every area,” he said. “[The acquisition] will allow us to evaluate things with fresh eyes and expand our editorial coverage.”Kaskie credited Condé Nast for understanding and appreciating Pitchfork’s brand during negotiations, which took place over the previous year, as well as pledging “minimal disruption” in terms of integration.“It really comes down to the fact that we’re being acquired by a company that respects our brand and what we’ve built over a long time,” Kaskie said."
4,POLITICS,Marco Rubio ISO Billionaires For Heavy Campaign Petting,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-sheldon-adelson_us_561d2ea1e4b050c6c4a2ea64,"He insists his agenda is not for sale, but nobody's buying that agenda as-is.",2015-10-13,Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) at Civic Hall about the 'sharing economy' on Oct. 6 in New York City (file). Reports suggest that Rubio may have hit the Adelson jackpot.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561d2f1e1400002a00c79c90.jpeg?cache=P9Dd8JeBka&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even as the Democratic candidates gather in Las Vegas for the first of their party's primary debates, some consequential news is emerging from Sin City that doesn't involve whether or not Vice President Joe Biden's going to drop in on tonight's affair unexpectedly like he was Nicki Minaj. As Politico's Alex Isenstadt reports this morning, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson is apparently close to deciding which candidate he'll purchase for the 2016 election, and the lucky winner looks to be Marco Rubio.Yes, the Florida senator has apparently emerged as the favorite to earn a year-long cash commitment from Adelson, after Rubio delivered what Politico describes as a successful ""performance"" for the billionaire at the Venetian Las Vegas hotel and casino. This is bad news, I guess, for the Judds, whose performance has only earned them a commitment from Adelson through Oct. 24. Per Politico:Those close to Adelson — who spent more than $100 million on Republican candidates and causes during the 2012 campaign and has been aggressively courted by most would-be Republican nominees — stressed that the 82-year-old gambling magnate had made no final decision on whom he'd support but said that momentum had strongly shifted to the Florida senator. A formal endorsement, they said, could come as soon as the end of the month — and with it, the potential for a multimillion dollar contribution. With a net worth of $25.7 billion, according to Forbes, Adelson can afford to spend freely.It's taken quite a while for Rubio to win Adelson's affections, a process that has been ongoing since April, when it was reported (again, by Isenstadt) that Rubio had ""taken the lead"" in the ""Sheldon Adelson primary."" As Isenstadt reported then, one follows a pretty simple blueprint to win Adelson's favor:Adelson's attraction to Rubio is in no small part centered on the Florida senator's outspoken support for Israel, an issue near and dear to the billionaire's heart. Rubio has reached out to Adelson more often than any other 2016 candidate, sources close to Adelson say, and has provided him with the most detailed plan for how he'd manage America's foreign policy.Beyond that, a Republican candidate generally has to oppose labor rights (Adelson, who runs ""the only non-union casino on the Strip"" is opposed to workers organizing), to relieve him of the pressure of federal investigators scrutinizing his businesses, and just ignore the numerous examples of liberal policies that Adelson supports in spite of the fact that he exclusively donates to candidates who vehemently oppose them.These requirements have been more or less fulfilled by just about every candidate who is running for the GOP nomination. Rubio, however, has separated himself from the pack thanks to his efforts to worm his way into Adelson's good graces by doing such things as ""phoning the billionaire several times a month to provide in-depth updates on the state of his campaign."" It's not particularly noteworthy to witness an American politician bowing and scraping before an oddball billionaire during our nation's spin through the ""Doom Loop Of Oligarchy,"" but it is a little funny to reflect on the fact that Rubio likes to pretend he is different.""When people give money to me, or support me, they're buying into [my] agenda, I'm not buying into theirs,"" is the line that Rubio enjoys giving to voters on the stump. It's a very pretty thing to say. The only problem is that not too many people have been buying Rubio's agenda of late. As The Hill's Jonathan Easley reported last week, Rubio's third-quarter fundraising report arrived to the sound of wet bleats from the sad trombone:White House hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) raised $6 million in the third quarter, a disappointing haul for a candidate who has been rising in the polls and lauded as a potential threat to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for the GOP's establishment mantle.That's a drop from the $9 million Rubio raised in two-and-a-half months in the second quarter, after he launched his bid for the White House in mid-April.All told, Rubio has raised $18 million in hard campaign dollars this year, which includes about $3 million for his Senate reelection bid that has transferred to his presidential account.And lo, the Boy Wonder was made to go on bended knee to the Venetian, for succor. Meanwhile, Rubio's primary antagonist, the sunburnt Wonder Bread loaf from reality television, had this to say:Okay, okay, I hear you, broken clock, you were due.At any rate, Isenstadt also notes that the Rubio camp is making overtures to other big-time billionaire donors, including hedge fund titan Paul Singer and the Chicago Cubs-owning Ricketts clan, who once supported Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.But it's an upcoming meeting with ""Doug Deason, the son of billionaire megadonor Darwin Deason"" that seems more emblematic of the new path Rubio is walking. Rubio failed to win himself the Deason dollars in a previous overture, owing to a difference of opinion. However, as Isenstadt reports, ""[i]n an interview, Deason recalled getting an unsatisfactory answer from Rubio and said he hoped to get a better response the next time they met.""Considering that the sticking point between Deason and Rubio was the senator's support for federal sugar subsidies, a policy that a Florida politician must support simply as a matter of course, I'd say Rubio's fealty to his own agenda is about to get a lot more flexible."

Cooper said he intends to take a different approach with his line of questioning than Tapper did during the GOP debate -- and Cooper has quite a reputation for asking tough questions. ""Going into the Republican debates, you pretty much knew there were a number of candidates who were willing to [attack each other],"" he said in an interview with CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" on Sunday. ""Some lower-level candidates wanted to punch up and try to make a name for themselves. That's not the case, so far as we've seen, on the Democratic side.""The prominent Democratic candidates also have somewhat of a relationship with Black Lives Matter activists, unlike those in the GOP. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley have all met with Black Lives Matter activists. Sanders and O'Malley have released sweeping campaign platforms tackling mass incarceration and police violence. Clinton's platform has not yet been released. The candidates' history with criminal justice must also be considered. In the past, Clinton has defended the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act that former President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1994. Critics say Clinton played a role in facilitating mass incarceration -- an issue that disproportionately affects black Americans -- by supporting these tough-on-crime initiatives.O'Malley implemented NYPD-style ""zero tolerance"" policing methods when he was mayor of Baltimore and, in 2006, the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland filed a lawsuit against the city's police department. It alleged that officers were illegally arresting people in Baltimore’s poor, predominantly black neighborhoods for minor offenses. The city settled the suit in 2010. But West Baltimore, which includes Freddie Gray's neighborhood of Sandtown-Winchester, is still home to over half of all people released from Maryland's prison system each year. Sanders was very much against the 1994 crime bill, but ended up voting for it anyway since it included the Violence Against Women Act. What hurts Sanders is that he sees racial inequality as a symptom of economic inequality.Considering how much Black Lives Matter has accomplished in the past year, a question at the debate is expected. Police violence against black people and the racial wealth gap are now Democratic campaign issues. The media, on average, is giving issues affecting the black community more nuanced coverage. Campaign Zero, a comprehensive set of policy demands hoping to end police violence against black people, was also launched by Black Lives Matter activists last month. Most of the onus falls on CNN, however. If systemic racism isn't addressed, then the criticism that the media doesn't care about black lives becomes even more valid than it already is. It is also very important that these candidates be held accountable for their less-than-upstanding pasts on these issues; speak candidly and publicly about the ills facing black Americans, not just in closed-door meetings with activists in the movement; and run a campaign where the connection between state violence and the history of racism in the U.S. is explicitly acknowledged.Hopefully, there will be a discussion about one of the most critical social justice movements in the last 50 years. It is warranted. Black people want -- and deserve -- to know how, exactly, these candidates intend on addressing the issues and if they truly understand a system that takes and ruins so many black lives.And honestly, just asking white presidential candidates how they feel about police violence and other ills affecting black Americans isn't enough."

9,WOMEN,Millennial Women Are Actually Pretty Optimistic About Workplace Equality,Rebecca Adams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/millennial-women-workplace-equality_us_561d1e16e4b050c6c4a2d6ff,Poll suggests young working women don't see as many barriers to success as those who came before.,2015-10-13,"Donna Strickland, The Nobel Prize In Physics, 2018",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4d8b1240000300097b4cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"According to a new global poll, women under 35 are more positive about their career prospects than their predecessors. The poll, conducted by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and The Rockefeller Foundation, surveyed 9,500 women in 19 nations in the G20 and found that millennials were more optimistic than previous generations about workplace issues such as equal pay, networking opportunities and the effects of motherhood on careers. Despite the persisting wage gap, 43 percent of women under 35 were confident they'd achieve equal pay. Only 34 percent of women between 50 and 64 saw this as a possibility. That millennial confidence also extended to women's feelings on being able to juggle a career with children. Forty-eight percent of younger women said they were confident they could do it, compared to 45 percent of women between 35 and 64. When it came to starting their own businesses, 40 percent of millennial women believed they had the same chance of success as men, while only 33 percent of women between the ages of 50 and 64 felt the same. Women under 35 also were more optimistic about access to jobs, as well as their professional development and career growth opportunities, with 45 percent of them thinking men have it better in these areas, compared to 50 percent of older women.The survey also suggested that the ""boys club"" workplace trope is less of an issue for millennials. Forty-two percent of millennial women surveyed felt like they had the same access to business networks as men, while only 33 percent of older women agreed.The outlook of the millennials surveyed could be chalked up to youthful optimism, but these young women weren't naively unaware of the challenges they face -- four in every 10 women saw the gender wage gap as a key issue. And the top concern for women of all ages across the globe was work-life balance, with 44 percent of women listing it as a major challenge.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, women currently earn 78 cents for every dollar paid to men, while mothers make a mere 70 cents for every dollar paid to fathers (a.k.a. they pay the ""mommy tax""). While the wage gap is indeed closing, if it continues to move at the same pace as it has the last 50 years, equal pay won't be achieved until 2059, according to estimates from the Institute for Women's Policy Research. Work-life balance can seem equally as far-fetched for women, who tend to do more of the housework than their male partners, even when they're the primary breadwinners. Optimism alone won't fix systemic gender inequalities, but with women increasingly moving into male-dominated fields and making the wage gap a national conversation, there's certainly reason to see the bright side of things.And research has suggested that having a good attitude can make people more physically and emotionally resilient. If women are going to have to excel at their jobs and push through the glass ceiling, remaining optimistic might just be their best strategy.Also on HuffPost:"
10,LATINO VOICES,"These New York Musicians Revive Big Band Music, With A Colombian Twist",Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gregorio-uribe-big-band_us_561c277fe4b028dd7ea4d770,The Gregorio Uribe Big Band's music reflects the history and reality of an immigrant city.,2015-10-13,Gregorio Uribe performs at Le Poisson Rouge in New York City.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561c2e1112000026007e4ee6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- One of the high points at any of the Gregorio Uribe Big Band’s monthly shows at Zinc Bar in Greenwich Village comes when the audience belts out the chorus of the song “Gracias, Nueva York!” It’s a moment that embodies the immigrant gratitude for opportunity that pervades the city.It’s also very catchy.Uribe, 30, first moved to New York in 2008 to pursue the unlikely aim of building a big band driven by Colombian rhythms. About seven decades had passed since the combined forces of the Great Depression and the phonograph made such large ensembles all but financially untenable.And yet, Uribe's group is on the verge of another successful milestone: On Oct. 14, the band will release its debut album, “Cumbia Universal,” at Dizzy’s Club in New York’s Lincoln Center.“When I decided to go for a big band, I was very aware of the chaotic or romantic aspects of it,” Uribe told The Huffington Post. “In a world where one person can make music with one laptop, this is kind of going against the current.""""But at the same time, I thought that because there’s so much music out there these days, that the same element that was going to make it difficult was what was going to make the band unique,"" he added. ""So I said, ok, I’m ready for that struggle.”Uribe first started experimenting with big band arrangements in 2007, as he was finishing his degree at Berklee College of Music in Boston. As a student at an elite U.S. music institution who had left his native Colombia for the first time at age 18, he'd distanced himself from the popular music of his youth, like cumbia and vallenato, a folksy dance style from the Caribbean that is wildly popular in Colombia.But as graduation approached and Uribe began to envision his musical future, he awakened to the richness of his roots.“It’s an interesting moment when you’re in college and you’re far from your homeland,” Uribe told HuffPost. “You’re playing in school and you’re thinking, ‘Oh, this music is too simple, what am I doing playing this thing?’ But then you come full circle and you think, this music is very organic to me. Why should I not embrace that?”“And my conclusion was the big band,” he went on. “Because it was a combination of these things that I came to love -- big band jazz arranging and Colombian music and rhythms.”It’s music that combines the technical virtuosity of the American big bands of the 1940s with the thunderous percussion of Colombian dance music. The punchy horn section at times channels Duke Ellington, but the huffing melodies of the accordion instantly recall vallenato. It’s music that reflects the history and reality of an immigrant city.The sounds may have a distinctly Colombian tinge, but the 16-piece band boasts members from across the hemisphere. Jonathan Gómez, who plays alegre drum, is the only other Colombian-born musician in the group. The others hail from Argentina, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland and the United States, including two Mexican-Americans. Even Uribe’s look displays the melding of cultures that defines his music. He nearly always performs in a pressed white shirt, grey vest and black tie -- a throwback to the far more formal 1920s and 1930s, when big bands dominated the dance scene. But he also dons a sombrero vueltiao, an emblematically Colombian beige-and-black stitched hat, and he plays an accordion emblazoned with the colors of his country’s flag. The band bootstrapped the production of their new disc, raising $23,000 on Kickstarter to provide initial funding. The band relies on an ""extended family"" of substitute musicians, so that the official members can free themselves up to take gigs when opportunity calls elsewhere. But the group’s unique sound has also attracted the attention of big names in the music business. Uribe has shared the stage three times with Carlos Vives, one of Colombia’s most popular musicians -- most recently at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center this month, when Vives performed with salsa star Marc Anthony. Uribe said he hadn’t planned to play that night. He only wanted to hand off a copy of the new CD as a present. But when he met with Vives backstage, the star invited Uribe to perform. “I hadn’t even brought my instrument,” Uribe said. “I borrowed one of his accordions at the last minute.” Salsa legend Ruben Blades also lends his vocals to the title track, “Cumbia Universal,” a song that Uribe says defines the band’s values. “It’s the idea of cumbia being a song that everyone can feel included in and enjoy,” Uribe said. “And also the idea of the drum beat being part of a common past … I like the idea of having common ground.” Watch the first video from the new album, “Yo vengo,” in the video above.

A new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds that most Democratic voters don't expect the debate to change their minds.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561d16521400006f003c8138.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The trio of low-polling candidates hoping Tuesday night's debate will help them make their case to Democratic voters face an uphill challenge -- in a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, most potential viewers say they're unlikely to change their opinions about the campaign after watching the first debate.Most voters agree that debates are important in theory, and many are planning to watch. Fifty-seven percent of registered Democrats agree that primary debates are a good way to get to know the candidates. About one-third of registered Democratic voters say they're excited to watch Tuesday's debate, and another 38 percent say they're not excited but may end up tuning in anyway. Just 21 percent say they probably or definitely won't watch. Still, 54 percent of the voters who are considering watching expect the debate to mostly confirm what they already think about the candidates, while just 30 percent believe there's a chance it will change their views. A 57 percent majority of all Democratic voters say they have at least a good idea of who they'll vote for.That doesn't mean they can't or won't change their minds before next year's primaries, as Hillary Clinton's narrowing lead has shown. About 35 percent of Democratic primary voters now say they've made up their minds and want to see Clinton nominated, down nearly 10 points since August; another 9 percent say they're still making up their minds, but would prefer to see her as the Democratic nominee. Eighteen percent now say they've decided to throw their support behind a different candidate, while 13 percent are still deciding, but would rather see an alternative to Clinton. The remainder aren't sure about either their candidate preference or how firm it is.That leaves Clinton with a plurality of support for now, even when pitted against the rest of the Democratic field. And, as other surveys have shown, the campaign has remained relatively stable so far, with Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden -- who has not yet announced whether he'll run -- largely holding on to their supporters over the summer. With months until the first votes are cast, there's plenty of time for things to change, but few expect Tuesday's event to be the catalyst. In the HuffPost/YouGov poll, a majority of both Clinton supporters and Clinton opponents say they're unlikely to change their minds because of the debate.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 7-9 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

12,BUSINESS,Another Way Companies Make It Harder For New Mothers,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-breastfeeding-at-work_us_561d624ee4b0c5a1ce60dba3,A new study says breastfeeding moms don't get the accommodation they need at work -- but there's something they can do about it.,2015-10-13,"New moms who don't get the space and time they need to pump breast milk at work are less likely to continue breastfeeding their children, a new study finds.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561d634012000026007e5050.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pumping breast milk at work is one of the more depressing indignities of new motherhood. You’re holed up in some tiny windowless closet at work, breasts exposed, hooked up to a whirring suction, nervous to be away from your job and sad to be away from your baby.What’s worse than that, though? Not having the opportunity to pump at all.Only 40 percent of new mothers who return to work after giving birth have access to the private space and breaks they need to pump breast milk at work, despite federal regulations requiring employers to accommodate them, according to research published Tuesday in the journal Women’s Health Issues.Without support at work, women are much more likely to stop breastfeeding their children.Low-income women and single mothers were even less likely to have access to a private space that’s not a bathroom, or to take breaks to express milk, the study from the University of Minnesota School of Public Health found.“This is pretty woefully inadequate, based everything we know about what moms and babies need,” Katy Kozhimannil, the lead researcher on the study, told The Huffington Post.Since 2010, the Affordable Care Act, or ""Obamacare,"" has required companies with more than 50 employees to provide reasonable accommodation and time for hourly workers to express breast milk. Obamacare does allow employers an exemption from the provisions if they can prove it's a hardship to comply -- but there are all sorts of innovative ways workplaces can help nursing mothers, according to Dr. Joan Younger Meek, a member and past chair of the nonprofit U.S. Breastfeeding Committee and a professor of clinical sciences at the Florida State University College of Medicine. She mentions she's even seen makeshift tents set up for farm workers.Still, many women and even some employers aren’t aware of the new rules. “I wish I could say I was shocked,” said Meek of the study’s findings.It’s typically in an employer’s best interest to support breastfeeding, which has fairly well-documented health benefits. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that mothers breastfeed exclusively for the first six months of a child’s life. But it's not so easy when you're away from your baby for hours during the day -- and especially tricky if you're an hourly worker with little control over your break time. Mothers who had time and space to pump at work were twice as likely to exclusively breastfeed their baby for at least six months, according to the study.Good breastfeeding accommodations aren't just beneficial for moms and babies: Since breastfed babies are less likely to get sick, new mothers are less likely to take sick days from work. Mothers who get breastfeeding support at work are less likely to quit their jobs, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. There are things women can do to make sure they get the support they need, should they choose to breastfeed after returning to work.Meek recommends that pregnant women start a conversation about breastfeeding accommodations before they go out on leave. They can talk to other mothers at work about their experience. They can also talk to a supervisor or their human resources department about what they need. “It’s easier to plan ahead of time then to scramble at the last minute,” she said.Women who have problems after returning to work or who have an unhelpful employer can file a complaint with the Department of Labor, which will investigate the issue.""My biggest obstacle turned out to be the space,"" said Lauren, a teacher in Virginia, who shared her breastfeeding story on the website of the It's Working Project, a for-profit organization that aims to make workplaces better for women.Even though she put together a schedule for pumping on her breaks, Lauren had no place to go. She shared an office -- and it didn't lock. She considered quitting nursing altogether, but then decided to talk to her school's vice principal, who found her space in an electrical closet.That worked just fine. “It was warm!” Lauren is quoted as saying on the website. “Much more comfortable than my office, which was set to a frigid 60 degrees.""Since this is the first study to look at the link between workplace accommodations and length of breastfeeding, it’s possible that new moms have better opportunities to breastfeed at work today than they did in the past.Certainly, there’s more support for breastfeeding these days, said Meek. “It has gotten better, but lower-income workers and single mothers and breadwinner mothers still have difficulty.”The study, which was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, analyzed a survey of 2,400 women who gave birth in 2011 and 2012 and were interviewed in 2013 so they could describe their return to work. More than 1,000 of the women went back to work and answered follow-up questions about breastfeeding.The survey did not look at what types of jobs most women held or what kinds of companies they worked at. The researchers found that 59 percent of women had access to adequate break time and 45 percent had a private space for pumping. Only 40 percent of women surveyed had access to both things.Every year, about 1.8 million women return to work within six months of giving birth, the study estimates. Also on HuffPost:"
13,POLITICS,Campaign Finance Reformers Want Details At Democratic Debate,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-campaign-finance-reform_us_561d59bbe4b028dd7ea56a85,"""We don’t want to hear more lip service. We want to hear action.""",2015-10-13,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a candidate for the Democratic nomination, has made reversing the Citizens United decision a central part of his campaign. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561d5aa21400002b003c822b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Campaign finance reformers don’t want to just hear denunciations of the rising role of big money in politics from the Democratic presidential candidates at Tuesday night’s debate. They want to hear candidates lay out solutions and explain how they will make them happen.“It’s all about solutions,” Every Voice communications director Adam Smith said. “Nobody watching needs to be convinced that the system is broken or that money corrupts politics.”The role of money in politics has emerged as a major concern of Democratic Party voters since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision opened the door to unlimited independent spending by corporations, unions and -- following a subsequent lower court ruling -- wealthy individuals on elections. The decision has led politicians to increasingly lean on massive contributions from the wealthiest Americans. At the midpoint of 2015, the majority of the funding for the 2016 presidential campaign had come from donors giving more than $100,000.In the past, reform groups have been happy enough to have the issue of campaign finance reform or lobbying reform addressed at all in political debates. But too often these conversations have been of a negative variety instead of about how to rebalance the system.“The real issue is that people are so cynical and they don’t think anything can happen,” Smith said. “That’s why we need to talk more about solutions.”The push for actual comprehensive policies also comes as public attitudes sour on the role big money plays in elections and governance. A recent Bloomberg poll found that 78 percent of Americans opposed the Citizens United decision and 87 percent supported reform of campaign finance laws to reduce the influence of the wealthy in elections.“We don’t want to hear more lip service,” Common Cause senior policy counsel Stephen Spaulding said. “We want to hear action.""Much of what the reform community is looking for from the candidates can be found in a document crafted by 13 advocacy groups this year. The Fighting Big Money, Empowering People agenda covers many of the policies adopted by the Democratic candidates, from the creation of a small-donor matching system for public financing of elections to the adoption of real-time disclosure rules and the implementation of rules preventing candidate-super PAC coordination.“Several candidates have already come out with comprehensive plans; other candidates have had strong positions on the issue,” said Marge Baker, executive vice president of People for the American Way. “We want to hear what are they going to do about it.”Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a candidate for the Democratic nomination, has made reversing Citizens United and stopping the accumulation of economic and political power by the rich a central part of his campaign. He has introduced a constitutional amendment to overturn the decision, promised to appoint justices opposed to it, voted for disclosure legislation, and also backs public financing of elections.“What [the Supreme Court] said to the wealthiest people in this country is, ‘Well, you already own much of our economy, we are now going to give you the opportunity to buy the United States government,’” Sanders said about Citizens United to a campaign crowd. “And that is precisely what they are trying to do right now.”Early in her presidential campaign, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, announced campaign finance reform as one of her four “big fights” to be won under a future administration. On Sept. 8, her campaign released a reform plan that included public financing for congressional elections, a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and support for a number of executive actions she could take -- including ordering the disclosure of all political donations by federal contractors and urging the Securities and Exchange Commission to require publicly traded companies to disclose political donations to shareholders.“Our democracy should be about expanding the franchise, not charging an entrance fee,” Clinton said in a statement upon releasing her plan. “It starts with overturning the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, and continues with structural reform to our campaign finance system so there’s real sunshine and increased participation.”Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, another Democratic presidential hopeful, has also released a comprehensive plan covering many of the same points on public financing and executive actions as the Clinton plan."

Moore spoke to People magazine about the new council, which is currently made up of 79 members of the creative community including Aziz Ansari, Kim Kardashian, Judd Apatow and Ellen DeGeneres. According to a press release, the group will use its ""cultural influence to support common-sense solutions proven to save lives from the gun violence that claims 88 American lives every day and injures hundreds more."" The actress explained that her motivation to get involved in the gun safety discussion stemmed from the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012. ""I remember my daughter came to work with me that day. I was doing a movie in Queens and when we got into the van, I actually said to the driver, 'Turn the radio off,'"" Moore told People. ""She was young, so the whole day, I kept the TV and the radio off."" Later that same night, after looking at her phone, the actress' daughter asked her if kids were shot.""I was like, 'I've had it.' I said to my husband, [director Bart Freundlich], 'I've got to do something. This is the one thing that I need to say something about. This is my responsibility as a parent."" Moore hopes that with the help of the council, she can help create awareness for change. A note on the website reads, ""We believe the creative community has an opportunity to use our communications skills and the power of culture to galvanize many more Americans in the gun violence prevention movement."" Moore also noted in a press release that the council is not meant to fight against the 2nd Amendment. ""We do not believe that the 2nd Amendment and gun safety are mutually exclusive ideas, and as a creative community, we will do everything we can to support the safety of our fellow Americans, and galvanize more to join us in this movement.""

The Weekly Standard described how Cooper had been listed as a ""notable past member"" of the organization, linking to a Mediaite story from May that mentioned several prominent journalists who shared that distinction. Cooper said that he moderated a panel at the Clinton Global Initiative in 2007, but he has had no ties to the organization or personal links to the Clintons in the years since.“I walked in. I did my moderation. I left,"" he said. ""I wasn’t paid. I’ve never been back to the Clinton Global Initiative. I’ve never been a member of CGI. I’ve never been to a cocktail party for CGI. I’ve never been to a social event with the Clintons.""Cooper said that if he was as close to the Clintons as some believe, he'd be able to easily book Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, as a guest on his show. Clinton hasn't appeared on ""Anderson Cooper 360"" in years. He also noted that he's spoken at the Reagan Library before.Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol tweeted in response to Cooper's dismissal that ""facts are stubborn things.""Fox News host Greta Van Susteren, also identified in May as a CGI “member,"" wrote then that the description was ""weird.""“The idea or suggestion that I am or was a ‘member"" of Clinton Global Initiative is just silly -- I think it is just a word the Clinton Global Initiative used in their event program to describe those who were invited and attended,” Van Susteren wrote. “It is never a word I would have used.""The Drudge Report has given oxygen to similar suggestions of bias in past election cycles. In October 2012, the outlet led with a story about how President Barack Obama attended the 1991 wedding of his Harvard Law School classmate Julius Genachowski and ABC News journalist Martha Raddatz, the moderator of that year's vice presidential debate.Four years earlier, The Drudge Report blasted out the news that PBS's Gwen Ifill was writing a book about Obama and race, shortly before she was set to moderate the 2008 vice presidential debate. Despite the glaring headline, Ifill's book was no secret.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly described the debates Martha Raddatz and Gwen Ifill moderated.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who raised roughly $6 million in the third quarter. Rubio's haul is worrying for a candidate considered one of the front-runners for the GOP nomination. However, his campaign says it expects the pace to pick up next quarter, which it will start with $11 million in cash on hand.One reason Fiorina is doing so well may be that her campaign has largely outsourced some of its costly functions to a super PAC supporting her run for president, a maneuver that has alarmed campaign finance watchdogs. The fundraising numbers are not yet final, however. The campaign is still required to file its fundraising report with the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15."
