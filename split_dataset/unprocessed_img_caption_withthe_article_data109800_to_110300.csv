0,LATINO VOICES,Light-Skinned Latinos Tend To Vote More Republican,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lightskinned-latinos-tend_n_5843816.html,,2014-09-18,"DORAL, FL - FEBRUARY 28: U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) walks out of the El Arepzo 2 restaurant on February 28, 2014 in Doral, Florida.

The data highlights rarely recognized racial divisions within the Latino community that have perplexed the U.S. Census Bureau and tripped up mass media. But don’t expect it to change too much about the way you understand the Latino vote. Writing for The Washington Post’s Monkey Cage blog on Wednesday, professor Spencer Piston analyzed a sample of Latino citizens interviewed for the 2012 American National Election Studies. Interviewers measured the respondents' skin color. The data show that Hispanics with darker skin were far more likely to vote Democrat than those with lighter skin. In the most dramatic of four cases presented, the analysis estimated that Latinos with the darkest skin showed a 98 percent chance of voting Democrat, while those with the lightest skin showed a 43 percent chance. Despite the variation, Latinos of all skin tones tended to lean more strongly toward identifying as Democrats and voting Democrat in national elections, with the exception of the 2012 U.S. Senate election. The data isn’t too surprising when considering that non-Hispanic whites lean more conservative than people of color. Given that Latinos live in the U.S. and adapt to national ideas about race, one might expect Hispanic voter preferences to reflect, while not necessarily replicate, broader patterns. The predictions Piston makes based on the data, however, are questionable. He writes that the analysis should make us rethink projections suggesting that the growth of the Latino electorate will dilute the Republican vote, which are based on the premise that Latinos tend to vote Democrat. But the projections that Piston disputes measure Latino voters in the aggregate. Unless we expect the number of white Latinos to grow much faster than Latinos of color, or Republicans to get way better at selectively targeting them, there’s no reason to think those projections won’t pan out just because we now have data showing whiter Latinos vote for Democrats in fewer numbers. That information doesn’t change anything, it merely illuminates a phenomenon that was already there. The crux of Piston’s argument is that white Latinos start to identify more strongly as conservatives over time. But he doesn’t explain why the trend would accelerate. Nevertheless, Piston concludes with these words: The coming decades may therefore be characterized by a different kind of partisan polarization than we normally think about: polarization by skin tone. This would give new meaning to the phrase “divided by color,” and if it is indeed what the future holds, it is not at all clear that Republicans are the party with a “race problem.”Maybe. But there’s several reasons to question the prediction that whiter Latinos will become more Republican with time solely because of their racial identification. As a multiracial ethnicity, Latinos view race differently than non-Latinos because so many Hispanics come from a mixed-race background. While racial division and discrimination are undoubtedly part of the Latino experience, Latinos have less fixed ideas about race than non-Latino Americans. Our communities, our social groups and our families are racially mixed in a way that doesn’t exist to the same degree among non-Hispanic white and black Americans. That heritage makes it unlikely that light skin would act as strongly as a predictor of political affiliation in the Latino community as it does among non-Hispanic whites. The light-skinned Latino that Piston assumes will be more likely to vote Republican because he or she hasn’t experienced racial discrimination is likely surrounded by darker-skinned people at home, work, school and church who have. As friends and family, those people are likely to identify with one another, even if their personal experience differs. Latinos also face some forms of discrimination as a group. Resentment against the Spanish language, white American assumptions of cultural superiority and, most prominently, anti-immigrant sentiment, affects Latinos as a group. Because conservatives have embraced these nativist views with more enthusiasm than liberals, expect Republicans to repel Latinos of all races until those ideas are abandoned. The major exception is South Florida, where a largely white and historically conservative Cuban-America community, by sheer force of numbers, has made it culturally unacceptable and politically unviable for local Republicans to mount English-only campaigns or state crackdowns on undocumented immigrants. It is, of course, possible that Piston is right and lighter-skinned Latinos will move en masse toward the Republican Party in the future. And he points out that that political affiliations are less fixed among Latinos than non-Hispanic whites and blacks. But if that were going to happen, why hasn't it happened yet? Light-skinned Latinos today do in fact identify more strongly as Democrats than non-Hispanic whites in the analysis that Piston presents. "

There is no ""true Islam"" in Islam. There has never been any central ""authority"" in Islam that could define such a thing. For better or worse (mostly for the better), Islam wears many faces. But paradoxically, there is one contemporary orientation that does make the big claim of being ""true Islam"": Wahhabism. As Professor As'ad AbuKhalil notes: ""What Mohammed Ibn 'Abdul-Wahab insisted upon -- and what is followers today insist upon -- is that men with the sword judge on behalf of God here on earth, and on all matters, small and big. This is where the Saudi Kingdom and ISIS fit. They are outside the boundaries of mainstream Islam, in that they refuse to even concede that they speak as representatives of a sect. Wahhabis (of all stripes) protest to even the name of Wahhabis: we are only Muslims, they assert; i.e. they alone are Muslim and everyone else is a kafir [unbeliever] who should be fought as ancient pagans at the time of Mohammad. Wahhabis claim that they represent the 'true Islam' when the strength of Islam throughout the ages is that there is no such thing as 'the true Islam.'""So the only claim to being ""true Islam"" is that proclaimed by Saudi Arabia -- and asserted by ISIS, too. Just to be clear, this joint claim derives from them both sharing the same doctrinal foundation: ʿAbd al-Wahhab's key text, The Book of Monotheism. ISIS, in short, is as Wahhabist -- or more so -- as the Saudi King, Abdullah. There is here, surely, a delicious irony in Obama and Kerry taking upon their shoulders the task of seeking the ""delegitimization"" of the very doctrine from which the Saudi kingdom is derived. So, the only upholder of ""true Islam"" and custodian of Mecca happens to share the ""same"" Islam as ISIS. How can King Abdullah then denounce it? And how could any Muslim, familiar with the issues, take any such denunciation -- were it to be made -- seriously? AND IT IS A STATEJohn Kerry would be right if he said al Qaeda is an ideology and not a regime. But he is wrong about ISIS. Unlike al Qaeda which only had an ""idea,"" ISIS has a clear purpose: to establish God's ""principality"" here and now. It has a doctrine for how to bring such a state into existence (drawn from the wars launched to establish the original Islamic State); it holds a territory greater in size than that of Great Britain; it has large financial resources; it has a handsomely equipped army (courtesy of the U.S., the U.K. and others), one that is led by competent commanders; and it has a leader who, many find, spoke well (on the one occasion that he has appeared publicly). In brief, this development (the ""Islamic State"") may be much more serious, be more grounded, and have much wider appeal than western bluster about ""thugs"" and ""mindless killers"" would imply. THE REAL TARGET OF AMERICA'S ARAB ALLIES IS ASSAD A number of Gulf and Arab states have signed up with Washington to fight ISIS, but only because they plan to insert a Trojan Horse into the ""war"" agenda. Their troops hidden in the belly of the wooden ""horse"" are gathered -- not to fight ISIS -- but to fight a quite different war. They want to turn it into a renewed offensive against President Assad and Syria. Indeed, at their preliminary summit in Jeddah, the Arab States agreed to a new Arab security architecture that would subvert the ""war on ISIS"" into war not just on ISIS, but also on President Assad and all Islamists (plainly they hope to pull the West into a larger war with the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, Hezbollah, etc.). Leading Saudi commentator, Jamal Khashoggi made the Saudi plan clear in a recent op-ed: ""We can thus say that eliminating ISIS also calls for the elimination of Assad ... The operation must target Moscow's ally in Damascus and topple him or pave the way to toppling him. Perhaps this is the logical explanation as to why Saudi Arabia approved training camps for the moderate Syrian opposition. It's tantamount to declaring an indirect war on the Syrian regime ... The Jeddah alliance is everyone's opportunity for a new beginning. It is not limited to its immediate task of eliminating ISIS but also includes the possibility of expanding towards reforming the situation in Iraq and Syria.""America's position is the nuanced one that it will not ""coordinate"" with Damascus, but, it will ""deconflict"" (Kerry's words) with it. Syria's armed forces demonstrably have militarily effectiveness, and America knows it -- and the only other game in town (as its expression goes), is ISIS. So, America, it seems, has conceded -- as a sop in order to keep the Gulf engaged -- to some Saudi diversion of the ""war against ISIS"" into a war, retargeted, to unseat President Assad. This reorientation sits comfortably with the Gulf exculpatory narrative that ISIS is no armed neo-Wahhabist vanguard movement, but merely a natural Sunni ""reaction"" that arose out of Assad's and former Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki's sectarian policies. Saudi Arabia will -- as its contribution to defeating ISIS -- then train and arm 5,000 ""moderate"" Syrian oppositionists to return to Syria. The U.S. understands full well that its (and its Saudi sponsor's) objective will be to bring down Assad -- and not to fight ISIS (with whom the Syrian ""moderates"" reportedly coordinate in battle and have a non-aggression pact). Syria's army is 130,000 strong, plus a further 100,000 auxiliaries. It is not likely that Saudi's Syrian brigades -- which have had a dismal record so far -- will bring down President Assad, but they will make U.S. policy incoherent and Syria more bloodstained. If there are two main protagonists in Syria -- the Syrian Army and ISIS -- then America has no choice: It must prefer Assad, but it cannot be seen to be doing so, without offending Saudi Arabia. So America enters the conflict with one arm tied behind its back (by its own Gulf allies). In ISIS' strategically important Syrian backyard, America has no visible and direct partner -- indeed, as former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and Syria Ryan Crocker commented: ""We need to do everything we can to figure out who the non-ISIS [Syrian] opposition is. Frankly, we don't have a clue"" -- but can only work with Assad in a deniable and indirect way (which it is doing). But the U.S. cannot really hope to prevail against ISIS in such a convoluted manner -- and with its Gulf allies (and many American think tank allies, too -- see here, here and here) trying to muddy the waters by inserting their own Saudi-trained ""moderate"" army in order to weaken Assad at the same time that America is ""deconflicting"" with him. U.S. AIR ATTACKS SEEN AS ANTI-SUNNI, NOT ANTI-ISISEven in Iraq, the anti-ISIS coalition limitations will become more clear. Air attacks will become perceived not as attacks on ISIS but as attacks on the very Sunni communities into which it has merged and melted away. (The Iraqi government already has had to halt such strikes for this reason).The Iraqi Shiite will defend their territories with utmost vigor, but may well choose to stay aloof from entering the Euphrates Valley with its long history as a militant Sunni heartland. Baghdad will not wish to pursue the war into a full-court sectarian conflict, and the Peshmerga will have neither the capability nor the will to do more than protect their own communities. In sum, ISIS may find that there is actually a notable lack of regional will to repair the fracture of Iraq -- but instead a will that seeks to contain it as is.ISIS NOT A THREAT TO AMERICA Is the Islamic State a threat then? It is worth recalling that -- unlike al Qaeda -- ISIS' primary aim is not so much to provoke America into an overreaction and self-implosion (as Bin Laden thought the Afghan war had done to the Soviet Union). ISIS is not, of course, indifferent towards America, but it's primordial focus rather, is on founding God's Principality on earth, and instituting God's Law. It is not surprising then, that U.S. officials say that there is no present threat to the U.S. homeland. ISIS is about seizing territory militarily, securing its frontiers, eliminating idolatry and heresy and physically establishing a Caliphate."

But that is what Oklahoma Rep. John Bennett is doing by fear mongering against the whole American Muslim community. Bennett is creating imaginary Muslim enemies where none exist.Yet, Bennett is standing by his needlessly inflammatory statements, doubling down on comments about American Islam, and saying that ""This is a cancer in our nation that needs to be cut out.""Let's be clear. The biggest threat to the self-aggrandizing extremist group ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) is a prosperous, peaceful American Muslim community. American Muslims as law-abiding American citizens threaten the whole ISIL imaginary cosmic war of Muslims against the ""Great Satan"" of Western countries. Make no mistake. ISIL is a sadistic group of murdering, thieving thugs, but they are estimated at best between 20,000 and 30,000 fighters. When you place those numbers against the power of the United States, and the combined power of the U.S. and its allies, you see how small ISIL actually is.But ISIL itself is in the business of creating an imaginary Muslim through their media strategy. ISIL has a very savvy social media strategy playing the hashtag game on Twitter to magnify their cyber footprint. ISIL is playing us. By projecting every Western nightmare of the black hooded figure killing in a viscerally brutal way, as they did with the filmed execution of James Foley, the fine young journalist they brutally murdered, ISIL is targeting Americans for their fear mongering. They project themselves as larger and more threatening than they really are with that execution image, and now others also brutally murdered, gaming both Americans into fearing them and reaching new audiences for radicalizing and recruitment. Fear mongering in return, especially against an American Muslim community that is roundly condemning ISIL for what it is doing, does not help reduce the threat of ISIL to its proper size so we can deal with them effectively. Fear mongering only magnifies that threat into unrealistic, nightmare proportions and tempts us to behave reactively and hatefully, giving more energy to ISIL rather than using that energy to defeat them.Astonishingly, however, Bennett thinks this hateful fear mongering is compatible with the love ethic of Jesus. ""We need to share his [Jesus'] story, love others and stand for freedom,"" he said, after having called Islam a ""cancer."" Bennett seemed not to see the contradiction. No, it is not what Jesus meant by love to label fellow Americans a ""cancer"" when they have done nothing but hold a different faith than your own. Bennett himself is giving into the spirit of fear, not following the spirit of love. As a Christian pastor and teacher, I know it is unfaithful to give into fear. Jesus frequently teaches his disciples not to be afraid. In Matthew 10, verses 26-31, Jesus is recorded as saying ""do not fear"" three times, as Jesus exposes how the disciples would have cause to fear persecution for following his teachings, but that fear was unfaithful because fear gives over your power to the one threatening you. Don't do that, Jesus teaches. The disciples had plenty to fear from the brutal, sadistic Romans, a vast empire that ruled by fear and intimidation by their own military might and with the help of their local collaborators. The Romans were a real empire, not the bloated self-projection of some group of terrorists who call themselves ISIL. Jesus teaches the disciples to realize their fears are unfaithful, and that giving into fear only magnifies their hatefulness.The fear mongering of someone like Rep. Bennett magnifies hatred, and creates imaginary Muslim enemies where there are none. Instead of creating imaginary Muslims to fear, let us come together as Americans and as people of different faiths and humanist values to stand firm against the reality of the brutality of ISIL and confront it together. That is the only sure way we can be safe as Americans. And for me, as a Christian, that is the way of faithfulness."
3,POLITICS,Congress Ashamed Of Congress For Tending To Elections Before War Authorization Debate,Jennifer Bendery and Sabrina Siddiqui,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-war-authorization-isis_n_5831408.html,,2014-09-18,"UNITED STATES - SEPTEMBER 13: Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., speaks during a news conference on the Farm Bill's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) outside the Capitol on Thursday, Sept. 13, 2012. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d62824000032005772f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Congress is ashamed of itself for tending to elections before having a war authorization vote. But they'll do it anyway.A bipartisan faction of lawmakers has been demanding a vote to authorize President Barack Obama's military escalation against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. Obama maintains he doesn't need a new authorization to expand U.S. military strikes against the terrorist group; indeed, the U.S. has already carried out 160 airstrikes in Iraq this summer and plans to expand into Syria. But some lawmakers disagree that the president has the authority under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force to carry out an open-ended campaign of airstrikes against the Islamic State, and argue that Congress must weigh in -- if not for legal reasons, then at least to show where they stand on the serious matter of going to war. But with elections around the corner, many lawmakers aren't inclined to wade into a thorny debate about war authorization that could jeopardize their races. So the debate is being sidelined for two months, at a minimum, as political campaigns take hold. Not that members of Congress seem particularly surprised by their collective priorities.""I find it an act of cowardice, but not astonishing,"" said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).""Is it embarrassing? Yes,"" said Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.). ""It's an election year. Self-preservation trumps national security.""Members leading the charge for a new, better tailored AUMF speculate it's more than the current election cycle that's sending colleagues running from the issue. U.S. military action against the Islamic State could extend into and even beyond 2016, and should things go awry, lawmakers are inclined to let the president take the fall.""It's easier to be on the sidelines and, you know, if everything goes well, to say, 'I was always with you.' If not, you can say, 'Whoa, you blew it,'"" said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.). ""The fact that we're all taking great pains to do the absolute minimum to avoid an authorization ... is not only not doing our job, it's cowardice.""HuffPost talked to more than a dozen lawmakers about whether they thought Congress should stay in session to delve into the issue. Nearly everyone said yes.""I think we should complete discussions on this now. Absolutely,"" said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). ""This is what we're paid to do.""""Why wouldn't you vote?"" asked Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.). ""Either you're for it or against it, and if you can't defend either being for it or against it, you don't have any business being here in the first place.""""I think the president would be missing an opportunity if he fails to see Senate approval, because it will strengthen his position,"" added Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). ""I am in favor of more votes as soon as possible."" Yet, the reality is that lawmakers are the ones fueling their party leaders' decisions on whether or not to hold votes -- and when to leave town. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), for example, wouldn't be adjourning for two months if most Democrats were demanding attention to a war authorization debate. The same applies to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Republicans. In others words, some of the same lawmakers telling reporters they want a debate on war authorization may also be privately telling party leaders they want nothing to do with it.""People don't really want to take that vote,"" said one frustrated House Democrat, who requested anonymity. ""People say stuff in there, but they won't vote on it. Talk is cheap. Do I think there will be a vote when we come back? No.""For his part, Reid said he doesn't think it makes Congress seem cowardly that lawmakers are waiting until after they get re-elected to debate the limits of the president's war authority.""I didn't know we were waiting,"" he grumbled.Lawmakers do have to take one war-related vote before they leave town. It's on the narrower question of whether to support Obama's request to arm and train Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State. The House approved that measure Wednesday evening, and the Senate is poised to pass it on Thursday. During the House vote, the measure's opponents frequently cited their broader questions about the U.S. war unfolding overseas.""Just how steep is the slippery slope we are embarking upon? How long will the conflict last? Is there an exit strategy? What does victory look like? How much will it cost? How many U.S. lives will be lost?"" asked Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.).Not everyone feels a sense of urgency on the need for a war authorization debate. Some lawmakers say they're fine with waiting until November to tackle the issue, even as U.S. military action escalates in the meantime.""I think at one point, we've got to vote on this issue and deal with that. If it's before the election, that doesn't bother me -- if it's before or after,"" said Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska), emphasizing that the vote on arming Syrian rebels suffices for now. ""I don't support funding the rebels, and that's the issue that's in front of me today.""""[Obama] needs to have a specific vote and approval by Congress at some point. I think it would be -- both legally and from a buy-in perspective from the American people -- wise for him to do that,"" said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.), ""but I don't know what the president is going to do.""""It's going to take time for Congress to be able to see if [the president's plans] are achievable goals,"" added Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.). ""I think we'll know a lot more as a couple more weeks pass."" Others said they're willing to take the president at his word that he can take military action against the Islamic State on his own.""I think what we'll do today is give the president exactly what he wants. He is the commander in chief. He was elected to that role,"" said Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.). ""Right now the administration is telling us they have all the existing authority. I know some of my friends would like to repeal that authority, but I don't think that's the will of the body.""""I believe what the president has done so far -- and will be doing -- he doesn't need a vote to do that,"" said Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.). ""Some people seem to want to have a vote now; they're of the opinion he doesn't have authority now. That's a difference of opinion.""Even after the elections, there's no guarantee that lawmakers will prioritize a debate on war authorization. It may come down to public opinion deciding when, or if, Congress turns its attention to defining the limits on the president's authority to carry out attacks against the Islamic State -- an endeavor that some speculate could go on for years and incur significant costs.""It's up to our constituents to determine if they think we're doing our jobs,"" said Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.). ""The public needs to judge the democracy. That's what elections are all about."""

The idea is that the extra weight and bulk of their elaborate tails make it hard for peacocks to get off the ground in a hurry--and thus makes them more vulnerable to predators.But surprising new research from the University of Leeds in England shoots down that hypothesis.Dr. Graham Askew, associate professor in muscle function and movement at the university's School of Biomedical Sciences, took high-speed films of five Indian peacocks as they took to the air. Then he clipped the birds' tails and again filmed their take-offs.Askew believed that the birds with the tails would take longer to get off the ground. After all, as he explained in a written statement issued by the university, ""These feathers weigh about 300 grams and can exceed 1.5 meters, so it's expected that the male birds would be making a significant sacrifice in their flight performance for being attractive--possibly giving up their lives if the train restricts escape from predators such as tigers and leopards in their natural environment.""But Askew found no significant difference in the birds' ability to get airborne before or after their tails were clipped--a finding he described as ""a bit surprising.""The peacock tail is considered a prime example of sexual selection, a form of natural selection in which some animals have specific features that make it easier for them to attract mates--and thus reproduce. Other examples include lions' manes and elks' antlers.Of course, just because the peacock's spectacular plumage doesn't affect flight performance doesn't mean it comes at no cost to the birds. ""There could be other costs associated with possessing a train,"" Askew told The Huffington Post in an email, ""such as the energy invested in producing the feathers (about 3% of their daily energy budget), changes in maneuverability, and a potential cost of making the birds more conspicuous to predators.""A paper describing Askew's research was published Sept. 18, 2014 in The Journal of Experimental Biology."

Irving, the first pick in the 2011 draft by Cleveland, earned Rookie of the Year honors. Last season, he averaged 21 points and a career-high six assists while making his second All-Star game (and earning the All-Star MVP). He was promptly rewarded with a sparkling new five-year, $90 million contract extension. Most recently, the Duke product led Team USA to a gold medal in the FIBA World Cup while anchoring point guard responsibilities and earning the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.Irving caught up with The Huffington Post during the FIBA games to discuss his love of music, his work with Coach K, and his thoughts on LeBron James, who recently said: ""I believe Kyrie can be the best point guard in the league very soon.""You are collaborating with Skullcandy music. What role has music played during your life?When I was younger my dad took me around a lot of old school music, whether it was church music or R&B. ... Then as I got older, I just started becoming interested in country music. I mean, I just have a true appreciation of it because of the way someone can express themselves through a beat and instruments and words is truly inspiring. I just have a true passion for it. What kind of music do you listen to before games?All types, man. Some playlists I have some ""Frozen"" songs on it from the Disney movie, ""Frozen."" Just everything, you know. Hey, that's a good movie, man. It's a great movie. Are there a few favorite artists that stand out for you?One of my good friends is Chris Brown, I’ve been onto him for the last few years. Then J. Cole, Nas, Jamie Cullum, the pianist. A little bit of George Winston -- he’s a pianist as well. Those are my favorites.How is playing under Coach K for the national team different from your experience working with him at Duke?It’s not a big difference. He just expects a little bit more out of me than he did at Duke. Our relationship is always looking each other in the eye and always telling each other the truth, and that’s how our relationship has been since I met him.The international game seems to fit your skills so well in the open floor. Give me a sense of how comfortable you are right now with your game, especially with the FIBA style of play.It’s definitely an adjustment, especially in the open court. That’s where I excel, so I try to do that as much as possible and just try to make everybody better as well. We have so many weapons, so many guys that are playing on this team. This is fun. It’s really fun. With that in mind, what you can extract from this experience that you can take to the NBA to help take you to the next level?I’ve had a chance to play with a lot of players, but every time I get the chance to play with the best of the best, it’s such a unique opportunity that I feel honored to get. My role is totally different with the Cavs than it is with [Team USA], and I’m completely OK with that, just because I know the game is that much easier and that much more fun when you have guys that are basically at the peak of what we do. What do you learn about yourself when you’re in a different country with all of these guys playing basketball against international competitors? Do you feel like it makes you more mature, off the floor as well? As far as a basketball standpoint, you learn from everybody who’s on the team and the coaching staff, everybody. And you can build relationships on and off the floor. That’s what I’m really about. Obviously when I’m on the court I take care of business, but off the court it’s about building relationships you never thought you could develop. Just being a human outside of the game. The game is what it is, it’s going to be what it is, and I gotta keep living my life no matter what, and that’s what I do.With your new contract, how excited are you to get out and show that you really are the best point guard in the NBA? How does the contact make you look at the game differently?I’m just looking forward to the amount of space and the amount of plays there are gonna be. The easy job of just showing up every night but knowing that everybody’s ready to go to war. Not to disrespect any other time that we’ve had, but this is the best team I’m going to be a part of, and I see it as that. Being part of a great team. We’re a good team right now, but we want to become a great team eventually. Coming into this season, that’s the biggest thing in my mindset, doing whatever possible to win and try to win a championship. That combination of you and LeBron -- talk about the open floor. That really is going to be incredible. What was your first reaction when you found out he was joining your team?I was excited. Obviously one of the best players coming back home is something that is monumental, and I think in NBA league history, to have three All-Stars on one team ... I mean it's happened before.But not like this.That’s what I’m saying. We only have five guys returning from the team last year, so that’s crazy in itself. Of course, we have Mike Miller, James Jones, Matrix (Shawn Marion). We have a chance to do something special, so now we just gotta make it happen.At what point will you start to talk with your guys, whether it’s the returners or LeBron or Kevin Love? Or is that something that just happens on the floor during camp?Who knows? Honestly, I have no idea. It can happen the first day I get back, it can happen end of the season, mid-week in the season. We just have to develop an identity. I think that’s the most important thing is find out who we want to be, and exactly what we want to accomplish. The ultimate goal is to win a championship but the journey is what’s going to be the biggest part in how we try to devise this. A lot of people are going to be going for us, but it’s something you want as a competitor.What has been the reaction from all the Uncle Drew ads? Because they’re incredible, everybody seems to love them and they've even developed a cult following. I’m just thankful that everybody loved it. I get joy out of it, watching other people enjoy it as well. It’s more or less something we all can connect to, because we all know that old guy that comes to the park, and either he’s good or he’s terrible. I just wanted to do something that people could connect to, and we’re all part of it. It wasn’t just me making it, but everyone joining in on the experience and being part of something bigger than all of us. It’s a role that I played; I didn’t know it was going to become that big but I’m just really excited that everyone enjoyed it, and I continue to make it because it puts smiles on people’s faces. Let's talk about Kevin Love for a moment. Where do you see him being the best asset to your two-man game? Pick-and-roll, pick-and-pop, transition?What’s crazy is that LeBron and K-Love have been in the top 10 in scoring the last three years. And I’m in the top 20 my last two years. We all come from our respective places where we were before and we all had different roles, but one thing I don’t want them to change is the way we play. And that’s just making plays. It’s not just all about scoring, but just making plays and playing off one another. Me and K-Love playing pick-and-roll, either the point guard is going to go with the two, or he’s going to try to fight over and it’s going to be one-on-one with the big and someone has to help on the back side. You just start thinking about basketball plays and the basketball knowledge that I have, and seeing the play ahead. And I’m already getting excited, because what are teams going to do? You’re going to have to decide who you’re going to guard and how you’re going to guard us, and that’s going to be tough.With that in mind, is Year 1 championship or bust for the Cavs?No, I don’t see it that way. Winning a championship -- either it can happen right away, it can happen in one year, two years. It takes time. Me and K-Love haven’t even been to the playoffs, so it’s not more or less championship or bust, we just gotta figure it out. That’s basically what it’s going to boil down. It’s not about what everyone else thinks, what everyone else is predicting. Either we’re going to be really, really good or we’re going to suck. Everyone’s kind of jumping ship or they’re staying on with us -- honestly I really don’t care. What have you learned from the Spurs and some of these other teams that have been there year in and year out? Every team has their own identities. I don’t think one team should try to emulate what they do. The Spurs, one thing they consistently do is play hard. You can never take that away from them. But they’re also talented as well, do things the right way, and their system works for them. Then we have the Heat last year, which is guys playing around the perimeter, four guys, one in. Pick-and-rolls dominate the offense, LeBron and [Dwyane Wade isolations]. Teams play different ways, and if you find that way to win and it works, then I don’t think you should change it. So we just have to find our identity, and that’s what I’ve learned. When you find out how to win and the way to win, that’s when you start getting on a roll, and things become that much easier.And that identity comes just from playing with one another?Yep, just finding consistency, that’s all. Once you find consistency in this game, then day in, day out you have a legitimate chance at winning. And that’s how I want to feel, that every single day we have that consistency, and knowing that we have a great chance at winning tonight against any team.

The deadly virus also has reached Nigeria and Senegal.Ebola is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of sick patients. But as the epidemic has grown, so have questions about whether, if left unchecked, the virus might transform and become more contagious.In hearings in the Senate and House on Tuesday and Wednesday, lawmakers asked Fauci if it might even become airborne.Viruses certainly mutate all the time, making mistakes as they copy themselves in order to grow and spread, Fauci explained. Most of those mutations are irrelevant, not associated with any biological change.But sometimes, those mutations can make a virus a little more or a little less virulent, or make it a little more or a little less efficient at spreading in whatever way it normally is transmitted, he said.""Very, very rarely does it completely change the way it's transmitted,"" Fauci said.He stressed that he's not saying it's impossible.""People might think I'm pooh-poohing it. I'm not,"" Fauci said.He said the government had funded the Broad Institute in Boston to study the virus' mutations. In a publication last month, the researchers reported a somewhat more rapid rate of mutations than expected at that point in the outbreak, but that nothing had jumped out as being of special concern so far.Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.

At least five civilians, including two young girls, were killed in an air strike by NATO forces in eastern Afghanistan, police and hospital officials said.

I had been meaning to go sooner, but the steep, icy roads up to her 'house' in Kabul prohibited an earlier visit. I guess that Maryam was about 15 when she had her baby, but no one really knows. She lived in a noisy and sparse house full of women and babies -- no men, which is unusual in Afghanistan and left the household somewhat vulnerable. It was wintertime, bitterly cold with little heating. I have no idea how these women ever got money for food, let alone heating. Maryam had recently moved to Kabul from another part of the country, didn't speak Dari, (the trade language of Kabul) and certainly didn't know how to read or write. When I arrived at her dilapidated mud house, I found her sitting with her tiny new baby heavily wrapped. She gave birth at home and had not had any postnatal care. I undressed the baby to conduct a newborn check. When I removed the baby's hat, I was horrified to discover a large oozing open sore on the side of the head, stretching down to the face. The baby had a severe case of impetigo -- an easy-to-treat but infectious bacterial condition, which can become serious if left unchecked. It is most likely that Maryam would not have sought any medical care for her baby had I not visited; she had no money to pay for transport to a health facility, no male chaperone to accompany her, she could not speak the language, didn't have the skills to negotiate a busy clinic and would probably have been ripped off at the pharmacy.An estimated 289,000 women died giving birth last year, and a staggering 2.9 million newborns die during their first month of life, amid sustained efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) 4 and 5 targets of reducing child and maternal mortality rates, respectively.Significant progress towards reaching the MDG's has been made, particularly in the area of maternal health. The number of women dying due to pregnancy or birth related causes fell by nearly 50 percent globally since 1990 - an enormous achievement.Although overall, child (under 5) deaths have been declining, progress towards improving newborn survival is lagging behind. No specific MDG target around reducing newborn mortality has meant less focus in this area. Currently 40 percent of child deaths occur in newborns, representing an increase on newborn deaths in the past 10 years.There has been a tendency to treat the health of mothers and newborns as separate entities, instead of taking the necessitated fully integrated approach. The Lancet's recent Every Newborn series highlighted that the health and wellbeing of mothers and their babies is inseparable and that initiatives to improve maternal health must also incorporate newborn health elements. Putting this into practice, the Every Newborn Action Plan supports the implementation of ""newborn-specific actions"" within the context of maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health. As a midwife myself, it has been encouraging to see the fantastic recent emphasis on strengthening and scaling up midwifery on a global level -- midwives are perfectly placed to provide care to the mother and baby dyad, and are crucial to the success of MDG's 4 and 5 and post-2015 targets related to maternal and newborn health.But it goes even further than this. Evidence shows that educational gains for girls and women are associated with reduced child mortality; the use of modern contraceptives among women of childbearing age reduces fertility rates which in turn benefits the economic growth of countries and leads to greater job opportunities for women; empowering women through community participatory women's groups improves maternal and newborn health. The Every Woman, Every Child movement states that, ""The health of women and children is critically important to almost every area of human development and progress"".There are less than 500 days left to reach the MDG targets. The 17 proposed Sustainable Development Goals encompass a much broader agenda and it is not yet clear how progress will be measured. The great challenge that lies before us is to maintain the focus and build on the gains of improving the lives of mothers and their babies in the post-2015 world.In spite of living in Afghanistan's largest and best-resourced city, Maryam did not have any antenatal care. As a teenager, she was at higher risk of pregnancy related complications during pregnancy and birth. Fortunately, she remained healthy and her birth was straightforward, and with help accessing health care, her baby's impetigo was treated. But things could have been different. I want to see a day when young women like Maryam are educated, protected from child marriage, free to choose when they start having children, able to access care from a skilled midwife during pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period, free to plan how often and how many subsequent children to have, and whose babies not only survive, but thrive."

The Justice Department has reached a $16.65 billion settlement with Bank of America Corporation for financial fraud leading up to and during the financial crisis, the largest civil settlement with a single entity in American history, to resolve federal and state claims against Bank of America and its former and current subsidiaries, including Countrywide Financial Corporation and Merrill Lynch.

""[W]e need not tolerate a system that permits top executives to enjoy all of the rewards of excessively risky activity while bearing none of the responsibility.""As the Justice Department furthers its ongoing investigations into potentially illegal conduct by financial firms, insider information from Wall Street executives has served as a critical factor in equipping prosecutors with the often elusive ""smoking gun"" evidence needed to ensure a conviction, Holder said in excerpts of the speech provided by the Justice Department. But under current law, provisions in the 1989 Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) cap the amount a whistleblower can receive for providing evidence of financial fraud at $1.6 million, ""a paltry sum"" for Wall Street executives, Holder said. In contrast, he argued, the federal False Claims Act, which combats fraud against government programs, allows citizens to receive as much as one-third of any damages recovered by the government.For federal prosecutors to gain access to the evidence needed to bring enforcement actions against financial fraud, Holder said, FIRREA must be modified to provide greater financial incentives for executives risking their careers to provide insider information to investigators.In recent years, however, the Justice Department has faced growing criticism over its failure to bring criminal charges against high-level individuals and major banks in connection with the 2008 financial crisis. Justice Department officials, including Holder, have responded by saying that some banks are just too big to prosecute, and that doing so would upset the global financial system.""I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy,"" Holder said during testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March 2013. ""And I think that is a function of the fact that some of these institutions have become too large.""On Wednesday, Holder further stressed the importance of holding ""individual decision-makers"" responsible for their crimes -- in the name of judicial ""fairness"" and ""accountability.""""All other things being equal, few things discourage criminal activity at a firm -- or incentivize changes in corporate behavior -- like the prospect of individual decision-makers being held accountable,"" Holder said.

I have to say I am thoroughly pleased with the fact that we had an Elizabeth and Courtney showdown for the finale. Usually, MasterChef exaggerates: most extreme pressure test ever, or biggest cooking competition in the world!"" but this finale was super real. Before we start taking bets, I shall provide you with my recap of the events this week. 1) The Top 3 have to cook for top chefs from all over America. Elizabeth wins with a delicious, and super trendy, skin on red snapper with cauliflower three ways. Anyone who's eaten in NYC recently will feel that purple faux-broccoli pain. 2) Elizabeth gets to drink champagne in the balcony and watch the pair cook off. Three classic American desserts: cheesecake, Boston cream pie (I've never had one, but I wanted to shove my face into Courtney's, the drips being more appealing than off-putting), and key lime pie. Yummers. Elizabeth's commentary on the differences between Courtney and Leslie were hysterical. Oh, to be a fly in that studio. Leslie threw salt in his batter and sealed the deal for the ladies. 3) I am rooting for Elizabeth, because her dishes always look so fancy. But then I want to root for Courtney, from my hometown, and because they sort of made a big deal about her past as a dancer in a strip club. Ladies, pull out those pony tails. 4) One full, three-course meal. They start with apps: Courtney has a pig ear salad. Big risk! Elizabeth has a grilled octo salad with fresh chickpeas and chorizo. Joe is not thrilled with bits of dog chew on his plate. Gordon says, much to Courtney's chagrin, that Elizabeth's plate is pretty and pulled off. 5) Elizabeth has lamb with a mint yogurt sauce and veggies, Courtney has duck breast and a farro veggie salad. You can sort of see the theme of both their meals. Courtney calls Elizabeth's lamb raw and it looked like they were going to come to blows. Elizabeth's lamb is uneven -- Joe's is rare, Gordon's perfect, which was a good strategy. Gordon detests a bad temp; Joe can handle it a little bit. Courtney's duck is ""spot on"" and ""stunning"" all around. 6) Elizabeth has a grapefruit and olive oil semolina cake that I want in my face. Courtney is cooking up a meringue, that should take a lot longer than she has. No one is playing it safe. Elizabeth gets Courtney back for her snide raw lamb comment: What does her dish look like? ""It looks like second place."" She put salt in her black cherries and makes Joe think, which is apparently a good thing. Gordon thinks it's clumsy. Elizabeth makes a spot-on cake, but it looks deconstructed and rustic. Everyone loves it though. Elizabeth's menu is connected and thematic. Courtney's was a little innovative though in the pairings, though. Elizabeth's fiance passes out under the pressure. And, it's Courtney. I respect her, but I don't like her and will have to stop here. I can't take the gloating. What did you think? Let me know  @karenfratti. ""MasterChef"" airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on FOX."

Rhea Suh, who currently serves as the assistant secretary for policy, management and budget at the Department of Interior, will take over as president of the NRDC in January, the group said. Suh has served in that DOI post since 2009; in October 2013, Obama nominated her to become the assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks. That confirmation process, however, was delayed by objections from Republicans who argued that Suh was too much of an environmental activist for the job. While her nomination was eventually approved in committee along party lines, it had not yet gone before the full Senate. Before joining DOI, Suh worked at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the David and Lucille Packard Foundation, which both fund environmental programs. This prompted much of the opposition among Republican senators. ""It has been an unparalleled privilege to work for the President and Interior Secretaries Ken Salazar and Sally Jewell,"" Suh said in a statement Wednesday. ""Now, I’m honored to join NRDC, our nation’s intrepid defender of clean air, safe water, and wild places.""She will replace current NRDC President Frances Beinecke, who has served in that capacity since 2006.Suh's selection at the NRDC will likely fuel complaints from Republicans about the environmental group's role in shaping Obama administration policies. A group of Republicans has sought to investigate the group's involvement in the Environmental Protection Agency's new rules on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, accusing the NRDC of having ""improper"" influence over the proposal. The NRDC had previously laid out potential methods of reducing emissions in several public reports. "

The Air Force allowed those who took the oath to omit the phrase until late last year, but then began requiring all airmen to take the full oath, the Washington Post reported.In a statement, Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James said the changes to the Air Force policy were effective immediately. “We take any instance in which Airmen report concerns regarding religious freedom seriously,” Lee said in the statement. “We are making the appropriate adjustments to ensure our Airmen's rights are protected.”Both the Army and the Navy allow soldiers and sailors to omit saying “so help me God” from their oaths when they enlist."
