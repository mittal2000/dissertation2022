Equal parts art-world underdog, feminist icon and object of kitsch, Kahlo's legacy seems as miraculous as her too-short life.Having lived in pain, barely surviving a bus accident at age 17 that left her unable to carry a pregnancy to term, Kahlo died -- according to her best-known biographer, almost certainly by suicide -- 61 years ago to the day at age 47. A passionate woman, colorful metaphorically and not, she was known as much for her famous marriage to painter Diego Rivera as for the affairs she conducted outside of it. But much of the vibrant work she left behind, even in light of her recent popularity, is difficult to come by. Outside of a computer screen, a postcard or a novelty tee, that is.Museums are trying to keep up with her fans. Several recent and upcoming exhibitions boast Kahlo's name -- usually alongside Rivera's -- but to provide more substance often rely on letters, sketches and other artifacts. The New York Botanical Garden even recreated her garden, in addition to displaying a small handful of paintings.""Look How Many Works By Frida Kahlo We Were Able To Get"" could be the title of most Kahlo-inspired exhibitions, one art dealer remarked to Artnet. As for private collectors, only about 60 works have made it to the auction block in the past two decades, according to an Artnet investigation.With all our love for Frida Kahlo, why does her work seem so elusive?Most importantly, Kahlo was not a prolific artist, explained Axel Stein, Sotheby's head of Latin American art. Due to her long list of health problems, ""she had a lot of time on her bed,"" Stein told The Huffington Post. ""That's why [many works appear in] small format. She had a whole stretcher built specially so she could paint on her bed."" Kahlo was very particular, only completing around 130 paintings and an additional hundred or so drawings. (Biographer Hayden Herrera estimates 200 total works and Stein gave a range from 200 to 250.)Compounding the issue of volume -- particularly for private collectors -- is the fact that Mexican patrimony laws prohibit much of her work from leaving that nation. Estimates are difficult to assess, but Stein ventured a guess that about 75 percent of Kahlo's work resides in Mexico. ""Whatever she painted in Mexico, usually stayed in Mexico,"" Stein said. As a distinguished historical figure, Kahlo's works are designated ""artistic monuments"" by Mexico's National Institution of Fine Arts (INBA), and held in private collections. They may only be exported from the country temporarily, and cultural non-profits -- including most U.S. museums -- must request permission from the INBA to allow specific works to travel internationally. (Other for-profits must also post a bond to ensure safe return.) Despite how intimidating that all may seem, chief curator Bonnie Clearwater of the NSU Museum of Art in Fort Lauderdale, which put on a recent Kahlo exhibit, says the process was relatively painless.The other portion of her body of work -- those paintings completed outside of Mexico and exported before the law went into effect -- can move about without so much bureaucracy. And Kahlo did paint when she visited the U.S. several times with Rivera, spending time in Detroit, Chicago and parts of California, as well as when she traveled for certain medical procedures.Although they don't number many, private collectors the world over have come to own original Kahlo works. But it's not always easy getting them to museums for the public. Of the two largest Kahlo collections -- that of Jacques and Natasha Gelman, with 11, and Dolores Olmedo, with 25 -- only the Gelmans' paintings are available for nearly full-time lending. The Vergel Foundation, established after Natasha's death in 2002, has booked shows in Sao Paulo, Brasilia, Sydney, Madrid, Vancouver, Poznan and Milan until 2018. The Dolores Olmedo Museum, which houses Olmedo's collection in Mexico City, also lends paintings for exhibition, but is chiefly interested in keeping its works on its own walls, Vergel Foundation President Robert Littman told HuffPost.""It's hard to organize a Frida Kahlo show without the Gelman pictures and the Olmedo pictures, because those are the principal lenders,"" Littman explained. Other collectors may not be so generous. Madonna, for instance, repeatedly rejected requests to lend a Kahlo to the DIA for its recent exhibition. Littman noted another collector, in Argentina, who also steadfastly refuses to share his paintings. Others may be convinced, with some wishing to remain anonymous.But if auction houses are any indicator, people want to see a lot more Frida Kahlo. Stein told HuffPost about a particular piece, ""La venadita,"" depicting Kahlo's head atop the body of a small deer running through the woods with arrows piercing its body. In 1985, the work carried an estimated value of $175,000 to $200,000.""The other day someone called the office and asked about that painting, if I knew where it was,"" Stein said. ""Because he was happy to pay $7 million.""If that buyer succeeds, it would be a new record purchase for a Kahlo painting, the previous having been set with her self-portrait ""Roots"" in 2006 for $5.6 million.""It's astonishing,"" Clearwater noted, ""to see how her work continues to grow in popularity and how viewers truly connect with the paintings.""Clarification: This article has been edited to clarify that Kahlo's health did not prevent her from becoming pregnant, but did prevent her from having children."

""I have been accused of a crime. Of looking into the dead yet pleading eyes of a girl, unable to move while she was brutally raped and doing nothing. I have never been one to deny my mistakes in life and I wouldn't start now. If I were guilty, I would admit it,"" the 55-year-old wrote on Facebook on Saturday.""There are so many excuses I could make being only one month into my sixteenth year at the time that people would understand but I am innocent. When I return from Sweden I will seek a qualified polygraph examiner to put to rest any and all allegations."" She added, ""I will make public the questions, answers and results of that test. I will prove I am telling the truth. I will not allow anyone to throw me under the bus and accuse me of such a foul act. I will fight for myself. It is the only thing I can do.""According The Huffington Post reporter Jason Cherkis' story, Fuchs says the last thing she remembers before the rape was looking up to see Jett and Currie staring at her. Currie claims she spoke up and left the room while the rape was taking place, however, Kari Krome, who was 14 at the time, and also claims to have been sexually assaulted by Fowley at a different time, recalled that Jett and Currie were sitting off to the side of the room, snickering. Currie's comments come a day after Jett released her own statement on Facebook denying that knowledge of Fuchs' rape. “Anyone who truly knows me understands that if I was aware of a friend or bandmate being violated, I would not stand by while it happened.” Jett wrote on Friday. ""For a group of young teenagers thrust into '70s rock stardom there were relationships that were bizarre, but I was not aware of this incident. Obviously Jackie’s story is extremely upsetting and although we haven’t spoken in decades, I wish her peace and healing.”Fuchs left the band in 1977 and the Runaways broke up in 1979. Read the full story on Jackie Fuchs and The Lost Girls. UPDATE: In a blog post, former Runaways bassist Jackie Fuchs responded to the ""outpouring of love and support"" she has received since The Huffington Post first published her claims that she was raped by the band's manager on New Year’s Eve 1975, while others, including her bandmates watched. In the post, which originally appeared on Facebook, she wrote, ""I know some people watching the online drama unfold have been discouraged by the lack of support I've received from my former bandmates. To which I can only say that I hope you never have to walk in their shoes. My rape was traumatic for everyone, not just me, and everyone deals with trauma in their own way and time."" She added, ""All I can say about what was said and done is that my bandmates were children who'd witnessed something criminal and tragic. I've no doubt they were dealing with it as best they were able. They had no responsible adults to guide them -- only a rapist and his apologists.""Fuchs went on to say that ""being a passive bystander is not a ""crime,"" which is what Currie claimed she was being accused of in her statement. Rather Fuchs wrote that ""All of us have been passive bystanders at some point in our lives.""Read her full blog post here. "

So it is an agreement that is practically forced upon us,"" he told BBC radio.If the summit on Greece's third bailout had failed, Athens would have been staring into an economic abyss with its banks on the brink of collapse and the prospect of having to print a parallel currency and exit the euro.""The agreement was laborious, but it has been concluded. There is no Grexit,"" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told a news conference after 17 hours of bargaining.He dismissed suggestions that Tsipras had been humiliated even though the summit statement insisted repeatedly that Greece must now subject much of its public policy to prior agreement by bailout monitors.""In this compromise, there are no winners and no losers,"" Juncker said. ""I don't think the Greek people have been humiliated, nor that the other Europeans have lost face. It is a typical European arrangement.""Tsipras himself, elected five months ago to end five years of suffocating austerity, said he had ""fought a tough battle"" and ""averted the plan for financial strangulation.""But to get the accord through parliament by the deadline on Wednesday, Tsipras will have to rely on votes from pro-European opposition parties, raising big question marks over the future of his government and opening the prospect of snap elections.Leftwing rebels in the ruling Syriza party and his junior coalition partner, the right-wing Independent Greeks party, indicated they would not tear up election pledges that brought them to power in January.""We cannot agree to that,"" Independent Greeks leader Panos Kammenos told reporters after meeting Tsipras. ""In a parliamentary democracy there are rules and we uphold them.""CONDITIONAL AGREEMENTGreece won conditional agreement to receive a possible 86 billion euros ($95 billion) over three years. As part of the deal, euro zone finance ministers will discuss on Monday how to keep Greece financed during the time it will need to agree a bailout, but none of the options appear easy, officials said.Athens must meet a tight timetable for enacting unpopular reforms of value added tax, pensions, budget cuts, bankruptcy rules and an EU banking law that could be used to make big depositors take losses.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she could recommend ""with full confidence"" that the Bundestag authorize the opening of loan negotiations once the Greek parliament has approved the entire program and passed the first laws.The Bundestag is due to vote on Greece on Friday.Merkel's allies meanwhile defended the deal, with her chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, saying Europe had won and Germany ""was part of the solution -- from the beginning until the end!""But in Greece, relief was mixed with anger at Germany. ""Listen, it is some sort of victory but it is a pyrrhic victory because the measures are very strict,"" Marianna, 73, told Reuters.Asked whether the tough conditions imposed on Greece were not similar to the 1919 Versailles treaty that forced crushing reparations on a defeated Germany after World War One, Merkel said: ""I won't take part in historical comparisons, especially when I didn't make them myself.""The deterioration of the Greek economy since Tsipras won office in January, and particularly in the last two weeks, had led to a much higher financing need, she said.One senior EU official put the cost to Greece of the last two weeks of turmoil at 25 to 30 billion euros. A euro zone diplomat said it might be closer to 50 billion euros.Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said Greece had been ""humiliated"" - mostly as a result of its refusal to take an offer made to it two weeks ago and he said the talks had been brutal. ""It was not pretty to watch,"" he said. STATE ASSETSTsipras accepted a compromise on German-led demands for the sequestration of Greek state assets worth 50 billion euros - including recapitalised banks - in a trust fund beyond government reach, to be sold off primarily to pay down debt. In a gesture to Greece, some 12.5 billion euros of the proceeds would go to investment in Greece, Merkel said.The Greek leader had to drop his opposition to a full role for the International Monetary Fund in the next bailout, which Merkel had insisted on to win parliamentary backing in Berlin.In a sign of how hard it may be for Tsipras to convince his own Syriza party to accept the deal, Labor Minister Panos Skourletis said the terms were unviable and would lead to new elections this year.Six sweeping measures including spending cuts, tax hikes and pension reforms must be enacted by Wednesday night and the entire package endorsed by parliament before talks can start, the leaders decided.In almost the only concession after imposing its tough terms on Tsipras, Germany dropped a proposal to make Greece take a ""time-out"" from the euro zone that many said resembled a forced ejection if it failed to meet the conditions.Tsipras was subjected to a 17-hour browbeating by leaders furious that he had spurned their previous bailout offer on more favorable terms in June and held a referendum last week to reject it. Only France and Italy worked to try to soften the terms being imposed on Greece.Some diplomats questioned whether it was feasible to rush the package through the Greek parliament in three days.Tsipras is set to sack ministers who did not support him and make dissident Syriza lawmakers resign their seats, people close to the government said.Even if this week's rescue succeeds, EU diplomats question whether Greece will stay the course on a three-year program.Euro zone finance ministers were tasked with finding sources of immediate bridge funding for Greece to prevent it defaulting on a key payment to the ECB next Monday.Greece needs 7 billion euros of funding by July 20, when it must make a bond redemption to the ECB, and 12 billion euros by mid-August when another ECB payment falls due.The ECB on Monday maintained emergency funding for Greek banks to keep them just afloat this week, a banking source said.

He was 55. Iwata was a popular figure among the company's many fans, in no small part due to the fact that he was an enthusiastic gamer who had risen to power from the ranks of programmers. ""On my business card, I am a corporate president. In my mind, I am a game developer,"" he said at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in 2005. ""But in my heart, I am a gamer.""In 2002, Iwata became the fourth president of Nintendo, which began in 1889 making ""hanafuda,"" or ""flower cards,"" a traditional Japanese card game. He was the first president who didn't belong to the Yamauchi family, Nintendo's founders. While attending the Tokyo Institute of Technology in the 1980s, Iwata freelanced as a developer for HAL Laboratory, a second-party developer for Nintendo. He joined HAL full-time after graduation, where he worked on popular titles such as ""Balloon Fight"" and the Kirby series, and became president in 1993 before moving over to Nintendo. But Iwata's career as a programmer actually began much earlier, when he was just a high school student. ""My first interest was computers. At the time, there were no personal computers, so the very first computer I bought was a calculator -- a calculator capable of programming,"" Iwata told Polygon in 2012. ""It only displayed numbers, but with a calculator that only displays numbers, I somehow made games and played them with friends.""While ascending to head of Nintendo, Iwata never seemed to lose his enthusiasm for the games or his connection to those who play them; he even had an online series of in-depth and at times freewheeling Q&As with Nintendo game designers called ""Iwata Asks.""As head of Nintendo, Iwata presided over some of the company's biggest hits, including the Wii gaming system and Nintendo DS. But there were also a few missteps. Last year, he cut his salary in half for five months after the company's stock fell due to disappointing sales of Wii U. Some critics also say the company has been too slow to embrace other portable platforms such as Apple's iOS and Google's Android. Iwata missed the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) last year due to illness, but recently recovered enough to relaunch the ""Iwata Asks"" series. News of his death sent shockwaves through the industry. Even a major corporate rival paid tribute to a man who spent his life in video games:Fans of Nintendo also took to social media to express their grief and share memories: "
10,WOMEN,Olympic Hammer Thrower Amanda Bingson Is A Body Positivity Queen,Nina Friend,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amanda-bingson-on_us_55a03783e4b0b8145f72cf36,"""It’s a lot harder than you realize to throw naked.""",2015-07-13,"Amanda Bingson, 25-year-old USA track and field hammer thrower, talks about body image and being an athlete.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a3f29f1700001111326916.png?cache=1uGdsM067E&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Amanda Bingson's route to appearing nude on the cover of a popular U.S. magazine might seem a bit unconventional for the particular milestone. The 25-year-old hammer thrower was recently featured on one of ESPN magazine's six covers for its seventh annual Body Issue. Bingson walked onto the track team at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas in 2008, where she began competing in the hammer throw event in 2009. After finishing college in 2012 and only a few years after picking up the sport, she placed second in the U.S. Olympic Trials, qualifying for the 2012 Summer Olympic Track and Field Team.A year later, in the 2013 USA Outdoor Championship, Bingson earned her first national title and broke a U.S. record.Last week, HuffPost chatted with Bingson about the overwhelming reaction to her ESPN cover. In the interview, the athlete got real about self-esteem, throwing naked and that awesome Olympic rings tattoo.The Huffington Post: When you were asked to be photographed for the Body Issue. What was your initial reaction?Amanda Bingson: That it wasn’t real, honestly, because we were talking about it but I thought that’s all it was -- just kind of talk. And now that it’s actually happening, it’s so surreal. And everybody has just been so supportive in helping me realize what everything could be and that I want to be here and following my dreams.Was there ever a moment when you didn’t want to pose? Yeah, right before I walked out. I was super excited and really into it, but then of course once you get into that situation you have all these different things going through your head. I was having everybody try to help me get amped up. We had rock music going on in the trailer, they were giving me a rubdown on my shoulders like I was getting ready to go out for a fight. I was getting a little nervous. But everyone was like, ""Go have fun with it, its fine, everyone’s gonna love it."" And, you know, it just kinda set my mind at ease and I was like: Okay, let’s go out and do this.What was it like to do your sport while not wearing any clothes?It was hard -- it was really hard to be honest. We’re spinning around, we’re going through these positions and everything’s going really fast and I have bigger boobs so everything is getting kinda dragged behind and everything’s in the way. It was hard, but it was fun. It just sucked that we had to do it barefoot. They wanted it to be so authentic so my feet got torn up a lot, but it was so worth it and I’m really happy that I did it. But it’s a lot harder than you realize to throw naked. There’s a lot of moving parts. What have been some other reactions to your cover?I was surprised about how supportive everybody is. And I think I’ve only gotten about three comments and messages about how it’s not positive. Of course with everything there’s always comments about how you’re disgusting, you’re gross -- and then [the haters] just get this blowback that they’re ignorant and I can’t believe you would say this, she’s beautiful, we shouldn’t judge everybody by how they look and you’re the one that’s ugly on the inside. And it’s phenomenal. My family is calling me. I’m pretty sure my mom’s still crying about it because she’s so proud. Everybody’s been so on board with it and so supportive.What’s been your personal reaction to all of the positive press and the social media response? Did you expect an overwhelming positive response?No, absolutely not. When they asked me to be in the issue, I thought, “Okay I’ll be the one in the back by the ads and everyone will just flip through it and pay no never mind to me,” and what it has become has just been so mind-blowing. I still haven’t really fully grasped what’s happening. It’s been nonstop and so fast that I haven’t even had time to catch up. Even this morning when I actually got the physical copy of the magazine and seeing me on the cover, I took a step back and was like, “Wow this is not real life. This kind of stuff doesn’t happen to little girls from Las Vegas who were bullied.” This is just so surreal. I think it definitely gives me that sense of confidence and I’m happy and proud that I can be among the women that are getting the voice out there. And even men -- men have plenty of body issues that they have to go through and for them to see somebody who’s 215 pounds that wears a size 17 pants out there like this -- I think it’s amazing because I definitely didn’t have that when I was growing up and going through all the bullying issues that I went through.Can you speak more to the bullying when you were younger -- have people ever spoken down to you about your body?Oh yeah, even doctors. I have always been active. I grew up on a construction site, so I’ve been lifting and doing all sorts of physical activities ever since I was a little girl. I have farmer’s strength. At 13 years old, a doctor straight told me that I was morbidly obese because I didn’t fit on their BMI chart. I just remember my mom grabbing my arm and running out of the doctor’s office. I had never really known what that meant because my parents always supported me and told me that I was beautiful and to use your body for what you do and don’t try to be what other people expect you to be, so I was very sheltered.Once I got into the high school range where social media started picking up a little bit more and you see everything in the magazines and the Internet, it definitely got a little bit harder because we had all that imagery being thrown in our faces. And especially growing up in Las Vegas -- it’s the entertainment capital of the world -- and you see all the entertainers with the chiseled abs and the pasties coming in doing all their shows, so it was definitely kind of hard. But I just transferred it into my athleticism. I was like, yes I am bigger than most of these girls that I’m competing with and going to school with, but I’m also the one on the varsity teams, making it to state, doing all these great achievements in my athleticism and I think that’s really what you have to do when you’re put in that situation. Were you always athletically-inclined as a kid?I grew up in dance and gymnastics and then of course during recess we would play soccer. I was really competitive in soccer -- I was playing along with all the boys and I was the first one picked on the team because I was bigger than most of them and I wasn’t scared to get hit because I knew I could take it. I was always doing that, and then my first organized sport was volleyball. I started doing that and competing and I fell in love. Even today, I still love it. That’s what I grew up with, doing that all the way through elementary school and middle school, doing the camps in the summer and summer leagues.When I got to high school there was an incident where I hit puberty and grew up a little bit faster than most of the other girls and my coach told me that I had to lose a couple of pounds if I wanted to be on varsity. I did my best to [lose the weight] because I wanted to fit into that volleyball mold and be a volleyball player and get a scholarship for volleyball. Track and field was something I did on the side to fill up my season. And then after I lost all the weight, she told me I still wouldn’t make it on varsity unless I lost another 10 pounds. I was so over it. I was just like, go kick sticks. I can’t. I’ve done everything I could. This isn’t for me. And so that’s when I really focused on track and field and ended up doing really well my senior year and being able to go onto college doing it.When did you decide that throwing would be a cool thing to pursue?I never wanted to be a professional thrower or a professional athlete. Growing up, I’d always wanted to do cosmetology -- I just wanted to make people pretty and make them feel good about themselves, that’s all I really wanted to do with my life. And then I did track in high school, and I wasn’t very good on the U.S. scale as far as Division 1 scholarships, so I wasn’t getting any scholarship opportunities or anything. I thought, I’ll just go to cosmetology school and be done with it. And my mom told me no, I had to go to college and get onto the track team because I wasn’t exactly the outstanding citizen that I am today -- I needed some structure in my life and I needed a routine, so she persuaded me to go onto the team at UNLV and my coach just never let me leave.So now, being here and having this opportunity, I am so thankful that my mom made me go to college and made me go onto the track team and my coach making me stay on the team and not letting me quit. It’s just been so phenomenal and I couldn’t imagine doing anything differently now.You said that you wanted to make people feel pretty and feel good about themselves. Now with the Body Issue, isn't that exactly what you’re doing?Man, I never thought of it that way. Holy toledos! Oh my goodness. You’re right, I am living my own dream it’s just a different avenue.What was it like to compete in the Olympics?My first ever meet out of college was the Olympics, like the biggest stage I could ever be on, and it’s sink or swim…It was amazing, in every aspect. I wasn’t supposed to make the team at all, and then we had a great throw on that one specific day and I ended up making the team.That really was an eye-opener for me, because being at the Olympic village you see all these different athletes, just everywhere, from all the different countries in the world and you sit there and you look at them and you’re like, man, I haven’t seen that type of a body but they’re here and this is awesome and the amount of diversity there in every shape, every size, every color, everything is just so eye-opening.What’s the story behind your awesome tattoo of the Olympic rings?It’s so skewed…in America, we’re so fixated on products and winning, that when I decided I wanted to get my tattoo, I said I want it somewhere that I could show it off during my competition and when I’m practicing and in my sport, but in normal society I don’t want it to be seen at all. And I’ll tell you why -- I drew on the rings in a couple different spots to see how I’d like it and I went around town with a couple weeks to really get a feel for it. And when people would see my Olympic rings, they would sit there and be like “Oh did you go to the Olympics?” and I’m like yeah I did, getting all excited, and they’re like “Did you medal?” and I’d be like “No.” And that would be the end of the conversation. Period. And I felt like such a failure. So that’s why I got the rings there, because I don’t want to have that awkward conversation again, to be completely honest, because I want people to be excited about it. But I love my rings.We talk a lot about the way women’s bodies are scrutinized by the media. How is that different at your level of athletic competition?It’s so much different. I am tiny in the throws world. I am a midget and I am the skinny little girl that everyone’s trying to shove food in my face because I need to get fattened up. It’s such a different perspective to see. The body issue in athleticism is just so much different because as long as you’re doing well and you’re successful in what you’re doing, who cares if you’re 250 pounds or 200 pounds or 164 pounds.Are there stereotypes about women hammer throwers?In general, women’s athletics were kind of stereotyped. You had to look like a man, you couldn’t wear makeup, you had to have the short hair, you weren’t allowed to be feminine -- were really the stereotypes for women’s athletics in general. And then with throwing, because it is such a -- I wouldn’t say masculine sport -- but it is definitely a less feminine sport because it’s such a power event. And everyone that’s been good and in the media has always been the Eastern European women who don’t wear makeup, just put their hair up in a ponytail, and kinda looked like the Ms. Trunchbulls if you would, and that was the idea of what we were supposed to look like. And now everything’s just taken a turn and people are embracing their femininity in every sport, and I absolutely love it.In your own career, have you felt those types of stereotypes? I never have -- I’ve always had the shock factor. You can kinda tell that I work out a little bit. When [people] ask me “What sport do you play?” and I’m like “I play track and field,” it’s always kind of a “Oh really? What do you do in track and field?” [I say] “Oh, I’m a thrower” and [they say] “You throw? Man, throwers didn’t look like you when I was going to school.” And I’m just like, yeah we’re kind of changing. I never really experienced [the stereotypes] – I get more of a shock factor because I’m not what people would generally think of as a thrower.What’s your take on the way we talk about women’s bodies in the media?I understand the reality of it. Everybody wants it. But I think it’s so disgusting. Instead of sitting there and telling me “Hey, here’s how you can lose 10 pounds” -- I think that’s so silly -- why don’t you say, “Hey, here’s 10 ways to be more proud of yourself, here’s 10 ways to look at yourself differently.” What do you know now about your body or the way you perceive your body that you wish your 18-year-old self knew?Oh man, get over it. Everybody loves some cushion -- I learned that real quick. Growing up I always thought the only people that get the attention and get the boys are the skinny little models that have that perfect butt, no cellulite, no stretch marks. And now I’m getting to that point where it’s just like no, there are other people that love them some big girls. And I think if I would’ve known that back then, my life living in Las Vegas and going to college in Las Vegas and trying to get a job would’ve been so much easier. I would’ve been like man, screw them, I love myself. Other people love me. So who cares? Gosh, my life would’ve been so much easier.Do you have any advice for women, of all shapes and sizes, who struggle with their body image?You just have to find something that makes you feel good. Whether you’re male or female or anything -- there are plenty of men that have body issues -- you just have to find something that makes you feel good and fit into your own world. There are so many different worlds and societies out there that support big girls and things that we can do. You just have to go find it. They’re not gonna shove it in our face. And if I can help out in any kind of way, don’t hesitate to message me and we can get through this together.This interview has been edited and condensed."

It may even be the hero. It's certainly, at the very least, the love interest. Though the book was written in English, the language to which I'm referring is Sanskrit. Taseer has studied the language for ""seven or eight years,"" he told me last week, when we sat down in a remarkably noisy Manhattan Teavana to talk about his latest book. ""It was not research for the book,"" he hastened to point out. ""It was like… the other way around."" Reading the novel, it would be difficult to draw any other conclusion. The book follows Skanda, a student of Sanskrit, in the year after his father's death. As his mother, Uma, and his father, Toby, the Maharaja of Kalasuryaketu, have been long divorced after a passionate but brief marriage, Skanda must return to India to take care of the funeral arrangements. Toby, a renowned Sanskritist, imbued Skanda with his all-consuming love for the language, a romance that became the central one of Toby's life.Taseer conveys this passion for the language without any sense of stilted, academic remove. The reader is frequently plunged into sidebars and dialogues that tenderly unwrap the layers of linguistic complexity hidden within a Sanskrit phrase, or the long line of cognates to which a Sanskrit word can claim relation. This taste of the wonders of what has been called the most perfect language doesn't exist in an ivory tower, however. As he continues his Sanskrit studies, Skanda must reckon with India's recent troubled history, his own parent's fractious marriage and the unacknowledged effects on his own childhood, and the inextricable complicity of the language he loves.We talked more about the power of language, the complexities of Indian politics, and his own writing process:The title of the book, The Way Things Were, it comes out at a certain point, derived from the Sanskrit word for history, a compound meaning “The Way indeed that Things Were.” What kind of history did you want to document in the book?I think what I was interested in was the weight of the past on different characters. Even the structure for me was very important. I needed this surface narrative in the present, which was very still, and then you could feel a flood of events coming up from below. So it was more in the way almost as a mechanism that I was interested in history, and so that’s why the title came as a kind of gift, because it covers talk, legend, history, everything -- it’s a very old word for history.In some ways I’m dealing with those places where there’s a kind of intractable history. It’s something that I find Americans understand very little. Because even sometimes you feel, with wars that have been fought, people find themselves in situations where they can’t understand why, if certain situations were to change, these people couldn’t just get along. And actually the old world is full of intractable history.It’s funny because more and more we’re seeing that even our own North and South can’t really get along all that well.Yeah.And that’s such recent history.Actually it’s funny you say that because the South is one of the few places where I feel, in America, the evidence of intractable history. And it’s there in Faulkner, you know. You can feel when you’re reading Faulkner that these people, just out of mad irrationality, are not going to give ground. I was going to ask about the weight of history, and how much it seemed to be hanging on Skanda and Uma and Toby throughout the book, and how Uma tries to just free herself from it. Even Skanda seems to feel, now that his father is gone, that he can just look to the future. Is it possible to escape history, or is it even desirable to do so?I think if you face it, squarely, it is possible to free yourself from it. I think that’s the whole exercise, the whole paralysis that we find Skanda in, is as a consequence of his never having faced the past, of it having lived in him, and of it having caused a kind of pain, but never having been addressed. This process that we’re going through in the book, where on one hand you have the narrative unfolding and on the other you have this kind of waiting or purgatory that Skanda’s in, is, in a sense, a kind of facing up to the past. Uma’s approach is like a more violent approach. It’s the approach of clean breaks. I think that if you do it in that way, probably, you pay a price. Probably on the level of your humanity, on the level of your sensitivity.And you can feel that actually with certain societies as well where there hasn’t been that reckoning with the past, and it keeps coming up, it keeps surfacing in certain forms.You wrote an article about English and how it’s destroyed Indian literature. How do you think India’s forced adoption of English has affected its perception of its own history?Generally history in India is a very tricky business. Sanskrit literature... there are plays, there are a number of different literary forms. The one thing that there’s no literary equivalent of is, like, the Chinese Annals or the Arab Histories or Tacitus or Herodotus. There’s no history writing tradition. So in some ways, India has always, for its history, looked to the accounts of foreigners.Language has obviously made it difficult, because five percent, I think, of India speaks English. So imagine, if you met an Indian who speaks English, you’re speaking already to a tiny, tiny superclass. It’s complicated because it’s a country where everyone speaks very different languages, so there has to be a unifying language, but English is also invested with power.And you write in English, so is that a choice that you made, or do you feel like there isn’t really a choice?Yeah, it was a choice that was forced on me. Actually, my grandfather was an Urdu poet, and there was a little period where all the different languages of India were going through a period where it seemed like they were flourishing. There might have been a subsequent generation of a substantial reading class built up in these languages. But almost at that exact moment, all of the people of that generation sent their children to public schools and convents, and they all received a kind of English education which was the detriment of any Indian language, so… by the time you come around to my generation, a clean break has occurred. So the only way for a writer -- it’s not even a question of money -- the only way to be writing to an audience that’s actually listening, a reading public, you have to write in English. I think of myself as almost no less than Ibsen or Joyce, writing into a tradition of exile, of cobbling together an audience in places like America, England, South Africa, Australia, India. I don’t think I can rely on any one country as a place I can write into. Do you think there’s a way for India, at this point to develop a modern literature in those Indian languages?I think the movement now is all in one way. It’s an impossible stream to channel. Never mind the power of America, which would influence the position of English in the world, but even at times when political power has broken, the language has continued to move. In India, the movement is all towards English, and unfortunately towards a very dead, not a very vibrant language. There’s a moment in the book where Toby predicts at the time [when] a place’s linguistic needs would be the most -- it really needs to express itself -- the means are totally inadequate. It finds a borrowed English or a language of clichés, a language that doesn’t have that deep tissue of familiarity. And there’s a lot of other writing coming out that has that quality. There isn’t that deep sense of fluency, but it’s the only language in some ways as well.We see the possibility of linguistic redemption in the book through Toby and it fails. He feels he’s placed his hopes in a class of people who are unable to replicate his ideals. I wondered if, in the end, there’s an idealism we place in language that can’t be borne through.Toby’s not a man of revivalism. Right now in India there’s a whole politics of trying to revive Sanskrit. There’s a lot of revivalism the way Erdogan is trying to do with Ottoman Turkish. It’s not an intellectual endeavor. They’re trying to advance a certain kind of politics, a sort of nationalistic politics, using the symbols of the past. Which is in some ways a danger that this book is very alive to, in the character of someone like Maniraja. But Toby’s dream was founded in the intellect and the idea that basically the genius of a people, a language… some grain of it would come into the future and fertilize the present, and would be something more along the lines of a profound rebirth or an awakening. That never happens.Every time someone in some way becomes a victim of the violence of this place, you see Toby is almost blinded by his naiveté. It’s a very attractive vision, but he doesn’t see the place he’s living in. He doesn’t see it clearly.The idea of Sanskrit as a language of India is punctured at a certain point when Uma tells Maniraja that people never spoke Sanskrit, it was just a language of the super-elite. But Toby also has this sense that Sanskrit was this language of the people, if not in such a commonplace sense. So is it an illusion, in a broader sense, that there’s a true Indianness to Sanskrit that extends to the whole of the people? Sanskrit has a very interesting role in that respect because it was always a high language, and it became the origin of almost all of India’s languages, like Latin was in Europe. In some ways there’s never been a more formal language. So there’s a lot about the classical world that was not fair or just, but that was still marvelous, that was full of many things to inspire the intellect and to create a feeling of wonder, and Toby was very much lost in that sense of it. He doesn’t have a program. Whereas Maniraja is not interested in the past for the sake of the past. The past has to serve a program. It has to be in the employ of the present.I wanted to talk about the “drawing-room class” [the educated upper-class], where the novel is mostly set. A lot of them have ideals for India, but they’re not in dialogue with the majority of the country. Is that an inherent problem in terms of achieving or realizing those ideals?Yeah, I feel like the class has grown more and more isolated.Sometimes it feels like people accuse blue America of having no awareness of red America, but blue America is a substantial thing in its own right! The two sides are somewhat evenly matched. In India we’re looking at this tiny population dreaming in the cities or dreaming in one part of the city, and this swell of people on the other side who are completely going in another direction. The election, from an American perspective, created a lot of dismay. There was a lot of suspicion about Narendra Modi as a figure, a lot of controversy. You wrote a little bit, in this article, about some possible false optimism about the election and how much he’d be able to change. What do you think about him as a figure and what he represents?Because I covered that election, I’d like to make a separation. It was a very hopeful election, and it’s odd when you’re covering an election not to capture its mood, which was a mood of hopefulness. And [people] invested this man with their hope. On that side of it, it’s very moving when that happens, and just as you think of the Obama election, you can’t be blind to the fact that you’re traveling in that environment.I have to say that Modi himself has come to seem to me like an increasingly buffoonish figure. I feel like he’s kind of channeled quite an ugly homogenizing spirit. There’s a sort of majoritarianism, even from little things, like these yoga days to beef bans to the ugliest rhetoric that’s come out of his ministers.I had reservations about it then, in fact a lot of my dispatches from that time are full of reservations, but it’s been, even by those standards... he’s been kind of a disappointing figure. And the book kind of anticipates that. I feel like there’s that kind of man who comes out in Maniraja is, in a sense, the man of the future, and there’s no hiding the disappointment I feel related to the advent of that kind of personality.The idea of linguistic unity is really important throughout -- cognates, for example, they signify global unity. But it seems like a lot of the time, language is more divisive than not, both personally and being used as a symbol of something politically divisive. Is this more of a failure of language itself, or of us?Well, of us. We invest it with all kinds of -- you’ve seen, obviously, the way that language can be invested with politics. And it’s exactly as you said. There’s on one hand the kind of tragedy that when you probe it, it’s full of an underlying unity. And yet, in so many ways and forms, they’re like, ""Ah, this person doesn’t speak English, he’s obviously of a lower class."" It’s weaponized. And this is very true of India. Because of the partition, language became co-opted by religion.I, for instance, because my father’s Pakistani, if I used a certain word for a certain thing, people have immediately understood a whole set of things about me. I remember at one point, when I first went to see my father in Pakistan and I crossed over the border, they were like, “Why are you coming?” And the language is interchangeable between Indian and Pakistan. So I said, “I’m coming for my sister’s birthday.” But I used a word for birthday that only an Indian could have used. And they knew. So there was this hushed silence. And then a man, from behind the room, used the Urdu word -- both words were understood, but he was basically like, “You’re not a Pakistani, because you used that word.”I know your family in Pakistan has been really deeply affected by the religious conflicts there, and in Noon, you graphically get into the riots and violence. In The Way Things Were, the violence is in the background, and muted, but we’re looking at the roots of where this kind of violence comes from. Was it revealing for you to look at this kind of violence from behind the scenes, in a way?I wrote Noon before my father was killed. And he was killed in that way, and my brother was kidnapped, and there was a year of all sorts of that violence. Too much to get into. But I think I felt, in myself, a kind of passivity that had come over me. And so Skanda’s passivity is very much, I think, part of the kind of mood I was writing out of. And I suppose I was done with that kind of violence. This book was the first book that I wrote after that had happened, and I was very withdrawn, and perhaps some of that has become part of the fiction.Are you working on anything right now?A book of nonfiction.What’s it about?It’s… I don’t want to say yet! It’s given me a lot of joy though, because I started life as a journalist, and it’s really nice to be out in the world again and to have real material in the world, and not just to be spinning your guts at home like with novels.Do you prefer writing nonfiction generally?No, I mean -- if a novel, especially like this one, takes hold of you, there’s nothing more perfect, in my opinion. I don’t think I’ve ever been happier than those two years that I was writing this. It really kind of seized me. But it’s very tiring and it’s very nice not to force fiction. If it comes in that way, then one submits to it, but with nonfiction, you’re not stewing in it.This interview has been edited and condensed. Correction: A previous version of this article contained an error in one instance of the title of The Way Things Were. The post has been updated to correct this."

Here are some of the results of their polls about families and devices like smartphones:The survey results showed that 54 percent of kids think their parents check their devices too often and 32 percent of them ""feel unimportant"" when their parents are distracted by their phones.As for the parents, 52 percent agreed that they check their phones too often.

Catholic gays have contested the Church's ban on homosexual activity, saying it deprives them of the intimacy that is part of a loving relationship.Saturday was believed to be the first time a gay rights activist was known to have been invited to attend an event during a papal trip. One theme of a major meeting of Catholic bishops at the Vatican in October will be how the Church can reach out to homosexual Catholics.On his way to the gathering, the pope made an unscheduled stop at a hospice for the terminally ill run by Italian priest Aldo Trento.

But say the words ""adult summer reading program"" and you've got our attention.  Enter Book Bingo and we're hooked.   This summer, Seattle Public Library and Seattle Arts & Lectures brought grown-up readers across the city a summer reading program just for us -- and we're absolutely loving it. In Summer Book Bingo, each square on the bingo card is a challenge -- read a book by a local author, read a book translated from another language, read a book set somewhere you've always wanted to go, and so on. Get five in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally and you've got ""bingo"" (and a chance to win prizes).  But the best part? It's not the prizes. The absolute best part is that people around the city are talking about what they're reading. We're hearing about it in our libraries, seeing people share what they're reading for each square on Twitter and Instagram (#BookBingoNW), and listening in while readers offer each other suggestions to get to bingo.  Last summer, my favorite podcast, ""Books on the Nightstand,"" did a fabulous job starting conversations -- and keeping them going -- through its version of Book Bingo. Podcast hosts Ann Kingman and Michael Kindness offered suggestions each week on the podcast, and readers shared its suggestions, too. Its Goodreads group is impressive with 5,000 members; its discussions are topical and there are already more than 50 book bingo categories being discussed. People love to talk about what they're reading and people love to read about what to read next.  Anyone can play along with ""Books on the Nightstand"" and players get different cards. You can get a randomized line up of reading challenges by printing from here (refresh before printing). I'm sure the intent is to take whichever card you're handed, but I'll admit to hitting refresh three times before printing. Sorry, I just really couldn't face a book with footnotes, after not finishing David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest two summers in a row; my next card had ""read a biography of someone you dislike"" AND ""read a book you think you'll dislike."" Too much disliking for my summer reading ... but a simple ""refresh"" and I've got a card that challenges, but isn't a turn off.  Even if you don't play the ""BOTNS"" version of Book Bingo, its podcasts, shownotes, and discussion boards are excellent places to get ideas for what to read next.  Seattle's Book Bingo version (which has also made it to France and Médiathèque Languidic, a library in Languidic, for Biblio Bingo) has just one card. The categories are open-ended enough that it doesn't seem to matter if you read fiction or nonfiction. And the good thing about one standardized card is that it brings some structure and commonalities to reading discussions around the city. You can walk into any library or independent book store and pick up a bingo card, talk to librarians and booksellers about what to read, maybe even talk with other customers or library patrons. There really is potential for three months of people talking about what they're reading.  I find this city-wide focus on reading -- and talking about books -- extremely satisfying. Reading is, of course, solitary, yet so many of us are looking for a community of readers. We can read alone, together. We can talk about what we're reading when we feel like it, if we feel like it. We can feel the satisfaction of finishing a good book and writing the title in a bingo square.  Right now my Book Bingo card is on my refrigerator. This is one summer reading program piece I plan to keep, long after summer ends."

People love to talk about what they're reading and people love to read about what to read next.  Anyone can play along with ""Books on the Nightstand"" and players get different cards. You can get a randomized line up of reading challenges by printing from here (refresh before printing). I'm sure the intent is to take whichever card you're handed, but I'll admit to hitting refresh three times before printing. Sorry, I just really couldn't face a book with footnotes, after not finishing David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest two summers in a row; my next card had ""read a biography of someone you dislike"" AND ""read a book you think you'll dislike."" Too much disliking for my summer reading ... but a simple ""refresh"" and I've got a card that challenges, but isn't a turn off.  Even if you don't play the ""BOTNS"" version of Book Bingo, its podcasts, shownotes, and discussion boards are excellent places to get ideas for what to read next.  Seattle's Book Bingo version (which has also made it to France and Médiathèque Languidic, a library in Languidic, for Biblio Bingo) has just one card. The categories are open-ended enough that it doesn't seem to matter if you read fiction or nonfiction. And the good thing about one standardized card is that it brings some structure and commonalities to reading discussions around the city. You can walk into any library or independent book store and pick up a bingo card, talk to librarians and booksellers about what to read, maybe even talk with other customers or library patrons. There really is potential for three months of people talking about what they're reading.  I find this city-wide focus on reading -- and talking about books -- extremely satisfying. Reading is, of course, solitary, yet so many of us are looking for a community of readers. We can read alone, together. We can talk about what we're reading when we feel like it, if we feel like it. We can feel the satisfaction of finishing a good book and writing the title in a bingo square.  Right now my Book Bingo card is on my refrigerator. This is one summer reading program piece I plan to keep, long after summer ends."

The attack would presumably be against a ""tourist target"" for maximum effect and would be organized and staged from Libya. Although Interpol did not specifically cite cruise ships as the intended target, such ships would be an obvious choice. The warning came after a succession of Islamic State inspired attacks against popular tourist destinations along the North African shore.The Islamic State has been calling on its supporters to attack popular Mediterranean tourist sites since at least 2014. On March 18, 2015, three IS affiliated militants attacked the Bardo National Museum in Tunis. Twenty-one people, mostly European tourists from two recently arrived cruise ships, were killed during the attack and one more victim died 10 days later from injuries suffered during the incident. An additional 50 people, also mostly tourists, were injured.  Bardo Museum, TunisThree months later, on June 26, a second attack at a beach resort in Port El Kantaoui near Sousse resulted in the deaths of 38 foreign tourists, most of them British. A lone gunman, identified as 23-year-old Seifeddine Rezgui, armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, opened fire on the beach in an attack that lasted for approximately 40 minutes. The attack prompted both the British and Danish governments to urge their citizens to return home and brought a wave of cancellations by prospective visitors.Tunisian president Beji Caid Essebsi declared a state of emergency, fired dozens of Tunisian government employees, including the governor of Sousse, for an inadequate response and deployed hundreds of police officers to guard popular tourist sites. The tourism sector employs some 400,000 Tunisians and is responsible for seven percent of Tunisia's GDP. The economic impact of the two terrorist attacks on Tunisia's tourist industry is estimated to be half a billion dollars.In the meantime, in Egypt, on June 10, an Islamic State inspired suicide bomber and two other militants attempted to stage an attack against tourists outside the Temple of Karnak near Luxor. The Egyptian tourist industry had been free of any such attacks since an incident in November 1997 when jihadist gunmen opened fire on tourists at Luxor's 3,400-year-old Hatshepsut Temple killing 58 tourists.  Temple of Karnak, Luxor EgyptIn the Karnak incident, Egyptian police opened fire on the militants when two of them pulled out their weapons, killing one and injuring another. The suicide bomber detonated his bomb and was killed. There were no other fatalities. Islamic State did not take credit for the Luxor attack, although the militants claimed they were responding to Islamic State's calls to attack tourist locations. The attack capped a series of low level attacks against security officials at popular tourist sites that have been going on for the last several months. Tourism is absolutely vital to the Egyptian economy. At its peak in 2011, the industry provided 1 in 12 jobs in Egypt, generated revenues of 12.5 billion dollars and represented 11 percent of GDP and 14.4 percent of foreign currency revenues. Since 2010, tourism in Egypt has dropped by around 30 percent. In the meantime, in the Sinai, the Islamic State affiliated Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Partners of Jerusalem) have been conducting a fierce insurgency against the Egyptian military in North Sinai. They have now threatened to begin attacking the popular tourist resorts along the Red Sea in the south. To date attacks against tourists have occurred along the North African side of the Mediterranean. The fear is that such attacks may spillover to the European side of the Mediterranean as well. Beaches and ports are singularly vulnerable to attack. Both are open to the sea, are prone to smuggling, and are difficult to secure. Beaches, moreover, offer little cover to tourists from attackers. Tunisia's response notwithstanding, most Mediterranean tourist venues have minimal security.According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, collectively, the Mediterranean tourist industry directly generates around 380 billion dollars in revenues and employs about eight million people. An additional 12 million people are employed indirectly by tourist dependent industries. In total, tourism related or dependent spending in the Mediterranean region is approaching one trillion dollars in turnover. In 2014, approximately 300 million tourists visited the Mediterranean region. 80% of those visitors were from Europe; approximately 10 percent were from North America and the balance from elsewhere in the world.  Sousse BeachfrontIn addition to being a vital source of foreign exchange and income, Mediterranean tourism provides millions of low skilled jobs. Such jobs have often been an entry way for economic advancement. If these jobs are lost, they will be difficult to replace in other economic sectors. Given its size and diversity, Mediterranean tourism will prove to be a resilient industry. The combination of history, culture and ""fun in the sun,"" combined with its proximity to Europe's tourists, will make it a popular tourist destination regardless of what terrorist attacks occur.Islamic State and other jihadist groups simply don't have the wherewithal to attack the industry on a Mediterranean wide basis. For the most part tourists will opt to avoid high risk areas in favor of lower risk countries or venues. Targeted attacks against popular tourist destinations in North Africa as well as against beaches, ports and possibly cruise ships in the Mediterranean region, however, can prove extremely disruptive and will cause significant dislocations within the tourist industry.  Rimini Beachfront, ItalyFor the most part, few tourists will be exposed to any significant danger or threat of attack. The remote danger of being the victim of a terrorist attack is not a reason to forego Mediterranean travel. It is, though, a reason to exercise caution and to be ""situationally aware"" of one's surroundings when in the region.Continued random acts of terrorist violence, however, will create a climate of fear that will impact both the overall size of the industry and travel patterns and on a local basis will result in significant economic hardships. Like ripples in a pond, Islamic State inspired violence will continue to wash ashore across the length of the Mediterranean Sea."
