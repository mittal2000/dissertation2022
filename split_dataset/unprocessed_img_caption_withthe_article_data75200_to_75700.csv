The companies are also putting forward their own individual climate commitments, which include reducing emissions from operations and increasing their use of renewable energy.""We recognize that delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms, while accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy will produce multiple benefits with regard to sustainable economic growth, public health, resilience to natural disasters, and the health of the global environment,"" states the pledge.The effort is part of the Obama administration's buildup to the United Nations climate negotiations at the end of this year, when world leaders hope to reach an international agreement on curbing planet-warming emissions. Negotiators are meeting in Germany this week to finalize a draft of the agreement ahead of the big meeting in Paris. The pledges ""demonstrate that the American private sector is stepping up,"" said Brian Deese, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, in a call with reporters Monday morning. ""In both the United States and in countries across the world, the support and the backing of the business community is an important ingredient to getting to ambitious but also sustainable climate action.""""Making sure those voices are prominent as we move into the final stage of international talks is absolutely essential,"" said Deese. ""At the end of the day, we need to demonstrate we can act on the climate effects we face, that we can reduce emissions.""Joining Deese on the call was Todd Brady, global environmental director of Intel. ""We believe that global climate change is a serious environmental and social challenge,"" said Brady, who added that the situation demands an ""equally serious response from both the public and private sector.""Obama is also hosting a roundtable with the CEOs of some of the signatory corporations at the White House Monday.

1,COLLEGE,National Fraternity Group Deletes Webpage To Help Promote Campus Rape Bill,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fraternities-delete-webpage-safe-campus-act_us_561ecdb6e4b0c5a1ce61efae,The organization used statements from groups that do not support the legislation to argue in favor of it.,2015-10-19,Sigma Nu is one of the fraternities supporting a lobbying effort to enact new rules on colleges investigating sexual assault reports.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/562524111400006f003c88b0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The North-American Interfraternity Conference has deleted a page on its website that attempted to promote federal legislation addressing campus rape by using statements from higher education groups that don't endorse a bill.Under the Safe Campus Act, college students who are sexually assaulted would be forced to report their assaults to police in order for colleges to take any action on their cases. No other illegal behavior would face this same requirement. The NIC, which represents 74 men's fraternities, has been engaged this year in lobbying for new rules on college investigations into cases of sexual assault involving students. The organization added several webpages on July 29 -- the day the Safe Campus Act was introduced in the House of Representatives -- including one intended to bolster public support for the bill.That webpage used several statements from the American Council on Education, a top higher education group representing college presidents, criticizing regulations around campus rape. The NIC also cited a statement from the Association for Student Conduct Administration in which the group said it supports a college following a law enforcement request to wait on conducting a campus investigation if it would jeopardize a criminal inquiry. But that page -- including the cached version -- has been taken down. An embedded version is below. The link now leads to an index page, with a ""404"" in the title of the webpage. An embedded version is below.The NIC did not return request for comment. When the Safe Campus Act was introduced, both the ASCA and ACE quickly distanced themselves from it. Suggesting that the bill addressed issues raised by ACE ""is simply speculation,"" the group said in July. An ACE spokeswoman said last week that the organization has not taken a position on the Safe Campus Act, and doesn't intend to. She added on Monday that the organization did not ask the NIC to remove the website, and added ACE has ""never had any conversations with them on any subject.""ASCA opposes the bill. Requiring sexual assault reports to go to police before further action can be taken on campus would ""create a chilling effect for our complainants"" and lead to a ""significant decrease in reporting"" of campus rape cases, said Jason A. Casares, the organization's president-elect.The NIC webpage also used comments from Foundation of Individual Rights in Education, a civil liberties group, and the American Council of Trustees and Alumni. Both organizations were cited as saying they favor pushing more sexual assault cases into the hands of police.FIRE has supported the Safe Campus Act from the beginning, but it recommends changing the bill's language to allow colleges to issue nonpunitive accommodations even if an assault isn't reported to police. Essentially, FIRE proposes letting schools move class schedules and housing for alleged victims -- but not conduct a hearing and potentially punish a student accused of assault unless law enforcement is looped in. ACTA has not explicitly endorsed the Safe Campus Act, but said in a statement it favors involving law enforcement in all cases.""ACTA believes that sexual assault wherever and whenever it occurs requires serious legal response,"" the group said. ""The Safe Campus Act is helping to draw attention within the legislative discussion to the essential role of the criminal justice system and the crucial need for due-process rights.""The National District Attorneys Association, which was not mentioned on the NIC's website, also supports the bill, although many advocacy and activist groups working with rape victims are in strong opposition to it. ______Tyler Kingkade covers higher education and sexual violence, and is based in New York.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) thinks it might be a good idea to drug test public housing residents -- and he's crediting school children for inspiring him.""Our moms and daddies don’t use that money for us,"" Manchin said a group of middle school students told him, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported Monday.Manchin said he told the students their idea made sense, but where would the children go if their parents tested positive for drugs? He got a sad answer.""Foster care is the only thing that can save me. My mom is still a drug addict from Beckley,'"" Manchin said one child told him.Manchin's office declined to elaborate on the idea. A spokesman declined to clarify when the conversation happened, but said the senator speaks to a lot of kids in southwestern West Virginia, where drug abuse is rampant.Unlike with some other safety net programs, federal law doesn't explicitly allow or forbid local housing agencies drug testing tenants, according to the Congressional Research Service. A handful of housing agencies around the country have required tenants to undergo urine tests to prove they're not on drugs. Civil liberties advocates say blanket drug testing policies can violate the Constitution's protections against unreasonable search by the government: The American Civil Liberties Union sued over the Chicago Housing Authority's drug test requirement in 2013. Manchin suggested treatment, not loss of benefits, would be the goal. ""You can’t do any of this until you have adequate treatment centers,"" he said Monday, according to the Gazette-Mail. Most of the welfare drug-testing schemes proposed over the past few years have required treatment for users rather than simply ending their benefits.Manchin criticized the War on Drugs for emphasizing incarceration over treatment, and also pointed a finger at pharmaceutical companies for flooding the market with painkillers.

Reilly and Mariah Stewart,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ferguson-municipal-court-federal-civil-rights-lawsuit_us_562542a7e4b0bce34701a232,Ferguson is negotiating over a federal rights lawsuit on their court practices.,2015-10-19,"The city of Ferguson, Missouri, may settle a federal civil rights lawsuit, which takes aim at the municipal court system.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5625433d1400002b003c88f8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Lawyers representing the city of Ferguson, Missouri, are considering settling a federal civil rights lawsuit alleging widespread constitutional abuses in its municipal court system, which -- along with the other municipal courts in St. Louis County -- came under heavy scrutiny following the death of Michael Brown in August 2014.A filing on Monday indicated that lawyers representing Ferguson and the civil rights attorneys representing poor defendants held in Ferguson's jail had ""been engaged in meaningful settlement discussions"" over the case. The lawsuit was filed by ArchCity Defenders, as well as nonprofit Equal Justice Under Law and the Saint Louis University School of Law, on behalf of 11 poor individuals who had been held in Ferguson's jail.A lawyer for ArchCity Defenders, a local organization, which has been heavily critical of the practices of municipal courts in St. Louis County, asked a federal judge to extend the deadline to argue for making it a class action. Lawyers for both sides did not immediately respond to request for comment.Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis, operated a municipal court that regularly violated the rights of black citizens to fill the city's coffers, according to the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division. The report, released earlier this year, said that many officers and officials “appear to see some residents, especially those who live in Ferguson’s predominately African-American neighborhoods, less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue.""The report found that the city, police and court officials have “worked in concert to maximize revenue at every stage of the enforcement process” for several years, and that black citizens were disproportionately ticketed.In August, the Ferguson City Council appeared to reject the DOJ's first proposal to change and reform Ferguson's practices.Monday's filing was the first indication that the city of Ferguson had entered into negotiations over the lawsuit, which is separate from the justice department probe. The lawsuit at issue alleged it was the practice of the city to ""confine impoverished people who cannot afford their release in grotesque, dangerous, and inhumane conditions.""The lawsuit filed in February said that impoverished people arrested in Ferguson are:kept in overcrowded cells; they are denied toothbrushes, toothpaste, and soap; they are subjected to the constant stench of excrement and refuse in their congested cells; they are surrounded by walls smeared with mucus and blood; they are kept in the same clothes for days and weeks without access to laundry or clean underwear; they step on top of other inmates, whose bodies cover nearly the entire uncleaned cell floor, in order to access a single shared toilet that the City does not clean; they develop untreated illnesses and infections in open wounds that spread to other inmates; they endure days and weeks without being allowed to use the moldy shower; their filthy bodies huddle in cold temperatures with a single thin blanket even as they beg guards for warm blankets; they are not given adequate hygiene products for menstruation; they are routinely denied vital medical care and prescription medication, even when their families beg to be allowed to bring medication to the jail; they are provided food so insufficient and lacking in nutrition that inmates lose significant amounts of weight; they suffer from dehydration out of fear of drinking foul smelling water that comes from an apparatus on top of the toilet; and they must listen to the screams of other inmates languishing from unattended medical issues as they sit in their cells without access to books, legal materials, television, or natural light.The city of Jennings, which is near Ferguson, has already agreed to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit that was filed at the same time the lawsuit against Ferguson was filed. Another nearby town, the tiny municipality of Velda City, agreed to end its cash-only fixed bail system that kept the poor imprisoned over low-level charges. Yet another town in St. Louis County, St. Ann, is also under a federal court order to release those they arrest as soon as practicable after booking unless they appear before a judge within 24 hours.UPDATE: 10 p.m. -- Thomas Harvey, of ArchCity Defenders, said in an email that his organization is working on details of the settlement with Ferguson and that both sides had agreed to ask for a deadline extension. He added that there was nothing to report publicly at this time. Ryan J. Reilly reported from Washington, Mariah Stewart reported from St. Louis.Also On HuffPost:"

Jeb Bush (R) has been going all out to defend his brother's national security record in recent days, responding to Donald Trump's assertions that former President George W. Bush should assume more responsibility for the 9/11 terrorist attacks that took place during his term.Jeb Bush has insisted that his brother bears no blame for 9/11; it's how he reacted that matters. At the same time, however, Republicans continue to blame Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, which occurred while she was secretary of state. CNN ""State of the Union"" host Jake Tapper pressed the presidential candidate on this contradiction on Sunday, asking him, ""[If] your brother and his administration bear no responsibility at all, how do you then make the jump that President Obama and Secretary Clinton are responsible for what happened at Benghazi?""Bush replied that the State Department had a duty to ensure that there was proper security at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi.""There were calls for security. It looks like they didn't get it,"" Bush said. ""And how was the response in the aftermath of the attack? Was there a chance that these four American lives could have been saved? That's what the investigation is about. It's not a political issue.""There have already been seven investigations of the 2012 attack in Libya, aside from an ongoing inquiry by the House Select Committee on Benghazi. They all found that no one in the government was at fault for gross negligence, although the Obama administration's response could have been improved. Trump has repeatedly said that he doesn't blame George W. Bush for 9/11. Yet at the same time, he argues, it's dishonest for the former president's backers to say he ""kept us safe,"" but only look at his record after the disastrous attacks. Jeb Bush has pushed back against that criticism. ""Mr. Trump is probably going to say that FDR was around when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor,"" he said Sunday on CNN. ""Does anybody actually blame my brother for the attacks on 9/11? If they do, they're totally marginalized in our society.""But, as Peter Beinart wrote in The Atlantic, ""There’s no way of knowing for sure if Bush could have stopped the September 11 attacks. But that’s not the right question. The right question is: Did Bush do everything he could reasonably have to stop them, given what he knew at the time? And he didn’t. It’s not even close.""Early in the George W. Bush administration, intelligence officials warned top aides that about the threat of al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, but they felt like they weren't being listened to. According to Richard Clarke, the National Security Council's counterterrorism coordinator, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said he didn't understand why officials were focusing so much on bin Laden, since ""Iraqi terrorism"" posed just as much of a threat. Former White House National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice testified in 2004 that Bush understood the threat of al Qaeda, but he ""did not want to respond to [al Qaeda] one attack at a time.""""He told me he was 'tired of swatting flies,'"" Rice said at the time. And on Aug. 6, 2001, Bush received the now-infamous document from intelligence officials entitled ""Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S."" Trump continued to go after the former president on Monday, pointing to articles that questioned his record.George W. Bush continues to be incredibly popular among Republicans, with 85 percent saying he kept the U.S. safe during his presidency, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll.And Jeb Bush has been doubling down on defending that legacy, fundraising off his feud with Trump. On Monday, the presidential hopeful announced that he will be holding a fundraiser with his brother and parents in Houston. This story has been updated to include a 2004 quote from Condoleezza Rice."

On Oct. 14, the former congresswoman hosted a ""Domestic Violence Awareness Summit"" in Washington, D.C. The day-long event was part of her recent initiative to fight gun violence against women and families called ""The Women’s Coalition for Common Sense.""During the summit, Giffords explained why gun control is most definitely a women's issue. “We have a problem in our country. Too many women are dying from gun violence,"" Giffords said in her speech in the video above. ""Guns and domestic violence are a deadly mix.""As a survivor of a 2011 shooting in Tucson, Arizona, Gabby Giffords knows all too well the horrifying consequences of gun violence.“We don’t agree about everything, but we can agree on this: Dangerous people with guns are a threat to women. Criminals with guns. Abusers with guns. Stalkers with guns. That makes gun violence a women’s issue. For mothers, for families, for me and you,"" Giffords said. As she has reiterated time and time again, over the past year and a half, guns need to be kept out of the hands of domestic abusers. According to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, American women are around 11 times more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed countries. Other statistics from the NDVH show that when a gun is present in a situation of domestic violence, the chances of a woman being murdered increases by 500 percent.  Also on HuffPost:"

James Clyburn, right, has suggested Vice President Joe Biden not run for president.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56254a881400006f003c8914.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A key House Democrat suggested Monday that Vice President Joe Biden can’t win the Democratic nomination on his own and should not enter the contest.Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) told The Huffington Post that Biden should instead say he is “available” to head the 2016 ticket if circumstances warrant it -- that is, if Hillary Clinton implodes. “If I were advising him, I would not advise him to get in,” said Clyburn, 75, a top member of the House leadership and an influential figure in the Congressional Black Caucus. “In my opinion, he would not do himself any favors by getting in.”Clyburn has not yet endorsed a candidate for the Democratic nomination. At this juncture, he said, Clinton’s candidacy offers his party’s best chance to hold the White House in 2016.But besides facing a challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Clinton faces two more immediate hurdles, Clyburn noted.One is the House committee investigating the Benghazi incident (the panel is headed by Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina); the other an FBI investigation into her email practices.“Unless Trey has a smoking gun, I think the hearing Thursday is going to be ho-hum,” Clyburn predicted. The FBI is less predictable.The point, Clyburn said, is that Biden’s destiny is no longer up to Biden.“I don’t see a path for him that he can create,” Clyburn said in an interview in his district office. “There is only a path that could be created for him. All the impediments -- all the obstacles -- would have to be removed by somebody else.”If Biden is really serious about running in the Democrats' 2016 nomination race, he’d need Clyburn’s support -- or at least encouragement.In South Carolina, where the support of black voters is the key to winning the Democratic nomination, Clyburn is the man to see.The black vote would be especially crucial for a potential Biden run in 2016. As his aides have loyally spun, Biden would not expect to “break out” in Iowa or New Hampshire, but rather gain momentum in South Carolina with his appealing personality, liberal values and his role as the right-hand man of the first black president.And there is, in theory, room to run that way. Obama beat Hillary Clinton in South Carolina during the 2008 primary. Bill Clinton angered many voters by dismissively comparing Obama’s victory to similar ones by Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988.Biden spoke to Clyburn recently at the CBC’s annual prayer breakfast. But while Biden stayed for the whole event and glad-handed in candidate fashion, the vice president has never contacted Clyburn to discuss a possible campaign and didn’t attend the main CBC gala that same weekend.The two men haven’t spoken one word about a campaign, Clyburn said.“We haven’t talked about it at all,” said Clyburn. “Nobody believes me, but it’s true.”"

""Apple knew that - they wanted it, and they went and got it.""A spokesman for Apple declined to comment for this story.Kaufman said Apple recruiters began circling Mission as it was trying to raise a crucial round of funding last autumn.An investor who had committed to the round backed out after two key engineers joined Apple, he said, and more employees followed in the coming months.San Francisco-based Mission is not the first to run up against Apple's auto ambitions. Tesla Motors Inc CEO Elon Musk has publicly chided the iPhone maker for trying to poach engineers.In February, electric-car battery maker A123 Systems sued Apple for recruiting some of its top engineers, claiming it had been forced to abandon key projects. A123 and Apple later settled on undisclosed terms.With a research and development team of several hundred, A123 could weather the departures, CEO Jason Forcier said. But a small startup could be crippled, he noted.""The competition for engineers is as stiff as I've ever seen it, and I've been in this game for 25 years now,"" he said.That was illustrated earlier this year when ride-hailing app Uber snatched as many as 50 people away from Carnegie Mellon University's robotics lab, according to media reports, to help it build a self-driving car.And amid tepid interest from investors in clean tech, startups rarely raise the money they need to compete, Forcier said.""We put $1 billion into A123,"" he said. ""Startups get $10 million to $20 million - it's nothing.""Mission raised about $14 million, according to investment database CrunchBase.Scot Harden, a vice president at electric bike maker Zero Motorcycles, said his company has not suffered any defections to Apple thanks to a stable base of investors.""You have to have investors behind you who really see that future,"" he said.MISSION'S WOESApple never tried to acquire Mission Motors, Kaufman said. But the engineering team, specializing in hardware and software for electric drive systems, including algorithms for battery charging and cooling, offered Apple a range of expertise to draw from.At least two Mission employees joined Apple in 2012, according to LinkedIn profiles. Over the past year, people with knowledge of Mission estimate about a half dozen engineers moved to Apple.Other employees also joined companies such as Tesla and Harley-Davidson, but Apple grabbed the largest share, they added.The hires include Nancy Sun, Mission's vice president of electrical engineering, Mark Sherwood, director of power train systems engineering, and Eyal Cohen, vice president of software and electrical engineering.Sherwood declined to comment. Cohen and Sun did not respond to requests for comment.From its founding in 2007, Mission attracted engineers driven to build a world-class electric motorcycle. The company made headlines as it unveiled its prototype: an angular, modernist racing machine that hit 150 miles (240 km) per hour in tests, a record for electric bikes.""It was the best bike I've ever thrown a leg over,"" former Mission employee Jeremy Cleland said.But Mission was perpetually on the verge of running out of money, people with knowledge of the matter said.In 2010, the company began focusing on making software and components for electric vehicles for other firms, hoping to generate revenue to support the motorcycle project.A separate company, Mission Motorcycles, was formed in 2013 to sell the bike, but it plans to file for bankruptcy, CEO Mark Seeger wrote in court papers in September.Mission Motors had no more luck with its new third-party business model. Although it struck deals with Harley-Davidson and others, the contracts were not lucrative.Infield Capital, the largest investor which now controls the company, is in talks with parties which may be interested in acquiring the remaining Mission Motors assets, including designs for components and software, a patent portfolio, and a battery lab, said Bill Perry, a venture adviser at the firm.Mission's prized bike never reached consumers. But former employees now hold key roles in Silicon Valley's auto efforts.They include Seth LaForge, an engineer on Google's self-driving car project, and Jon Wagner, Tesla's director of battery engineering - an impressive tally for a company that never numbered more than about 50 employees.""The Apples, the Googles and the Teslas really benefited from the education that those engineers were given at Mission,"" one industry executive said.(Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Stephen R.

But a small startup could be crippled, he noted.""The competition for engineers is as stiff as I've ever seen it, and I've been in this game for 25 years now,"" he said.That was illustrated earlier this year when ride-hailing app Uber snatched as many as 50 people away from Carnegie Mellon University's robotics lab, according to media reports, to help it build a self-driving car.And amid tepid interest from investors in clean tech, startups rarely raise the money they need to compete, Forcier said.""We put $1 billion into A123,"" he said. ""Startups get $10 million to $20 million - it's nothing.""Mission raised about $14 million, according to investment database CrunchBase.Scot Harden, a vice president at electric bike maker Zero Motorcycles, said his company has not suffered any defections to Apple thanks to a stable base of investors.""You have to have investors behind you who really see that future,"" he said.MISSION'S WOESApple never tried to acquire Mission Motors, Kaufman said. But the engineering team, specializing in hardware and software for electric drive systems, including algorithms for battery charging and cooling, offered Apple a range of expertise to draw from.At least two Mission employees joined Apple in 2012, according to LinkedIn profiles. Over the past year, people with knowledge of Mission estimate about a half dozen engineers moved to Apple.Other employees also joined companies such as Tesla and Harley-Davidson, but Apple grabbed the largest share, they added.The hires include Nancy Sun, Mission's vice president of electrical engineering, Mark Sherwood, director of power train systems engineering, and Eyal Cohen, vice president of software and electrical engineering.Sherwood declined to comment. Cohen and Sun did not respond to requests for comment.From its founding in 2007, Mission attracted engineers driven to build a world-class electric motorcycle. The company made headlines as it unveiled its prototype: an angular, modernist racing machine that hit 150 miles (240 km) per hour in tests, a record for electric bikes.""It was the best bike I've ever thrown a leg over,"" former Mission employee Jeremy Cleland said.But Mission was perpetually on the verge of running out of money, people with knowledge of the matter said.In 2010, the company began focusing on making software and components for electric vehicles for other firms, hoping to generate revenue to support the motorcycle project.A separate company, Mission Motorcycles, was formed in 2013 to sell the bike, but it plans to file for bankruptcy, CEO Mark Seeger wrote in court papers in September.Mission Motors had no more luck with its new third-party business model. Although it struck deals with Harley-Davidson and others, the contracts were not lucrative.Infield Capital, the largest investor which now controls the company, is in talks with parties which may be interested in acquiring the remaining Mission Motors assets, including designs for components and software, a patent portfolio, and a battery lab, said Bill Perry, a venture adviser at the firm.Mission's prized bike never reached consumers. But former employees now hold key roles in Silicon Valley's auto efforts.They include Seth LaForge, an engineer on Google's self-driving car project, and Jon Wagner, Tesla's director of battery engineering - an impressive tally for a company that never numbered more than about 50 employees.""The Apples, the Googles and the Teslas really benefited from the education that those engineers were given at Mission,"" one industry executive said.(Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Stephen R.

11,BUSINESS,Amazon Still Pretty Angry About That New York Times Story,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-jay-carney-new-york-times-story_us_5624ee94e4b08589ef47f960,Jay Carney offers detailed response to front-page story -- two months later.,2015-10-19,Amazon spokesman and former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/562529581400002200c7a3db.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two months after the New York Times published a damning investigation into its workplace culture, Amazon is fighting back. In a blog post on Medium published Monday morning, Amazon spokesperson Jay Carney claims that the Times' reporters Jodi Kantor and David Streitfeld failed to check the accuracy of the anecdotes in the piece. ""Had the reporters checked their facts, the story they published would have been a lot less sensational, a lot more balanced, and, let’s be honest, a lot more boring,"" he writes. ""It might not have merited the front page, but it would have been closer to the truth.""The Times' executive editor, Dean Baquet, tore apart Carney's post in his own blog on Medium. Kantor and Streitfeld spoke with more than 100 current and former Amazon employees, Baquet said. Nothing in Carney's latest response refutes their claims, he writes, adding, ""This story was based on dozens of interviews. And any reading of the responses leaves no doubt that this was an accurate portrait."" Carney refused to let the Times get the last word, though. Later on Monday, he shot back at Baquet ""thanking"" him for his response and sticking to his point that the Times failed to thoroughly fact-check its sources.The back-and-forth drew a wave of critics on Twitter, fed up with the petty feuding.  Two months is an awfully long time to take in responding to a newspaper story. Especially one as big as the Times' piece, a brutal portrayal of a Hobbesian workplace at Amazon that generated a raft of think pieces, hot takes and blog posts from current and former employees. At the time, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos defended his company, but only in vague terms, not addressing the specifics of the story. The demanding chief executive asked employees to let him know if they saw any problems at the retailer. He said there was ""zero tolerance"" for a lack of empathy there. (In other words, he has no empathy for anyone without empathy.)Back then, Carney, who previously served as White House press secretary, said he was unable to track down some of the employees quoted in the piece. In his blog on Monday, Carney partially explained the delay by saying that the company's goal was to get the Times to correct its story.""We presented the Times with our findings several weeks ago, hoping they might take action to correct the record,"" Carney writes. ""They haven’t, which is why we decided to write about it ourselves.""Carney offers details on four employees that the Times quoted in the piece. In particular, Carney claims that the man who said that Amazon workers cry at their desk -- a damning often-quoted assertion -- was fired from the company for ""defraud[ing] vendors."" Carney's account is disputed by the former employee, Baquet writes, adding that there was no formal accusation of wrongdoing.Carney explains that one woman who told the Times she didn't sleep for four days to complete a project, chose to do so.Carney also claims that Kantor misled Amazon about the focus of the piece. ""[T]his story will express that Amazon has a somewhat counterintuitive theory of management that really works,"" Carney quotes Kantor as telling the company. Baquet writes that this claim is particularly disingenuous. We have reviewed notes from Ms. Kantor’s communications with your team. The topics discussed relatively early on included Amazon’s reputation as a difficult place to work, social cohesion, complaints of a culture of criticism and other worker concerns that were emerging from the reporting.A few days after the Times' story published, the paper's public editor criticized the piece for its reliance on anecdotes to paint its picture of Amazon but acknowledged that no facts reported were in question.This post has been updated with Dean Baquet's response to Jay Carney's critique of the Times story, and with Carney's response to that response.

A colossal dark hole was recently spotted on the sun's surface, and it has been spewing solar wind our way. According to NASA, the high-speed wind triggered a light show of several auroras on Earth last week.A photo of the ""coronal hole"" (below) was taken by a camera aboard the space agency's Solar Dynamics Observatory on Oct. 10.The hole is located on the outermost layer of the sun, called the corona, in the northern hemisphere. It is about the size of 50 Earths and is releasing wind at up to 500 miles per second, Space.com reported.A geomagnetic storm watch was issued for Wednesday through Friday, as forecasters continued to monitor the solar particle-carrying wind heading our way. Coronal holes are often the source of faster-than-normal solar winds since they mark cooler regions on the sun. These regions have a lower density of solar material and weakened magnetic field lines -- factors that make it easier for solar wind to escape.When solar wind reaches Earth, it can disturb our planet's magnetosphere and cause geomagnetic storms. While such storms create beautiful auroras, or Northern Lights, they can also affect satellite and radio communication systems.NASA scientists haven't indicated whether the recently spotted hole will stick around for Halloween, but coronal holes are known to last for up to months.Also on HuffPost Science:"

14,BLACK VOICES,Police Department Bias Trainings Are More In Demand Than Ever,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/police-bias-training-programs_us_561ecc70e4b050c6c4a437f9,But no one can say for sure if they're actually changing attitudes.,2015-10-19,"Police departments are ramping up efforts to get their officers into bias trainings, as communities continue to be concerned about police brutality.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561ecd151200002e007e52b0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lorie Fridell is an incredibly busy woman.An associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, Fridell is the mastermind of an in-demand training program for police departments looking to address their officers’ implicit biases and unconscious sources of prejudiced behavior.In recent months, Fridell has been fielding more inquiries than ever before -- at least once a day -- from departments across the United States and Canada. To date, the trainings, which are partially funded by the Department of Justice, have reached about 350 different agencies. Among them, departments in Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Baltimore.The surging interest in her program, which is titled Fair and Impartial Training, has left her scrambling to train more instructors so that she can keep up with the demand. Right now, 11 trainers -- all of whom are either current officers working during their vacation time or retired officers -- are facilitating the trainings, while many others are still in the process of trying out to land a spot on the team.“There’s a lot of chiefs and sheriffs looking for answers and their quest for answers has increased,” Fridell told The Huffington Post. “They identified that this seems to be the model that makes the most sense.”Following the high-profile incidents of police-involved killings of black males in Ferguson, Missouri, as well as New York, Cleveland and elsewhere -- and the continued impact of the Black Lives Matter movement -- the call for improved, less biased policing in the U.S. continues to be heard. Many communities have lost faith in the police entirely. A Gallup poll released this summer found that Americans' trust in the police has hit a 22-year low and communities of color remain particularly leery of law enforcement officers. Programs like Fridell’s have been touted by some as a promising step departments can take toward regaining that trust.The trainings offered by Fridell’s group are intended to help police personnel understand the nature of their unconscious biases and how they can impact their policing. They also introduce tools to help officers recognize their biases and modify their behavioral responses to them in the interest of policing their communities more fairly.But does it work? Fridell admits the majority of participants are “somewhere between defensive and hostile” to begin with, though she believes they “make the sale” with about 95 percent of those who take part, based on responses to the evaluations trainers distribute at the end of each session.“There are absolutely people who won’t buy it, that 5 percent. I have nothing more to say to them than what we say in the training: ‘This is you, these are your biases, this is science and this is what you need to do,’” Fridell said. “We also get comments like they came into the training kicking and screaming and now they wonder why they didn’t get the training 20 years ago. That, to me, shows a transformation.”Despite Fridell's confidence in the program, there isn't any evidence that it is having a real impact noted Joshua Correll, a University of Colorado psychology professor specializing in the study of bias. The trainings, he said, simply have not been tested in any significant way.“I don’t necessarily question that [these departments] want to do the right thing, but I think there is a reasonable concern about these trainings and their real potential to undo bias or erase bias,” Correll told HuffPost.Tony Greenwald, a psychology professor at the University of Washington and the principal investigator at Harvard University’s Project Implicit, agrees that it is “plausible” Fridell’s and other similar police trainings accomplish nothing at all. As police departments have rarely been transparent about the trainings they are undergoing and what changes they may inform, he remains suspicious.“These [biases] are things that are very long-ingrained and I think the secret in trying to deal with this is figuring out how to live with them and prevent them from interfering with doing proper work in a police setting,” Greenwald said. “There’s lots of talk but very little action about police operating more in the public eye.”While Correll said that biases can prove malleable in a laboratory setting, they can return just as quickly outside of the controlled environments of trainings and workshops.""Just as they can be changed or temporarily erased in the lab, they can be rebuilt in society, in a real world that rebuilds stereotypical affiliations,"" Correll added. ""And guess what? The bias comes back, like they were never touched.""Biases are particularly prone to return in stressful situations, such as a police officer being engaged in a potentially life-or-death encounter, and that setting could not be more different from that of a lab.Correll doubts anyone will take the time to figure out how to bridge that gap, because it would be time-consuming and expensive.“If there were real political will from funding sources and from police departments, we could do this study to try and figure out which interventions work,” he continued. “But it’s an illogical approach to try to generalize from one population and one situation to a totally different one.” Given that there's little evidence that the trainings work, this raises the question of whether departments are genuinely interested in improving their policing -- particularly when it comes to communities of color -- or are simply looking for a public relations boost from media coverage of their efforts, to push back against recent criticisms.Dennis Parker, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s racial justice program, told HuffPost he believes it's too early to tell what the impact of such trainings will be. He sees the issue of police biases as part of the much larger problem of “broken windows” policing as well as a lack of transparency and accountability among police departments.A valid solution, Parker explained, would need to consider those other factors as well.“It’s a significant first step but it’s a step that could lead to nowhere,” Parker said. “This training is not like an inoculation you take once and you’re protected for life from unconscious bias. The effort to deal with this has to be continuous and reinforced.”For her part, Fridell insists that the overwhelming majority of departments have a sincere interest in doing better and don’t simply “need a check mark for their communities.” She also argues that her training is not a cure-all when it comes to both abusive policing and explicit, racist biases, but is adamant we have to start somewhere.""It takes a lot of work sometimes to break down those walls,” she said."

Within four months of getting a prosthetic leg, Abbott went paddle boarding. Soon after, she got a special leg so she could walk in 4-inch heels, her preferred footwear. She also has a special running blade, as well as an “everyday” leg. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BOSTON (AP) -- Ever since she lost a leg in the Boston Marathon bombing, Heather Abbott has devoted herself to giving others a leg up.On Monday, she'll accomplish that quite literally. The Heather Abbott Foundation will donate its first artificial limb to a 26-year-old woman from Walpole, Massachusetts, who said it will let her do something she's never been able to do before: walk in heels.Hillary Cohen, whose right leg was amputated nearly two years ago, will be fitted Monday with a custom-made leg provided through Abbott's foundation.""It will allow me to be able to be like any other girl. I'll be able to put myself together more and feel more confident,"" said Cohen, who works as a bone density technician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.Abbott, who had part of her own leg amputated after suffering grievous injuries in the 2013 terrorist attacks at the marathon finish line, called it ""heartwarming"" to be able to help Cohen. For Abbott, a basic artificial leg wasn't enough to help her get her life back. She's since been fitted with additional specialty prostheses that enable her to wear heels, run and swim.In a very real sense, Abbott said, she feels Cohen's pain.""She was somebody I really wanted to help,"" said Abbott, of Newport, Rhode Island. ""I know how important it was to me to have those legs and feel feminine and do things other women could do. They allowed me to get back to my life the way that it was.""Cohen's leg was amputated below the knee in January 2014 because of complications from neurofibromatosis, a painful condition that causes tumors to form on nerve tissue.Although she has one prosthetic limb, it's not suitable for wearing high heels, running or doing other activities. Abbott's foundation was established to help provide specialty devices so amputees can recover as much of their normal lives as possible.They're not cheap. A leg like the one Cohen is getting typically costs $70,000, and insurance companies often don't cover anything they deem to be cosmetic or medically unnecessary.In Cohen's case, Next Step Bionics & Prosthetics of Newton, which is conducting Monday's fitting, provided the leg to the foundation at a discount.Cohen said she's deeply grateful to get assistance from the Abbott Foundation - and thrilled that her new leg will let her walk in heels for the first time. Because her disease began at age 13, she's never been able to wear them.Eventually, she hopes to procure a leg that will let her resume running and chase her goal of completing a marathon - an achievement that, in a sense, would bring her full-circle with Abbott, her benefactor.""I want to show people that just because I have a prosthetic doesn't mean I have limitations,"" Cohen said. ""My life now is limitless.""Next up for the Heather Abbott Foundation: providing a running leg to an 8-year-old Massachusetts girl who lost a limb in a lawnmower accident.""It is going to change her life,"" Abbott said."

Let’s do the same for oil companies & climate change,” former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) tweeted on Friday, linking to an article about the House members' request for an inquiry.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) expressed a similar sentiment on Twitter, but stopped short of explicitly endorsing the inquiry.“#ExxonKnew the truth about fossil fuels and climate change and lied to protect their business model at the expense of the planet,” he tweeted.Those are the only public comments O’Malley and Sanders have made about the ExxonMobil controversy.As of Sunday, neither of the Democratic presidential candidates responded to The Huffington Post's request to confirm that they endorse the House Democrats’ calls for an inquiry or offer a more detailed statement on their positions.Reps. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Friday asking her to initiate an investigation of ExxonMobil for conducting a “campaign to deceive the American people about the known risks of fossil fuels in causing climate change."" The letter is based on reports from Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times earlier this month detailing Exxon’s efforts to cast doubt on the role of fossil fuels in driving climate change, despite knowledge of its causes dating back decades.Inside Climate News told the story of how one of Exxon’s own scientists told the company’s management in 1977 that carbon dioxide emitted through the burning of fossil fuels was the ""most likely” driver of global climate change.And the LA Times documented how Exxon “sought to downplay the certainty of global warming,” even as it charged its scientists with assessing how to prepare for the phenomenon.Lieu and DeSaulnier compared Exxon’s conduct to cigarette companies’ public denial of the harmful effects of tobacco decades earlier.ExxonMobil denied the charges in an email to HuffPost. ""We unequivocally reject allegations contained in the letter to Attorney General Lynch from Representatives Lieu and DeSaulnier,"" said Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for ExxonMobil. ""The media reports that are the basis for their allegations are inaccurate distortions of ExxonMobil’s more than 30-year history of climate research that was conducted in conjunction with the Department of Energy, academics and the UN International Panel on Climate Change.""UPDATE: This article has been updated with ExxonMobil's response.Kate Sheppard contributed reporting.Also on HuffPost:"

The students, who were selected by the university to participate in a focus group, agreed that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had the strongest debate performance because she looked and sounded presidential. Yet they had many other observations gleaned from spending their college years in Des Moines -- the center of the political process every four years. The students have attended campaign events for nearly every candidate running in 2016 and have met the debate candidates personally. ""[Clinton] came off more personable than she normally does in her persona, and that was something that I really lacked from her before,"" said senior Sarah Fulton.Senior Kevin Maisto agreed that Clinton had a ""powerhouse"" performance, but also said he was impressed with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who was forceful and memorable. He said Sanders could have used some more debate preparation.""I wish he could have been a little more sharp with some of his statements,"" Maisto said. He also explained his disappointment in former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley.""I kind of wanted him to take away that fringe candidate role and really use this to lead him further in the polls. I don't think his performance proved that.""Senior Bri Steirer disagreed, saying she was impressed with O'Malley, especially because this was his first performance on a national stage.""I think he really separated himself from the other candidates,"" said Steirer, who is president of the Drake Democrats. All five students agreed that while O'Malley's performance wasn't strong enough to win the debate, there still is a path forward for him in Iowa, where he has spent the majority of his campaign time and money. Since O'Malley announced his candidacy at the end of May, he has made 13 visits to Iowa and 69 appearances around the state. That's more than any other candidate vying for the Democratic nomination.""The people he has here are willing to go out and knock on doors, they adore him so much,"" Fulton said. ""I would say just give him a little more time.""""No one does Iowa like Martin O'Malley,"" Steirer said. She described seeing him speak at the Des Moines Register's soapbox at the Iowa State Fair. ""The tucked-in shirt with the jeans, even the brow wipe. He had it down to a science. The man does Iowa better than anyone I've ever seen. I think he is just a spark waiting to catch into a wildfire because if you can do down-home real estate politicking like Martin O'Malley, that's a special skill and not one that could be taught.""The students had contrasting views on the most talked-about moment of the evening: the back-and-forth when Sanders declared he was sick of hearing about Clinton's ""damn"" email controversy instead of criticizing her for it.Junior Caitlin Eames, who made it clear that she does not support Sanders' policies, praised him for delivering this message.""I think Bernie doesn't really care if it was the right political strategic move or not. I think that's how he feels and he's not afraid to express that,"" she said. ""His supporters will probably be encouraged by that."" Fuller said that since Republicans are continuously attacking Clinton over the email controversy, the statement was a way for Sanders to unite the Democratic party.But Steirer had a completely different view of the exchange, given that during the debate Sanders was speaking to a very particular group of people: Democratic party elites and activists.""There is a whole other half or more of America who actually cares about what is in those emails and has genuine concern for what is in those emails,"" she said. ""For him to say that the American people are sick of hearing about it is sort of generalizing an overarching opinion.""Clinton and Sanders had the lion's share of speaking time in the debate, with Clinton speaking for 30 minutes, 26 seconds and Sanders speaking for 26 minutes, 42 seconds. Some in this focus group thought the speaking time was not balanced.""[Debate viewers] got to see their names and see their faces, but I don't think that they got to see them talk as much as what would have been preferable,"" Fulton said. ""If you look at Lincoln Chafee, he spoke just under nine minutes whereas Hillary Clinton spoke over 30 minutes.""Steirer disagreed, saying the speaking time had to do with number of attacks launched at Clinton that required her to respond, though she agreed there should be a platform where the public could hear more from each candidate.Logan Kentner, a sophomore and president of the Drake Republicans, noted the advantage the Democratic party has with only five candidates on the debate stage.""The Republican party had 11 on stage at the last debate. Some of the bottom tier candidates had only a couple minutes to speak total whereas the bottom tier Democratic candidate right now is getting nine minutes,"" he said.These men and women at Drake, a private coeducational university in Des Moines, aren't your average college students. They are actively following the race leading up to the Iowa caucus, attending campaign events and gaining a personal knowledge of the candidates. A Drake student even had a question featured in the debate, and the university campus will host the second Democratic debate, on Nov. 14.""It kind of goes to my head a little bit, going to school in Des Moines,"" said Steirer. ""The candidates are just so accessible so they'll be there to shake your hand, they will be there to listen to your issues.""Eames agreed. ""A number of candidates who I've had the opportunity to get to see in person, once I've seen them in person and shook their hand, my perception of them completely changed,"" she said.Maisto said meeting the candidates before seeing them in action during the debate helped him gain a better understanding of their personality.""Knowing what they are saying on the trail matches up"" is important, Maisto said. He made an example of Sanders, whose debate reflected what he has said campaigning, ""so you know that he's authentic."" But overall, the debate did not alter the students' opinions of the candidates, they said. Each candidate's performance catered to what their supporters wanted to see or hear.""I think what happened up on stage, if anyone were to look at it ahead of time, no one would be surprised,"" Maisto said.

Martin O'Malley, right, speaks as Hillary Rodham Clinton listens during the CNN Democratic presidential debate Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015, in Las Vegas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- A day after the first Democratic debate aired on CNN, five Drake University students gathered around a table in a student lounge on campus to reflect. The students, who were selected by the university to participate in a focus group, agreed that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had the strongest debate performance because she looked and sounded presidential. Yet they had many other observations gleaned from spending their college years in Des Moines -- the center of the political process every four years. The students have attended campaign events for nearly every candidate running in 2016 and have met the debate candidates personally. ""[Clinton] came off more personable than she normally does in her persona, and that was something that I really lacked from her before,"" said senior Sarah Fulton.Senior Kevin Maisto agreed that Clinton had a ""powerhouse"" performance, but also said he was impressed with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who was forceful and memorable. He said Sanders could have used some more debate preparation.""I wish he could have been a little more sharp with some of his statements,"" Maisto said. He also explained his disappointment in former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley.""I kind of wanted him to take away that fringe candidate role and really use this to lead him further in the polls. I don't think his performance proved that.""Senior Bri Steirer disagreed, saying she was impressed with O'Malley, especially because this was his first performance on a national stage.""I think he really separated himself from the other candidates,"" said Steirer, who is president of the Drake Democrats. All five students agreed that while O'Malley's performance wasn't strong enough to win the debate, there still is a path forward for him in Iowa, where he has spent the majority of his campaign time and money. Since O'Malley announced his candidacy at the end of May, he has made 13 visits to Iowa and 69 appearances around the state. That's more than any other candidate vying for the Democratic nomination.""The people he has here are willing to go out and knock on doors, they adore him so much,"" Fulton said. ""I would say just give him a little more time.""""No one does Iowa like Martin O'Malley,"" Steirer said. She described seeing him speak at the Des Moines Register's soapbox at the Iowa State Fair. ""The tucked-in shirt with the jeans, even the brow wipe. He had it down to a science. The man does Iowa better than anyone I've ever seen. I think he is just a spark waiting to catch into a wildfire because if you can do down-home real estate politicking like Martin O'Malley, that's a special skill and not one that could be taught.""The students had contrasting views on the most talked-about moment of the evening: the back-and-forth when Sanders declared he was sick of hearing about Clinton's ""damn"" email controversy instead of criticizing her for it.Junior Caitlin Eames, who made it clear that she does not support Sanders' policies, praised him for delivering this message.""I think Bernie doesn't really care if it was the right political strategic move or not. I think that's how he feels and he's not afraid to express that,"" she said. ""His supporters will probably be encouraged by that."" Fuller said that since Republicans are continuously attacking Clinton over the email controversy, the statement was a way for Sanders to unite the Democratic party.But Steirer had a completely different view of the exchange, given that during the debate Sanders was speaking to a very particular group of people: Democratic party elites and activists.""There is a whole other half or more of America who actually cares about what is in those emails and has genuine concern for what is in those emails,"" she said. ""For him to say that the American people are sick of hearing about it is sort of generalizing an overarching opinion.""Clinton and Sanders had the lion's share of speaking time in the debate, with Clinton speaking for 30 minutes, 26 seconds and Sanders speaking for 26 minutes, 42 seconds. Some in this focus group thought the speaking time was not balanced.""[Debate viewers] got to see their names and see their faces, but I don't think that they got to see them talk as much as what would have been preferable,"" Fulton said. ""If you look at Lincoln Chafee, he spoke just under nine minutes whereas Hillary Clinton spoke over 30 minutes.""Steirer disagreed, saying the speaking time had to do with number of attacks launched at Clinton that required her to respond, though she agreed there should be a platform where the public could hear more from each candidate.Logan Kentner, a sophomore and president of the Drake Republicans, noted the advantage the Democratic party has with only five candidates on the debate stage.""The Republican party had 11 on stage at the last debate. Some of the bottom tier candidates had only a couple minutes to speak total whereas the bottom tier Democratic candidate right now is getting nine minutes,"" he said.These men and women at Drake, a private coeducational university in Des Moines, aren't your average college students. They are actively following the race leading up to the Iowa caucus, attending campaign events and gaining a personal knowledge of the candidates. A Drake student even had a question featured in the debate, and the university campus will host the second Democratic debate, on Nov. 14.""It kind of goes to my head a little bit, going to school in Des Moines,"" said Steirer. ""The candidates are just so accessible so they'll be there to shake your hand, they will be there to listen to your issues.""Eames agreed. ""A number of candidates who I've had the opportunity to get to see in person, once I've seen them in person and shook their hand, my perception of them completely changed,"" she said.Maisto said meeting the candidates before seeing them in action during the debate helped him gain a better understanding of their personality.""Knowing what they are saying on the trail matches up"" is important, Maisto said. He made an example of Sanders, whose debate reflected what he has said campaigning, ""so you know that he's authentic."" But overall, the debate did not alter the students' opinions of the candidates, they said. Each candidate's performance catered to what their supporters wanted to see or hear.""I think what happened up on stage, if anyone were to look at it ahead of time, no one would be surprised,"" Maisto said. ""The fringe candidates will mostly remain the fringe candidates. Hillary Clinton was confident, poised, prepared and she was definitely front-runner status and she kind of solidified that. Bernie ignited his base and talked about the issues he wanted to talk about, which he's been doing on the campaign trail. When you look at it, there weren't any major moments that differentiated from what we've already been talking about, what's already been reported and what's already been taking place on the campaign trail.""CORRECTION: This story previously misstated that the students in the focus group were selected by Drake University to attend a debate watch party.
