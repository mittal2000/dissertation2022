We just need to ask the right questions.""",2015-08-08,"<p>A French Air Force plane taking part in the search for wreckage from the missing MH370 plane lands in Saint-Marie on the island of La Reunion on Aug. 7, 2015.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c525f71d00002f001443fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we speak with David Gallo about the latest developments in the search for flight MH370.The recent discovery of plane debris in the Indian Ocean has raised hopes of finally solving the mystery of the Malaysia Airlines plane that vanished last year.Malaysia said on Wednesday that the wing piece, called a flaperon, belonged to flight MH370, which went missing with 239 people on board on March 8, 2014, flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. While French investigators were more cautious in providing a definitive link, they concur that the debris is a flaperon from a Boeing 777, and flight MH370 is the only plane of that type that is missing.On Friday, France expanded its search for more debris around the Indian Ocean island of Reunion, where the flaperon was found. Meanwhile, experts continue to scrutinize the wing part for any clues on what happened to plane. To better understand what these developments could reveal about the missing plane, The WorldPost spoke to David Gallo, director of special projects at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who helped French authorities locate the wreckage of Air France flight 447 in 2011. How difficult is it to trace back the path of the debris and find where the plane crashed?It is extremely difficult. It would have been dispersed by winds and the ocean currents for 500-odd days. I don't think it will help refine the present search area in the short term.But if the current underwater search doesn't find anything, and this remains the only piece of tangible evidence in 16 months of an international investigation -- and into possibly a criminal act -- it will become extremely important.What will experts be looking for when they examine this object? Firstly, how it sits in the water. Judging by the barnacles, which grow in sunlight, it looks like it was floating vertically, long side up. This is important because if it sticks above the water it will have been pushed by the wind, and if it was underwater it will have been pushed by the currents -- and these are often opposite directions.Then, they will look at what the currents and winds were doing each day. It is very hard to backtrack all the way to the date it was lost. It's like finding a balloon on the East Coast of the U.S. and knowing it started on the West Coast -- could you backtrack and find its starting point? That's almost impossible to do. They will have to go back in time and see if the data exists and how detailed it is.The barnacles could provide some clues -- their size could suggest the minimum length of time the object has been in the water. If they're a certain species of barnacle this could locate the debris in a smaller possible area. Often animals build their shells out of sea water, and the chemicals in them may be different in different areas.Pollen is also a wonderful indicator of location. Anyone with a car knows that once pollen gets on your windscreen it can survive anything. Pollen, for example from off the Australian coast, could provide more information on the location. The ocean is a great record keeper. The ocean sediment, rocks, coral, sea animals, ice caps -- they are all continuously recording the earth's history, and this is human history. We're right at the beginning of understanding what ocean forensics might do. The answers are out there. We just need to ask the right questions. What clues might the debris offer about what happened to the plane?The investigators will also look at the object itself -- whether it's dented, what the damage is like, and if it has nuts and bolts, whether they are skewed. It appears that the leading piece is in good shape while the tail is crumpled, and this could be due to fluttering in the air. This is important because it might tell you something about how this part came off the plane: whether it came off in the water or in the air, and if it came off in the air, whether it was from an explosion or a mechanical issue.The investigators will go down to the grains of the metal and examine stresses and strains. This is what we did with Air France 477 and it provided compelling evidence that the plane landed on its belly, tail first -- that it came almost straight down and hit the ocean.If their analysis shows the piece came off because of a sharp descent this will alter the current analysis that the plane was gliding for a certain time and distance and ran out of fuel. If it came off at supersonic speed, they'll have to shift the search area north. From my experience I can promise that the French investigators will be completely thorough -- from the largest pieces to the individual grains of metal, they will be looking for any clues they can get. Would you expect other debris to turn up in the same area around Reunion?It's unlikely. The ocean is a great disperser. If you put five objects of different shapes in the water the ocean will tend to disperse them. Finding the items themselves is difficult; over time it begins to approach a question of luck. Depending on what the objects look like, they could be further north, or they could be on the other side of Australia. How likely is it that rest of the plane will ever be found?Time is not on our side. I don't understand why there wasn't action sooner when the debris field could have been more condensed. It is frustrating that there were a series of false claims at the beginning -- that debris had been found, or that pings were heard from the black box, which turned out to be shark tagging.No one has done this routinely. The French had experience with Air France 447 and now the Australians, Malaysians and Chinese are all involved. It's difficult to work out what do and in what sequence.The team that is searching now [the Australian-led search team scouring a 46,000 square mile area in the southern Indian Ocean] is the only team on Earth who can do the job. They faced a lot of criticism, as we did during the Air France 447 search, but they're the right team and have the right technology. I'm confident that if it's in the area they would have seen it, and I have to hope it's in the second half of the search area. It may take time, but the plane will be found. The families have to have closure. And the flying public and the aeronautical industry have to know why it went down. There are also the families of the Air France 477 flight, the MH17 plane and the Germanwings jet to consider. Every time these things happen it opens old wounds and makes them deeper. I think it will be found --it just needs the will and the patience.What frustrates me a lot is that after Air France 447, we said this can never happen again. There is a simple solution: get aircraft to broadcast their position every couple of minutes. Here we are a few years later and it happens again and in the worst possible way, and we still won't learn our lesson. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Also on HuffPost: "
8,ARTS & CULTURE,That Time A YA Book Won The Pulitzer Prize For Fiction,Maddie Crum,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/that-time-a-ya-book-won-the-pulitzer-prize-for-fiction_us_55c507a5e4b0923c12bce2d2,"Happy birthday, Marjorie Rawlings!",2015-08-08,'Wild: From Lost To Found On The Pacific Crest Trail' by Cheryl Strayed,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a6bb521900002600b86930.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Immature, embarrassing, fundamentally uncritical. Too often, the way we talk and write about Young Adult books is conflated with the way we talk about young adults, as though it’s teens doing the writing, unarmed with critical distance.In fact, it’s almost always super-smart, bookish adults funneling all they’ve learned from reading into an honest story about kids. It’s no wonder adults enjoy their books. And this supposed trend is nothing new -- in 1939 Marjorie Rawlings won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for a novel that was meant to appeal to younger readers. In Rawling’s obituary in 2000, The New York Times reported: The Yearling, Mrs. Rawlings' greatest triumph, was hailed in 1938 as a ""classic"" of American popular fiction. While considering her writing as lacking the depth and ""tough-mindedness"" of great literature, critics nevertheless praised her skill in reproducing the color, characters, speech, local customs and way of life of the backwoods of Florida.So, critics might've dismissed her books' lack of heft, but they couldn't deny that she could tell a mean story.The Yearling, for those who haven’t read it, is about a young boy who adopts a fawn, and takes the animal in as a member of the family. It’s not an unheard of set-up, but Rawling’s ability to write deftly about nature earned her accolades. Raised on a farm, she set the book in the spot that would eventually become her home -- a woody, mostly vacant spot called the “Big Scrub.”Though Rawlings headed to New York City after graduating college, she eventually moved with her husband to a plot of land in rural Florida. And that's where her writing flourished. She would eventually befriend other Southern writers such as Zora Neale Hurston, but not before she captured the mood of her home in the story of The Yearling. In addition to winning arguably the top prize in fiction, it was a bestseller, read in book clubs nationwide, and was adapted into a major film. Today marks the 119th anniversary of Rawling's birth. Why not read a YA book to celebrate?Also on HuffPost:"

The movement issued a call to action for people everywhere to recognize the reality of institutionalized racism.Christian leaders around the country saw the movement as a critical opportunity to engage their church in conversations about race and privilege. The Huffington Post reached out to some of these leaders for their thoughts about how Black Lives Matter has changed the church ― and the work that still needs to be done.Rev. Jennifer BaileyFounder of the Faith Matters Network, fellow at the Nathan Cummings Foundation and ordained itinerant elder in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Nashville, Tennessee.The Black Lives Matter movement awoke our national consciousness to the persistent system of white supremacy and structural racism that penetrates each of our institutions. By placing violence against black bodies at the center of the movement, BLM has demanded dignity and respect for those who are often disregarded as disposal. This summer, my denomination was hit particularly hard from the attack on Mother Emanuel AME in Charleston, South Carolina, to the death of Sandra Bland, a young AME woman found dead in a jail cell in Texas. My prayer is that the specific pain and grief experienced in my church community this summer can be catalyzed toward concrete action and advocacy on issues ranging from police brutality to intergenerational poverty. I think American Christianity has been slow to get on board with the message of BLM out of fear and uncertainty. The gospel message of Jesus was, at its core, about embodying God's love through affirming the inherent dignity of all peoples in general, and of marginalized peoples in particular. I believe BLM is issuing a challenge to the Church to enter into a deep sense of collective lament for the loss of life, repentance for our complicity in systems of white supremacy and courage to be led by those who may not fit our ""traditional"" models of leadership. I hope that there will be those in the Christian community who are bold enough to take on this challenge wholeheartedly.Pastor Renita Marie LamkinItinerant elder and pastor in the AME Church, St Charles, MissouriBlack and poor residents of Ferguson have been systematically and intentionally targeted, oppressed, vilified and ignored. The government, affluent white business owners and the greater region are no longer able to claim to be ignorant to the crisis of humanity so many have suffered for so long.

At protests, white activists have been spoken to politely, as black activists were pulled off the sidewalks.There is a deeper sense of awareness in the church to the levels of injustice being suffered by black and brown people in the greater St. Louis region. Churches have engaged difficult and uncomfortable conversations about race, complicities in white privilege and participation in white supremacy. The Church has broadened its embrace of the “other” and has begun celebrating the work of those who are in the struggle for justice. Clergy have been more visible and audible in their critique of the racist systems from which much oppression flows.But more action is needed. Too often, meetings and community conversations are held in order to delay progress and to give the illusion of progress, all while the community remains broken. So, action to change the system is needed -- not Band-Aid actions.Rev. Dr. Jamal BryantSenior pastor at Empowerment Temple, BaltimoreI think the religious community is now more intentionally integrated with the larger community. It took Freddie Gray's death to realize how large and deep that wedge was. We are building one brick at a time to build up a generation that, generally speaking, wasn’t a part of anybody’s church. They believe in God, but they feel the church has been disconnected from what’s taking place in the community.Much of what Jesus did didn’t happen in the temple. I think Gray's death has caused the church to move outside the safety of stained-glass windows and really do ministry on the street. In our own church, we opened up a Freddie Gray Youth Empowerment Center. We're feeding 500 kids a day and offering them programs in mathematics, computer skills, fine arts and athletics. Without the Freddie Gray uprising, I’m confident it wouldn’t have happened.July had the highest monthly murder rate in Baltimore since 1972. We have a whole lot to do. The national debate is about aggressive policing, but we can’t do that while neglecting young people who are killing their neighbors.I think Black Lives Matter has changed the black church. It’s given it license to embrace our ethnicity out loud. I think there’s a resurgence of the black power movement from the 1970s that hasn't been as strong over the last 20 years. This generation has sparked a flame that was going to go out.Jamye WootenCo-founder of Baltimore United For Change and publisher of KineticsLive, a faith-based news website covering social justice movementsWe have seen a strong collaborative effort amongst grassroots and faith-based organizations. From summer camps and freedom schools to urban farming and the opening of recreation centers, many have stepped up to make a change in [the] lives of our youth and community. But the systemic and structural violence still remains -- high unemployment, failing schools, vacant and abandoned homes and high rates of poverty still exist.While I know many individuals of faith that are involved in this movement, the mass mobilization of youth across the nation has challenged many in the church to move beyond their comfort zone, behind the four walls of the church, and to come into the community. My prayer is that the church won't solely concentrate on charity or social service ministry, something many of our churches are good at, but that they would advocate for just and righteous policies -- living wages, affordable housing, quality education and the like.Baltimore needs to make a commitment to invest in uptown the same way that they have invested in downtown. Black churches must make a commitment beyond charity and social services ministry and begin collaborating and pooling our collective resources for the upliftment and development of our communities. Rev. Nelson B. Rivers IIIPastor of Charity Missionary Baptist Church in North Charleston, South Carolina, and vice president of religious affairs and external relations at the National Action NetworkAfter the Emanuel Nine, we saw the flag come down. There was an outpouring of goodwill and beautiful words. We now have a body cameras bill for the whole state. But law doesn’t always change police behavior, as we saw in the case of Sandra Bland. We don’t need rhetoric, we need action.In Charleston County, we still have a deeply segregated school system. Rev. Clementa Pinckney fought hard for the children of Charleston County. It’s easy to make wonderful statements about Rev. Pinckney, but to ignore his mission to bring change to the school district -- that’s cheap grace. We need grace that has a cost.To say that the Black Lives Matter movement has changed the church would make it appear as if, at one point, the church didn’t think black lives mattered. That's not true. I reject the notion that there’s a generational divide. There were issues of passion and youthful expression at first, some impatience for what they perceived to be a slow process. We aren’t enemies, we’re on the same side. You shouldn’t be speaking about preachers in the church as though they’re your enemies, that’s insulting and disrespectful.What Black Lives Matter did was push the envelope. They gave life to our leadership. Where we didn’t agree, we’re now able to have a conversation. We work with young people as they continue to do the work we can no longer do.Jonathan WaltonProject director of InterVarsity's New York City Urban Project, a faith-based leadership program that trains students to engage and act against injusticeThe Black Lives Matter Movement has the potential to turn a moment into a movement, but must expand in depth and breadth to accomplish the task of justice and reconciliation.First, we must know who we are as people made in the image of God made to work, flourish, rule and create to ensure the working, flourishing, ruling and creating of all of creation. Our identities must be fixed solely in that reality. Second, we must root our work for reconciliation in shalom and recognize the image of God in every person on the face of the planet. Because as we see ourselves rightly as ambassadors, given the ministry of reconciliation, then we can rightly see others.Lastly, I believe that we must get as excited about policy shaping as we do about protesting. Personal, relational and systemic sinfulness needs personal, relational and systemic redemption; and that work is little, slow and fueled by prayer, long meetings and relationship building -- not just marches, Twitter feeds and shouting matches on- and offline.Troy JacksonDirector of the AMOS Project, a faith-based effort that organizes congregations to work for racial and economic justice in CincinnatiWhat has changed after the shooting of Tamir Rice? My first reaction is that Tamir Rice is just one of the names of those who have lost lives senselessly to law enforcement in Ohio in the past twelve months. There was John Crawford III, Tanisha Anderson, Samuel Dubose. Ohio in 2015 has become Mississippi in 1955. Blacks are killed by police, and it is rare indeed to even get an indictment, let alone a conviction.Black Lives Matter has served as a prophetic voice to the church and to our society. They are calling people of faith to examine our values, and to decide if we want to continue to be chaplains to an empire that devalues the lives of so many, or whether we will join them as prophets of the resistance. They ask the church a critical question: ""What side are you on?"" The church can either declare we are on the side of the Exodus, the Resurrection, or we can walk away sad like the rich young ruler, for we have far too much invested in the American empire that is infused with white supremacy.We must heed the call to prayer, and we must heed the call to presence. As John 1:14 in the Message says, Jesus ""became flesh and moved into the neighborhood."" We must be present in our communities, supporting justice leaders, marching, strategizing, praying and bringing the powerful justice narrative of Scripture to bear in a broken world.These interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.

10,HEALTHY LIVING,What To Do With Your Mind During Meditation,"Sonima.com, ContributorA wellness website dedicated to mindful living",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meditation_b_7889944.html,"If you have ever sat down in a cross-legged posture, began focusing on your breath, and immediately wondered, ""What should I do about all these thoughts?"" this is a simple answer.",2015-08-08,"serenity and yoga practicing at sunset, meditation",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9eeeaa1f0000510022358f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Lodro RinzlerI have been teaching peaceful-abiding meditation for 14 years now, and over that time I have realized that there are many misconceptions about what to do with your mind during meditation. If you have ever sat down in a cross-legged posture, began focusing on your breath, and immediately wondered, ""What should I do about all these thoughts?"" this is a simple answer.Before You Meditate For most of us, we run around all day letting our mind flit from one topic to another like a hummingbird surrounded by bird-feeders. To turn to this hummingbird and say, ""Quick! Just sit still!"" wouldn't work. In fact, it would only freak the bird out.Related: 30 Brilliant Insights from Mindfulness Trail BlazersThe same goes for us as we enter meditation. If you run in the door after a long day at work, look at your phone, realize you have 15 minutes to meditate, grab some cushions and plop down, your mind will likely still be very speedy. If your mind normally runs at 100 miles per hour, see if you can gently nudge that down to at least 60 miles per hour before beginning to meditate. That might mean having a cup of tea, changing into non-work clothes, or reading a few pages of a meditation book before you begin. Taking these few minutes to unwind allows you to transition into your meditation practice so you enter already beginning to feel a bit spacious.While You Meditate One of the common mistakes people make when beginning a meditation practice is believing that it is simply a way to turn off your mind. Your mind is a radiant, brilliant, amazing thing and there is no off switch. Meditation is not about zoning out and becoming a vegetable. You can befriend yourself in meditation, use it to transcend your usual experience, even have a powerful realization depending on what technique you are doing, but let's be clear that your mind will remain ""on.""Another common misconception is that thoughts are bad and we should rid ourselves of thoughts. Our mind cannot stop producing thoughts. It's simply what it does. Often when people discover that there is no off switch in their mind and thoughts continue to come they get discouraged and think they are the worst meditator of all time. There have been thousands of years of meditators and I promise you, you are not the worst. Not by a long shot.Many types of meditation are not about getting rid of thoughts but about establishing a healthier relationship to what is going on in the mind. One of my favorite words for meditation is the Tibetan term ""gom,"" which can be translated as ""become familiar with."" In other words, meditation is a way to become more familiar with what is going on in your mind and more familiar with the types of thoughts that come up throughout your day.Related: A Simple Guide to the Complex World of MeditationIf you engage in shamatha, peaceful-abiding meditation, the instruction is to return your attention to your breathing, over and over again. A big thought will pop up and distract you from the breath. It's your job to gently return your focus once more to feeling the simple flow of the breath as it enters and leaves your body. If it is helpful you could even silently say ""thinking"" to yourself.The process of labeling your thoughts as ""thinking"" is not to dismiss them or chase them away like you might swat away a fly: ""Shoo! Don't bother me!"" The point is to acknowledge the thought. You notice that it came up, inwardly nod at it by saying ""thinking"" to yourself and, as if it were someone you saw passing by in the street, having acknowledged them you continue on your way, in this case by returning your attention to the breath.By being extremely gentle with yourself and returning your attention, continuously, to your breathing, you prevent that hummingbird mindset I mentioned earlier. You are, perhaps for the first time all day, focusing on just one thing: the breath. Thoughts about life, fantasies, strong emotions, discursive and subtle emotions will come up. In all these cases we look at the thought, acknowledge it, and come back to the breath.I have off-handedly mentioned being gentle a few times now and, at the risk of kicking a dead horse, I want to directly ask that you be very kind with yourself while you meditate. It is common to acknowledge a thought and come back to the breath, only to have that same thought come up again immediately. Where you may begin by gently saying, ""thinking"" to yourself, after a few repetitions you end up inwardly yelling, ""THINKING!"" The former carries the subtext of, ""It's okay. You got distracted. Come on back to the breath buddy."" The latter carries the subtext of, ""You jerk! How is it that you are so f-ing bad at this thing? What a loser you are that you can't even stay with the breath."" We judge ourselves in so many areas of our lives; please leave that self-judgment at the door when you begin meditating.Related: Settling In with Colleen SaidmanI believe that the inner tone you use with yourself in meditation ends up being the tone you treat yourself with for the rest of your day. If you can use meditation as a time to befriend yourself, to be very kind and sweet to yourself, then you will likely be gentle to yourself for much of the rest of the day. You have attuned your inner voice to give yourself a break when things don't go the way you want and to return to what's coming up right now, instead of dwelling on what just happened or how it will affect you in the future.After You Meditate When you get up from your meditation, don't immediately check your email or rush off to your next appointment. Take a moment to stretch, have a glass of water, or take a short walk. Leave your mind at whatever speed it has ended up at, instead of hitting the gas pedal and ramping it back up to 100 miles per hour. Transitioning out of the meditation practice in this way allows you to maintain a clear and spacious mind, one that accommodates anything.If you want to explore different types of meditation practices, start with this 10-Minute Loving-Kindness meditation on Sonima.com!"

Which countries are more likely to rekindle business and gain more? What will be the Iranian leaders invest in the most? What are the opportunities and risks?",2015-08-08,2015-07-02-1435808454-9985178-ScreenShot20150701at8.40.02PM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-07-02-1435808454-9985178-ScreenShot20150701at8.40.02PM-thumb.png,"After the nuclear deal was reached, foreign countries and companies appear to be rushing to rekindle business with the Islamic Republic, which had been cut off from global trade. Iranian leaders have reciprocated the interest in conducting business -- in many areas including technology, arms, manufacturing, gas and oil -- with other countries. Within hours of the nuclear deal, several international oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and Eni expressed their interest in returning to Iran's oil market, which will more likely ratchet up OPEC's oil production. Among European countries, Germany and France appear to be among the first to rush to rekindle business with the Islamic Republic. Recently, Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's economic minister and vice chancellor, along with a business delegation from Siemens and Linde, and automobile manufactures Mercedes and Volkswagen, made a visit to Iran. This was the first business conference in more than a decade. Iranian leaders are also planning to strengthen Iran's airplane fleet. After the nuclear deal was reached, Mohammad Khodakarami, the director of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization stated that ""Iran will buy a total of 80 to 90 planes a year from the two aviation giants [Airbus and Boing] in the first phase of renovating its air fleet."" When it comes to Iran's economic landscape after the nuclear deal, major questions to address are: What sectors will likely witness foreign investment and flourish the most? Which countries are more likely to rekindle business and gain more? What will be the Iranian leaders invest in the most? What are the opportunities and risks? Opportunities: What Iranian Sectors Are Appealing? The first appealing sector in Iran is the energy sector: oil and gas. The Islamic Republic enjoys the fourth biggest proven crude oil and the second largest natural gas reserves in the world. The second appealing Iranian market is the arms industry. When the sanctions and UN arms embargo are lifted, arms deals can usher in billions of dollars for arms corporations. Russia has already lifted its arms ban on Iran. Additional sectors are Iran's consumer and technology markets. With roughly 80 million people, the Islamic Republic has the second largest population in the Middle East, and the 17th largest in the world. What is more intriguing regarding the consumer marker is that over 60% of the 80 million are under 30 years of age. Iran enjoys a highly educated population but suffers from a high level of brain drain. Even under economic sanctions, Iranian people spent roughly more than $75 billion on food, more than $20 billion on clothes and $18.5 billion on tourism in 2012. Which Countries and Corporations Will Gain More? When it comes to the oil and gas markets, countries which are currently buying oil from Iran -- including China, India Japan, Turkey, and South Korea -- are more likely to ratchet up their oil purchases. European countries and Western oil corporations will also slowly increase their presence in Iran's oil and gas market. Ironically, the United States -- which pushed for Iran's nuclear deal and the consequent removal of economic sanctions and UN arms embargo on Iran -- will be the least beneficiary of Iran's market, economically speaking. Due to the U.S. Congress' opposition of the nuclear deal, U.S. companies will not be capable of dealing with Iran anytime soon. With regards to the arms sale, the Russian-Chinese-Iranian axis will remain robust. Russian arms sales to Iran will increase as restrictions wash away. Russia, which pushed for the listing of arms embargo on Iran, has already announced that it will supply the S-300 missile system to Iran. Concerning Iran's consumer market, Western companies and products have an edge over other companies from the Iranian people's perspectives. Western companies will find it much easier to reach Iranian consumers. Nevertheless, the process of doing business with Iran in full-speed is going to take time. When it comes to the Gulf, one particular country will witness increased trade with Iran: the UAE. Dubai -- which is a traditional hub for business with Iran and a crucial gateway for articles and goods -- will witness increased trade from an economically free Iran. More than 75 percent of Iran's trade in the Gulf is conducted with the UAE. In addition, Iran is UAE's fourth largest trading and business partner after China. In Iran, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Office of the Supreme Leader, who have a monopoly over the energy and main economic sectors, will be the major beneficiaries. The Risks One the major risks of rushing to do business with Iran is linked to the UNSC economic sanctions. In case Iran violates the terms of the nuclear agreement down the road, if political instability regarding Iran's repressive domestic policies increases, and if sanctions are re-imposed, companies will face tough decisions regarding their investments. Secondly, since most of the economic sectors are controlled and owned by the Iranian state, doing business will be a much more daunting task due to the government's legal trade frameworks and the limited labor laws. Third, doing business with the IRGC and some entities, which are still blacklisted, can impact the credibility of the companies. This might alienate those foreign companies from doing business with other countries in the region which are negatively impacted by IRGC activities. Fourth, if the U.S. Congress continues its unilateral sanctions on Iran, it will be more difficult for Western companies to rekindle business with Iran without fearing repercussions from the U.S. Finally, since the state-controlled economy creates a less competitive market and high level of bureaucracy in the country, foreign companies will find it more challenging to compete and less lucrative to do business with Iran.-----Dr. Majid Rafizadeh, an American scholar and political scientist, is the president of the International American Council on the Middle East and serves on the advisory board of Harvard International Review.

I am all too familiar with this phenomenon because, like the Tsimhoni children, my sister and I were incarcerated in a juvenile detention center for refusing to see our father at the age of 14.",2015-08-08,"Oakland County Family Court Judge Lisa Gorcyca listens to attorneys arguments during the continuing court battle between Maya Eibschitz-Tsimhoni and her former husband, Omer Tsimhoni, who have been in court for years fighting, mostly, over who gets to see their children in Pontiac, Mich. on Friday, July 10, 2015. (Daniel Mears/Detroit News via AP, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2a36c2100003000c64f87.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Tsimhoni children -- ages 9, 10 and 14 -- recently made international news when they were bullied by Judge Lisa Gorcyca (Oakland County, Michigan) and ordered to the juvenile detention center Children's Village for refusing to see their father who they claim is abusive. Judge Gorcyca specifically referred to the detention center as ""jail"" when threatening the kids, asking them: ""Do you want to live in jail?"" Then she back-pedaled after public outrage claiming, ""These three children are not being punished, they have been removed from a home situation in which they were unable to pursue a healthy relationship with their father.""The argument emerged that the specific wing, Mandy's Place, of the facility where the Tsimhoni children were held was not a ""jail,"" but merely a housing facility for abused children. An article in the The Detroit Free Press quoted Director George Miller as saying, ""We try to make it as homelike as we can... We even re-did the front door to make it look more like a home.""The front door aside, the conditions in the facility seem hardly distinguishable from other juvenile detention centers. The article goes on to explain: ""There is no cable television. There is no internet access. There are no cell phones or iPads. And children cannot accept incoming calls. Outgoing calls, when allowed, are monitored."" Miller calls the conditions within the facility ""very structured, with 24-hour supervision."" Most importantly, the children are not allowed to leave of their own free will. Even if the facility is not officially a juvenile detention center, it functions as one.Some juvenile detention centers may double as holding places for abused children, but they remain juvenile detention centers nonetheless. I am all too familiar with this phenomenon because, like the Tsimhoni children, my sister and I were incarcerated in a juvenile detention center for refusing to see our father at the age of 14. Like Mandy's Place, the juvenile detention center we were taken to had a reputation for doubling as a safe house. The lack of safety there made the large yellow ""safe place"" sticker on the front door painfully ironic to us.My twin sister and I at age 2.I spent several hours of the first night praying on my knees after the staff members and social workers belittled and mocked me, asking ""Did you ever provoke your parents?"" and responding to my attempt to describe a violent incident by yelling, ""Stop giving me these evasive answers! Did he or did he not leave a mark?"" The next morning, and throughout the rest of my stay, I was very tired from my psychological distress. I asked the staff members if I could go back to my room and sleep during free time. The staff refused and told me that I could not go into my room unless I was sick. They also stated that, if I wanted to go back to my room, I would not be able to come out again all day... even for meals.Like the detention center where the Tsimhonis were kept, our facility was also overwhelmingly populated with convicted juveniles who were shocked by our presence. The only other child being held there without having first been committed a crime was waiting for her mother to come and get her after she declined to live with her sexual abuser. Our collective guilt was assumed by staff members of the facility, and we were treated as criminals.While incarcerated, my sister and I played monopoly with the abuse victim while the other inmates attended anger management counseling as a condition of their incarceration. As we laid out the monopoly pieces, the little girl told us, ""I am not a bad girl. I am just waiting here for my mom to come get me from California."" The nearest staff member, assuming she was a runaway, snapped: ""Maybe it's what got you here from California that makes you a bad girl!"" I will never forget the downtrodden look on that girl's face. I really hope she didn't believe the woman who told her she was a bad girl.Like the Tsimhonis whom Judge Gorcyca ordered ""to be kept away from each other as much as possible,"" I was forbidden to be near my twin sister, to hold her hand in prayer, and to speak freely to her or anyone else except behind a bookcase without the staff's knowledge. We were kept in private rooms in different hallways. The facility was not overcrowded the first night, so there was no need to have inmates share the two bedrooms. The next night, after another girl had arrived and engaged in a physical altercation in the yard, the facility became crowded enough to necessitate shared rooms. Even then, instead of putting my twin and I together, the staff members decided to put the new girl in the same room with me.I became acquainted with many injustices as I witnessed arbitrary extensions of confinement and other victimization of the inmates. These inmates, all of my fellow inmates, had their minor sentences unjustly augmented by the deficits in their educations.The facility kept us out of school and replaced our honors classes with not more than two hours a day of homework and online class time. The ""teacher"" brought her own child to the facility and played with her rather than teaching the incarcerated kids. The other children, many of them several years our senior, reached out to us for homework help. Unable to focus on our own homework due to our recent trauma, we tried to tutor them and teach them the third grade math they asked us about. ""What's 3 x 9?"" asked one older girl. ""What's 1/4 in decimal form?"" asked another. I did not recover from the absence from my advanced math class which I later barely passed with a D-.After I was released from the juvenile detention center, I saw a booth for the organization that gives out the ""Safe Place"" stickers where I live. I was thinking about it as I drove away, and I realized that I had to talk to the man there. I walked up to him and told him timidly, ""Sir, the [insert name of detention center] has one of your stickers. It is not a 'safe place' and you should take the sticker away."" He looked at me with deep concern and replied, ""You are not the first person who has told me that.""Sometimes I fantasize about educating the staff at the detention center where I was held; maybe shipping a box of Judith Herman's Trauma and Recovery to them and all the others. If you are tasked with protecting the interests of children or victims, please buy yourself a copy and save me the trouble.The memories of my incarceration and being blamed by authority figures for the abuse I suffered haunt me still. My sister and I at our high school graduation.Many parents and children will never know what it is like to reunite in the midst of a forced separation. I hope that, after this case, even fewer will understand such a tragedy. I reiterate the trauma survivors' cry and say of this sad reality, ""never again."" It is my sincere wish that no victim of abuse will ever again be subjected to juvenile detention for any reason, least of all for refusing to see their abuser."

Some 50 years ago, I went on my first (and only) wild-game hunt -- the most stupid thing I've ever done. But, at the time, I was gung-ho, buying all the proper paraphernalia, checking guns and racing off into the wilds of Kenya.Covering my macho derring-do, so I can never fully forget, was a photographer assigned to capture my ""heroic"" endeavors for a book called Great Hunts. His name was Robert Halmi.I remember being drunk with power as I softly pulled the trigger of my high-powered rifle and watched a leopard, a gazelle, an oryx, a zebra and other defenseless animals fall to the ground. The trophies I brought back were proudly mounted on the wall of my projection room. And then one day I looked up and all my trophies seemed to be staring at me. I realized how obscene it was to kill them. I quickly got rid of all the ""trophies"" and tried to forget the sin that I had committed.This summer we learned about Dr. Walter Palmer, an American hunter who caused universal outrage for his actions in Zimbabwe. I feel sorry for Dr. Palmer. He is being hunted much like he stalked his prey. His actions were inexcusable and I believe he is certainly paying for them. But he is not alone, many people hunt and kill wild animals for sport. That must be stopped. "

Mike Huckabee at his podium on Thursday at the Republican debate in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c419a41700002600566dd0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A question about Social Security during Thursday's GOP debate sparked an extended debate between Gov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.) and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee about the country’s largest social insurance program. It has appeared as an emerging fault line in the Republican presidential field. The argument began when Chris Wallace asked whether Christie, who has proposed Social Security benefit cuts, thought Huckabee was not being honest for claiming Social Security could be fixed without benefit cuts. “He is not lying -- he is just wrong,” Christie said. “I'm the only guy on this stage who has put out a detailed, 12-point plan on entitlement reform,” Christie added. “And here's why -- because 71 percent of federal spending right now is on entitlements and debt service, 71 percent. And we have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29 percent, and no time on the 71 percent, and that makes no sense.”Christie then elaborated on his plan, proposing a gradual increase in the retirement age and cutting benefits for people with higher incomes. Huckabee responded that he thought it was dishonest to cut benefits for Americans, who have been paying into the program all their lives through no choice of their own. “Well, let's all be reminded, 60 million Americans are on Social Security,” Huckabee noted. “A third of those people depend on 90 percent of their income fro Social Security.”Christe interjected that Huckabee was not being realistic about the program’s finances. “The lying and the stealing has already occurred,” Christie said. “The trust fund is filled with IOUs.” Huckabee rejected the notion, arguing that Social Security’s funding problem was due to the growth of unearned income that is not taxed for Social Security.""One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage,"" Huckabee said. ""The [number of] people who get wages is declining dramatically. Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and -- and capital gains.""He said his proposed flat national sales tax would capture more revenue from the wealthy for Social Security. Huckabee’s remarks will please Social Security advocates, who argue that rising income inequality -- including through growing unearned income -- has harmed Social Security’s finances.Christie, regardless of his policy proposals, will elicit their ire for echoing a long-debunked myth about the program: that the trust fund has been raided, and contains worthless IOUs. The trust fund is invested in U.S. Treasury bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.At the Republican debate for lower-polling candidates earlier in the evening, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) shared the story of how Social Security helped his sister when their parents died.

CORRECTION:  An earlier version of this story said Huckabee proposed taxing unearned income.

15,BUSINESS,"Steady Job Growth Is Still Not Boosting Workers' Pay, New Numbers Show",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steady-job-growth-not-boosting-workers-pay-july_us_55c4b422e4b0d9b743dbc027,Wages barely budged in July's jobs report -- but the Fed still seems poised to raise interest rates.,2015-08-07,"<p>Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has expressed optimism about the economy, signaling that the central bank may soon raise interest rates.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c4b7811400002e002e2427.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The July jobs report released Friday morning show the economy producing jobs at a steady pace. While the gains increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year, the lack of substantial wage growth confirms for some economists and activists that a rate hike is premature.The economy added 215,000 jobs in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported -- lower than the average of 246,000 per month in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.3 percent.The disproportionately high African American unemployment rate nonetheless declined to 9.1 percent, from 9.5 percent in June.Average hourly wages went up by 0.2 percent, bringing net wage growth over the past year to 2.1 percent -- only nominally higher than the rate of price inflation, which as of June was 1.8 percent for consumer goods (excluding energy and food).The solid, but not stellar, jobs numbers will likely be enough to convince the Federal Reserve that the job market is growing at a healthy enough rate to raise interest rates before the year’s end. Analysts are predicting a September rate hike based on the Fed’s optimistic July 29 statement, which noted “solid job gains and declining unemployment.”  July's job numbers are close enough to the average to keep the Fed on course, most economic observers say.But some -- mostly liberal -- economists and activists have long argued that we are still far from the employment levels needed to spur substantial wage growth across the earnings spectrum. A market that has more workers than jobs is especially harmful to African Americans and other marginalized groups, since they often face discrimination that makes it harder to find work, they note. Friday’s numbers did much to support their claims.Limited wage growth in July and a job creation rate that lags behind the growing population confirm that the Fed should wait for more progress before raising interest rates, said Elise Gould, a labor economist at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute. “This morning’s jobs report is clear evidence that the Fed should continue to hold the line, and let the economy continue to recover before raising rates prematurely,” Gould wrote in a statement.Justin Wolfers, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has been incredibly upbeat about recent jobs reports -- and remained thrilled with the July numbers -- also noted the lackluster wage growth.“There's no evidence anywhere - in average hourly earnings, or the employment cost index - of wage inflation,” Wolfers tweeted. “It's low and it's not rising.” Regardless of one's views on a rate hike, the Fed now has more than enough information to make a decision, argues The New York Times' Neil Irwin. ""The Fed seems to be gliding toward a rate increase quite soon,"" Irwin wrote. ""If it is wrong -- if rate increases are premature and inflation doesn’t return to the 2 percent the central bank targets, and workers never see the meaningful raises they’ve been awaiting -- then Fed officials will have only themselves to blame."""
