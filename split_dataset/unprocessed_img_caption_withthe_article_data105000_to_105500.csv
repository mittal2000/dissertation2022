Thousands of people celebrated the New Year with a 10 km run through the city. (Photo by Evren Atalay/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb66d4a250000940039a368.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When it comes to exercise, I've always been a kind of middle of the roader. When I was very young, I played ""at"" tennis, I swam, and I rode horses. As I became older, Jazzercise was the way of the world. I joined the club. Then came step aerobics. I bought my membership badge for that craze too. Being a middle of the roader, meant that I wasn't big into five to seven days a week of a hard pant and sweat routine. I was more of a ""this is supposed to be good for me and help me keep my weight down kind of gal.""I was more inclined to pop a tape into the VCR two or three days a week for 45 minutes at a clip and call it exercise. I'll even admit to owning a few Jane Fonda tapes, and..gasp...even a few Richard Simmons videos donned my storage shelf. But one day, while watching Richard and his gal pals and ""sweatin' to the oldies"" along with them, I noticed something. Richard was proud to display his overweight friends working out. He was proud to show the American public that overweight women could work out and lose weight. There was only one problem with this scenario: I was looking more and more like the women in the video, but my weight was going up, not down.I'd been trim all my life. I had two kids and proudly fit right back into my size eights after the birth of each one. Somehow, 20 years of life, and stress, sickness, and eating, found its way onto my five foot two inch frame. Although it certainly didn't happen overnight, it felt like I just blinked and there were a hundred extra pounds to be found inside my clothes. I went to work. It took me over two years. I'm not quite finished, but I've lost 85 pounds so far. I did it the middle of the road way -- the way I've always known. I began to eat more healthfully. I began to work out a bit more strenuously and a bit more frequently, and it's worked. I never really felt the need to leave my comfort zone of classic middle of the road warrior.I never felt the need until now. After 20 years of recurrent cancers, I found myself with yet two more cancer surgeries last July. I was done letting it define my stamina, at least with letting it define it 100 percent of the time. As it so happens, one of my kids, the one that was switched at birth in the hospital before we brought her home, is a marathon runner. She has a very successful blog about health and fitness. She does her long runs, yoga, P90X, and limits eating those bad white foods and red meats. Although she has a successful professional career, for a fun hobby, she's studying to become a personal trainer. In other words, she ain't no middle of the roader.One day, a few weeks ago, I took notice of an e-mail I received advertising a 5K Rocky Balboa run to occur starting at the Philadelphia Museum steps made famous by the Rocky movies. Being fairly new to the Philly scene, I thought this might be something fun I could do with my non-middle of the road daughter. A 5K, I thought, well that's only three miles. I knew I could easily walk three miles on any given day just sightseeing around Manhattan. This, I thought, I could do.So my expert daughter told me I needed to train for the race which is to occur on November 15th. She suggested I download an app to my iPhone called ""Couch to 5K (C25K)."" My thinking was that I'm certainly no couch potato, this should be easy. I christened the app ""Cancer to 5K"" instead.Thus I began my relationship with my new friend ""C2."" She had three workouts ready for me each week. The first week, she had me walk for five minutes for a warm up. Easy peezy. Then I had to run for one minute and walk for 90 seconds alternately for a total of 20 minutes, and finally a five-minute cool down walk. I learned a fascinating thing on that first one minute run: running is not easy. Running at the age of 54 felt nearly impossible. By the second one minute run, I wondered what I'd gotten myself into. I thought that perhaps C2 was right, I have been a couch potato all my life. The workout repeated itself on days two and three for a complete week one workout.Week two was comprised of moving the one minute runs up to three minute runs. I'm ashamed to admit it, but halfway through the first three-minute run, I found myself pulling my phone out to take a look at it. I was sure that somehow, I'd hit the pause button, and C2 didn't know I'd already completed three minutes of running. Can you imagine my dismay when she clearly displayed that I had two minutes more to go? And that was for only the first of the three-minute intervals. I persevered and made it through all three of these three-minute interval workouts to complete week two.Week three and four were similar. C2 had me increase running times and decrease walking times for each of the three work out days. At this point there are a few things that I've learned. One, is that there is a definite reason I never see a smile on the face of a person running. Two, is that it is clearly harder to run up hill than down, and three, C2 is not my best friend, but she is trying to have my best interests at heart by training me for the big day.But this week, week five of training, C2 became a double crosser! It all started out innocently enough. Day one of week five consisted of the usual five-minute walking warmup followed by intervals of five-minute runs and three-minute walks. Admittedly, the five-minute runs felt like 20-minute runs, but I do have to work my way up in run time if I'm going to get to the finish line on November 15th. So when day two of week five training came up this week, I was mentally prepared. I knew I had to do my 5/3 intervals to complete the workout. So when C2 announced that my five-minute warmup was complete and it was time to run, I was prepared. I paced myself. Wow did that five minutes feel like an incredibly long time. Again, I persevered. She sounded the alarm that it was again time to walk. Thank God! I walked my three minutes until she dinged again signaling to me that it was time to run. But at the end of the run, she announced that it was already cool down time. What? I was confused. Weren't we supposed to do a run five/walk three, three times? How could I be done? I was baffled. I had to wait until I got home and could put my glasses on to see the screen. Low and behold, for the first time in five weeks, C2 had switched things up. I no longer had the same work out all three days of each week. I didn't have the same 5/3 routine I'd had on day one of week five. Noooooo! C2 had me run two eight-minute intervals. I KNEW THOSE MINUTES FELT LONGER THAN FIVE!That C2. What a double crosser.Today, was day three of week five training. I'm a bit wiser now. I took a peek at what C2 had in store for me today before I took my glasses off for my run. Would you believe she made me run 20 minutes straight? The horror of it all!As I prepare for week six of training, I find that I've learned even more. I've learned that I'm going to finish what I started. I'm going to run this 5K. I've learned that I've been a middle of the roader my whole life for a good reason. And I've learned that not only do I know why you never see people smiling while running, not only is it still harder to run uphill than down, and not only is C2 definitely NOT my best friend, but C2 was a free download. I've learned ya get what ya pay for!This essay first published in BoomerCafe.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

Building an online business isn't easy, and there are some hard realities you need to realize CopyBlogger tells us.I know I'm not telling you anything new. Having said that, I LOVE the freedom an online business can provide. As you're reading this, I'm writing this article from a Starbucks that's one block away from the ocean in Maui, Hawaii.While I'm writing this, people are buying my books and other products on my website. I'm making money passively while enjoying the amazingness of Maui. If this is your dream, there are seven things you can do to get better results from your online business. 1. Stop copying other peoplePeople buy from someone they know, like, and trust. They don't buy from strangers. If you are the clone of someone else, they'll never get to know the real you. When they want to buy, they will buy from the person you are copying. Use frameworks that work, but don't be a clone. Let your voice come through, and build a business that's yours.2. Be clear about who you serveIf you try to reach the whole world, you'll end up reaching no one, because your efforts to reach customers will be scattered. You won't be able to help people where they are if you're not speaking to a specific target audience.The more specific you can get with your target audience, the easier time you'll have marketing, which is what ultimately grows your business. When you do, you will be focused with your strategy.3. Keep it simple Keep your website simple and clean. Even though Wordpress has a variety of options for widgets and plugins, you don't need ALL of them. When someone visits your website it shouldn't confuse them.When it comes to your business, keep it simple too. Build traffic to your website. Learn the biggest struggles your target audience is facing. Create products and services that help solve those problems. Rinse and repeat. Yes, it can be that simple.4. Don't rely too heavily on social mediaWhile you can't ignore social media, you can't make it your number one strategy for traffic and leads. New York Times best-selling author, Crystal Paine, clearly illustrated this. I also wrote about how social media marketing is overrated for the Huffington Post. The bottom line is you want to build your business on your platform, not someone else's. You want people to sign up to your email list, and interact with you personally, not just on social media. 5. Focus on what's important to where you areThere's a wealth of information you can learn online. Most of these things aren't important to where you are in the process. If you're building, you probably shouldn't be learning about SEO.If you guest post, and build your audience in other ways, the SEO will naturally come, so your time is better spent writing guest posts. Sit down, and evaluate where you're at in your journey, and stick to what will help you where you are. Don't fall victim to information overload because it can easily keep you from making progress. Speed of implementation is what makes you successful in business.6. Don't be afraid to charge a fair price It would be great to help as many people as possible for free, but you have a family and bills to pay. If you create something that adds value and helps people, you should charge a fair price for it. Remember, you're building a business; it can't be a business if it doesn't make money.There are people online that should be ashamed at what they're doing and charging, but you'll find that in any industry. As long as you focus on serving and adding value to people's lives, your prices will be justified.7. Keep pushing forwardAt the end of the day, if you want this to work, you have to determine right now that you'll keep going no matter what. Perseverance is what makes your business grow. Even if you haven't made the process you wanted to make at this point, you can't give up. Build this business one relationship, and one sell at a time. Have patience. This takes time to build. With focused effort you can build a powerful online business. Use these seven things to optimize your building efforts. Have patience, and build something that helps your target audience. Focus and you will do this. Which one of these do you need to work on?This articles originally appeared on KimanziConstable.com"

For some, including myself, he is simply one of the most imaginative and gifted writers at work today. For others, and again I include myself in this list, he is a pan-African cultural hero, an almost folkloric figure with the capacity to not only constantly surprise his readers, but also inspire collective forward motion. This is no small feat. Binyavanga Wainaina deploys language like small bombs wrapped in exquisite paper. When he published his landmark satirical essay on how (not) to write about Africa, it felt nothing short of a revolutionary act in a literary landscape where so many Western writers and readers felt compelled to view and present Africa as a 'dark continent' devoid of creative thinkers and overflowing with disease and chaotic, inexplicable violence. Wainaina has always waged war against cliché, and in doing so has inspired a generation of emerging African writers like myself to create beyond borders policed both by self and others.When Wainaina came out as a proud gay man earlier this year, he once again pulverized cultural stereotypes in a graceful, elegant way that made headlines around the world. In person, Wainaina carries himself with confidence, humility and a sense of cheeky joie de vivre. I first met Wainaina in the summer of 2012, at a pub in Notting Hill, London, and over the course of several hours we drank, ate, smoked, talked and laughed. Wainaina is a connoisseur of crisp bon mots and we cracked jokes about everything. Separated by geography, we didn't see each other again for another two years until a few weeks ago when he was back in London, where I live, for work purposes. During his brief time in the city we decided to do a video interview, which would be filmed by my close friend, the Iranian director and photographer, Bahareh Hosseini. On an unusually warm October weekend we all convened in a small film studio in Clapham, South London. Wainaina, who was exhausted from his other work engagements, was a wonderful sport, and we drank, ate and talked for hours in front of the camera. The resulting short film is a portrait of two gay African writers being as honest and vulnerable as the camera allowed.After we wrapped up the shoot and Wainaina left the studio, my lasting impression of him was someone incredibly kind-hearted and fun. And this is really the image we wanted to capture. Binyavanga Wainaina may be a cultural phenomenon but he sees the world through a playful lens -- albeit one spiked with a rigorous moral and intellectual power.I hope you enjoy our filmed conversation below and witness the generosity of spirit that makes this man so special.

6,MEDIA,Dear FCC: Net Neutrality Is Part of a Social Contract,"Victor Pickard, ContributorAssociate Professor, University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Sc...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dear-fcc-net-neutrality-i_b_6140750.html,The Internet is no longer a luxury for those who can pay or a profitable plaything for a handful of corporations. It is a daily necessity. It is much too precious to be left to the mercies of Internet monopolies. It must be protected by an FCC that governs not only in the public's name but also with its consent.,2014-11-12,"Timothy Karr of the Free Press holds a sign in support of net-neutrality before a hearing at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, Dec. 21, 2010. U.S. regulators banned Internet service providers led by AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. from blocking or slowing Web content sent to homes and businesses, while allowing mobile phone companies to put limits on traffic. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c0f3210000d601c86fab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With his ringing endorsement for strong net neutrality protections, President Obama has joined a public groundswell for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reclassify the Internet as a utility. This move would not only enable the agency to remain true to its mandate to regulate in the public interest, it would also, according to the President and many of the nearly 4 million Americans who filed comments with the FCC, promote democratic values of openness, fairness and freedom.Such overwhelming public support for what may seem like a wonky regulatory debate reminds us that net neutrality is and always has been much more than a technocratic squabble over how Internet ""pipes"" are managed. It's about the role of media and information in a democratic society, and the role of government -- in this case the FCC -- to help ensure access to information because, as we all learn in school, democracy requires an informed populace. Put simply, this is about a social contract between information providers, society and government. This contract must include a clear regulatory role for the FCC. Since the market won't automatically provide public goods like information, and since unregulated monopolies can threaten the health of our media system, government oversight is required. Without such authority, the FCC (which celebrated its 80th birthday this year) risks significant constraints and complications going forward. What will be the agency's purpose for the next 80 years, or even the next five? How will the FCC defend the public interest in the digital age -- an age of new digital monopolies? Weak net neutrality regulations risk not only irrelevance for the FCC, but also a loss of legitimacy in the eyes of the public in whose name it regulates.We've been down this road before. In the 1930s and '40s, commercial radio was roughly the same age as today's commercial Internet. It was seen as a revolutionary force that would democratize society, give voice to the voiceless, and educate the masses. And there was a great debate in this country about how that medium should operate: whose interests it should serve, who should own and control it, whether it should remain predominantly commercial or be publicly subsidized with significant obligations to public affairs and educational content. Once it became clear that a few corporations would dominate radio, the debate turned to specific regulatory questions: If we give broadcasters tremendous benefits -- like monopolistic use of the public airwaves -- what do they owe society in return? Are they obligated to share this scarce resource to include diverse voices? Is broadcast media primarily an instrument for democracy or for profit? As the medium became increasingly commercialized and ownership more concentrated, regulatory authority became tenuous. Despite admirable attempts to keep broadcasters beholden to the public interest, the FCC fell back on relatively weak regulatory guidelines, like the Fairness Doctrine, and ultimately lost the battle to salvage much of commercial radio and television's democratic potential.Today we face a similar quandary with the Internet. We're again deciding what information providers are allowed to do with the content that flows through their conduits. Again, we are deciding the future of a key information infrastructure that has a profound impact on our daily lives. And it is, once again, an infrastructure dominated by monopolies. Will we repeat the mistakes of the past and let monopoly power over infrastructure shape the type of content available to the public? Or will we empower the public by safeguarding an open Internet? Given the technological and economic changes in our communication systems, these questions are especially pressing, and decisions made now may set the Internet's course for decades to come. But without reclassifying the Internet as a telecommunications service, as the President argues, the FCC will not have the authority to maintain an open Internet. Word has leaked that the FCC is considering a ""hybrid"" plan that would still allow preferential treatment of content with Internet fast and slow lanes -- exactly what the President identified as detrimental to the Internet's democratic potential -- and would likely be overturned in court. Like we saw with broadcast media in the 1940s, a weak decision by the FCC today that allows internet service providers to become gatekeepers might lead us down a slippery slope of unaccountable information providers and ineffectual regulators.Net neutrality cannot solve all of the problems facing the Internet -- especially lack of competition in the American Internet service marketplace, both from other commercial operators and from alternative models like municipal-owned broadband networks. But without strong protections that ensure all Internet content is treated equally, we may end up with a powerless FCC, few checks on Internet access monopolies who abuse their market power, and a public ill-served by its information system. The Internet is no longer a luxury for those who can pay or a profitable plaything for a handful of corporations. It is a daily necessity; Americans rely on it not just for entertainment, but also for schoolwork, health and their livelihood. It is much too precious to be left to the mercies of Internet monopolies. It must be protected by an FCC that governs not only in the public's name but also with its consent."

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dccc260000350083bcc5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's a time-honored tradition.After months of covering the midterm elections through a prism of polls and tactics, pundits will shift their focus to the defeated party's so-called season of ""soul-searching.""As a Democrat, I'm disappointed in last Tuesday's results. But as a progressive, I know my party need not search for its soul -- but rather, its backbone.The truth is that the Democratic Party has core values that are very much in sync with most Americans. We believe in taking dead aim at the income inequality that infects our communities -- from big cities like New York, to small towns and rural areas across the United States. We believe that the wealthy should pay their fair share so we can lift people out of poverty and grow our middle class. And we believe in rules that prevent big corporations and Wall Street banks from unraveling workers' pensions, suppressing employees' wages and benefits, and rigging the system to reward wealth instead of work.This year, too many Democratic candidates lost sight of those core principles -- opting instead to clip their progressive wings in deference to a conventional wisdom that says bold ideas aren't politically practical.To working people, it showed Democratic weakness -- a weak commitment to the change desperately sought by struggling families, and a weak alternative to a Republican philosophy that has held America back.Bold, progressive ideas win elections. Just ask Senator Al Franken, who has fought fearlessly to rein in Wall Street, and won by a larger margin on Tuesday than President Obama did in Minnesota in 2012. Or Senator Jeff Merkley, who never backed away from his support for Obamacare -- a federal program that is already working to reduce income inequality, and promises to do more to address the inequality crisis than anything out of Washington in generations. Merkley won re-election in Oregon by six points more than Obama won that state in 2012.Then there's Governor Jerry Brown, who cruised to re-election after championing -- and winning -- a millionaire's tax that dedicated funding to California's public schools. And don't forget Governor Dan Malloy -- who was written off by so many in his re-election bid in Connecticut. Malloy raised taxes so he could invest more in education each year (at a time when other Governors were slashing education to close yawning budget gaps). Malloy passed earned sick time and a minimum wage hike. And in his re-election bid, he proudly stood alongside President Obama. Malloy not only lived to tell about it on Tuesday, he increased his margin of victory in a rematch with his 2010 Republican opponent.Critics will point to competitive Senate races in Kentucky, Arkansas, and North Carolina as places where such progressive policies would all but ensure Democrats' defeat. Our question is: how would they know?In those states, Democratic candidates didn't say much about progressive taxation, expanding health and retirement benefits, or implementing anti-poverty efforts like universal pre-k or affordable housing.In Kentucky, more than 413,000 residents have signed up for Obamacare -- making it one of the program's most notable success stories. Arkansas had the nation's fourth highest poverty rate last year, at 19.7%. In North Carolina -- nearly 60% of three-and-four-year olds are not enrolled in pre-k. What were the Democratic candidates offering voters there?We saw photo-ops with candidates firing their rifles of choice; witnessed rhetorical gymnastics about how different they were from Obama; and watched televised debates dominated by empty attacks on the Koch Brothers' influence on campaigns, rather than policies requiring billionaires like the Kochs to pay their fair share in taxes to fund programs benefiting working people.I'm not blaming the individual candidates here. The strategies they employed are largely the making of Washington insiders who force-feed message points on candidates under threat of being written off by their national party infrastructure. But we've tried it the Washington way time and time again -- and seen the result. It's time for a bold, new approach -- with campaign messages that are rooted in local concerns and core party principles; ideas that are morally just, intellectually honest, and sound public policy. In other words, a campaign plan that gives voters some credit, and has a real chance of success at the polls.Acknowledging the need to address income inequality helps win elections. Want proof? Look at the Republicans. In several contests where the GOP prevailed last Tuesday, candidates spoke directly to voters' concerns on issues like poverty, wage equality, and underemployment. And tackling inequality is not only good politics; it's good government. In New York, progressive Democrats joined me in passing universal pre-k and an expansion of after-school programs. We are pursuing bold plans for building affordable housing. And we've taken decisive action to offer more people paid sick leave and living wages. In Washington, Senator Elizabeth Warren and progressive Democrats have fought to better regulate the complex financial instruments at the heart of the 2008 fiscal meltdown, and have battled the big banks to allow students to refinance their college loans at current lower rates. And the fight against inequality isn't limited to blue states. Right now, there's a fierce battle being waged on behalf of pre-k in dark-red Indiana. In Kentucky, Governor Beshear maintains wide support and popularity after publicly championing the benefits of Obamacare to the state. Last week, voters in Arkansas, Alaska, Nebraska, and South Dakota approved ballot measures to increase the minimum wage.So where do Democrats go from here? The 2016 presidential election is two years off, but will have a huge impact on the lives of America's middle-class and poor. Democrats simply cannot rely on shifting demographics and a badly damaged Republican brand to hold the White House and help countless Americans who are struggling. We must demonstrate, from coast to coast, that we are a party dedicated to lifting people out of poverty; one committed to building a bigger and more durable middle-class; one that is unafraid to ask a little more from those at the very top -- the wealthy individuals and big corporations who have not only rebounded from the depths of the Great Recession, but who've accumulated record new wealth.This is a blueprint to revitalize the Democratic Party; to reenergize the everyday people whom we have always championed and stand up tall -- with a backbone of steel -- in what is sure to be a hard-fought contest for the direction our nation in 2016 and beyond."
8,BLACK VOICES,Michael Brown's Parents Testify At U.N.: 'We Need The World To Know',Lilly Workneh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-brown-parents-un_n_6141756.html,,2014-11-12,"The parents of Michael Brown, Lesley McSpadden, left, and Michael Brown, Sr., right, sit for an interview with The Associated Press in Washington, Saturday, Sept. 27, 2014. Michael Brown's parents say they are unmoved by the Ferguson police chief's apology in their son's shooting death by a police officer. Instead, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr. told The Associated Press they would rather see an arrest, and Brown Sr. said he wants the police officer ""in handcuffs."" (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae00e7240000310054cff6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The parents of Michael Brown addressed members of the United Nations on Tuesday on a mission to bring further international awareness to the shooting death of their unarmed 18-year-old son by Ferguson, Mo. police officer Darren Wilson. Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr. traveled to Geneva, Switzerland as part of a delegation of human rights advocates and spoke before a U.N. Committee against Torture. They made a statement against police brutality and voiced their concerns over the latest ongoing events in Ferguson. ""We need the world to know what's going on in Ferguson and we need justice,"" McSpadden told CNN. “We need answers and we need action. And we have to bring it to the U.N. so they can expose it to the rest of the world, what's going on in small town Ferguson.” Family and community members are bracing for the decision of a grand jury that will determine whether Wilson, 28, will be indicted on charges for the death of Brown. The results of their deliberations are expected to be announced this week. However, Brown’s parents say Wilson got away with murder and called for his immediate arrest in their testimony before members of the committee. But while local residents are stocking up on guns and ammunition in anticipation of any potential protests, McSpadden made a plea for peace asking residents and community members to pause, plan and prepare in response to the grand jury decision. “We don’t want anyone acting irrational or acting before thinking,” McFadden said. “Because it wouldn’t be serving us any purpose, it wouldn’t be doing us any good. We’re trying to get a message across.” Brown’s parents relayed this message to members of the U.N. committee and urged them to bring an end to racially-biased policing tactics and the practice of racial-profiling by officers in Ferguson. Along with these recommendations, Brown and McSpadden requested a nationwide investigation examining “systematic police brutality and harassment in black and brown communities, and youth in particular. Methodology and findings of this investigation must be made publicly available,"" they said according to CNN.Brown’s death is one of the latest incidents in a string of shootings of unarmed black teenagers and his parents are not the only ones who have shared their loss before the U.N. The parents of Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis, two slain unarmed 17-year-old boys from Florida, also shared their concerns on race and discrimination at a convention earlier this year in Switzerland. They testified before the U.N.’s Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which strives to uphold human and civil rights standards around the world. “I ... wanted the committee to know that [Trayvon] was killed by a person [who] is of non-African-American descent and that the person was 28 years old so that they can understand that this was a 17-year-old child, by U.S. standards, against a 28-year-old adult male, and that Trayvon was considered a threat only because of the color of his skin,” Sybrina Fulton told the committee in August, discussing the death of her son who was killed by former neighborhood watch guard George Zimmerman. Fulton’s testimony to the U.N. was supported by Ron Davis, the father of Jordan Davis -- a black teenager from Florida who was shot to death in an altercation over loud music. The shooter, Michael Dunn, a white 47-year-old software engineer, was eventually found guilty and charged with three counts of second-degree attempted murder. “My son, 17-year-old Jordan Davis... was killed at a gas station in Jacksonville, Florida, for no other reason other than the color of his skin and also that he was playing loud music,” Davis said.Meanwhile, McFadden and Brown Sr. join the parents of Martin and Davis in battling the loss of their relatives while remaining strong in their mission to fight for justice. ""It's a situation where I'm surprised we haven't even lost our mind yet over this,” Brown’s father told CNN. “But we're being strong. Hopefully, justice will prevail.""CORRECTION: Due to a typographical error, an earlier version of this article initially located Ferguson in Mississippi, rather than Missouri. "

Their intentions may be admirable, but their tactics are probably ineffective. Loud voices do not always get heard. Especially in Sierra Leone, where a vein of suspicion runs deep, a legacy of grinding poverty and a brutal civil war ignited by blood diamonds. Rumors swirl here as the epidemic grows -- villagers whisper of a government plot, of children snatched away at night by men in white suits, of bodies that vanish. Meanwhile, the international media paints a picture of hapless African victims, ignorant of infectious disease pathways and unwilling to take commonsense public health measures. Trust on all sides erodes. We need to do things differently in order to blockade the virus. Eight years ago, I came to the Kono District of Sierra Leone as a documentary filmmaker following the journey of a diamond from the earth to the consumer. In a sense, I have never left. In the rural village where I was filming, more than 400 students were braving torrential rains in a roofless school to learn. We raised $6,000 and put a roof and cement floor on the dilapidated building, repaired toilets, and added new benches and iron doors that lock. When the locals finally stopped celebrating that achievement, we launched Shine on Sierra Leone to do much more. Our mission is to create sustainable programs that promote thriving, self-sufficient communities. By many measures, Sierra Leone is a troubled land. Diamond miners are paid $1.33 and a cup of rice for their daily labors and life expectancy at birth is 45 years. But cold statistics do not take a full measure. This is a land of defiant optimism in the face of brutal experience. The music is joyful, the villagers always ready to dance. From the horror of recent history has emerged a people of tremendous warmth, and a younger generation that believes in a brighter future. At Shine on Sierra Leone, we push them to be architects of their own design. We do not do for the people of the region, we do with them, as a partnership, not a charity. With our training, local residents have mastered the earthbag technique, filling empty rice bags with a plaster of cement, clay and sand to produce a cheap, disaster-proof building block. We've trained over 12,000 individuals to become computer literate. We offer microloans of up to $1,000 apiece, and have a repayment rate that never falls below 97 percent. We expect success, and we get it. Cut to Ebola. When those bullhorn-outfitted vehicles arrive, the villagers respond as anyone might who has known trauma at the hands of strangers -- they flee into the bush. When the government mandated a three-day lockdown to find hidden disease, it overlooked the daily food and water needs of people without a storehouse of provisions. Who can blame residents for wondering where true danger lies? Local leaders in the Kono District started calling us, and asking, ""What are we supposed to believe? What is going on?"" Shine on Sierra Leone has begun to engage vigorously with the community to combat the epidemic. Lockdowns can be an effective containment tool, but they have to be accompanied by deep dialogue and adequate supplies. In a society that loves to touch, messages about how to stay safe, tend ailing family members, and bury the dead in defiance of longstanding tradition must be delivered by messengers who understand the culture and whose knock at the door is welcome.Shine on Sierra Leone is now partnering with Wellbody Alliance, a grassroots organization providing the only comprehensive health care in the region. Together, we are training community health workers, distributing risk-reduction kits and low-literacy educational materials, and assembling protective gear (gloves, gowns, face masks, waste bags, etc.) and basic supplies (thermometers, chlorine, water filters). We have developed a protocol that includes house-by-house fever checks, supportive observation of those with a high temperature, and an isolation and treatment plan for individuals with active infection. Equally important, it includes personal attention, door-to-door deep dialogue, and a measure of love, healing ingredients absent in hospital wards that lack capacity to provide such critical ""extras."" We are alone in this effort. The government claims the district has no Ebola infections, although we have seen dozens of them, and many deaths. The absence of basic surveillance is just one mark of Sierra Leone's feeble health care infrastructure. It was shocking for us to realize that no one is coming to our rescue -- not the national government and not the large NGOs. There is no coordinated international effort on our ground.That's the reality, and we're stepping up. We've got the person power, the passion, and the community ties to turn back the Ebola terror in Kono. Learn more HERE.Thank you for your support, shine on. "

Republicans roared back in the midterm elections on Tuesday, capturing control of the Senate from Democrats, winning crucial governor races and solidifying their majority in the U.S. House. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dcce25000094003a563d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I woke up the Wednesday morning after the midterm elections feeling like the guy who had slept through a tornado, was now surveying the damage, and hearing third-hand what had happened. It's not as if, Tuesday night, I hadn't been refreshing Facebook incessantly while simultaneously glued to the three or four channels I was flipping between. I watched the results and they weren't unexpected. I fully expected the GOP to take the Senate and for the Democrats to stay home in record numbers and let it happen. After all, there wasn't much to vote for.In an uncharacteristically positive tone I opined last week that should the GOP inevitably take both houses, they would be saddled with the unenviable task of actually having to do something for the next two years. After nearly six years of accomplishing little more than obstruction, they would actually have to legislate and govern. The roles would be reversed and they would have to go, hat in hand, to President Obama in order to prove to the voters that they could actually get some bills through Congress that Obama would sign.Sure, the GOP would win this round but they would show voters that not only were they incapable of passing legislation, they would also prove to us that it was going to be more of the same. I also got some sick pleasure imagining what a blood bath the civil war within the GOP would look like. You thought The Game of Thrones' Red Wedding episode was bad? This was going to be a feeding frenzy. The next two years were going to be comedic gold and low-hanging fruit. The complete cluster eff that was to come would lock things up for Democrats in 2016.Typically and historically the Democrats don't show up during the midterms. They've always had a bad habit of making a poor showing, but this election was pretty important and from what I was seeing on social media and in my circles, it looked like it was going to be bad, just not this bad.The GOP swept the country. It took control of the Senate and added at least nine more seats to the House, giving it close to 245 seats -- the largest Republican majority since the Truman administration. Republicans will inhabit 65 percent of the governors mansions and they took control of 70 percent of the state legislatures.Some of the people elected to these positions make Michele Bachmann and Louie Gohmert look like MENSA members. Jody Hice (Georgia), who was elected to the House, blamed the Sandy Hook shooting on ""kicking God out of our schools,"" compared abortion to Hitler's murder of 6 million Jews, and thinks that Muslims don't deserve First Amendment protection. Joni Ernst (Iowa), who Chris Matthews has repeatedly referred to as ""The Hog Castrator"" due to an ad she ran in which she bragged about having castrated hogs for a living, has endorsed the impeachment of President Obama and slammed Medicaid recipients for not taking personal responsibility for their health. She also denies climate change and says she'd defend herself with her ""beautiful little Smith & Wesson,"" from the government. Tom Tillis from North Carolina won in a close race but still managed to be elected to the Senate by wanting to abolish the minimum wage. He is a climate change denier and suggested that liberals plotted to use climate science ""as a Trojan horse for their energy policy."" Tillis also opposed a resolution apologizing for an 1898 massacre of African Americans in a North Carolina city, explaining that the amendment didn't sufficiently honor white Republicans.On a local level voters elected a white supremacist in Maryland, a guy in Michigan who called anti-bullying measures a ""Trojan horse of homosexual activists,"" and this guy who calls himself ""Dr. Chaps."" He wrote a book about how President Obama is possessed by demons and once performed an exorcism of Obama. Dr. Chaps also thinks that homosexuals may sexually abuse their own children. Those are just a few examples of who Americans elected to lead -- at least the ones who showed up and bothered to vote. Politico's Alex Isenstadt wrote a good piece about the onslaught of wingnuts coming to Congress, appropriately titled, ""Animal House.""The Republican message this election, at least according to the ads, was that Ebola and ISIS are about to cross our border and Obama hasn't done a thing in six years. As for the message from the Democrats? They ran on three distinct issues: We're not the GOP or Obama; we're not really sure what we've accomplished in the last six years; and Barrack who? Alison Lundergan Grimes, who ran against McConnell in Kentucky, stopped short of denying Obama's existence -- she got fewer votes than the president did in her own state.Over the course of the last six years, while Democrats were able to get stuff done, we've seen 63 straight months of economic expansion, a depression averted, a deficit reduced by two-thirds, a health care law that's working and lowering costs, two women on the Supreme Court, Osama bin Laden dead, the stock market at record heights, the unemployment rate reduced from 10.2 percent to 5.9 percent, and gas prices are down. The Democrats, rather than point any of that out, decidedly went with, ""I'm not a wingnut. Don't vote for wingnuts.""And that's just past accomplishments.In ballot questions and polling across the country, people showed support for progressive ideas: marijuana legalization, equal pay for women, raises in the minimum wage, paid sick leave, gun control and reproductive rights. Yet, Democrats avoided those issues as if they were some sort of flesh-eating bacteria. So when it came to voting in the legislators that would purportedly carry out the apparent will of the people, the people made some incredibly idiotic decisions -- they voted for the party who opposes all of these ideas.Jon Stewart sums it up in this clip, in which he refers to the Democrats, appropriately, as chicken shit:Howard Dean, former DNC chair, also weighed in on Meet the Press, saying:The Republican message was 'We're not Obama,' no substance whatsoever. What was the Democrats' message? 'Oh, we're not either.' You cannot win if you are afraid! Where was the Democratic party? You gotta stand for something if you're gonna win!This same attitude permeates Facebook pages and groups with names like, Liberals are Us, I am Liberal, and Liberals Unite, among others. Tens of thousands of members and fans sharing and reposting articles, images, videos, and memes showing how crazy the right is. Little more than hapless Facebook users who seem to think reposting something constitutes civic involvement, pleading with everyone to not vote the crazies in. There's no policy to speak of, no candidate endorsed, no movement to get behind, just example after example of, ""Look what that crazy rightwing lunatic said today.""Carl Gibson wrote ""Open Letter to Democrats from a Disillusioned Young Voter,"" published on Reader Supported News last week, which is a good, though perhaps unintentional response to Democrats wanting to blame the loss on a poor turnout by younger voters -- 12 percent of this election.Gibson writes:The few of us who did show up to vote largely did it to support state ballot initiatives that actually mattered in our daily lives. We still voted to raise the minimum wage in 4 states to a slightly more respectable amount, and to $15 an hour in San Francisco. We voted for a week of paid sick days in Massachusetts, and for marijuana legalization in three more states (okay, well, DC isn't a state yet, but it definitely will be by the time we're grandparents). We voted to turn nonviolent drug offenses from felonies into misdemeanors in California. We even boosted high voter turnout in Michigan for Gary Peters, a Democrat who made climate change -- something we'll have to confront long after the boomers are gone -- his top issue. We just didn't vote for Democrats who haven't done anything for us since we voted for them in 2012, and who brazenly took our votes for granted this year.He goes on to point out that the GOP actually had a message, that the Republican platform comes in easy-to-remember, tweet-sized sentences and even alludes to the fact that most people really don't pay attention to what actually goes on in Congress. ""We all know their buzzwords -- 'national security,' 'family values,' 'free markets.' That may translate to endless war, homophobia, and corporate feudalism for the better-informed, but for most people, those are catch phrases they can get behind,"" Gibson writes. He then offers some of his own to get the Democrats started, suggesting, ""affordable education,"" ""good jobs,"" and ""healthy families,"" referring to Elizabeth Warren's 0.75 percent interest rate for student loans, single-payer health care, or a public health insurance option.Gibson, who is 26 years old and more socially and politically active than most, received his fair share of attacks from liberals finally and uncharacteristically showing some sort of outrage and anger, if only from the comfort of their home and hiding behind screen names. ""I am sick to death of your kind of shallow, selfish, short-sighted, ignorant extortion. What's in it for you, spoiled little boy,"" one commenter wrote.One angry liberal even took the time out of their day to post a blog, ""Responding To The Shallow Open Letter To Democrats From A Disillusioned Voter"" publicly chastising Gibson. In typical fashion, it offered no real response, no solution, no reason for young people, or anyone to vote for a democratic candidate. It was posted on a site called Liberal America, and written by someone, unlike Gibson, who chose not to give their real name but instead hid behind the name ""Anomaly."" As with comments on articles, it's difficult to take anyone seriously who doesn't have the stones to tell us who they really are.It's a bit naïve and self-serving for people like ""Anomaly"" to expect anyone to not vote in their own best interest. It's bordering on stupidity to expect people to vote simply because the other candidate is nuts. Gibson wrote a well-thought-out piece and even suggested some issues that would compel young voters to show up at the polls. Rather than accept this, commenters and ""Anomaly"" chose to alienate young voters even more with self-righteous and condescending garbage. A large majority of voters are behind the ideas that Elizabeth Warren (MA-D) and Bernie Sanders (VT-I) are presenting. The very few candidates who stood behind progressive ideas and ran on them won. Al Franken won in Minnesota and Gary Peters, running in Michigan, leaned hard into liberalism and in a landslide victory claimed his seat in the Senate. Peters, unlike his colleagues, didn't shy away from talking about the accomplishments of the last six years. He didn't apologize or pretend that Obama didn't exist. He aptly pointed out that his party helped save the auto industry along with millions of jobs and the voters thanked him for it.As for the candidates who didn't run on the accomplishments of the past six years, they allow the GOP the opportunity to take credit for all of it and take advantage of an electorate that has the attention span of a gnat.The day after the election, The Daily Show ran this clip, in which commentator and Senior Political Analyst Jordan Klepper shows the GOP taking credit for it all:Last night at approximately 11:27 Eastern Time, Republicans gained control of the US Senate and the results were almost immediate,"" said Jordan Klepper. ""The economy now growing at a robust 3.5 percent. Gas this morning, under three bucks a gallon. Stock Market at record levels. Deficits cut in half. Ten million more Americans have health insurance. And unemployment sub six percent for the first time since we elected chairman Obama.Klepper goes on to say, ""If Democrats had accomplished all of that, they would have been out there bragging about it for months."" It's a brilliant clip and worth watching in its entirety.Yes, the GOP won big this round and there will be a lot to watch these next two years. The American people are fickle, for the most part ill-informed, and have short memories. Every couple of years these same ill-informed voters, who are unhappy with the way things are going, will vote the current bums out and whoever is in control will be at risk. Franklin D. Roosevelt once said, ""Democracy cannot succeed unless those who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely. The real safeguard of a democracy, therefore, is education.""It's up to either party to educate the public with regards to their respective platforms, courses of action, and vision of the future. And if they don't give us something to vote for, can they really expect us to keep voting against something else? Read more at nowitcounts.com"

Photo by Kyla Hemmelgarn.Let's talk about Camille Sullivan. This was a close one - just as I was going to print, a batch of Camille's new photos arrived in my mailbox. Yes! Oops. I went off on a tangent. How so not me.Having had roles in well known productions such as Rookie Blue, The Killing and Hellcats, this Canadian actress is a wild card, yet at the same time, she seems to have her life under control.You've earned numerous awards and nominations. What was your very first award win and for what?The first award I won was a Leo Award for the movie Normal. I was shocked, really and truly shocked and so consequently, as I had nothing prepared, I made a terrible acceptance speech. I cursed more than once and made an inappropriate joke about threesomes. Thankfully once they've given you the award, they can't take it back ;)Your film The Birdwatcher is premiering in 2015. Describe your audition for this film and how you prepared for your role.I had read the script before going in to my audition for The Birdwatcher. I had read it and cried profusely. It was beautiful. I also knew going in that Gabrielle Rose would be playing my birth mother and she's fantastic, so I wanted the part pretty badly. I did some research on adoption and on terminal cancer and prepared the scenes loosely so I could experiment with them a bit and see what came out naturally. I had two other auditions that day so I wore something comfortable that would work for all three. Then I did what I always do before auditions, I took a deep breath and hoped for the best, luckily, on that day, it worked.What type of meditation do you do? How did you become involved with meditation? What do you get out of it? What advice do you have for people who want to start meditating but who never have?I do a simple mindfulness mediation every day, or I try to, for twenty minutes to a half an hour. I started about ten years ago because I used to suffer from panic attacks. Once I started meditating regularly, the panic attacks stopped completely. It was amazing. I also noticed that I became calmer and more centered in my daily life which I desperately needed. I am not calm by nature and the meditation gets me just about kissing normal ;) For anyone who would like to try it, it is as simple as sitting down in a quiet place and observing your natural breath. Your mind will wander, just gently guide it back to the breath. It is a practice and the more regularly you do it, the more results you will notice.Why do a lot of your pictures have you NOT looking at the camera?I hadn't noticed that a lot of my pictures have me looking away from camera. I suppose the question is, why do I choose pictures that have me looking away? I guess it's probably shyness and maybe I like the side angle on my face a little better.If you were walking on the sidewalk and in front of you there was an open ladder on the right and a black cat on the left, what would you do to continue your journey?I would stop, call the cat over and pet it until it moved around to right and then I would pass on the left. If the cat did not approach me, I would take my chances with the cat. I never walk under a ladder, that's just crazy.What's your exercise and food routine?Right now I do a combination of running and yoga about four times a week. I have never really liked the gym, so running outside and doing yoga at home works for me. I think the trick is finding something you can maintain. As far as my diet, I just try to eat whole grains, fruit and vegetables, all the usuals. I did give up fast food and pop (soda) completely though. The only thing I really miss is the In-N-Out-Burger.You knew you wanted to act from a young age. Share the story.When I went to the University of British Columbia I knew I wanted to be an actor, I just hadn't fully admitted it yet. I was afraid I wasn't good enough and I didn't have a lot of experience but I decided to audition for the theatre program anyway. I wasn't sure I would get in. I wasn't even sure about pursuing acting at all, so I came up with a back up plan. If I didn't get in to the theatre program I would quit school and move to Paris. End of plan. Luckily, I got in. I like to think I deliberately left myself no other options so that I wouldn't chicken out. I still don't have a back up and I still pray I won't need one.Your film Ally Was Screaming just premiered at the Calgary International Film Festival. Did you attend?The Calgary Film Festival was kind enough to bring me to Calgary as a guest of the Festival so I could attend the premiere of Ally Was Screaming. It was a packed house and the movie got a great reception. It turned out amazingly well and I am really proud of it. We shot the movie in Calgary so it was nice to catch up with some of the other actors and crew, as well as our director and producers.You recently wrote a screenplay. What steps are you taking to see it blossom onto the screen? I had not written in a long time. I wrote a play in high-school that was banned and I took some creative writing courses in university but I had let it slip by the wayside. Until one day, I had what I thought was a pretty good idea so I started writing again. I originally wrote my screenplay as a television pilot but when a director friend of mine voiced his interest in making it as a movie, I thought, why not. So now I am in rewriting hell but hopefully I will be able to make it into a proper movie script yet. The next step will be to get a producer on board and then drum up some cash.Being from Canada, what's your fascination with American politics?When I was about 12 or 13, my sister dated this guy who would watch coverage of the American presidential race at our house and for whatever reason I just loved it. It is a vicious and often hilarious, no holds barred knock out battle. I just can't look away. I also love Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert and they kill it during election time.Tell us a story from your childhood where someone or some thing made you cry.When I was kid, we took in a stray cat that kept showing up in our yard. My sister and I named him Shirley Feeney, after Laverne & Shirley. We had the cat for a few years, although I suspect he may have been eating at a number of homes in our neighborhood, but then one day he never came back. I remember crying on the back steps, desolate, eating Meow Mix out of the box because what else were we gonna do with it now...I'd like to give a shout out to Pete Fry For City Council! My good friend Pete is running for city council in Vancouver for the Green Party. (Election day November 15, 2014) He is a smart, dedicated, honest man and he would be a great addition to our city council. Check him out."

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dcce260000300183bcc7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The New York City Police Department is on pace to stop, question, and/or frisk about 50,000 New Yorkers this year, NYPD Commissioner William Bratton said Monday, which represents a significant drop from last year. ""This year, as of today, we’ve done about 45,000, so we’ll probably end the year with about 50,000,” Bratton told The New Yorker’s Jeffrey Toobin at the American Justice Summit at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, according to Capital New York. “It'll be down about 75 percent from what it was last year.” In 2013, there were just over 190,000 police stops, and that itself was a precipitous drop from the nearly 700,000 police stops that occurred in 2011, when the NYPD's use of the practice peaked. Police stops surged during Michael Bloomberg's three terms as mayor, which lasted from 2001 to 2013. Bloomberg and Ray Kelly, who preceded Bratton as NYPD commissioner, argued that the aggressive use of the tactic was important to reducing gun violence, while critics charged that it unfairly targeted minorities. In 2011, 87 percent of those stopped by police were black or Latino, and roughly the same proportion were innocent of any crime. Bratton also pointed out on Monday that the drop in stop-and-frisk has correlated to a decline in crime -- despite ominous warnings from Kelly that reducing stop-and-frisk would cost lives. There have been 20 fewer murders this year, Bratton said, compared to the same period in 2013 -- when the city's homicide rate fell to an all-time low. A federal judge last year ruled that the department’s use of stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional and amounted to racial profiling. She ordered a series of reforms -- including a federal monitor and a pilot body camera program -- which, over a year later, are finally set to be implemented.And Mayor Bill de Blasio won a landslide election last year after campaigning on the promise to rein in the NYPD's use of stop-and-frisk. Fifty thousand police stops, Bratton said on Monday, is ""a level that is probably appropriate for a city this size and the amount of disorder and crime we’re experiencing.” But Jennifer Carnig, a spokesperson for the New York Civil Liberties Union, told The Huffington Post on Tuesday that “there's no right number.” “We need a police department that only stops people when there is a belief that a crime was committed, is being committed or is about to be committed -- an NYPD that makes constitutional stops,” Carnig said. “New Yorkers need to know that their police are protecting public safety and our basic rights, no matter what race we are or what neighborhood we live in,” she added. Bog Gangi of the Police Reform Organizing Project told HuffPost that the drop in stop-and-frisk is certainly a good thing, but that “Bratton shouldn't be bragging” about it, because the city had “no choice but to scale back” due to the court ruling.What remains troubling, Gangi said, is de Blasio and Bratton’s embrace of so-called “broken windows” policing. ""Broken windows"" is the strategy of aggressively targeting low-level crimes as a way to deter more serious crime. It’s a strategy Bratton has championed since his first stint as NYPD commissioner back in the 1990s, and one that has come under intense criticism since the death of Eric Garner in Staten Island over the summer. Garner died after being put into a chokehold during an arrest for selling untaxed, “loosie” cigarettes -- a classic ""broken windows"" offense. Gangi said the abuse of stop-and-frisk has always been just a symptom of ""broken windows"" policing, which he described as the “heart of the problem.” A study released last month by John Jay College showed that the number of misdemeanor arrests in New York City has tripled since the early 1980s. There were over 225,000 total misdemeanor arrests in 2013, the study found, compared to over 110,000 in 1990.Blacks were arrested for low-level crimes over 100,000 times last year, but just over 56,000 times in 1990. Latinos were arrested nearly 80,000 times last year for misdemeanor crimes, compared to nearly 31,000 of those arrests in 1990. Whites, meanwhile, were arrested for misdemeanors just 29,000 times last year, a smaller uptick from the nearly 22,000 such arrests in 1990. At Monday’s summit, according to The Daily Beast, Toobin pointed to these statistics before asking Bratton, “Do you think we arrest too many people?”“No,” replied Bratton, who has doggedly defended ""broken windows"" since Garner’s death. Then he added, “In some instances, we may.” It remains to be seen how far de Blasio and Bratton will budge on ""broken windows."" On Monday, the pair announced that the city would no longer arrest people for publicly possessing under 25 grams of marijuana -- another common ""broken windows"" offense. Alex Vitale, a professor of sociology at Brooklyn College who studies policing, said that while the drop in stop-and-frisk incidents and the relaxing of marijuana enforcement are both “positive developments,” there’s “still a lot of work to do.” “As long as the city continues to make tens of thousands of low-level arrests,” he said, “then the criminalization juggernaut is still running along.”  "
13,HEALTHY LIVING,What Happens When You Remove Facebook's Most Popular Feature,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-we-love-to-be-liked_n_6133534.html,,2014-11-12,"A thumbs up or 'Like' icon at the Facebook main campus in Menlo Park, California, May 15, 2012. Facebook, the world's most popular internet social network, expects to raise USD $12.1 billion in what will be Silicon Valley's largest-ever initial public offering (IPO) later this week. AFP PHOTO / ROBYN BECK (Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e63d01f0000500021fdbc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Benjamin Grosser describes himself as a longtime heavy Facebook user. But a couple of years ago, he noticed some disconcerting patterns in how he was engaging with the platform. ""I would be more interested in how many likes something got, as opposed to who left the likes -- or how many comments I received, as opposed to what those comments were,"" Grosser told The Huffington Post. ""I started to realize that I was focusing on the numbers themselves more than the content they represented.""Facebook's 1.3 billion global users post more than 3 million likes and comments each day, and tallying them up has arguably become as much of the Facebook experience as sharing content and engaging with others. And research shows we respond to the validating rush of a new Facebook ""like"" (or 20) -- when people gain positive feedback about themselves on Facebook, the brain's reward centers light up. The greater the intensity of the individual's Facebook use, the greater the reward. But heavy Facebook use is also associated with lower self-esteem and poor self-worth, indicating that the platform's ""reward"" doesn't necessarily lead to sustainable well-being.  The many numbers of the Facebook interface. Counting Facebook likes -- and taking them, on some level, as an indication of self-worth -- turns our basic drive for personal growth into a game of acquiring more and more markers of social status. This leads us to begin viewing ourselves and our friendships in quantitative terms, Grosser argues in a paper published this week in Computational Culture, a journal of software studies: How many friends do I have? How many people liked my post about my new job? How many people have ""liked"" this new product I'm thinking about buying? Grosser, an artist and software developer, decided to investigate how Facebook's many numbers affect the way we all use the system -- and to see what would happen if he created a new version of Facebook without them.So he created the Facebook Demetricator, an open-source web browser plug-in that removes all metrics from the Facebook interface. Users no longer see their number of friends or the likes received on a post (instead, it reads simply ""people like this""). And there is no ""+1"" symbol from the ""add friend"" button. ""As an artist, one of the ways I ask questions... is to intervene within a system in order to examine how that system changes who we are and what we do,"" Grosser wrote. The service, created in 2012, has since attracted thousands of users and plenty of media buzz. Grosser -- whose work has been referred to as “creative civil disobedience in the digital age"" by Slate -- posited that Facebook encourages us to take part in a game of accumulating ""social capital."" ""When we are constantly being told how many friends we have, we are encouraged to add another, to make that number go higher, to exceed our current metrics,"" Grosser writes. ""This is further reinforced by the interface, which places a '+1' in front of the 'Add Friend' button. The system makes it appear as if adding a friend increments one’s social capital by one."" Grosser's Demetricator plug-in removes the number of likes from the user's Facebook posts. So far, the consensus among Demetricator users seems to be a relief at letting go of the need to check notifications and view Facebook as a competitive activity. “Now it doesn’t matter to me how many likes something has,"" one user said in a comment cited in Grosser's paper, noting that he now pays more attention to the quality of the conversation. ""When you combine our need for personal worth with this constant conditioning to think of ourselves in quantitative terms, it starts to make us think about ourselves having to perform well,"" Grosser says. ""By taking the numbers away... all of sudden people didn't feel as competitive."""
14,COLLEGE,The Value of Collegiate Athletics: Let's Not Throw the Baby Out with the Bathwater,"Dr. Ricardo Azziz, ContributorChief Officer, Academic Health & Hospital Affairs, State Unive...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-value-of-collegiate-a_b_6108674.html,"We cannot allow the prestige and money that follow top-tier college sports programs to blind us to our overriding purpose: preparing our students to be successful adults and to become the learned and productive citizens our communities, states, and nation need.",2014-11-11,2014-11-05-1966732_660786673963107_2048650257_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-05-1966732_660786673963107_2048650257_n-thumb.jpg,"Recently, disturbing revelations about a number of college athletics programs have shocked the nation. Allegations of fake courses at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, abusive coaching at Rutgers, sexual abuse at Penn State, a multi-million dollar pyramid scheme at the University of Miami, and transcript fraud at a New York community college to help athletes get into Florida State, among others, have rocked the college sports world. Add to that lawsuits by athletes over mismanaged or ignored concussions and a growing call to view them as employees deserving of pay rather than as students, and it's no wonder we are seeing a flood of articles, discussions, and opinion pieces that question whether sports should even be a part of the college experience.Such a response is totally understandable. Clearly, discussions need to be held, actions taken, and abuses ended. Universities must be held accountable for educating all of our students, not the least our student-athletes ... students first, athletes second. We cannot allow the prestige and money that follow top-tier college sports programs to blind us to our overriding purpose: preparing our students to be successful adults and to become the thoughtful, learned, and productive citizens our communities, states, and nation need.However, as we address these issues, we should be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.Georgia Regents University, where I am president, is one of four public research universities in Georgia, and home to the state's public academic health center. At GRU, we believe in the well-rounded, the well-informed, and the well-being of others... and that is why we believe in the Jaguar Nation, home of our collegiate athletics program.Our strong and growing program fields NCAA Division II teams in five men's and six women's sports, and Division I teams in men's and women's golf. We're proud members of the Peach Belt Athletic Conference, and our men's golf team was the National Division I champion for back-to-back seasons in 2010 and 2011. Our women's golf team is having a great season, climbing from 28th to 21st in national rankings since the fall season began. (A natural fit -- GRU is in beautiful Augusta, Georgia, home of the world-renowned Masters Golf Tournament.) At GRU, we are incredibly proud that 19 of our Division II student athletes were Athletics Directors Association Academic Achievement Award winners (3.5+ GPA) in 2013-14, and 88 made the Peach Belt Conference's Presidential Honor Roll (3.0+ GPA). The NCAA just released data for Division II athletes that all of us should celebrate: These students graduate at higher rates than the general student body, 55 percent and 48 percent, respectively. The NCAA calculates an Academic Success Rate (ASR), the graduation rate taking into account transfers, students who leave in good standing, and several other adjustments. That measure is even higher: Division II student athletes' ASR is 71 percent. At GRU, our Division II athletes perform similarly, with a four-class average graduation rate of 56 percent and an ASR of 63 percent. And our student athletes' average GPA is almost identical to that of non-athletes.When managed with the right priorities in mind, collegiate athletics are good for student athletes ... and for the student body as a whole. Our students come here first to learn, but intellectual growth is only part of what forms a well-rounded, contributing, mentally and physically healthy individual. Participation in athletics, from Division I to intramural, teaches students critical life skills like leadership, teamwork, loyalty, commitment, perseverance, and time management. It fosters healthy habits and provides stress release. It forges friendships, inspires connections, and sparks school sprit that can last a lifetime.Beyond the individual student athletes, well-run athletics programs benefit the institutions at large -- even those, like GRU, that aren't generally recognized (yet!) as collegiate sports powerhouses.Well-run collegiate sports programs enhance faculty, student, alumni, and community engagement and alignment; they increase the value of the university brand; they drive enrollment and academic excellence; and they drive revenue for other auxiliaries (e.g., athletic paraphernalia sales). Multiple studies have shown alumni athletes donate more often and more dollars than non-athletes.The student athlete is a truly exceptional individual. NCAA data demonstrate that the percentage of high school athletes who end up being able to compete at the collegiate level is very low (depending on the sport, between 3.3 and 11.3 percent). So sports programs allow us to attract truly exceptional young people to our universities, many of whom are of diverse or under-represented backgrounds and who serve as role models for our under-represented and majority student populations alike.So, yes, let's shine a bright light on problems in collegiate athletics, and let's institute necessary reforms. Let's ensure we always put the good of our student athletes first. But let's not overreact and lose the tremendous potential collegiate sports hold for universities and students alike. We shouldn't be throwing the baby out with the bathwater."
