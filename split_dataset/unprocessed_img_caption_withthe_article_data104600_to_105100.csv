This grace has helped me to realize an important truth about my Thanksgiving feast: food is more than just food. Food has the power to show our love and demonstrate our acceptance. Thanksgiving and I have a torrid past (most recently, I faced my fears of raw poultry); however, even reaching all the way back to childhood, I always hated the Thanksgiving desserts. I was embarrassed to admit that the mushy, warm apples in an apple pie made my stomach churn. There was no amount of Reddi-wip that could make me forget that pumpkin pie was a pie made out of a vegetable. Instead of forcing me into an apple pie peg, I am grateful that my mom made me my favorite pie: coconut cream pie. Although coconut cream pie may seem as an untraditional choice for Thanksgiving dessert, my Thanksgiving would be incomplete without it. As a kid, the aroma of toasted coconut fresh from the oven is one of the most comforting, delicious scents I have ever known.   So as an adult responsible for contributing to the Thanksgiving feast, I now make the customary coconut cream pie. I follow the steps in the exact same way my mom did. I prepare the same Jell-O brand Cook-and-Serve Vanilla pudding not only because it tastes better than instant pudding, but I feel like I really made something complicated by standing over the stove and stirring the pudding mix with milk for 15 consecutive minutes. I carefully roll out the premade pie dough (I'm not above getting help with this step), and I lovingly pour the decadent pudding with bits of sweet, flaky coconut into the pastry shell. I then toast more coconut to put on top of the whipped cream. I feel the best parts of my childhood, the parts where I felt heard and valued, drifting back as the coconut is toasted to perfection.  As the universe would have it, my kids are not pie people at all. In fact, if given a choice between pie for dessert or nothing at all, I believe they would choose nothing. I'm not going to lie, I was a little sad that they did not share my same love of coconut cream pie. I had visions of us hovering around our creamy dessert, eating in solidarity as everyone else ate the sad, squishy apple pie.

Not even terminal brain cancer was going to stop her. Natalia was determined to help the hungry and homeless. She said, ""I would like to give people soup and blankets. I don't want there to be hunger."" On her birthday this October, Natalia and her loving family went to the Drop Inn Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Center provides food and shelter to the homeless. There they handed out blankets and served a soup Natalia had prepared. This was a continuation of Natalia's mission started earlier this year thanks to the Make A Wish Foundation.Her first wish to the Foundation was for the cancer to go away. She also knew how cold she would feel after getting chemotherapy and that inspired her to help the homeless. She could relate to their suffering. That is when she came up with the idea for giving out soup and blankets. Natalia worked with a local chef to come up with a special recipe for her soup. It is called Natalia's Soup of Love. The soup has not only fed the hungry in Cincinnati but also miles away in Louisville, Kentucky. Last week Natalia passed away from her brain tumor. Her spirit and mission will go on. Her family is going to celebrate her birthday every year at the Drop Inn Center. They will continue to help those in need. Natalia put others ahead of herself, even in her most troubled times. To her love and sharing were what life is about. If there were more Natalias in the world, we could virtually wipe out hunger. Everyone would have a roof over their head. What are some ways to help keep Natalia's mission going? Just getting involved with your local food bank and agencies that fight world hunger are great ways to start. If you visit the Feeding America web page you could locate the food banks and shelters in your area. There you will find ways to help out whether by volunteering, donating or advocating. If you visit the World Food Programme's web site you can find ways to get involved fighting hunger on a global scale. There are 805 million people worldwide who live in hunger and struggle to get one meal a day, if they are fortunate. Natalia's family needs help too as they have fallen upon difficult financial times. They have set up a GoFundMe campaign to help pay the medical bills.As winter arrives, a little bit early, we can take some comfort that homeless people have blankets because of Natalia. They have and will continue to eat her soup. They will not go hungry. The recipe for Natalia's Soup of Love is available online. The upcoming holiday season is a time of giving. Natalia took that one step further and made it a year round season. Natalia is an example to everyone. She gives us hope that we can make a better world. We can end hunger and homelessness. We just need to have her courage, creativity and spirit with us on that road to peace. "

In the early dawn of Nov. 2, militant leaders with the Islamic State group and al-Qaida gathered at a farm house in northern Syria and sealed a deal to stop fighting each other and work together against their opponents, a prominent Syrian opposition official and a rebel commander said. Such an alliance could be a significant blow to struggling U.S-backed Syrian rebels.

Islamic State, which has seized parts of northern and eastern Syria as well northern and western Iraq, has often displayed bodies in public after the killings.The hardline group, an offshoot of al Qaeda, said on Sunday it had beheaded an American aid worker in a video issued online, an act which U.S. President Barack Obama described as ""pure evil.""While it has killed a number of foreigners including journalists and aid workers, the overwhelming number of the group's victims have been from the local population, said Rami Abdulrahman who runs the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.The majority -- 882 -- were civilians and included two children and five women, he said, describing killings since June 29 when Islamic State's leader said the group had formed a caliphate.The children were shot dead separately in Aleppo province. One was accused of taking pictures of an Islamic State headquarters and the other was killed after being accused of insulting the Prophet Mohammad.The group killed 483 captured members of Syrian pro-government forces in the same period and 63 members of insurgent and Kurdish fighting groups in Syria. It also put to death four of its own members, Abdulrahman added.The hardline Sunni Muslim group has killed people from across ethnicities and sects in Syria and Iraq. In Syria it killed hundreds of members of the Sheitaat tribe which it had been battling in the east of the country.In some towns and villages the group has set up courts to administer what it describes as Islamic law before carrying out the killings.

6,GREEN,5 Reasons the Senate Must Protect Our Communities from the Keystone XL Pipeline,"Frances Beinecke, ContributorFormer President, NRDC",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-reasons-the-senate-must_b_6171564.html,"This bill would bypass essential reviews, skip safety assessments, and fast track a dangerous project.

In a move that disappointed environmental groups and cheered the oil industry, the Obama administration on Jan. 31, 2014, said it had no major environmental objections to the proposed Keystone XL pipeline from Canada. (AP Photo/Danny Johnston)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d2bbac260000132951ddf0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Tuesday, the Senate will vote on a bill forcing President Obama to green light the Keystone XL pipeline for dirty tar sands oil. Keystone threatens our air and water and would intensify the climate change already pounding our communities. The bill is a gift to the oil and gas industry, but if it passes, the American people will be stuck paying the price.This bill would bypass essential reviews, skip safety assessments, and fast track a dangerous project. This has sweeping implications for future generations. And yet it is entangled in the politics of the moment. In its first major vote after the midterm elections, the House passed a bill forcing the approval of the tar sands oil pipeline. Now Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu, caught in a runoff election, is pushing a similar bill in the Senate. When we take the politics out of the equation and ask the single question before the president--is this in the national interest of the United States--the answer is a resounding no. The President himself outlined some of the problems with the project on Friday, saying, ""Understand what this project is: It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. It doesn't have an impact on US gas prices.""Here are some of the other reasons to reject the Keystone XL pipeline. Total Jobs: 35   TransCanada, the company behind the pipeline, told the U.S. State Department the pipeline would create 35 permanent jobs. There will be temporary jobs for 1,950 construction workers for the two years. Then they'll be gone. Clean energy companies, meanwhile, announced more than 18,000 new jobs in more than 20 states in just the past three months.17 Percent More Carbon Pollution Tar sands oil is the dirtiest fuel on earth. Because producing it consumes so much energy, a gallon of tar sands crude generates 17 percent more carbon pollution than conventional crude oil. The State Department calculated that the incremental carbon pollution from the tar sands pipeline would be as much as putting up to 5.7 million additional cars on the road.Without Keystone, Less Tar Sands Oil and Less Pollution  Industry analysts and energy executives say that without Keystone, they have few options for getting their landlocked product to port. Other pipeline proposals have failed to make headway, and investors are pulling back on expansion plans. Statoil announced in September it was postponing an enormous tar sands project due to rising costs and a lack of pipeline space. That's the third major cancellation this year, preventing significant amounts of pollution from entering the environment, at least temporarily. Major Threat to America's Breadbasket and Water The pipeline would cut through Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska--states where ranches and farms produced $41.6 billion worth of food in 2012. The pipeline would cross 1,073 rivers, lakes and streams and national recognized water resources, such as the Ogallala aquifer, threatening them with a spill of tar sands crude, which has proven more difficult to clean up than conventional oil.Tar Sands Oil Spills Harder to Clean Up Much of Michigan's Kalamazoo River is still suffering from a tar sands pipeline blowout that contaminated 38 miles of water in 2010. In Mayflower, Arkansas, more than 200,000 gallons of tar sands crude polluted backyards and neighborhoods when a pipeline blew in 2013. Rare accidents? Hardly. TransCanada's Keystone I pipeline through the Midwest had 14 leaks in its first year of operation. The Keystone XL pipeline is a threat to our nation. It would increase pollution and intensify climate change for generations to come. We must raise our voices and demand our leaders reject this dirty scheme. Tell your Senator to oppose this bill now. And tell President Obama to veto if it reaches his desk."

8,POLITICS,"Demography, Democrats, and a Metropolitan Vision","Steven Conn, ContributorAuthor/Professor, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/demography-democrats-and_b_6170574.html,"Forget about the rising percentage of Latinos in this country for a moment and consider this number: somewhere between 65-70 percent of all Americans live in metropolitan regions of 500,000 or more.",2014-11-17,"Kansas City skyline from Crown Center, MO (Photo by Visions of America/UIG via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dd4e260000300183bce9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Writing in the New York Times (Sunday November 16, 2014), Kevin Baker accuses the Democratic party of being delusional. The thrust of this charge is that in the wake of the mid-term disaster, Democratic leaders seem to believe that the party's long-term success is inevitable. All the demographics guarantee it: the nation's population is getting less white, less male, and millennials are coming into their generational own even as boomers age and, despite what many of them seem to believe, die.There are details to quibble with in Baker's piece -- for example, he discounts the role of civil rights in turning the South from solidly Democratic to solidly Republican by noting that Democrats remained competitive at the state-level in many of those states. I might note that civil rights became the bedrock upon which the ""anti-government"" politics of the New Right was built. That politics affected the presidential vote first, as Southern revanchists blamed ""the government"" for desegregation; it played out at the state and local levels later.Still, Baker's larger point is a good one: demography is not destiny, and if the Democratic Party wants a real future, it needs a real vision. To that end, let me suggest that the Democratic Party may find that vision as much in geography as in demography. In short, if it wants to stage a comeback, the party needs a metropolitan vision. Forget about the rising percentage of Latinos in this country for a moment and consider this number: somewhere between 65-70 percent of all Americans live in metropolitan regions of 500,000 or more, according to a study by the Brookings Institution a few years ago. That is simply the most recent plateau in a trend of urbanization that has been going on since 1789. Even as Thomas Jefferson envisioned a nation of yeoman farmers, Americans were moving into the cities.While older industrial cities started to lose population in the mid-20th century, their surrounding regions continued to grow. The growth of post-war suburbia initially created a political polarization pitting liberal, Democratic cities against conservative, Republican suburbs. Mario Cuomo, for example, came from Queens; Alfonse D'Amato came from Long Island.But that divide has begun to close in a number of areas in the more recent past. As suburban areas around Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston, Denver and elsewhere develop more fully, they have become, well, more urbanized. This means that their populations have grown, they have become more dense, and they have become considerably more diverse. In 1975 George Clinton described the geography of metropolitan America as ""chocolate cities and vanilla suburbs,"" but things have become more complex since then.And metropolitan Americans have been voting Democratic in growing numbers. A quick look at the map of President Obama's decisive 2012 win is initially startling because it looks so overwhelmingly red. Until you realize that those smaller blue areas around Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Chicago, and Las Vegas are where all the people live.Not only is metropolitan America trending blue, it has been systematically insulted and ignored by the GOP. President Reagan had no use for America's metro regions, nor did two Bushes. And since 2008 when the GOP has increasingly been run by the bunker-in-the-wilderness survivalist crowd, the party's hostility to all things urban has only gotten more bilious and bizarre. The Republican Party's 2012 platform, for example, denounced ""sustainable development"" as an attack on ""the American way of life of private property ownership, single-family homes, private car ownership and individual travel choices, and privately owned farms."" Can a political party really come out against sustainable development and hope to have a politically sustainable future?So what does a metropolitan vision for the Democratic Party look like? It includes many of the issues and goals currently floating around -- like dealing with immigration, since metropolitan America is still where the majority of immigrants settle, transportation, basic infrastructure. But such a vision might also mean pursuing these issues more aggressively and specifically as metropolitan problems.It also means pushing the knowledge/education/innovation economy more vigorously too. After all, metropolitan America remains the engine of our intellectual life, and the next developments in high-tech medicine and high-tech manufacturing are going to emerge there, not in the vast red, rural places on the map.Metropolitan America, however, might prove to be the best place to fight for income equality as well. When urban areas function best, they provide the best ladders for economic opportunity. If, as the president has said, fighting for greater economic equality will be a defining issue for the coming generation, then that fight will be best fought in metropolitan America.The other defining issue of our time, of course, is climate change, and here the Republican Party was inadvertently right in 2012. Metropolitan America is where the practices of sustainability and of reducing the nation's carbon footprint will be carried out. If New York City were a separate state, it would rank about 10th in population and 51st in per capita energy consumption. Casting climate change as a global crisis makes it hopeless and hopelessly abstract for most people. Re-framing it as a problem that can be addressed in and by metropolitan America could become a movement.It has been a truism about the Democratic Party for years that it has been merely the sum of its various interest groups: the elderly, African Americans, women, labor, students etc etc. Kevin Baker is right that should not simply rely on that old demographic magic, waiting for new demographic groups to join the crowd, and hoping that this will lead to electoral triumph. But the Democratic Party has an opportunity to seize on geography and become the party of metropolitan America.Steven Conn teaches history at Ohio State University.

Are You Looking For Bingo Or Competitive Tennis On Thursdays?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ac54891700004000bafbcd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"My cousin's wife of two years sat outside my grandmother's door with me and listened to my thoughts on death through my veil of migraine pain. It was day eight of the bedside vigil, and it was the first day I was starting to feel it -- the stress and pain of holding back grief, of trying to act normal. It was easier to talk to someone who wasn't blood, who could listen and not interrupt.  No one wants to talk about death but I started to force the conversation because my grandmother was starting to die even though we were denying it. She's 101 and wants to go ""home."" She's been saying she's been dying for 20 years, and even more over the past four years since she's been in a nursing home. But she'd say it while making plans the next day and ordering people around and having a shot of Southern Comfort -- even in the nursing home. She'd say she want to die but she had too much worrying to do about this son or that cousin. She's been the patriarch of our family for so long, it's hard to imagine not having her to complain to, seek advice from, borrow a $10, buy her a lottery ticket. She's the family hub. Our large Irish family always crossed paths at her Hoboken brownstone; now it's at Fritz Reuter. She is where our family comes to gather. But now when she says she wants to die, it's different. She says she is dying and anyone can see my grandmother at 101 is way different from when she was 100. Anyone who has spent any time with her over the past 20 years would even see it immediately. And anyone who hung out with her all the time like my cousins and I did these past four years, well, there's no denying the major shift. My grandmother -- still witty and trying to read my iPad two days ago -- started to change as her body started to slowly shut down. Even she didn't know at first what was going on. About three weeks before death started to set in, she told me she was terrified she was going crazy, that her mind was playing tricks on her on her. I brushed it off until she called me crying to come see her and ""straighten her out"" -- she didn't know where she was and had forgotten she went out to lunch that afternoon. Once she saw me, and I reoriented her to her surroundings, she seemed perfectly fine.The next day, however, she's holding on to me in terror, crying what happens if her body outlives her mind, then what? She really felt like she was going crazy and didn't know what was happening to her. She was so very scared. I stayed with her that night not knowing it was the start of a deathbed vigil, not knowing how important a role I was to become in my grandmother's life.I didn't have to do a lot of research to discover she wasn't getting dementia, it was delirium -- sudden and fluctuating states of restlessness, illusions and incoherent thoughts and speech. It's terrible at night and I found out she had been asking the aides to sit with her when she woke scared; no one knows how long it had been going on. She was offered medication but turned it down, fearful it would make her feel even more crazy during the day. Since this was a woman who wasn't even on blood pressure medication, I wasn't about to push pills, night terrors or not. Quality of life with family is important now, and like a new mother nesting, Grammy has sudden requests of everyone and a need to get things -- real and imagined -- put in order. She wanted to say goodbye to everyone, and tour every inch of this building. She's had random requests for food she doesn't normally eat, and insisted on having a new telephone. She asked my dad for a meatball. She suddenly hates coffee and wants pineapple juice. Death is a process not unlike birth. There are signs when it starts to begin, that now, in hindsight, were clear a few months ago, and got clearer and clearer as we got closer to this point. There's no denying it, and once the process has begun, there's no turning back except for tubes and machines. She has a DNR. Her wishes are clear and she's never wavered. My grandmother asked me to stay with her until it's over, and I can only think of a few reasons she'd ask me: She knows I'll talk about anything and won't mince words; she knows I will do anything for her if I'm able; and she know I can be a calming presence. It took me a very long time to become a calming presence; it's still a daily practice. My grandmother is a demanding woman, but at the same time doesn't like to impose too much. She must really need me here, and perhaps knows I need just as much, to be here as well. I haven't yet begun to process this woman not being in my life. Knowing I am spending every last day with her is something I will never regret.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

World leaders have gathered in Brisbane for the annual G20 Summit and are expected to discuss economic growth, free trade and climate change as well as pressing issues including the situation in Ukraine and the Ebola crisis.

Indeed, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has questioned the science behind climate change.""The most difficult discussion was on climate change,"" an EU official told reporters on condition of anonymity. ""This was really trench warfare, this was really step by step by step. In the end we have references to most of the things we wanted.""The official said the passage included practical measures that countries could take and a reference to contributing to the Green Climate Fund, which U.S. President Barack Obama committed $3 billion to on Saturday.The United States and Europe led the push to have climate change discussed at the meeting, with Obama using a speech on Saturday to warn that Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef was under threat.""Here in the Asia Pacific nobody has more at stake when it comes to thinking about and then acting on climate change,"" Obama said. ""Here in Australia it means longer droughts, more wildfires.""Asked on Sunday if he accepted that climate change was potentially one of the biggest impediments to global economic growth, Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey said: ""No. No I don't. Absolutely not.""""You just look at China. China is going to continue to increase emissions to 2030,"" he said. ""Australia is doing the same amount of work on climate change as the United States over a 30-year period. Frankly, what we're focused on is growth and jobs."" ANTI-CORRUPTIONEU officials said the communique, likely to be three pages, down from 27 last year, would also include an anti-corruption action plan.China had agreed to a G20 deal aimed at cracking down on companies masking their ownership, after initial concerns about the proposal, the EU official said.""This was difficult for China but they managed to clear that,"" the official said.A working group at the Group of 20, under Australia's Attorney-General's Department, has been seeking agreement on how to improve beneficial ownership transparency and combat the use of shell companies that can hide ill-gotten money or avoid taxation. China had said on Thursday an agreement was still in discussions. PRESSURE ON RUSSIAThe separatist war in eastern Ukraine, where more than 4,000 people have been killed since April, is expected to be discussed further on Sunday after a series of one-on-one meetings between Putin and leaders including Obama.The European Union has demanded Moscow withdraw troops and weapons from Ukraine and put pressure on rebels there to accept a ceasefire, after the latest fighting wrecked a truce agreed in September.Obama, who met with key regional allies Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe early on Sunday, is due to meet with European leaders to discuss Ukraine later in the day. EU foreign ministers will meet on Monday to consider further steps, including additional possible sanctions on Russia.Western nations have imposed successive rounds of sanctions on Moscow, accusing it of sending troops and tanks to back pro-Russian rebels fighting to break away from Ukraine. Russia denies the charges.On Saturday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied speculation that Putin would leave the summit early, saying he would take part in all G20 events.

Despite Browns linebacker Christian Kirksey blanketing him, Watt somehow made a diving catch and kept his feet in bounds for his second touchdown reception of the season.

I cannot imagine a more fitting description for The Midtown Men and the exhilaration which both precedes and follows their every public appearance.  It is going to be my supreme privilege to introduce you, over time, not only to their music, but the intimate thoughts and feelings of these brilliant performers, as well as some of the talented and generous 1960s artists whose music they so exquisitely honor.So - imagine you're entering a large theater. There's an electric charge in the air. The room is buzzing with anticipation and the sounds of 3400 fans filing in: the murmur of quiet conversations, ushers showing people to their appointed rows, coats being draped over seat-backs. Pretty much like any other evening at the theater. Until the lights go down and you hear, ""Ladies and gentlemen - The Midtown Men!"" Then all bets are off as four men with boundless energy, glorious voices, and outfits right out of the 1960s, grab you by your gut and keep you absolutely entranced - reminiscing, singing, laughing, applauding, cheering, and whistling - and so thoroughly entertained, you can't get enough.   These magical men are Christian Hoff (Tony Award winner), Michael Longoria, Daniel Reichard, and J. Robert Spencer (Tony Award nominee): the four stars from the original Broadway cast of Jersey Boys.  So - what is it about these guys that makes them so different? No-one ever could create another Woodstock - though not for lack of trying - so how is it that these men managed to take that decade of music and make it as powerful and relevant now as it was back then?Renowned musician Tommy James (Tommy James and the Shondells) explained it this way: ""In the 60's, all the ducks were in a row. You had the entire media ... TV, the record business, radio ... all looking for that next big act, all on board. Plus you had about 70 million baby boom kids suddenly let out on the street, all of them with money in their pockets. Everything was right."" And it's happening all over again. ""The excitement that comes over the crowd,"" Tommy said, ""is very real.""   And why is that? There's something about their presence on stage: a combination of their magnificent voices, their unequivocal commitment to excellence, the friendship and camaraderie which is so clearly evident, their unmistakable love and respect not for just the music they are performing, but for the blood, sweat, and tears and passion and sacrifice of the men and women who originated the songs five decades ago. Add all that to a superb band, brilliantly-designed sets, and their unique ability to connect with each member of the audience as though they were singing just for you and no-one else, and you end up with this rarity: the recreation of an historic event which is as good as the original.Gene Cornish of The Rascals told me, ""It's not like I'm just listening to a tribute - it's the real deal. In my opinion, The Midtown Men are performing the soundtrack of our youth."" Gene often joins them on stage. Twice he's knocked me out and melted my heart with his harmonica when they performed the 1967 Rascals' hit, Groovin'.   Many 1960s icons, including disk jockey Cousin Brucie and rock icon Steven Van Zandt, have become good friends with The Midtown Men. Jeff Vee, their manager, explains: ""Every artist worries, 'when I die, will my music die with me?' But they know these guys are honoring their music, not just mimicking it, so they really feel like, 'my music is safe with them.'""I suggest you see for yourself. On Nov 29th and 30th, in New York and nearby markets, PBS will air The Midtown Men Live in Concert!, directed by Grammy and Emmy award-winners Pierre and François Lamoureux, who've directed/produced acts like The Who, Peter Frampton, Opéra de Montréal, and Cirque du Soleil.No surprise ... these shooting stars are rising so quickly, the PBS show's been picked up in Detroit, Atlanta, Seattle, Austin, San Diego, Las Vegas, Tampa, Boston, and other major markets. Keep an eye on your local listings.One final exciting teaser: In January, The Midtown Men will accompany Tommy James up as he begins recording his new 'unplugged' album.

(Photo by Phil Walter/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f2fd240000500057295f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Referring to God as 'Father', 'Lord' and 'King' may have wider implications than people think. Clemson University sociologist Andrew Whitehead has a new report out in the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion demonstrating that people who believe in a masculine God are more likely to oppose same-sex marriage and civil unions.""Those who believe God is masculine also hold very traditional views of gender roles,"" Whitehead writes. ""Individuals who ascribe to a masculine image of God are much more likely to espouse traditional gender ideologies compared to those who do not view God as masculine.""Beliefs about the nature of God can influence individuals' world views in many ways, including their their political views and their opinions, on things like abortion and capital punishment. For this study, Whitehead analyzed data from a 2007 Baylor Religion Survey of 1,648 U.S. citizens administered by the Gallup Organization and defined ""traditional"" by creating a gender roles index. For this he asked respondents to rate their agreement with statements like: ""Most men are better suited emotionally for politics than most women,"" ""A preschool child is likely to suffer if his or her mother works,"" ""It is God's will that women care for children"", and ""A husband should earn a larger salary than his wife.""The researcher found that respondents who hold traditional gender beliefs are generally unfavorable toward LGBT individuals because they see them as exhibiting traits of the opposite sex and subverting gender roles.The correlation between belief in a male-gendered God and opposition to same-sex unions held true across religious traditions, Whitehead told HuffPost, though Pew Forum has also demonstrated that beliefs can vary even within traditions that typically ascribe to a masculine image of God.Whitehead also found that high levels of religious practice and high regard for holy scripture correlate to traditional gender ideology, regardless of denomination. But evangelical and black Protestants were more likely than Catholic, mainline Protestant and Jewish individuals to view homosexuality and gay marriage unfavorably, Whitehead notes.""Individuals who view God as masculine are signaling a belief in an underlying gendered reality that influences their perceptions of the proper ordering of that reality,"" Whitehead writes.God's masculine gender and his position of power in the universe combined provide a model that many religious people view as justification for ""traditional"" gender roles in which men have authority to which women are expected to submit. Whitehead reports:""Because God is masculine, and men are a direct representation of God and so receive a certain amount of authority in family life, women are to submit to that authority. Therefore, same-sex unions clash with this understanding of the 'traditional' family and threaten a stable social order, which should, again, comply with the underlying gendered nature of all reality.""Sociology professor and Catholic priest Andrew Greeley published an article investigating the role of belief in a feminine God for Sociology and Social Research in 1988. In ""Evidence That a Maternal Image of God Correlates with Liberal Politics,"" Greeley found that belief in a maternal God made Americans less likely to vote for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984. They also demonstrated less support for capital punishment, favored government help for minority populations and rejected the idea that women should remain at home. Although Whitehead said he was unable to examine the effects of belief in a feminine God on same-sex marriage support, he did suggest that shifting away from a masculine image of God might move society ""in a more egalitarian direction."" But such a transition was unlikely, he said, because God's gender can never be proven or disproven and it would necessitate a shift in other aspects of people's worldview. ""No longer viewing God as a 'he' would not only mean a shift in attitudes toward same-sex unions but also in how their own marriages, society, or religious groups are ordered,"" Whitehead writes. ""The findings themselves indicate that due to religious individuals’ gendered views of reality we can expect continued opposition even though the attitudes of the wider culture toward same-sex unions are continuing to liberalize.""H/T Pacific Standard Magazine"
