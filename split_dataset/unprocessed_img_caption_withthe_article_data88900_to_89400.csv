Which is more essential to humanity: the individual or the collective?,2015-05-17,2015-05-15-1431701422-8854315-interlocking_hands.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-15-1431701422-8854315-interlocking_hands-thumb.jpg,"""Nothing is precious except that part of you which is in other people, and that part of others which is in you. Up there, on high, everything is one."" -- Pierre Teilhard de ChardinAt the root of the culture wars lies a fundamental dichotomy in worldviews. Which is more essential to humanity: the individual or the collective?The philosophy of Ayn Rand, as articulated in her novels The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957), undergirds one extreme of the cultural divide. Rand, a Russian Jew who immigrated to the U.S. in 1926, espoused a libertarian philosophy that leaves the individual unencumbered to pursue self-interest, enlightened or otherwise. Rand promoted the ""virtue of selfishness"" and reviled altruism, elevated reason and denigrated intuition, idolized laissez-faire capitalism and condemned all forms of religion and moral persuasion.Rand, who portrayed the poor as ""leeches"" on the rich, is the patron saint of ultra-libertarians such as Ron and Rand Paul. Paradoxically, some Christian conservatives -- Paul Ryan comes to mind -- also idolize Rand, despite her militant atheism and ""utter lack of charity or empathy.""Carried to its logical conclusion, the extreme individualism and ""rational egoism"" promoted by Rand lead to radical independence -- and ultimately isolation -- from other beings. In many religious traditions, hell is just such a state.The other extreme of the cultural divide was fully actualized in the system Rand fled: Soviet communism. The Cold-War Soviet state callously and routinely sacrificed individuals to the cogs of the collective agricultural and industrial machines. The individual served as a mere drone in a hive. Drones were expendable so long as the hive survived.Both extremes reveal the truth of a Cold-War-era joke: ""What is the difference between capitalism and communism?"" Answer: ""With capitalism, man exploits man. With communism, it's the other way round.""Extreme collectivism undermines creativity and initiative, ultimately crushing the souls of individuals. It is no coincidence that alcoholism was epidemic in the former U.S.S.R. Extreme individualism, on the other hand, grants license for individuals to destroy the commons -- soil, air, water, and climate -- on which we all depend. It is also no coincidence that the U.S., champion of unbridled capitalism and unfettered globalization, has lead the way in the destruction of the commons.There is a third way.The renown French paleontologist, Jesuit priest, and mystic Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955) articulated many novel and illuminating concepts: cosmogenesis, complexity-consciousness, the noosphere, and -- pertinent to this discussion -- union differentiates.The latter theme permeates his great work The Human Phenomenon (1955). It originates in Teilhard's observations that all components of the universe -- whether subatomic particles, atoms, cells, or biological organisms -- unite with other such entities to create more complex structures. The tendency toward union is innate in matter.The American philosopher Ken Wilber expresses a similar notion through the concept of holons. Wilbur describes a holon as an entity with a dual purpose: it is at once an autonomous individual and part of a greater whole. Holons exist in nested hierarchies: quarks, atoms, molecules, cells, organisms, societies, worlds, and so on. Teilhard and Wilbur concur that, far from losing its identity in union, an individual (or holon) becomes more truly itself by contributing to a greater whole (holon). ""Fuller being is closer union,"" wrote Teilhard. And individuals without community, he painted in words poetic, are but a ""cluster of sparks extinguished ... in darkness.""Still, the apparent paradox of Teilhard's axiom ""union differentiates"" makes it intellectually challenging: (integration) union and differentiation are opposites, mathematically and spiritually. The concept is best apprehended through experience rather than intellect. My ah-ha moment came in 1970. (Photo credit: the author)Following graduation from college, I joined a ""summer missions"" project under the auspices of a mainstream protestant denomination. Our co-ed group consisted of 13 college kids from a wide swath of America, and a 20-something married couple, our leaders.The 15 of us lived under one roof, in the ramshackle clubhouse of an abandoned golf course. Tasks split along gender lines. The guys did church construction: pouring concrete, framing walls, hanging rafters. The women (I wince in retrospect) cooked, washed, and cleaned. The musically inclined, female and male, formed a folk group and ran the ""Crossroads,"" our bi-weekly coffee house for footloose local youth.Group living was stressful. Conflicts arose over rigid gender roles, perspectives on the Vietnam War; and the difficulty of balancing the competing demands of caring for ourselves and serving the community. The summer could have exploded in our faces, and did for subsequent mission teams. (Photo credit: the author)Our group was fortunate. Mike and Susan, our house-parents, having recently married, had first-hand experience in working through gender-role issues. Moreover, Michael, completing his doctorate in psychology, had trained in counseling. At his insistence, we talked out and eventually sorted through most conflicts. Although not utopia, the work-camp experience was extraordinarily positive for me, a model of Teilhard's axiom that I would only much latter come to appreciate: union differentiates. Like flowers awakening to the sunshine and showers of spring, individual personalities blossomed. By summer's end, each person filled an essential niche in our communal life. So powerful was this impression that I wrote into the wee hours of our last night, crafting reflections in verse for each and every participant. I remained buoyed by the whole experience months thereafter. Forty-five years later, reflecting on summer 1970 still evokes all kinds of positive feelings.These musings convince me that the culture wars are pure political theater, intended to distract both sides while foxes raid the henhouse of democratic society. We need healthy communities and we need liberated individuals. The individual thrives only in the rich soil of a healthy collective, and the collective thrives only when its individuals are empowered to exercise their unique gifts.Teilhard had it right: union differentiates. The best gardeners pay attention to both the plants and the soil.(The author is indebted to poet and friend Charles Finn for encouragement, insight, and editorial suggestions.)"

That's it. Less than 1 million new private sector jobs in 12 years of Bush presidencies.President Obama creates as many new private sector jobs in 3-4 months as the Bushes did in 12 years. To understand this more fully, the Bushes averaged 5,190 new jobs per month for 12 years. No, not 51,000 that would be considered terrible, awful and devastating. But one-tenth of that, 5,190. There are no words to describe how abysmal that is.Lest one believe that Junior were the culprit, crashing his daddy's numbers, we can break it down further. Under Bush Senior there were a grand total of 1,084,000 new private sector jobs and Junior had a net negative 337,000 jobs. Other than Junior, Senior's 1 million jobs in 4 years is the lowest by far of any modern presidencySo, the proposition Jeb is making to the nation appears, in essence, to be this: we should rely on a third Bush's instincts (whose genetic defects on economic policy are described above) to extend President Obama's economic recovery from his brother's most disastrous economic and financial collapse since the Great Depression.For Mitt Romney it was the 47 percent. For the Bushes, it is the 747,000.Jeb Bush must think the American people are fools, or gluttons for punishment, to give the Bush instincts and hangers-on a third chance."

Emile Munir Elias, who the Vatican said was healed through her intercession, attended the canonisation with his mother.Sainthood is usually confirmed by the Catholic Church when two miracles - often the inexplicable healing of a sick person - are attributed to the intercession of a holy person who has died.

(Not too shabby for a market that barely existed a decade ago.) The two-thirds of Americans who own smartphones now spend more time immersed in apps than they do surfing the mobile web.How much time are we talking about? The heaviest users, aged 18 to 24, clock in more than 37 hours a month. But mobile device owners over 45 aren't far behind, spending 21-25 hours a month with their favorite apps.With more than 3 million apps available on the marketplace, it's getting harder to know which are winners and which are a waste. We've reviewed dozens and plucked five favorites below as worthy of a spot on your phone or tablet:Fitness Buddy ($1.99; Apple): A recent study showed that not exercising can be as dangerous to your health as smoking cigarettes. Among the top reasons people don't exercise? Not knowing what to do at the gym or getting bored with the same routines. Cue Fitness Buddy, which comes with more than 75 beginner, intermediate and advanced workouts (and more than 1,700 exercises). The app describes and demonstrates the execution of each exercise and also tracks your progress. Users will quickly understand why top tech blog Gizmodo called it one of the best iPhone apps ever.MyFitness Pal (free; Apple and Android): There are enough diet books out there to choke an industrial-strength paper shredder. But there's one weight-loss weapon scientists agree on, backed by multiple research studies with thousands of participants. ""The more food records people kept, the more weight they lost,"" says Jack Hollis, a lead author of one such study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. ""Those who kept daily food records lost twice as much weight as those who kept no records. It seems the simple act of writing down what you eat encourages people to consume fewer calories."" Perhaps it's no surprise, then, that digital food diary MyFitnessPal is the most popular free Health & Fitness app in the iTunes App Store.

I answered that I had been in my past but now had an advertising and design agency and asked why he assumed that I was an actor. He said, because of your hair and the way you dress, and, just the way you are. Then he eagerly half-turned around and said, ""My name is Estaifan B. Shilaita. Look me up. I'm famous."" Here was a 60-year-old-plus Chicago cab driver who was encouraging me to use my device to look him up. I was busy and needed to answer a few emails, but I was intrigued. I typed Estaifan Shilaita into my phone and immediately a HuffPost link popped up on top. Yes, there it was, my cab driver was the national professional boxing champion of Iraq. We talked some more in our short ride to another part of the city and he told me of a documentary they are making of him. When we reached the destination, we agreed he would return a few hours later to drive me to O'Hare to continue our conversation. On the way to the airport he related his boxing journey. He started boxing in 1968 and competed at the highest level until 1979 when, for political reasons, he immigrated to Chicago. After arriving in Chicago he fought another 7 matches, won 5, lost 2. His wife told Estaifan that she was tired of him coming home with a beat up face and so he hung up his gloves when he was 30 years old.

15,CRIME,Why Tsarnaev May Never Make It To The Death Chamber,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-appeal_n_7295548.html,,2015-05-16,"FILE - In this March 5, 2015 file courtroom sketch, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, center, is depicted between defense attorneys Miriam Conrad, left, and Judy Clarke, right, during his federal death penalty trial in Boston. Prosecutors rested their case against Tsarnaev on Monday, March 30, 2015, after jurors saw gruesome autopsy photos and heard a medical examiner describe the devastating injuries suffered by the three people who died in the 2013 terror attack. (Jane Flavell Collins via AP, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2ac303c000032000aee6f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is years from the death chamber -- if he ever makes it -- despite Friday's sentence by a federal jury. A lengthy appeals process, as well as legal and technical complications with lethal injection, are just some of the factors that could prevent Tsarnaev, 21, from receiving the punishment the jury imposed:Few Federal Death Row Prisoners Ever Get Executed Tsarnaev, who will be formally sentenced by a judge this summer, is poised to be the first terrorist in the post-9/11 era to be executed.But the government has a thin track record of actually executing federal death row prisoners. Federal courts have handed down death sentences 80 times since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, but only three inmates have been executed. The Appeals Process Could Take YearsTimothy McVeigh, convicted in 1997 of bombing a federal building in Oklahoma City, was on death row at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, for four years before  abandoning his appeals, expediting his execution. Unless Tsarnaev similarly gives up, he will engage a lengthy appeals process at a time when support for the death penalty is at a 40-year low in the U.S. Tsarnaev's defense likely will file several post-trial motions, which may include objections to the fact the trial was held in Boston, denying him a truly impartial jury. Other motions could arise if information surfaces that jurors were untruthful on disclosure forms, or that there was impropriety during deliberations in the jury room, WBUR reports. The Death Sentence Could Be Tossed Out Or VacatedA judge overseeing Tsarnaev's appeal has the power to throw out or otherwise vacate the Boston jury's sentence based on new evidence or prosecutorial decisions made in the post-conviction phase. In one such example, confessed killer Gary Lee Sampson was handed the death penalty, only to have the sentence vacated when it was revealed that one of the jurors lied during the screening process, The Boston Globe reports.Lethal Injection Is In Legal -- And Logistical -- Limbo A long-simmering battle over lethal injection in the 32 states that still allow capital punishment -- soon possibly 31 -- boiled over into the U.S. Supreme Court in April, when justices took up the constitutionality of specific lethal injection drug. As a result, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons doesn't have the drugs to carry out lethal injection.“The Department of Justice has been conducting a review of the federal protocol used by the Bureau of Prisons, and has had a moratorium in place on federal executions in the meantime,” Patrick Rodenbush, a spokesman for the department, told The Washington Post in a statement.If the Justice Department decides later to allow lethal injections, it will still face the same drug supply shortage that state departments of correction have been grappling with for the past several years. As For The Victims...Death penalty opponents have noted the long process that awaits not just Tsarnaev, but the hundreds of victims of the 2013 tragedy. In April, the parents of 8-year-old Martin Richard penned a passionate op-ed in the Globe pleading for the Justice Department to drop the death penalty against Tsarnaev. Richard was one of the four people killed in the bombing. His family argued that life without parole is the only way to close the book on the tragedy:We understand all too well the heinousness and brutality of the crimes committed. We were there. We lived it. The defendant murdered our 8-year-old son, maimed our 7-year-old daughter, and stole part of our soul. We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives. We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring.After Friday's verdict, bombing survivor Melida Arrendondo told Bloomberg News it wasn't a comfort that she and other victims must now buckle in for the appeals process.“This seems like another burden that will drag on,” Arrendondo said.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified Martin Richard as ""Richard Martin."" We regret the error."
