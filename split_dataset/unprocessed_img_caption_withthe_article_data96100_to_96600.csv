Or put another way, in terms of one's overall quality of life, spirit, and degree of personal fulfillment, some things play a much more significant role than feelings of happiness. I'll get to that in a minute.In my freshman year of college I read a book that changed my life. It was at the time the most important book that I had ever read, and it continues to be to this day. It's entitled, Man's Search for Meaning and it was written in 1946 by the Viennese psychiatrist and neurologist, Viktor Frankl.Frankl had been recently liberated from a concentration camp in which he had been imprisoned for several years, and shortly after receiving news that the Nazis executed his entire family, including his wife, pregnant with their first child, his brother, and both of his parents, as well as many other relatives.What Frankl personally witnessed and experienced during his incarceration led him to a conclusion that to this day stands as one of the most succinct and profound statements ever written about the human condition. That is that ""everything can be taken from a [person] but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances."" The circumstances in which Frankl lived during the war years, were beyond horrific. His writings were not simply expressions of a theory, but were grounded in his daily self-reflection on his own experience and his observation of countless other inmates and how they did or did not manage to survive unspeakable conditions.Frankl discovered that the primary variable that influenced the likelihood of whether his fellow prisoners survived of perished had to do with the degree to which they were identified with a purpose larger than themselves, particularly one in which they saw themselves as contributing in some meaningful way to the enhancement of the quality of others' lives. He claimed that those prisoners who suffered the physical and mental cruelties of the camps and managed to survive also tended to be the ones who sought and found the wherewithal to share the little they had, a comforting word, a crust of bread, or an act of simple kindness with others. Giving to others was of course not a guarantee of survival, but it was a way of sustaining a sense of purpose and meaning in the face of overwhelmingly brutal conditions. Without purpose of meaning, our life spirit diminishes and we become more vulnerable to physical and mental stressors.While it's natural to prefer happiness to suffering, Frankl recognized the paradox that a sense of purpose and meaning often is born out of adversity and pain, and he understood the potentially redemptive value in suffering. The recognition that there can be some good that comes out of our most painful experiences can be the central factor in the process of transforming suffering into purpose.In the January 2013 issue of The Atlantic , in her article entitled, ""There's More to Life than Being Happy,"" Emily Esfahani Smith writes, ""Research has shown that having meaning and purpose in life increases overall well-being and life satisfaction, improves mental and physical health, enhances resiliency and self esteem, and decreases the chances of depression."" She goes on to state that according to recent research, ""the single-minded pursuit of happiness is ironically leaving people less happy.""Happiness is usually associated or confused with pleasure, which has to do with experiencing enjoyable feelings and sensations. We feel happy when a need or desire is fulfilled, when we get what we want. The researcher, Kathleen Vohs claims that ""Happy people get a lot of joy from receiving benefits from others, while people leading meaningful lives get a lot of joy from giving to others.""A 2011 study concluded that people who have meaning in their lives through a clearly defined purpose, rate their life satisfaction higher even when they were feeling bad, than those without a sense of purpose.Several years prior to writing his groundbreaking book, Viktor Frankl was already living from a deep sense of purpose that at times required him to forego personal desires in favor of his commitment to fulfill other, purpose-driven intentions. In 1941 Austria had already been occupied by the Germans for three years. Frankl knew that it was just a matter of time before his parents would be taken away. At the time he was already distinguished internationally for his contributions to the field of psychology and had a widespread reputation. He had applied for and was given a visa to America where he and his wife would be safe from the Nazis, but as it became evident that his parents would inevitably be sent to a concentration camp, he recognized that he had to choose between rejecting his visa to America to help his parents make the painful and difficult adjustment to the camps, or to go to America to save himself and his wife and further pursue his career. After considerable deliberation he understood that his deepest purpose was in his loyalty and responsibility to his aging parents. He made the decision to put aside his individual pursuits, stay in Vienna and dedicate his life to being in service to his parents and later, to other inmates in the camps.Frankl's experiences during this time served to form the basis of his theoretical and clinical work that has since profoundly impacted on the quality of life for millions of people worldwide.Viktor Frankl died in 1997 at the age of 92. He spent his post-war years continuing to embody his commitment to serve through his teaching, his writings, and many other forms of contribution to the welfare of humanity. His life served as a stunning example of one man's extraordinary capacity to find and create meaning in a life that was at times characterized by indescribable physical and emotional suffering. He was literally living proof of the claim that we all have the power to choose our attitude in any given set of conditions, regardless of what the circumstances are, and that the choice that we make is the determining factor in the quality of our life. While there may be times when the ability to choose to feel happy doesn't seem available to us, there is never a time in which we lack the ability to choose our attitude. Frankl's life, more so than his written words, affirms that we all possess the power to make and act on this choice. It was, beyond any fragment of a doubt, a life well-lived."

Two days later, President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi and Prime Minister Khaled Bahah tendered their resignation to the Yemeni parliament. On February 6, the Houthis announced they were dissolving parliament and that a Revolutionary Committee led by Mohammed Ali al-Houthi would assume full control of the government. The coup culminated a four year long civil war, although its origins went back to 2004, which had seen the Ansar Allah militia take possession of the northwest corner of Yemen along with the capital, Sana'a and de facto control of much of the rest of the country.The Houthis belong to the Zaidi branch of Shia Islam. Although the Zaidi are a uniquely Yemeni sect, they share many similarities with the Shia communities in Iran and Iraq. They make up about one-third of the population. Iran has been a strong backer of the Houthi militia. The Hadi government had claimed that Tehran has supplied money and arms as well as training, via the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force and Hezbollah militants, at a secret base in Eritrea. It also claimed that it had evidence that a number of arms shipments, destined for the Houthis, that had been seized by the government had originated in Iran. Both Iran and Hezbollah denied those charges. The Hadi government had been seen as strongly pro-American and had been actively cooperating with the United States in its conflict with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The U.S. was alleged to have operated a ""secret base"" from which it conducted drone attacks against AQAP militants as well as the related Ansar al-Sharia group. The drone that was used in the 2011 attack against Anwar al-Awlaki, AQAP's leader, was actually launched from a ""secret"" CIA operated air field in Saudi Arabia. Although it's hardly a secret anymore as you can find it on Google maps.The base is just across the border from Yemen. References in the media to a ""base in Yemen"" may be describing a forward command post used to coordinate drone attacks rather than a facility where the drones are actually based. In addition, the U.S. also has special forces units stationed in Yemen. The overthrow of the Hadi government was seen as a significant setback for American interests in Yemen, and especially to the covert war it had been conducting against AQAP.Following the coup the U.S., as well as several other European countries, closed their embassies and withdrew their diplomatic personnel. American diplomats organized a hasty departure to the Sana'a international airport where they boarded whatever international flights had open seating. The marine security guards were required to relinquish their weapons before being allowed to depart and Houthi militants seized embassy vehicles that were left at the airport. The embassy, however, was not touched, and at least American diplomats were spared the indignity of being paraded blindfolded through the streets of Sana'a. In an epilogue all too disturbingly familiar, Houthi militants celebrated their success with street demonstrations and the accompanying mandatory ""Death to America"" chants.Privately however, the Houthi told the United States that they wanted U.S. special forces in Yemen to stay and that the U.S. could continue to operate the ""covert drone base"" there. Moreover, they also indicated they were prepared to work with the United States in the ongoing operation against AQAP. For the Houthi, looking to consolidate their position in Yemen and fearful that the situation in Yemen could quickly degenerate into a Houthi/Shia versus AQAO/Sunni all out civil war, a quiet alliance with the United States made a lot of sense. The other two main political groupings in Yemen, the largely secular, Marxist inspired Southern Movement, and the traditional Sunni tribes in the east and center, are unlikely to be much help in fighting AQAP. Washington now finds itself considering a de facto alliance with a conservative, jihadist, Iran backed, Shia militia -- much as it has already done with similar, Iranian backed, Shia militias in Iraq.The issue underscores a much broader trend that has been steadily gaining momentum in the Middle East, a fundamental realignment of the regions politics along a Shia-Sunni axis. For much of the postwar history of the Middle East, the regions politics were played out within the framework of Soviet-American Cold War rivalry. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict quickly became the centerpiece of that rivalry with Soviet and American client states lining up behind their respective patrons. Israel, after a brief flirtation with the Soviet Union, quickly aligned itself with the United States. Secular, socialist ""front line states"" like Egypt and Syria found common ground with Moscow. The Jordanians, a conservative monarchy never quite comfortable with the Kremlin's communist rhetoric and always better adept at maneuvering between rival superpowers, managed to stay in everyone's good graces. Lesser, although not necessarily less bloody conflicts, Syria-Lebanon, Iraq-Iran, Iraq-Kuwait and civil wars in Ethiopia, Somalia, and Yemen, resulted in similar alignments of each superpower's respective proxies. The arrangement, bloody conflicts notwithstanding, was remarkably stable. From time to time countries would switch camps, Egypt flipped from the Soviet camp to the American as a result of the Camp David Peace accords, and Iran flipped from the American to (more or less) the Soviet camp as a consequence of the Iranian revolution. Ethiopia flipped from the Western camp to the Soviet and back to the Western camp. Somalia flipped from the Soviet camp to the Western camp and then flipped into chaos. On the whole, these arrangements, along with Middle Eastern governments and their leaders, proved to be remarkably long lived, typically continuing for decades. Historians are often prone to point out ""inflection points,"" historical events that have a disproportionately significant impact on a country or region. These are events that ""reset a region's historical trajectory"" in a new, and often, wholly unexpected way. Invariably the significance of such inflection points does not emerge until years after the fact. Such is the benefit of hindsight. In recent years it has become obvious that there have been two significant inflection points in recent Middle Eastern history. The first was the 1979 Iranian revolution. Not only did that revolution replace a Western ally with a militant anti-Western and anti-American government, but more significantly it heralded the rise of political Shi'ism -- combining the power of a large, oil rich nation state with a militant pro-Shia political agenda. The second event was the American led invasion of Iraq in 2003, which resulted in the fall of the Hussein government and its replacement by a Shia dominated one. Not only did the overthrow of Saddam Hussein remove an existential threat to Iran, but its replacement by a pro-Iranian Shiite government proved to be the linchpin in a broad, geopolitical arc of Iranian influence across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories that came to be called the ""Shia Arc"" or the ""Iranian Arc of Influence,"" and was seen as a clear manifestation of a ""Shia revival.""At the moment there are three civil wars in the Middle East -- Iraq, Syria and Yemen -- that pit Sunni dominated militias and military forces against Shia based ones. In addition, significantly large Shia minorities in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the Emirates are growing increasingly restive. In Bahrain, a key American ally in the Gulf, Shias are in the majority and outnumber Sunnis by better than 2 to 1. Bahrain has seen a widespread and growing, Iranian backed, Shia militancy. Significantly, most of Saudi Arabia's largest oil fields are in regions where the population is predominantly Shia. Iran's growing assertiveness in the Middle East in general, and in the Persian Gulf in particular, especially among the Shia population there, has brought it into sharp conflict with Saudi Arabia. It has also raised Saudi fears that any American reconciliation with Iran would come at their expense and cement Tehran's role as the preeminent local power in the Gulf.At the same time as this growing rivalry between Tehran and Riyadh, a second equally significant rivalry is emerging between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two historical American allies, for the de facto leadership of the Sunni world. Historically, Saudi Arabia has been perceived as the leader of the Sunni community, a role it could claim both as a consequence of its stewardship of Islam's holy cities of Mecca and Medina as well as its prodigious oil wealth and its funding of Islamic charities and new mosques around the world. Turkey's president, Recep Erdogan, however, has increasingly tried to position himself as the de facto leader of the Muslim ummah -- the billion plus Sunni community. On February 12, for example, during a press conference in Mexico City, Erdogan sharply criticized President Obama, Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Kerry for ""their silence"" after the murder of three Muslim students at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. American officials were flabbergasted by Erdogan's comments on what they say as a purely, domestic criminal matter. His comments were carried live on Turkish television, however, preempting currently running programming, as well as elsewhere in the Middle East, underlining his self-assumed role as leader and spokesman of the worldwide Sunni community.Ankara's competition with Riyadh has sparked a range of additional conflicts between them, from sponsorship of different militant groups in the Syrian civil war to a competition in Cuba to see who can get Havana's permission to build a new mosque in the city. The two governments have sharply different views on the Muslim Brotherhood. The Saudi's have always seen the Brotherhood as anti-monarchy and an existential threat to the continuation of the Saud dynasty. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party trace its roots to the Turkish branch of the Muslim Brotherhood and has historically been a strong supporter of the organization. Lately, however, given its concern for the need to build a broad, Islamist coalition to oppose both al-Qaeda and Islamic State, Riyadh has been signaling that it may soften its historic opposition to the Muslim Brotherhood.Given Russia's long standing ties with Syria and Iran, at first glance, it would seem that the Kremlin is aligning itself with the ""Shia"" pole of the growing Sunni-Shia rivalry. In reality, Moscow sees significant opportunities in the Middle East given both what it perceives as the incoherence of American policy there and the political realignment that is taking place. In recent months, Russia has reached out to improve its relationship with Turkey, a longstanding foe, by offering preferential pricing of natural gas exports as well as the possibility of a new natural gas pipeline to carry Russian natural gas to the Mediterranean. Egypt too, has been the focus of particularly active Russian diplomatic attention. Some of America's European allies have also seen the lack of a clear American strategy as an opportunity to better position themselves with the Sunni Arab kingdoms in the Gulf. This diplomatic initiative has resulted in the curious situation of a French Socialist government taking a particularly hard line on the negotiations over the Iranian nuclear program as a way of assuring the Saudi's and the Gulf states that they would stand in the way of any ""unreasonable"" White House concessions to the Iranian government.The rivalry between Islamic State and al-Qaeda will also have an impact on the larger issues of Shia-Sunni relations in the Middle East. Islamic State has made its attacks on Shias a critical element of its strategy of terror and jihadist violence. Al Qaeda, on the other hand, has generally ignored the historic antagonisms between Shias and Sunnis in favor of creating a broad Muslim coalition against what they perceived as the ""far enemy"" -- the United States. The Islamic State's virulent anti-Shia strategy may force al Qaeda to adopt a similar orientation as it competes with Islamic State for the heart and soul of international jihadists. This already seems to be happening in Pakistan, which has the second largest population of both Shias and Sunnis in the Islamic world, (India actually has the second largest population of Muslims overall, second only to Indonesia) where al-Qaeda affiliated groups appear to be leading a campaign of rising violence against the Shia community there.North and West Africa have recently become the centers of new jihadist inspired conflict. In West Africa the militant jihadist group, Boko Haram, has repeatedly praised Islamic State and there have been reports that it has officially pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi and recognized him as Caliph of the Muslim ummah. Islamic State has not, however, publically acknowledged that allegiance. Nonetheless, Boko Haram has emerged as a smaller version of Islamic State and is increasingly adopting the ""Islamic State template,"" especially in regard to its social media. In Libya, al-Qaeda and Islamic State inspired groups are waging war both against each other as well as the ""government"" of Libya; in as far as there is one. North and West Africa are overwhelmingly Sunni, and the small percentage of Shias gets progressively smaller as you travel west. While there are few Shia communities in North Africa to target, the growing rivalry between al-Qaeda and Islamic State there may precipitate more anti-Shia violence elsewhere as each side tries to burnish its claim for the leadership of international jihadism. For the United States the growing Sunni-Shia rivalry in the Middle East offers both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, it allows the United States to play a balancing role, manipulating, assisting and constraining both sides, as great powers are prone to do, in pursuit of its own strategic objectives there. On the other hand, the rivalry cuts across the present alignment in the Middle East, threatens to put historic American allies at odds with one another, and often creates de facto alliances with countries or their proxies that Washington has been at odds with. At a basic level, the U.S. finds itself in a situation where it is fighting radical, Salafist-inspired jihadist movements, with an explicit anti-American agenda, that its historic Sunni Arab allies have, at times, been ambivalent about attacking. Moreover, many of their citizens are sympathetic towards these jihadist groups and they have often provided them, privately, with financial assistance. On the other hand, it also finds its agenda in the region increasingly aligned, at least in as far as fighting Salafist jihadists is concerned, with Shia militias. Historically, outside of Lebanon and Iraq, these militias have not expressly targeted Americans for violence but their sponsor, Iran, has usually been diametrically opposed to U.S. policies and interests in the Middle East. At this point, we are not even in a position to argue that ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"", in fact, we're not even entirely sure who all of our enemies and our friends are. In this rapidly changing environment, U.S. foreign policy needs to be both fresh and nimble. Sadly, it has been neither, preferring instead a seat of the pants approach that only serves to emphasize its policy inconsistency and its strategic incoherence."

Against the rest of the Democratic field, she's the overwhelming favorite in every poll that's ever been conducted. Of course, anytime we talk about a ""Democratic field,"" we should really say, ""insofar as one exists."" Her competition -- so far a dimly lit constellation of long shots (and perhaps the current vice president) -- isn't shaping up as a particularly robust challenge. Clinton plays a role in that simply by looming on the landscape. As has been discussed previously, Clinton has the power to ""freeze the field"" -- meaning that her dominance is such that Democratic party elites and mega-donors are loath to invest in a competitor, creating a sort of vicious cycle in which no viable competitors can truly present themselves.There is a very real possibility that Clinton could face only a nominal challenge in a Democratic primary, and potentially none at all. And that's produced an interesting phenomenon among the members of the political media who, expecting a competitive primary to generate monetizable content and grist for ""The Narrative,"" find themselves somewhere in the middle of a story that doesn't seem to have started. This is how you can understand the constant attention given to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- a woman who is not running for president -- as a ""foil"" for Clinton. Every great protagonist needs an antagonist, and the political press would dearly love, if possible, to will one into being. Elsewhere, there are the Hot Takes, suffused by the media's drug of choice, counter-intuition. Are all the advantages that Clinton secretly holds actually disadvantages in disguise? Is Clinton's ability to quelch all viable contenders for the Democratic nomination actually the Achilles heel that will lead to her undoing? A better question might be: Are all the people offering that opinion simply planting a flag for a future ""Told ya so"" story down the line?I think it's fair to say that most of us, if we wanted something important (like, say, a job), wouldn't spend much time regretting the news that we were the only person in the running. Just about everyone would prefer to win in a blowout. At the same time, there is something that we all understand instinctually about the nature of competition: It tests mettle. And the old eyeball test informs us of the virtues of tested mettle. When we look at the 27-1 Gonzaga University men's basketball team alongside the other basketball teams in the top four of the NCAA's national rankings, many of us downgrade the Bulldogs because we know that they didn't play against the same level of competition as Kentucky, Virginia and Duke did. So, in the back of our mind, Gonzaga looms as a paper tiger.That said, eventually Gonzaga is going to have ample opportunity to show that they're superior to their competition -- just like Clinton will, even if she runs in an uncontested primary.Of course, the fact that there isn't already vigorous competition for Clinton to face tells us a few potentially ominous things. First and foremost, it shows that the Democratic Party's bench is not terribly deep right now. Elections are, at bottom, a competition of ideas -- one in which a losing candidate's vision may persist beyond the candidate's own electoral hopes. That's a good thing for any political party. Furthermore, a quickly decided primary could negatively impact state-level political organizing, which in turn would impact the vitality of down-ticket campaigns. But let's stick with the question: Is Hillary running virtually unopposed a bad thing? As Vox's Matt Yglesias points out, having a competitive primary means ""real debates, real media strategy, real policy rollouts, and all the other accompaniments of a presidential nominating congress."" He goes on to note that ""competition"" in this instance goes well beyond simply having other credible opponents:A vigorous primary campaign is a means through which, among other things, the key potential vulnerabilities in a candidate's biography get aired. Was Clinton lying about her opposition to gay marriage the way David Axelrod says Obama was? Have too many years at the pinnacle of American politics left her out of touch with middle class struggles? Can she distance herself from Obama administration foreign policy initiatives that didn't work out (settlement freeze? Russia reset?) without sounding disloyal or ineffectual? Can she answer questions about the complicated finances underlying her husband's foundation?Here's the thing: All of that is smart-sounding stuff. It's thoughtful argument that appeals to our instincts. You can take that to a Beltway soiree or the set of a Sunday morning talk show, and with a little charm, you'll hold up. And yet, it's still really just gut feelings. It's still that instinct that pushes you to take an at-large team from the ACC deeper in the tourney than the one-loss Western Conference champions -- a good enough gamble that could, nonetheless, leave your bracket in tatters.And it's worth pointing out that over on the GOP side, Republican elites are making their own set of gambles with their primary. The Republican National Committee's interpretation of their 2012 cycle woes has led them to believe that the long primary cost them dearly. The RNC believes that their primary afforded too many fleeting also-rans too much media coverage, that the length of the competition provided too many opportunities for their party to be shown in a bad light, and that ultimately, everything conspired to force their nominee into a bunch of positions from which the extrication was too difficult. They have, subsequently, undertaken a number of moves to ""fix"" this problem, and while they've not created a situation in which one candidate has a massive advantage over everyone else, it's still a drive toward limiting the competition, all based on some gut feelings.Can we get closer to the truth of how, if at all, a competitive primary brings benefits -- or pitfalls -- to candidates? Well, if we turn to political science, there seems to be one constant notion: A competitive primary is very good for candidates, right up to where the competitive primary becomes a divisive primary, at which point the benefits of competition tend to fade. The virtues of competitive primaries are hotly debated, as it turns out. Back in February of 2008, The Monkey Cage's John Sides embarked on an exploration of the topic, noting that the most relevant research at the time pointed to other factors as being far more determinative of success in a general election. From a gambler's point of view, the health of the economy and the popular regard for the presidential incumbent matter a lot more than what happens during a primary.But Josh Putnam, proprietor of Frontloading HQ, nevertheless saw something interesting in the notion that a competitive primary could take a dark, blowback-producing turn. Just as the RNC concluded after the 2012 cycle, the factor that fascinated Putnam in 2008 was timing -- the notion that on a long enough timeline, a competitive primary eventually, maybe inevitably, turns divisive. Per Putnam:At what point does the positive competitiveness of the race for delegates turn into the negative, party-splitting divisiveness? Should Clinton do well in Ohio and Texas on Tuesday, then 2008 may have reached that point for the Democrats. But in the Super Tuesday era (1988/1992-2004), no challenger has been afforded such an opportunity. That era was marked by frontrunners who were able to snuff out insurgencies before competitiveness turned to divisiveness. ... [Walter] Mondale quelled Gary Hart before a movement started (No, this isn't within the era I defined above but it is a good example.). George W. Bush kept [John] McCain at bay. And [John] Kerry silenced John Edwards. Competitiveness yielded to reality in all three cases before divisiveness took hold or could attempt to take hold.It's almost as if there's a sort of ""uncanny valley"" phenomenon happening, in which competition elevates everyone until it gets too hot or turns too personal. There's a sweet spot: Ideally, you want your level of competition to be challenging, but not bedeviling. You want the primary race to look like a collegial bit of tire-kicking, not a campaign in which you're sending arsonists out to torch the rival dealership. So maybe all of the people who continually pen that ""Elizabeth Warren versus Hillary Clinton"" fan fiction are onto something, instinctually: They have a sense that the Jim Webbs and Martin O'Malleys of the world might not make it out of Iowa and that Clinton needs someone who can stay in the game long enough to make it to Super Tuesday. But not much further than that.In the end, that data-driven conclusion about competitive primaries that we really want remains elusive -- or at the very least, not strong enough to talk us out of our horse-sense feelings on the matter. But let's return to one last study, cited by The Monkey Cage's Jonathan Robinson, about that 2008 competition between Clinton and Barack Obama:Using a survey that tracked individual voters from the primary to the general election, Michael Henderson, D. Sunshine Hillygus, and Trevor Thompson ... examine whether and why Clinton supporters did or did not support Obama in the general election. They find that 71% of Clinton supporters ended up voting for Obama. Moreover, supporters of Clinton and the other Democratic candidates were no more likely to stay home on Election Day. The most important factors that predicted a vote for McCain among supporters of the other Democratic candidates were not frustration with the primary election’s outcome but ideology and political issues, especially the Iraq War.All of that suggests that even though the 2008 Democratic primary got fiercely competitive, it still stoked an energy that lasted throughout the election cycle, ensuring that Democratic voters stayed engaged over the long haul. Perhaps what a political party, ideally, wants out of a primary is a contest where the competitiveness fosters some amount of voter engagement without tipping into a grotesque spectacle that leaves those who had engaged with it feeling nauseous, discouraged and just plain done with politics for the year. Handled the right way, a contested primary creates a number of ""products"" organically that would need to be manufactured by other means in a non-contested primary. Competition helps to present those Big Ideas to the electorate, a vision of the future for which to fight. It breeds passion and gets voters to start using those muscles of commitment, which eventually get them out of the house and to the polls on Election Day. Perhaps most importantly, it allows the candidates to make connections with those activist members of the electorate, who'll use their muscles to make sure those committed voters know how to get to those polls on time.At this point, it sure looks like Hillary Clinton can grab the nomination without too much trouble. Trouble is, some trouble might be a nice thing to have.Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?"

Earlier in the week Walker announced the formation of 'Our American Revival', a new committee designed to explore the option of a presidential bid in 2016. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e9ee2100004202c96b7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's been more than two decades since Gov. Scott Walker (R) first pushed right-to-work legislation as a state lawmaker in Wisconsin. Now, all these years later, the famously anti-union governor may finally be getting his wish -- whether he likes it or not. On Tuesday, the Wisconsin state Senate is slated to take up a right-to-work bill in what's known as an extraordinary legislative session. With less deliberation than normal, the GOP-controlled chamber could pass the bill this week. The measure would then move on to the state's assembly, also controlled by Republicans, which would presumably take it up in early March.Barring a fortuitous turn of events for organized labor, the anti-union measure could reach the governor's desk next month. So why wouldn't Walker, who apparently has his eye on the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, heartily embrace legislation that's bound to please his base and diminish an already weakened labor movement in the state? Walker already crushed Wisconsin's public-sector unions in 2011 with Act 10, which stripped collective bargaining rights from most public employees. He then survived a bloody recall battle in its wake. Right-to-work could be just as divisive, with Madison potentially bursting into protests reminiscent of the Act 10 fight. In short, Walker has no need to further burnish his anti-union credentials over such controversial legislation. Indeed, Walker had said in the past that he had little interest in right-to-work, and in recent weeks he said it would be a distraction for him and the state. But after Scott Fitzgerald, the GOP Senate leader, last week announced his intention to fast-track the legislation, a Walker spokesperson confirmed on Friday that the governor would sign the bill if it came his way. The state's unions appear stunned and disgusted. Fitzgerald had previously said that if the legislation came up it would be after April, when the state would be wrestling over the budget.""My experience as leader is when you have the votes, you go to the floor -- you don’t wait around,"" Fitzgerald explained, according to the Wall Street Journal.""It's absolutely outrageous,"" said Stephanie Bloomingdale, secretary-treasurer of the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO. ""They're pushing it through in a very, very short period of time, and it's completely undemocratic. They should act transparently. They should give people the opportunity to debate this bill and the opportunity to weigh in.""Under U.S. labor law, if a workplace unionizes, the union must represent every worker in the bargaining unit, whether it wants to or not. That representation requires money and resources. What right-to-work legislation does is forbid contracts between unions and employers that require all workers to pay the union for bargaining on their behalf. Once right-to-work provides them with an out, many workers naturally choose to stop supporting the union, even if they believe in collective bargaining. After all, why pay hard-earned money for a service that the union has to provide you by law? As workers drop out, the union becomes less effectual, and the remaining workers have even less reason to remain. That's the death spiral that unions fear. Twenty-four states are now right-to-work; Wisconsin would become the 25th. The potential is freighted with symbolism, as half the country and counting would have adopted such laws. In addition to weakening unions -- the laws are widely supported by business lobbies -- right-to-work by extension weakens the Democratic Party, since organized labor remains a pillar of its base.Private-sector unionism continues to dwindle throughout the U.S., with less than 7 percent of workers in the sector now belonging to a union. As demonstrated in Michigan, right-to-work legislation -- which unions like to call ""right to work for less"" -- is hastening this demise. Republicans in that state passed a right-to-work law in 2012. According to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, union density in Michigan dropped sharply last year, with the estimated number of union members falling by 48,000, even as the state added 44,000 workers to its economy.There are many similarities between the situations in Michigan and Wisconsin. Both states historically have strong labor movements; Michigan is the cradle of the auto industry and United Auto Workers union, and Wisconsin still has above-average union density. Both states are also led by Republican governors who professed little interest in right-to-work legislation, only to later say they would sign it.Paul Secunda, a labor law professor at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, said the situation in Wisconsin is so dire for organized labor that unions have only one choice: a general strike by the state's unionized workers. Though they garnered national attention, the 2011 protests didn't manage to stop Act 10 or Walker, he noted.""I think they should shut it down,"" Secunda said. ""Public-sector workers in solidarity with private-sector workers should walk out next week. I think if the union movement has any strength left it's in the power of withholding labor. If it's not willing to do that, there's very little power they have.""Public-sector union membership has already plummeted in Wisconsin due to Act 10, since public-sector unions can no longer effectively bargain for their members. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Leadership Council 40 had nearly 32,000 members on its rolls in 2011; last year it reported a little over 13,000.  The state's AFL-CIO has protests slated for Tuesday and Wednesday at the Capitol in Madison. Legislatively, the union coalition's best chance at stopping the bill is to pick off two or three Republican votes in the Senate -- a long shot -- before it moves to the assembly, where Republicans enjoy an even wider margin.""It's important to remember those peaceful protests four years ago,"" Bloomingdale said. ""Those were union people but they were also non-union people -- grandmothers and kids and aunts and uncles -- people that wanted to speak out.""As for Walker, he's spent the recent days on the East Coast, raising money and courting leading conservatives in talks in New York and Washington, D.C. He's also weathered a round of tough press. Earlier this week he was criticized for not denouncing former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's comment that President Barack Obama does not love America. On Saturday he was criticized by liberals for saying he didn't know if Obama was a Christian.Patrick Guarasci, a Democratic strategist in Wisconsin, said that Walker's history with right-to-work has parallels to the Giuliani situation. In a gubernatorial debate with Tom Barrett (D) in 2012, Walker dodged the question when asked whether he would ever sign right-to-work legislation. He said repeatedly that it would never reach his desk. Now it very well might.Despite his iron fist with public-sector unions, and despite his White House ambitions, there are certain decisions that Walker doesn't want to make, Guarasci argued.""Either he was being coy or slippery, but you realize he was not being straightforward with what he would do,"" Guarasci said. ""You can make a strong argument that Walker doesn't want to make the call."""

It was critical for the party's survival, they said, to address an issue that was paramount to the nation's surging Hispanic population.

CMD/PRwatch quickly noted that the bill is taken almost word-for-word from the Koch corporate bill mill known as the American Legislative Exchange Council known as ""ALEC."" (See CMD's side-by side-here.)Walker's new-found enthusiasm for a decades-old effort to crush the wages of working families reminds us a few things the public needs to know about Scott Kevin Walker. 1. Walker Gets His ""Fresh"" Ideas, And His Money, From Hard-Line Ideologues and Special InterestsGovernor Walker's relationship with the billionaire Koch industrialists and one of the organizations they bankroll -- ALEC -- dates back to the 1990s. As a state legislator from 1993-2002, Walker rubbed shoulders with Koch Industries lobbyists who serve on ALEC's; corporate board and its task forces. In his first year in legislative office, Walker sponsored ""Right to Work"" legislation (1993 SB 459), followed by ""Paycheck Protection"" (1997 AB 624), and ""Truth in Sentencing"" (1997 AB 351), all parts of the ALEC lobbying agenda. He also pushed ALEC bills to privatize the state's prison system (1997 AB 634, 1999 AB 176 and AB 519); ALEC was funded by the for-profit prison industry, of course. He co-sponsored an ALEC bill (1997 AB 745) that would have prohibited all state agencies -- including universities -- from providing goods and services that could be procured from the private-sector, with rare exceptions.Then, as Milwaukee County Executive, Walker pursued an aggressive privatization agenda, another part of the ALEC wish list. In 2009, he even manufactured a budget crisis to fire the unionized county courthouse security workers and hire the scandal-plagued British corporation Wackenhut, which was also a funder of ALEC. After this move was reversed by a court arbitrator, the county had to rehire the workers and foot the bill for back pay, costing taxpayers a small fortune.After becoming Governor, Walker declared the state was ""broke"" and eviscerated public-sector unions with his Act 10 legislation. A key aspect of Act 10 Act, which prohibits the state from collecting union dues, reflects ALEC's Public Employer Payroll Deduction Policy Act. As Governor, Walker has signed a flood of ALEC bills into law (19 in his first two years alone), including anti-consumer ""tort reform"" provisions, restrictive voter ID, the Castle Doctrine more widely known as ""Stand Your Ground,"" voucher and virtual school expansions, telecom deregulation, concealed carry, the privatization of the state's economic development functions, and much more. This agenda was not indigenous to the state; it was imported entirely from the Koch/ALEC playbook.And let's not forget, Walker has taken more money from out-of-state donors than any other politician in Wisconsin history, and many of his millionaire and billionaire donors are members of the Koch Network, rebranded as ""Freedom Partners."" In Walker's 2010 race, as CMD/PRWatch documented, the Koch PAC gave Walker $43,000 -- his largest out-of-state contribution, the maximum under state law -- and then David Koch sent another $1 million to the Republican Governors Association, which spent $3.4 million attacking his opponent. The governor raised and spent some $37 million in the 2012 recall, more than three times as much as in the record-breaking 2010 race. David Koch's Americans for Prosperity (AFP) group spent at least $10 million to defend Walker in 2012, while claiming it was not involved in the election, even though the RGA was caught on tape bragging about AFP's role in the recall.In 2014, AFP announced it was spending another $900,000 in support of Walker, but the Koch total might be higher. Wisconsin Club for Growth -- with the long ties between its leader Eric O'Keefe and the Kochs -- has also been a big been a big backer of Walker's, funneling at least $9 million to affect the 2012 recall races, some of it from Koch-tied groups.2. Walker Is Duplicitous and Governs by Sneak AttackWalker has been a career politician his entire adult life. He is ceaselessly in campaign mode.He lies by omission and governs by sneak attack.After repeatedly saying during his run for governor in 2014 that he was not interesting in right to work, this week he reversed course.This is not an accident; it is his M.O.When Walker introduced his 2015-17 budget, he gave a long speech packed with detail. He neglected to mention that his bill slashed the ""the search for truth"" and the statutory language enshrining the Wisconsin Idea -- the guiding principle of the state's public university system for more than a century -- from the mission of the University of Wisconsin (UW) system (a story CMD/PRwatch broke).After the public uproar Walker first defended the language, and then said it was ""a drafting error,"" that had been overlooked by UW officials. A review of the drafting file determined that the provisions were requested by Walker aides and emails revealed that UW officials has strenuously objected to the language but were told it was a ""done deal."" Walker's ""drafting error"" excuse was given a ""pants on fire"" by Politifact.Walker also campaigned for Governor in 2010 on a promise to create 250,000 new jobs using a brown bag lunch as a prop. One of his first acts in Feb. 2011 was to crush public-sector unions, which were born in Wisconsin fifty years previously. Walker never once publicly mentioned his plans to go after public-sector workers during his entire election campaign and in fact told editorial boards, like the Oshkosh Northwestern, that he would bargain with public-sector unions.But Walker was accidentally caught on tape behind closed doors, with billionaire donor Diane Hendricks (part of the Koch network) in Jan. 2011 admitting that he was pursuing a ""divide and conquer,"" strategy to make Wisconsin a Republican stronghold by first going after the public-sector unions, then going after private-sector ones.Walker's union-busting Act 10 makes it prohibitively difficult for unions to re-certify and has cut public-sector union membership in half in the county surrounding the Capitol. Now Walker is going after private-sector unions. Notably, the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity group is pushing for right to work and connected to a new front group popping up in the state.3. Walker's Been under Criminal Investigation Since His First Day in the Governor's MansionIn his first run for Governor, when Walker served as the Milwaukee County Executive, her was caught up in a headline-grabbing elections scandal. The Milwaukee District Attorney, a Democrat who has been aggressive in pursuing Democratic Milwaukee officials for corruption, established that Walker's top aide Tim Russell had set up a secret Wi-Fi system in the County Executive's office which allowed an array of staff to secretly conduct campaign work and avoid open records laws, while being paid by taxpayers to conduct their official duties. Six Walker staffers and associates were eventually charged and convicted on a variety of crimes uncovered during the course of the investigation, including public corruption and embezzlement. Emails in the case indicate Walker had full knowledge of the secret Wi-Fi system, operating feet from his office. ""We cannot afford another story like this one. No one can give them any reason to do another story. That means no laptops, no websites, no time away during the work day, etc."" wrote Walker to Russell when the news first broke. Russell was released from jail just weeks ago, after serving two years for embezzling funds from the state's veterans. Learn more about this case in CMD's Sourcewatch.org.A second investigation of the Walker campaign was launched in Aug. 2012.This time, a special state prosecutor with Republican credentials was chosen to lead the complex five-county investigation concerning allegations that Walker's campaign illegally coordinated with ""independent"" electoral groups, particularly Wisconsin Club for Growth (WiCFG). The nonpartisan Government Accountability Board also supported the ""John Doe"" investigation, which is similar to a grand jury, with Board Chair Gerald Nichol, a former Republican elected official, recently noting the Board was presented with ""credible, hard evidence"" that the law had been violated.Walker raised millions for WiCFG, which was being run at the time by his top campaign aide R.J. Johnson and long-term ally and friend of the Koch's, Eric O'Keefe. WiCFG funneled that money to numerous groups including Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, which cut ads for Walker and others up for recall. WiCFG has filed multiple lawsuits at the state and federal level to stymie prosecutors and run out the clock on this investigation. See a timeline here.The investigation is now before the Wisconsin Supreme, Court which is hearing four challenges to the investigation in April. However, the court's conservative majority was elected with huge financial help from the exact same big money groups under investigation. Prosecutors have asked a number of justices to recuse themselves from the case, but the matter has not yet been decided. See CMD's reporting on this important case here.The Hijacking of a StateMany in Wisconsin feel their state has been hijacked by an out-of-state special interest agenda that gets more extreme every year. Now that Walker's allies in the Wisconsin legislature are considering stripping Wisconsin's liberal chief justice of her seniority right before the court hears the Walker dark money case and targeting her in other ways, the Republican legislature is working on legal changes to the ""John Doe"" investigation rules to protect politicians from prosecution, and are actively discussing dismantle the state's nonpartisan Government Accountability Board.I can almost hear the applause from the ghost Joe McCarthy, as of yet perhaps, Wisconsin's most infamous politician."

(Photo by Vince Bucci/Invision for The Hollywood Reporter/AP Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4a5fa250000cf00390515.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are stars. And there are icons.Clint Eastwood, whose film American Sniper has polarized the nation while gaining Oscar nominations and filling the coffers of Warner Brothers, falls into the latter category, a rarefied realm.Today, Oscar day, is a rainy one in Southern California, the kind of murky day Humphrey Bogart, another icon, encountered in many of his films, so I decided to stay home and ruminate on the movies, as I used to do as a boy.Around the time I turned six, in the fall of 1971, we bought our first color television set, a Sony, which was on sale at Caldor's. Not long after that, my father, sensing correctly that I was depressed and suffering from the early stages of what is known as anhedonia, introduced me to the old Warner Brothers movies. They were being shown on Channel 5 in New York, then an independent station, now the Fox flagship.Channel 5 had a deal with the owners of the pre-1950 Warner film library, whereby it showed those classic films every weekend and sometimes during the week.Before I knew it, I entered and became captivated with the imaginative universe of James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn, John Garfield and Edward G. Robinson, the Warner stars of the 1930s and '40s. I was likely the only kid my age who was watching the old Warner films week after week. And those stars as well as supporting players like Frank McHugh, Alan Hale, Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams and actresses like Olivia De Havilland, Ann Sheridan and Alexis Smith became my friends, characters I relied on each week, people who cracked good-natured jokes and spoke in a wisecracking manner, so evocative, for the most part, of the streets of the Lower East Side.When I first started watching those films, I was not such a fan of Bogart. In the 1930s, all the way up until High Sierra in 1941, he played supporting roles, often as a cowardly villain, in so many movies: The Roaring Twenties, Angels with Dirty Faces, Bullets or Ballots, Kid Galahad, Invisible Stripes, The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse and others.In those days, early in his career, Bogart almost always portrayed characters who were less honorable than the gangsters played by his fellow actors, Cagney, Robinson and George Raft. Bogart even played second fiddle to Flynn in Virginia City, a Western, where he looked somewhat comical as a mustachioed outlaw, not unlike his equally awkward and comical turn as an outlaw in another Western, The Oklahoma Kid, where Cagney played the lead. For the record, Cagney too was better suited for gangster pictures than Westerns.In the end, though, it was Bogey who became the biggest star of all, an icon, perhaps the greatest icon of the cinema. This was true not only because he starred in some of the best films of the 1940s, like Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon and the Bogey-Bacall pictures, such as To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep.It was also because he played nuanced characters, equal parts coward and hero, as likely to evidence weakness as strength, as likely to get punched out as to deliver a punch, and as likely to be somewhat villainous and embittered as to be an optimistic good guy, like Cagney and Flynn in so many of their pictures. Unlike Cagney, Flynn and of course John Wayne, who was not based at Warners, Bogey portrayed characters who were not always so optimistic. Maybe that is why I, a depressed child, related to him and to Garfield, who even more than Bogey played haunted, morally ambiguous roles.While I was living in the parallel universe of the 1930s and '40s films, the early 1970s was taking place, and some outstanding films were being made then. One thinks of Jack Nicholson, who would gain comparisons to Bogey in Chinatown, and who depicted antiheroes in so many of his roles, Five Easy Pieces, The Last Detail and One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, where he won his first Oscar for playing a psych ward patient.It was also during that period, in the 1970s, that Clint Eastwood began directing pictures, beginning with Play Misty for Me, where he essayed the role of a disc jockey, who is stalked by a fan.Eastwood was already a huge star from the spaghetti Westerns, where he played the Man with No Name, a much more nuanced character than the roles played by John Wayne, to whom he is often compared.In the early 1970s, Eastwood also began playing a cop, Dirty Harry Callahan, whom he would portray in several films.It is worth pointing out to those, who remain mad at Eastwood for his speech to an empty chair at the 2012 Republican Convention, that Eastwood often had a woman or a minority as his partner in those Dirty Harry films.Nor has his progressive cantankerousness been limited to his early films. For example, in playing a crusty film director modeled after John Huston in 1990's White Hunter, Black Heart, Eastwood has a scene where he challenges a racist hotel manager to a fight and...allows himself to lose. How many leading men have allowed that to happen, particularly in recent years! Again, Bogart comes to mind. He allowed himself to be strong-armed and sucker-punched by Ward Bond and Barton MacLane in The Maltese Falcon, which was John Huston's directorial debut, as it turns out. In White Hunter, which depicts the filming of a fictional movie modeled after The African Queen, the film in which Bogart won his only Oscar, there is also a scene where a younger woman makes a play for Eastwood's character. At the same time, she utters bigoted remarks about Jews. Eastwood's Huston-like director, who has no doubt been yearning to have sex with her, denies himself a romp in bed and tells her how disgusted he is with her ugliness.I point all this out because ever since Eastwood engaged in his soliloquy with the empty chair, a supposed stand-in for President Obama, many people have become convinced that Eastwood is a right-wing zealot.It is true that he supported Mitt Romney, never my favorite politician, and it is true that Eastwood said at the 2012 convention that he is a conservative. But his body of work tells us otherwise. Yes, he ran as a Republican, as I recall, when he was Mayor of Carmel, and yes he supported Romney. But Eastwood, like Bogart, has always played much more modulated, contradictory and moderate characters than many realize.Besides all of his spaghetti Westerns and Dirty Harry pictures, consider Gran Torino, where his codger shows his true love for a Hmong family by sacrificing himself to the criminals in the neighborhood. Or consider Invictus, his South African rugby picture, in which Morgan Freeman, Eastwood's friend and a regular collaborator, plays a heroic yet flawed Nelson Mandela, who comes up with the idea for the country's rugby team, primarily a bunch of white men, to rally the nation, which has only just shed its apartheid past.Yes, Eastwood, like Bogart, is cantankerous. Yes, he may even be somewhat right-wing. And yes he may relish shoot 'em ups, layered with violence. It may be no surprise that, like Bogart and Chris Kyle, the deceased American sniper, Eastwood is a former serviceman himself.But Eastwood is also one of those rarities in Hollywood; he is a consummate artist, who reportedly taught himself the piano, who has scored some of his own films, who has designed properties near his home, and who of course has acted and directed in countless classics for Warner Brothers.Because of his war pictures and Westerns, he will always be perceived by some as the heir to John Wayne, but, whatever one thinks of American Sniper, Eastwood is much more subtle than some jingoistic zealot. Overall, his crotchety and textured performances and directorial efforts make Eastwood more accurately the heir to Bogart, a true icon, and we may not see the likes of him again.Enjoy the Oscars!"

Dick Cheney, Bill O'Reilly, and Rudy Giuliani represent a modern day version of the Three Stooges, take your pick who is who but for my money Cheney is Moe, O'Reilly is Larry, and Giuliani is Curly. But their antics, while reflective of the foolishness of their namesakes, have consequences that are all too real and destructive. And the dysfunction they encourage has a very strong grip on a system that has drifted into paralysis. The accompanying cynicism is only reinforced by the viciousness of their attacks upon reason, common sense and respect for the system they purport to ""love"". Cheney is the architect of the nation's most deadly blunder (Iraq) in history, O'Reilly is a boisterous bloviator of disinformation that personifies the politics of personal destruction and ideological purity, and Giuliani is a circus clown disguised as a political hack so desperate for attention that he is willing to act like a spoiled and foolish adolescent. Together they form what passes for the heart of the lunatic fringe of the current Republican Party. Together they are far less than the sum of their parts. Together they do more to discourage patriotic fervor than promote it. But make no mistake, there actions are dangerous.Together they will spearhead another in a long string of calamitous mishaps when it comes to electing the next leader of the free world. So to some perverse extent right-thinking, conscientious, and truly patriotic individuals ought to derive some degree of satisfaction knowing that the party of Lincoln will once again suffer from its own internal disintegration. But as a country are we not better than that? Cheney should be in jail, O'Reilly should be out of a job, and Giuliani should be in a home in Florida.Aside from the practical effects of their collective and individual treachery, however, it is increasingly worrisome to those who have grown weary of the rancorous partisanship that has brought our governmental and political systems to a standstill. These modern-day Stooges continue to contribute to the gross cynicism that drives participation in our electoral system down except in national elections. In a sense they are a traveling carnival of snake oil salesmen promoting de facto voter suppression which is the political elixir they peddle. They are little more than purveyors of pessimism hiding behind a veil of patriotism. Where is the outrage in the Grand Old Party that should be more appropriately labeled the Grand Obstructionist Party? Far from decrying the self-destructive activities of some of its elder statesmen, the Speaker is busy orchestrating an ill-advised and petty display of gotcha by staging a blatantly political event designed to embarrass the President. That this too will most likely further damage the GOP brand makes the maneuver all that more asinine. People are simply tired of such sinister hucksterism.Together these amateurish and vindictive gambits do more to hurt the institution of the Presidency than the President. That our political leaders are engaged in such nonsense does more to shed light on their own self-deluded notions of patriotism than anything that the opposition could do or say. That these actions drive a further wedge in the real and perceived level of political dysfunction witnessed by the general populace is both sad and dangerous. At some point the protective wall of gerrymandered congressional redistricting will fall and the exposure will wipe out many of the pompous idiots that occupy positions of responsibility and power in our representative democratic system. But until that day we as a nation will continue to languish in the toxic cesspool of politics that currently poisons our democratic well. Grow up and do the people's work and for God's sake will somebody please put a muzzle on the Three Stooges, it is neither funny nor productive."

Bush, is considering becoming a republican candidate for the 2016 presidential election.

Jeb Bush (R) pushed states to approve the controversial drilling practice known as fracking while he personally stood to profit from the practice, the Tampa Bay Times reported on Friday.According to the Times, Bush, a likely 2016 presidential contender, urged a group of New York conservatives in 2013 to support fracking, even while he was involved with a private equity group that was raising $40 million for a company acquiring fracking wells.  Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, involves drilling water, chemicals and sand into the earth to break up rocks, thus freeing oil and natural gas. Environmentalists who object to the process say that fracking releases hazardous chemicals into the water supply.“We should be celebrating this phenomenal achievement –- and we do, in North Dakota, in Pennsylvania, in south and west Texas. Some states, like here in New York, are choosing not to grow. They won’t approve fracking,” Bush told the group, according to the  New York Post. “Meanwhile, in parts of New York where huge opportunities exist for the restoration of economic activity, people languish.”Those in the audience probably didn't know that Bush co-owns a company that is a managing partner of FracStar Logistics, a company that provides sand for fracking. According to the Times, Bush's son, Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, helped found FracStar, whose name has since been changed to Proforce Energy Services. The report also notes that the former governor and his other son, Jeb Bush Jr., are co-owners of the managing group, De Soto Partners.In addition, the Tampa Bay Times highlighted a speech that Bush gave in Colorado last year, in which he said that a possible statewide referendum that could permit more restrictions on fracking was ""one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.""Bush announced last last year that he was resigning all of his corporate and nonprofit board memberships, but he is still reviewing his role in businesses in which he is a principal partner or owner. The Tampa Bay Times' report suggests that Bush remains involved with De Soto Partners.Any appearance of a conflict of interest could prove tricky for Bush as he seeks to earn the Republican presidential nomination.For example, Bloomberg reported last month that in fall 2014, as Bush was gearing up for a possible presidential run, a private equity fund that listed him as its chairman and manager was raising millions, largely from offshore private investors. According to Bloomberg's report, the fund incorporated overseas to avoid U.S. taxes. When the Tampa Bay Times asked Bush about the relationship between his policy positions and his business interests as he considers a White House bid, he said that he was making an effort to separate the two and to be transparent.""I'm unraveling from every aspect of my business, both the investing company as well as the consulting business. Pretty much there,"" he said. ""At the proper time,"" Bush added, ""should I go forward (with a run for president), I'll give the people every opportunity to look at everything and they can make their own mind up."""

Islamist fighters have exploited instability as two rival governments fight for control of territory.The group has stepped up attacks since Egypt launched air strikes on suspected militant targets in the eastern Libyan city of Derna on Monday, a day after Islamists released a video showing the execution of a group of Egyptian Coptic Christians.On Sunday, two bombs exploded at the gate of the Iranian ambassador's residence in central Tripoli. Iran's official IRNA news agency confirmed the blasts and said there had been no casualties, adding Iran had already suspended operations there.""Two devices were laid, one exploded first and then the other. The point of the second bomb was to create confusion,"" Colonel Jumaa al-Mashri from the National Security Agency told Tripoli-based al-Nabaa television.A Reuters reporter at the scene saw the second device exploding some 30 minutes after the first. Minor damage could be seen at the gate.""Soldiers of the Islamic State caliphate targeted the Iranian embassy in Tripoli,"" the group said in a statement posted with pictures of a flame on Twitter.The militants also claimed responsibility for a Grad rocket attack on Labraq airport, announced by officials on Saturday. No one was hurt. The airport is the main gateway into eastern Libya and Bayda, seat of the internationally recognized prime minister, Abdullah al-Thinni.His government and the House of Representatives, elected in June, have been working out of the east since a faction called Libya Dawn seized Tripoli in August, reinstating the previous assembly and setting up a rival administration.Last month, militants claiming affiliation with Islamic State stormed the Corinthia luxury hotel in Tripoli, killing five foreigners and at least four Libyans.Supporters of the group have also taken over government and university buildings in Sirte, a central city and birthplace of Gaddafi, according to residents.

It also has the potential to become a political risk for Hillary Rodham Clinton as she moves toward a second presidential campaign.The former secretary of state has struggled with some recent bad headlines over large donations given to the foundation by foreign governments in the past two years, and the $200 million-plus the organization has raised since 2013, ahead of her anticipated White House campaign.Republicans contend that foreign governments donating to a foundation led by a potential U.S. president creates unacceptable conflicts of interests. Also, the involvement of big money reinforces a long-standing narrative pushed by the GOP of the Clintons as a couple who frequently mix business and politics.""Unless Hillary Clinton immediately reinstates the ban on foreign countries giving to her foundation and returns the millions of dollars these governments have already donated, she's setting an incredibly dangerous precedent,"" said the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus. ""The American people are not about to elect a president in Hillary Clinton who could expose them to the demands of foreign governments because they dumped massive sums of cash into her foundation.""The foundation, which is scheduled to hold events in Morocco and Greece this spring, defended its financial support and addressed how it might function if Clinton runs for president. If she seeks office again, something taken as a given by most, the foundation said it would ensure its policies and practices are ""appropriate, just as we did when she served as secretary of state.""In 2009, when Clinton became President Barack Obama's chief diplomat, the foundation stopped raising money from foreign governments. The fundraising involving non-U.S. entities resumed in 2013, after she left the his administration.The Wall Street Journal last week reported the foundation had received money in 2014 from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman and others. The Washington Post reported the charity has raised nearly $2 billion since the former president started it in 2001. About one-third of its donations of $1 million or more come from foreign governments or non-U.S. entities, the newspaper found.Democrats say the Clintons can defend their work at the foundation because of its track record and history of tackling some of the world's biggest problems, from AIDS and clean water to hunger, educational opportunities and the protection of endangered wildlife.They also note that the foundation voluntarily discloses its donors — nonprofits are not required to do — and say there is no evidence the Clintons have used it to enrich themselves. Nearly 90 percent of the foundation's money goes toward its programming.""The foundation has done amazing work,"" said Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy, a Democrat who campaigned with Bill Clinton last year. ""It has been a unifying force in our national affairs and in our international affairs.""Yet the influx of corporate and foreign money just before a potential Hillary Clinton campaign has caused some anxiety within her party.""There was a reason they stopped taking foreign government donations when Hillary was secretary of state,"" said Mike Carberry, a Johnson County, Iowa, supervisor and former county Democratic chairman. He said the foundation should reinstate the policies used from 2009 to 2013. ""It doesn't seem right.""The foundation has strong ties with several corporations and other large foundations. Last September's annual meeting in New York was sponsored by an array of companies that regularly lobby the federal government, including financial firms HSBC Bank USA, Barclays and Deutsche Bank, as well as Fortune 500 companies such as Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Monsanto, Procter & Gamble and ExxonMobil.Goldman Sachs, whose corporate officers have played leading roles in the Treasury Department in recent years, has worked with the Clinton Foundation on the 10,000 Women Initiative aimed at helping female entrepreneurs around the globe access capital.Many of the same donors to the Clintons' political campaigns have given money to the foundation. Dennis Cheng, a former Hillary Clinton campaign fundraiser, recently left the foundation as its chief development officer and is expected to be a top fundraiser for her expected campaign.The examination of the foundation's finances come as many Democrats want Clinton to take on a more populist economic agenda that would demand more oversight of Wall Street firms. It also follows efforts by Democrats to scrutinize Republican Mitt Romney's business practices in 2012 and tie Republican candidates to millions of dollars provided by the Koch Brothers and their business interests.Beyond the headlines, many Democrats say it shows the need for Clinton to begin actively campaigning and build an apparatus better suited to rapidly respond to these types of critiques.""There's a vacuum,"" said Tom Henderson, the chairman of the Polk County, Iowa, Democrats, who noted potential candidates such as former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb are visiting soon. ""She isn't doing anything"" in Iowa, he said.___Follow Ken Thomas on Twitter: https://twitter.com/KThomasDC"

Andriy Lysenko told a briefing that the withdrawal was to begin, but did not give further details.Rebel spokesman Eduard Basurin said the pullback from both sides is to take place between Sunday and March 7, but he did not specify whether rebels had made any moves yet. There was no immediate confirmation that the withdrawal had begun.Both sides are to pull back their big guns and rockets from 25 to 70 kilometers (15 to 43 miles) away from the conflict line -- depending on the weapons' size -- creating a buffer zone of between 50 and 140 kilometers (31-87 miles).The buffer zone was a main element of a peace agreement worked out in marathon negotiations 10 days ago in Minsk, Belarus. It also calls for a full exchange of war captives. Late Saturday, 139 Ukrainian soldiers and 52 rebels were exchanged; it remains unclear how many prisoners in total are on each side and when other swaps might take place.The cease-fire that was the first element of the Minsk plan was called into effect last Sunday.Ukrainian said Russia-backed separatists violated the cease-fire a dozen times during the night with artillery and rocket attacks and an attempt to storm a Ukrainian encampment. Lysenko said one serviceman was killed and three wounded over the past day.Explosions were heard in the main rebel-held city Donetsk around dawn on Sunday and a rebel website says several buildings in the city were damaged by artillery.Despite the reported violations, the level of firing appeared to be far lower than a week ago when a cease-fire was called.Among the attacks reported by the Ukrainian military was an attempt to storm positions in the village of Shyrokyne near the port city of Mariupol. That city remains of strategic concern to Ukraine because rebel seizure of it could help establish a land corridor between mainland Russia and the Russia-annexed Crimean peninsula. "

It's become a race to the bottom.",2015-02-22,"In this photo taken Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2014, a couple walks past the headquarters of Uber in San Francisco. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e9f2260000300183c0b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"GM is worth around $60 billion, and has over 200,000 employees. Its front-line workers earn from $19 to $28.50 an hour, with benefits. Uber is estimated to be worth some $40 billion, and has 850 employees. Uber also has over 163,000 drivers (as of December -- the number is expected to double by June), who average $17 an hour in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and $23 an hour in San Francisco and New York. But Uber doesn't count these drivers as employees. Uber says they're ""independent contractors."" What difference does it make?For one thing, GM workers don't have to pay for the machines they use. But Uber drivers pay for their cars -- not just buying them but also their maintenance, insurance, gas, oil changes, tires, and cleaning. Subtract these costs and Uber drivers' hourly pay drops considerably.For another, GM's employees get all the nation's labor protections.These include Social Security, a 40-hour workweek with time-and-a-half for overtime, worker health and safety, worker's compensation if injured on the job, family and medical leave, minimum wage, pension protection, unemployment insurance, protection against racial or gender discrimination, and the right to bargain collectively.Not to forget Obamacare's mandate of employer-provided health care.Uber workers don't get any of these things. They're outside the labor laws.Uber workers aren't alone. There are millions like just them, also outside the labor laws -- and their ranks are growing. Most aren't even part of the new Uberized ""sharing"" economy.They're franchisees, consultants, and free lancers.They're also construction workers, restaurant workers, truck drivers, office technicians, even workers in hair salons.What they all have in common is they're not considered ""employees"" of the companies they work for. They're ""independent contractors"" -- which puts all of them outside the labor laws, too. The rise of ""independent contractors"" is the most significant legal trend in the American workforce -- contributing directly to low pay, irregular hours, and job insecurity.What makes them ""independent contractors"" is the mainly that the companies they work for say they are. So those companies don't have to pick up the costs of having full-time employees.But are they really ""independent""? Companies can manipulate their hours and expenses to make them seem so. It's become a race to the bottom. Once one business cuts costs by making its workers ""independent contractors,"" every other business in that industry has to do the same -- or face shrinking profits and a dwindling share of the marketSome workers prefer to be independent contractors because that way they get paid in cash. Or they like deciding what hours they'll work.Mostly, though, they take these jobs because they can't find better ones. And as the race to the bottom accelerates, they have fewer and fewer alternatives. Fortunately, there are laws against this. Unfortunately, the laws are way too vague and not well-enforced.For example, FedEx calls its drivers independent contractors.Yet FedEx requires them to pay for the FedEx-branded trucks they drive, as well as the FedEx uniforms they wear, and FedEx scanners they use -- along with insurance, fuel, tires, oil changes, meals on the road, maintenance, and workers compensation insurance. If they get sick or need a vacation, they have to hire their own replacements. They're even required to groom themselves according to FedEx standards. FedEx doesn't tell its drivers what hours to work, but it tells them what packages to deliver and organizes their workloads to ensure they work between 9.5 and 11 hours every working day.If this isn't ""employment,"" I don't know what the word means.In 2005, thousands of FedEx drivers in California sued the company, alleging they were in fact employees and that FedEx owed them the money they shelled out, as well as wages for all the overtime work they put in.Last summer, a federal appeals court agreed, finding that under California law -- which looks at whether a company ""controls"" how a job is done along with a variety of other criteria to determine the real employment relationship -- the FedEx drivers were indeed employees, not independent contractors.Does that mean Uber drivers in California are also ""employees""? That case is being considered right now. What about FedEx drivers and Uber drivers in other states? Other truck drivers? Construction workers? Hair salon workers? The list goes on. The law is still up in the air. Which means the race to the bottom is still on.It's absurd to wait for the courts to decide all this case-by-case. We need a simpler test for determining who's an employer and employee.I suggest this one: Any corporation that accounts for at least 80 percent or more of the pay someone gets, or receives from that worker at least 20 percent of his or her earnings, should be presumed to be that person's ""employer.""Congress doesn't have to pass a new law to make this the test of employment. Federal agencies such as the Labor Department and the IRS have the power to do this on their own, through their rule making authority. They should do so. Now. ROBERT B.
