0,WORLDPOST,Far-Right Blame Game Distracts From France's Underlying Divisions,Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/france-divisions-far-right_n_6438452.html,,2015-01-13,"A French national flag and flowers remain hung at the statue named 'Le triomphe de la Republique' (Republic Triumph) by French artist Jules Dalou, in the Place de la Nation (Nation square), on January 12, 2015 a day after demonstrators put during a unity rally 'Marche Republicaine' in tribute to the 17 victims of a three-day killing spree by homegrown Islamists. France announced an unprecedented deployment of thousands of troops and police to bolster security at 'sensitive' sites including Jewish schools Monday, a day after marches gathering nearly four million people countrywide. AFP PHOTO/ JOEL SAGET (Photo credit should read JOEL SAGET/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14352240000330024fa50.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The streets of France rang with cries for unity this weekend, as more than 4 million people marched in a defiant response to three days of terror that left 17 people dead. French officials said Sunday's march in Paris was the largest in the nation's recent history.""National unity is vital at such a time, because the plans of the terrorists go beyond violence and seek to sow fear,"" French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said last week, amid the deadly attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and subsequent twin hostage crisis. Yet for all the emphasis on unity, the attacks have also brought renewed attention to the widening social and political divides in France. As the violence was perpetrated by three French men with immigrant parents and a violent interpretation of Islam, far-right parties across Europe have argued that they've been proven right about the threats posed by Islamic extremism and immigration.""I have been warning of the danger of Muslim fundamentalism in our country for years,"" said Marine Le Pen, leader of France's National Front party, in the wake of the attacks. Le Pen's deputy, Florian Philippot, told French radio: ""Anyone who says Islamist radicalism has nothing to do with immigration is living on another planet."" Meanwhile, the political opponents of far-right parties across Europe have accused those parties of exploiting the attack to sow fear between communities.Though French society does, indeed, have deepening schisms, many analysts say this has little to do with the dire warnings of the far right. The hard-liners' focus on religious differences can obscure the country's underlying socio-economic divisions, Anand Menon, a professor of West European Politics at King's College London, told The WorldPost. France's economic decline after the 2008 financial crisis has reinforced the gulf between the employed, who have relatively generous social benefits, and the growing numbers of unemployed, especially among youth and minorities. ""There is a growing division between the economic insiders and outsiders,"" Menon told The WorldPost. ""The outsiders include a disproportionate number of North Africans living in the horrendous suburbs of Paris -- which are almost like another country.""The banlieues, or suburbs, of Paris are home to many impoverished immigrant communities, and have high levels of unemployment and crime. The banlieues erupted into major riots in the 1980s and again in 2005.""We have a terrible problem in France of disenfranchised young people, with no opportunities,"" Olivier Roy, an expert in political Islam, told The New York Times last week. ""Many of them start off in petty delinquency, but for some of them radical Islam is a way to find a second life.""Meanwhile, the National Front has tapped into discontent over those same economic disparities, but blames immigration for making the problem worse (an argument of which many economists are skeptical). A significant economic divide exists between rural and urban France, and last year, Le Pen made a point of touring impoverished rural areas, which she labelled ""forgotten France,"" according to the BBC. The party's popularity has surged.In France, as in other European countries, politicians and the media frequently treat Muslims and immigrants as one and the same. Yet most immigrants to France are not from Muslim-majority countries. Nearly half of new immigrants to France in 2012 were Europeans, according to the French national statistics agency INSEE. The agency notes that the number of new immigrants to France was stable between 2004 to 2009 and rose between 2009 and 2012, mainly due to an influx of Europeans after the financial crisis.While France does not keep official statistics on religious affiliation, statistics indicate that a growing number of French Muslims are also French citizens. The French Muslim population is estimated to be the largest in Western Europe -- approximately 7.5 percent of the population, compared to an estimated 5 percent in Germany and the United Kingdom. French Muslims are predominantly North African, the descendants of migrants from former French colonial territories. By contrast, Britain's Muslim population is historically from South Asia, reflecting the country's own colonial past, and Germany has a greater proportion of guest workers from Turkey. Such nuances get lost, though, when political leaders do things like comparing Muslim immigration to the Nazi occupation of France, or saying that the onus is on Muslims to prove that ""you can be French and Muslim and still respect secular rules.""Muslim communities across Europe are grappling with a number of serious problems, including radicalization by extremist groups and populist backlash against Islam. France is reported to have the greatest number of Muslims going to fight alongside extremist groups in Syria, although the percentage of French Muslims who have gone off for that reason is about the same as the percentages in the U.K. and the Netherlands, according to one estimate by CNN. At the same time, far-right groups are growing in visibility and popularity across Europe, and attacks against French Muslims are on the rise. The uptick in racist violence has not only targeted Muslims. France also has Europe's largest Jewish population, and many French Jews fear that a surge of anti-Semitic attacks is in the offing. Violence against Roma communities has also escalated in recent years.Nicholas Dungan, a senior fellow and France expert at the Atlantic Council, argues that the root cause of rising racism is a general malaise about the country's prospects. ""If you look don't think things will get better, you look to blame someone else,"" he told The WorldPost. ""France has been in a state of drift for some time now, and that drift has led to divisions.""Perhaps surprisingly, the people of France have a relatively high opinion of the Muslims in their country, according to a Pew survey in March 2014. Pew found that 72 percent of the French regard French Muslims favorably -- a higher percentage than found in Italy, Greece, Spain, Poland, Germany or the U.K. At the same time, a similar percentage of French respondents -- 74 percent -- believe that Islam is incompatible with French values, according to an IPSOS survey in 2013. Dungan argues that there is no contradiction between these statistics. ""French people are politically sophisticated enough to make a distinction between Muslims and fundamentalists,"" he said. ""There is a lot of consistency in saying, 'We believe that Muslims are perfectly capable of being good members of society, but we don't think the values of Islam' -- and they're likely thinking of extreme examples -- 'fit with our values,'"" he said. This is reflective of wider political debates in France about the role of religion. Historically, France has drawn a strict separation between private religious practice and the secular public sphere. This has caused tensions with religious communities -- for example, many Muslims are displeased about recent bans on  in schools and face veils in public. French national identity is particularly rooted in the founding values of the Republic: liberty, equality and fraternity. Dungan argues that France is beset by an identity crisis after struggling to articulate these values in the modern era, noting a failure of political leadership, economic problems and a sense that France has faded on the world stage. ""If France does not excel, France does not exist,"" he remarked, characterizing French national pride.Many commentators have warned of the risk of further polarization following last week's killings. ""The main impact may be to use the attacks as an excuse to blame Islam and immigration for broad anxieties about where things are going in Europe today,"" warned John R. Bowen, sociocultural anthropologist at Washington University St. Louis, in a school publication.Others, though, are more optimistic. Several Parisians told the Financial Times that they hope the attack will provide an opportunity to heal the country's divisions. And Dungan believes that is already happening. Values are again at the center of national debate and the crowds on the streets show how deeply they are shared.""Until now, the National Front was able to occupy an empty political space,"" he said. ""But now people have realized that you don't need to vote for the far right in order to be patriotic."""

The camp hosts 163,000 residents who fled the conflict in Darfur which has killed 300,000 people and displaced two million. AFP PHOTO/ASHRAF SHAZLY (Photo credit should read ASHRAF SHAZLY/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14355240000140a51b6cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Darfur region in the west of Sudan was once a focus of extraordinary American civil society activism; there was also once regular international news and human rights reporting from Darfur. None of this is true now. Moreover, despite the morally high-minded rhetoric from candidate and President Obama, proclaiming Darfur to be the site of ""genocide"" and a ""stain on our souls,"" almost none of this rhetoric informs his administration's Sudan policies. Indeed, a senior State Department official proclaimed on the record (November 2010) that the U.S. had ""de-coupled"" Darfur from the bilateral issues between Washington and Khartoum that matter most: the regime's anger at its continuing presence on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, and Washington's lust for the putatively valuable counter-terrorism intelligence can Khartoum provide: it is an ongoing and cynical quid pro quo negotiation. Troublingly, this policy originates not with the State Department but rather with the various agencies that make up the U.S. ""intelligence community"" (a powerful oxymoron if one credits various reports of in-house fighting between the various agencies). The regime in Khartoum, always quick to exploit weaknesses or hesitation, saw this ""de-coupling"" as a signal from the Obama administration that they could ""finish business"" in Darfur without de-railing negotiations on issues of terrorism or indeed affecting any other feature of U.S policy in greater Sudan. And now, with much heightened military actions, completion of the genocide that began in 2003 is well underway. In fact, Darfur may present us with the first large-scale genocide in modern history that has a ""sequel""; this ""sequel,"" however, relies on essentially the same plot, the same tools, the same goals, and the same victims as the ""original"": non-Arab/African farmers, almost 3 million of whom have been driven from their homes by the Khartoum-orchestrated violence of the past decade, including half a million who are refugees in eastern Chad or who haven't made it to a camp.The main difference is Khartoum's replacement of the notorious Janjaweed, Arab militia forces that worked in concert with Khartoum in the early years of the genocide, but then increasingly on a ""free-lance"" basis, often fighting among themselves. Khartoum has reconstituted these brutal militia forces as the Rapid Response Forces (RSF), and in the main they are same men, though augmented by recruits from Chad, Niger, and other countries to the west of Sudan. What is different, however, is as important as the similarity in their ""services rendered"" to the regime.The RSF are much more heavily armed than the Janjaweed, with weapons considerably more powerful and lethal. Khartoum intends for the RSF to finish the job in Darfur, and no expense will be spared in ensuring that they have superior firepower in fighting the Darfuri rebels. The RSF are more cohesive than the Janjaweed ever were, and represent a critical component of the Khartoum regime's military power. This is made clear at various moments in the minutes recording a secret meeting on August 31, 2014, involving the top military and security officials of the regime (the minutes were leaked to me by a Sudanese source of unqualified honesty and integrity, and have been judged almost universally as authentic). The RSF are the shock troops for the regular forces -- Khartoum's Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) -- who are battle-weary, with some mid-level officers close to deserting. What is particularly dismaying to some professional soldiers in the SAF is that this time around the men in Khartoum haven't even bothered to deny their connection to these paramilitary units; rather, the regime has openly welcomed the RSF at all stages of recruitment, training, and deployment. No matter that many are driven solely by the desire for booty and have no true military training, and know nothing about international law governing the conduct of war.With the RSF -- more potent, more cohesive, and more tightly bound to the regime -- Khartoum's génocidaires have a weapon that is providing a decisive military edge. The evidence of the past few months has repeatedly links the RSF to large-scale atrocity crimes throughout Darfur; this information comes to us by way of Darfuris speaking to Radio Dabanga, far and away our best and most detailed source of information from the ground in Darfur. The bloated, ineffective UN/African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) has failed dismally in fulfilling its civilian protection mandate, and has done little to provide security. As a consequence more than 2 million Darfuris have been newly displaced -- most by violence -- since UNAMID assumed its mandate in January 2008. Nor does UNAMID gather evidence about the endless bombing attacks on civilian targets, the epidemic of rape that defines life for many hundreds of thousands of Darfuri girls and women, or the increasingly numerous and violent military assaults on camps and villages near camps. Large new swathes of African agricultural land have recently been lost to the RSF and other opportunistic Arab militia.In short, RSF violence is re-enacting the early years of the genocide, when many thousands of villages were burned or destroyed. Moreover, Khartoum is again coordinating militarily (now openly) with the RSF in attacks, often using aerial assets that range from the highly advanced Russian-built MiG-29 to helicopter gunships to the clumsily retrofitted cargo planes (also Russian-made) called Antonovs. Crude, shrapnel-loaded barrel bombs are simply pushed out the cargo bay from high altitudes, ensuring that they have no militarily useful accuracy but an immensely destructive effective on civilians. All such flights violate UN Security Council Resolution 1591 (March 2005). The reports we have been getting from Radio Dabanga for the past couple of months reveal a large convergence of RSF elements in North Darfur, particular in the area of eastern Jebel Marra and regions immediately to the east of the massif (and to the west of the capital of North Darfur, el-Fasher). Many scores of villages have been burned or destroyed, hundreds of people killed, and hundreds of women and girls raped. These are conservative figures; if we had a fully effective and mobile professional reporting force on the ground, we might discover that these figures drastically understate the destruction and violence. At the same time, in a year during which almost half a million Darfuris were newly displaced, the camps to which they flee have become increasingly limited in services they are able to provide (e.g., young children in North Darfur are experiencing acute malnutrition at three times the emergency threshold). International nongovernmental humanitarian organizations, and even the UN itself, are being roughly muscled by Khartoum through its security services and the absurdly named Humanitarian Aid Commission. There have been many expulsions of organizations and individuals over the years, and this past year was especially depleting. In addition to other UN officials, Ali Ala'atari of Jordan -- head of the UN's humanitarian mission in Sudan -- was expelled on preposterous charges in late December 2014. Ominously, UNAMID's current authorization runs only through June 30, 2015; it is unlikely to be renewed because of the threat of a Russian or Chinese veto. It will certainly be gutted in any event.In August 2004 the notorious Janjaweed leader Musa Hilal articulated Khartoum's genocidal ambitions in a memo originating in North Darfur: ""change of the demography of Darfur"" and ""empty it of all African tribes."" Success for this brutal regime is closer than it has ever been, and comes closer by the day. _____________________ Eric Reeves, a professor at Smith College, has published extensively on Sudan, nationally and internationally, for the past sixteen years.

Germany is home to four million Muslims and many mosques and Muslim associations have been outspoken in condemning the recent terror sprees in Paris by Islamic extremists that left 17 people dead, including 10 employees at the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f7842100002501c91d1b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On January 8, Stéphane Charbonnier, editor of the Paris satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, along with seven of his journalist colleagues and two policemen, a maintenance worker, and a visitor, were assassinated in an Islamist terror raid.Three more people were injured. The brutal atrocity came only days after an eloquent appeal by German Christian Democratic chancellor Angela Merkel, Western Europe's most credible politician and a committed conservative, cautioning her fellow citizens against anti-immigrant demonstrations centered in Dresden, in the former East Germany. Three suspects were named in the Charlie Hebdo incident, according to Reuters. They were identified as two brothers, Said Kouachi, born in 1980, and Cherif Kouachi, born in 1982, assisted by Hamyd Mourad, born in 1996. By Thursday morning, Mourad had surrendered to police, as reported by BBC News. Authorities continued their hunt for the Kouachi brothers, while seven associates of the pair have been detained.Aside from shouts of ""Allahu Akbar!"" [God is the Greatest!] and cries that the killers had ""avenged"" Muhammad, who had been caricatured in Charlie Hebdo, one of the violent intruders was said to have yelled that they represented ""Al-Qaida in Yemen,"" as noted in the London Guardian. Reuters described Cherif Kouachi as having served 18 months in prison. He was charged with involvement in a terrorist enterprise in 2005, when he participated in an Islamist group that recruited French nationals to fight against the U.S. in Iraq. But he was arrested before he could leave for the latter country. Although planned apparently in detail, over a substantial period of time, the assault on Charlie Hebdo by Islamist fanatics could be seen as a perverse response to the positive initiatives toward Muslim immigrants taken by Merkel and other non-Muslims. On January 1, the German leader was quoted in the Guardian, warning in a televised address, ""all those who go to [anti-Islam] demonstrations: do not follow those who have called the rallies. Because all too often they have prejudice, coldness, even hatred in their hearts."" Her speech was followed on Tuesday, January 6, by competing assemblies in Germany. Supporters of the anti-Islam ""Pegida"" (a German-language acronym for ""Patriotic Europeans Against Islamization of the West"") were, except in Dresden, overwhelmed numerically, in Berlin, Köln, and Stuttgart, by defenders of immigrants. In Köln, thousands of counter-demonstrators faced about 250 Pegida supporters, the BBC observed. Lights were turned off at the Köln Cathedral and elsewhere around the city, to communicate official disapproval of the anti-Islam events.The morning of January 6 had seen the front page of Bild, Germany's largest newspaper, publish an anti-Pegida manifesto signed by 80 prominent national figures, including the current foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a Social Democrat, and Christian Democrat finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble. Bild is traditionally oriented rightward and was long a target for the radical left in Germany. Meanwhile, in Sweden, where at least two and possibly three mosques were firebombed in recent weeks, mass mobilizations took place defending Muslim rights.And then came the news from Paris. Pegida representatives, for their part, argued that the bloodshed at Charlie Hebdo justified their anti-Islam stance. On its Facebook page, as pointed out by Newsweek, Pegida declared, ""The Islamists, against whom PEGIDA has been warning over the last 12 weeks, showed in France today that they are not capable of (practicing) democracy but instead see violence and death as the solution.""Solidarity meetings in favor of Charlie Hebdo were held around the world, with placards reading ""Je suis Charlie"" in France, and ""I am Charlie"" in English, in New York, Washington, and other cities. Angela Merkel herself said, in a statement carried by Reuters, ""This abominable act is not only an attack on the lives of French citizens and their security. It is also an attack on freedom of speech and the press, core elements of our free democratic culture.""Unfortunately, the onslaught against Charlie Hebdo demonstrated something moderate Muslims have known for a very long time, and that was hardly discovered by Pegida. That is that Islamist radicals, anywhere in the world, do not seek justice, but chaos. The viciousness displayed in Paris followed a Taliban bloodbath at an elite school in Pakistan, in December, that left 153 teachers and students dead.   Further, the invasion of Iraq by the so-called ""Islamic State"" or Daesh (in Arabic) killed 8,500 civilians in the second half of 2014, as recorded by the United Nations.Where conflict exists, Islamist extremists will seek to worsen it to their benefit. Where it does not exist, they will seek to provoke it. As cited by Al-Arabiya, the reformist Saudi television network located in Dubai, the moderate leadership of French Islam, embodied in the French Council for the Muslim Faith (CFCM), condemned the terrorist carnage. ""This extremely grave barbaric action is also an attack against democracy and the freedom of the press,"" the CFCM said in a statement published by Agence France-Presse.The CFCM, which is known for its defense of French secularism, appealed for calm and for Muslims to avoid radical agitation. ""In this tense international climate stoked by the madness of terrorist groups unjustly claiming to represent Islam, we call on all those attached to the republic's values and to democracy to avoid provocation,"" CFCM said.The homicidal zealots who devastated Charlie Hebdo may have thought, as they fled French justice, that they won a victory for Islam. But the effect of their action is the opposite -- they have contributed powerfully to fear of Muslims. In their ideological delirium, that is doubtless what they want. Their ferocity, however, undermines the civility and security of France and the world, and endangers the future of Islam. Regardless of feelings about caricatures of Muhammad, moderate Muslims should join their neighbors in protesting the crime against Charlie Hebdo."

I've set out to hold candidates and elected officials accountable and to push our democracy to truly represent the interests of our kids.I am passionate about preserving the rights and opportunities of current and future Americans. That has meant fighting to stop global warming. It has meant working with my wife, Kat Taylor, to lend money in underserved communities through the nonprofit community development bank we started -- Beneficial State Bank. It has meant working through our nonprofit, The Center for the Next Generation, to support efforts to make sure children 0-5 get the chance to have a fair start in life.Since I left the private sector and founded NextGen Climate, in our fight to prevent climate disaster and preserve American prosperity and jobs, I have met some of the best people I've ever known working as part of a community to safeguard our future right here in California. Together, we worked to close a tax loophole that favored out-of-state companies at the expense of California jobs and sent the money back to California schools. Together, we supported the rights of working families to have a voice in politics -- especially when there was an effort to try to take that right away. And, together, we took on the Texas oil companies in a ballot initiative in order to preserve the most progressive energy laws in the world.Together, so many of us in California have worked for environmental justice, economic justice and education justice in order to help give the next generation a fair shake.And, because of all the work done by so many people here in our state, California is on the move.Just last week, our great governor, Jerry Brown, set bold climate goals for California, making clear he intends to build on our state's leadership when it comes to clean energy jobs.But there is a different picture in Washington. There, strong interests oppose recognizing global warming and fight against the rights and futures of average Americans. There, they are winning. They don't want to give all of our people a fair shake at the American Dream if it means any threat to their corporate interests.People rail that democracy has been subverted to powerful economic interests -- that ""We the People"" have been overlooked. Based on what I have seen over the last several years, I fear there's some truth in that charge, and it scares me -- badly. Holding office is a sacred trust in our society, and I am honored that so many colleagues and friends have encouraged me to consider entering this race.

Students demanded that University of Georgia President Morehead reject ""the discriminatory practices enacted by the University of Georgia,"" and that the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia revoke Policies 4.1.6 and 4.3.4, which bar undocumented students from attending the state's top universities and deny in-state tuition to undocumented students. Georgia is one of only three states -- including Alabama and South Carolina -- that bar undocumented students from enrollment in state universities.Earlier in the afternoon, over twenty undocumented youth and thirty documented student allies attended a teach-in in the same classroom to learn more about past civil rights struggles and to call attention to Georgia's discriminatory policies that ban undocumented students from attending the state's five top public universities. Organizers posted a sign on the classroom door that read ""Desegregation in Progress."" But at 5 pm, when the building was set to close, the students refused to leave, announcing that they would stay to protest discriminatory educational practices ""in the spirit of this historic date"" and to honor the African-American students who had desegregated the University of Georgia 54 years ago.Four of the arrested youth are undocumented, and the remaining five are documented students who attend the University of Georgia and Kennesaw State University. Georgia's estimated 400,000 unauthorized immigrants are critical members of one of the largest Latino populations in the U.S. South. Undocumented students and their allies have put significant pressure on policymakers to end the ban on undocumented college attendance since the Board of Regents instituted its policies in 2011. Emory University student Malik Alexander explained that in his view ""taking away education based on documentation status is just another from of systematic oppression. It echoes Jim Crow racial segregation and all other types of 'legal' discrimination, but this time towards a different racial minority than America is used to confronting.""Students had timed their teach-in to coincide with the 54th anniversary of the integration of the University of Georgia by African-American students, an important milestone in the civil rights movement when, on January 9, 1961, Charlayne Hunter-Gault and Hamilton Holmes became the first to successfully desegregate a public university in the Deep South. These young students see their own struggles today as an extension of earlier democratic movements in the region. ""We are holding this protest to honor the legacy of the brave students who came before us,"" student Sergio Delgadillo noted, ""and to highlight modern forms of segregation under Georgia's current ban against undocumented students."" Valentina Emilia García called Friday's occupation and integrated classroom ""minute compared to the big things students did in the civil rights era"" and admitted that ""it excites me to know that I am making history.""To learn from earlier civil rights efforts in the South, organizers of the integrated classroom invited Lonnie C. King, the founding chairman of the Atlanta Student Movement in 1960, and Loretta Ross, a leading figure in the reproductive justice movement, to address the youth activists who gathered Friday. Most attendees already knew that other African-American leaders such as U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Georgia) -- one of the heroes of Selma -- have been staunch allies of the undocumented student movement, but they wanted to hear from experienced guides such as King and Ross to better understand their state's history and its ongoing challenges. Excitement ran high during the afternoon class. Students shared ideas and insights with one another. Attendees tweeted using hashtags such as #educationnotsegregation, #54yearslater, and #migrationisbeautiful. Speakers offered stories about their struggles old and new, and they praised recent efforts by undocumented students to make allies, to create opportunities for their communities, and to change public policies. Lonnie C. King urged immigrant rights activists to ""run the leg of freedom -- which is a relay -- as fast as you can when it's your turn to carry the baton,"" and to remember that ""you have to be willing to be a troublemaker for justice if you want to change anything."" Loretta Ross told them that ""my first radical act was my parents and I fighting for my right to an education,"" and she called the students' efforts ""radical and revolutionary.""As the afternoon progressed, young people promised that they would continue to work hard to open the doors of Georgia's colleges and universities to all qualified residents of the state. Many proudly wore handmade butterfly wings in the classroom to celebrate their families' migrations. ""Migration is beautiful,"" they wrote. Some criticized Georgia's education establishment directly. As Kevin Ruiz, one of the arrestees and a member of UGA's Undocumented Student Alliance, said, ""I am ashamed that my university denies admission to fully qualified, equally passionate students based on how they came to the United States as children.""The student organizers have learned about African-American and Latino histories at Freedom University, an Atlanta-based institution for undocumented young people that was inspired by Southern ""Freedom Schools"" for African Americans in earlier decades. For the last four years, Freedom University -- known to supporters as ""FU Georgia"" -- has provided a tuition-free education to undocumented students and helped many young people apply to out-of-state colleges and universities. And in the process, its staff has taught Latino students about local African-American political struggles.The organization's staff had emphasized in advance of Friday's events that student leaders must understand how they fit into their state's history. In the words of Executive Director Dr. Laura Emiko Soltis, ""Freedom University students know that education is their human right. This makes them unstoppable, and with documented student allies throughout Georgia, they are carrying on the long tradition of student freedom fighters in the South, and they will win."" Buoyed by ""learning about sit-ins, bus boycotts, and student protests,"" youth leaders like Ashley Rivas-Triana are convinced that they have a lot to contribute to struggles for equality in the state. ""You're the ones we've been waiting for,"" Loretta Ross told the students near the end of the class. When undocumented youth and their allies decided that they would not leave their integrated classroom when the university building closed Friday at 5pm, choosing instead to wait and demand an end to Georgia's discriminatory policies, they knew that they risked arrest. Six police cars arrived by 8pm to arrest the protesters on charges of criminal trespassing. Neither President Morehead nor the regents have responded to their demands. So in a scene that brought together past and present, officers handcuffed and arrested nine young students, many wearing butterfly wings, into nearby police cars. "

Students demanded that University of Georgia President Morehead reject ""the discriminatory practices enacted by the University of Georgia,"" and that the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia revoke Policies 4.1.6 and 4.3.4, which bar undocumented students from attending the state's top universities and deny in-state tuition to undocumented students. Georgia is one of only three states -- including Alabama and South Carolina -- that bar undocumented students from enrollment in state universities.Earlier in the afternoon, over twenty undocumented youth and thirty documented student allies attended a teach-in in the same classroom to learn more about past civil rights struggles and to call attention to Georgia's discriminatory policies that ban undocumented students from attending the state's five top public universities. Organizers posted a sign on the classroom door that read ""Desegregation in Progress."" But at 5 pm, when the building was set to close, the students refused to leave, announcing that they would stay to protest discriminatory educational practices ""in the spirit of this historic date"" and to honor the African-American students who had desegregated the University of Georgia 54 years ago.Four of the arrested youth are undocumented, and the remaining five are documented students who attend the University of Georgia and Kennesaw State University. Georgia's estimated 400,000 unauthorized immigrants are critical members of one of the largest Latino populations in the U.S. South. Undocumented students and their allies have put significant pressure on policymakers to end the ban on undocumented college attendance since the Board of Regents instituted its policies in 2011. Emory University student Malik Alexander explained that in his view ""taking away education based on documentation status is just another from of systematic oppression. It echoes Jim Crow racial segregation and all other types of 'legal' discrimination, but this time towards a different racial minority than America is used to confronting.""Students had timed their teach-in to coincide with the 54th anniversary of the integration of the University of Georgia by African-American students, an important milestone in the civil rights movement when, on January 9, 1961, Charlayne Hunter-Gault and Hamilton Holmes became the first to successfully desegregate a public university in the Deep South. These young students see their own struggles today as an extension of earlier democratic movements in the region. ""We are holding this protest to honor the legacy of the brave students who came before us,"" student Sergio Delgadillo noted, ""and to highlight modern forms of segregation under Georgia's current ban against undocumented students."" Valentina Emilia García called Friday's occupation and integrated classroom ""minute compared to the big things students did in the civil rights era"" and admitted that ""it excites me to know that I am making history.""To learn from earlier civil rights efforts in the South, organizers of the integrated classroom invited Lonnie C. King, the founding chairman of the Atlanta Student Movement in 1960, and Loretta Ross, a leading figure in the reproductive justice movement, to address the youth activists who gathered Friday. Most attendees already knew that other African-American leaders such as U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Georgia) -- one of the heroes of Selma -- have been staunch allies of the undocumented student movement, but they wanted to hear from experienced guides such as King and Ross to better understand their state's history and its ongoing challenges. Excitement ran high during the afternoon class. Students shared ideas and insights with one another. Attendees tweeted using hashtags such as #educationnotsegregation, #54yearslater, and #migrationisbeautiful. Speakers offered stories about their struggles old and new, and they praised recent efforts by undocumented students to make allies, to create opportunities for their communities, and to change public policies. Lonnie C. King urged immigrant rights activists to ""run the leg of freedom -- which is a relay -- as fast as you can when it's your turn to carry the baton,"" and to remember that ""you have to be willing to be a troublemaker for justice if you want to change anything."" Loretta Ross told them that ""my first radical act was my parents and I fighting for my right to an education,"" and she called the students' efforts ""radical and revolutionary.""As the afternoon progressed, young people promised that they would continue to work hard to open the doors of Georgia's colleges and universities to all qualified residents of the state. Many proudly wore handmade butterfly wings in the classroom to celebrate their families' migrations. ""Migration is beautiful,"" they wrote.
