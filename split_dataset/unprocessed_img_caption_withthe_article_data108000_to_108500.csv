For some of you, that may sound like a fate worse than death.

(Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae51a2200000e800ff40b5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I'm a 40-something intern in Hollywood. I know. For some of you, that may sound like a fate worse than death. Others may applaud my moxie for taking a chance at the mid-point of my life. (Who's got two thumbs and is clutching to her dream like an oxygen tank? This broad!) Others may find it sad and pathetic. But if you're a writer like me, you're thinking about how to work this premise into a TV show. Maybe I'm a ""Must See Thursday"" 90's sitcom about a plucky middle-aged intern who gets into trouble with her weird co-workers and crotchety boss. My catch phrase is ""At least it's not Cleveland."" Cue laugh track. Or maybe I'm an inspiring tale about a woman who picks up the pieces from her shattered, downsized lifestyle. ""She went from expense accounts to counting pennies. A Mid-Woman Night's Journey airs Sunday nights on Lifetime."" Maybe I'm a grizzled, post-9/11 heroine with a semi-relevant blog making observations on Facebook about the comic cruelties of life from her studio apartment. Truthfully, I'd prefer to be a 21st century Mary Poppins; a sophisticated, worldly woman who floats into an office each semester to be helpful and dispense some sage advice. Elizabeth Quinn is...Lady Intern. Lady Intern would be a classy yet cheeky show that BBC America developed at the last minute and is surprisingly popular with small town housewives. Ideally, she'd be played by one of the K/Cates -- Winslet or Blanchett.Most days it's perfectly pleasant being a lady intern. I think my supervisors feel awkward telling me what to do since they're younger than me, but I don't mind. I complete every task with a smile and a professional attitude. I'm still learning how Hollywood works. But I find if you compare it to high school, you can figure out the appropriate response. Like when one of the executives (aka mean girl) got pissed because I read the latest draft of Cyclops: The Reckoning before she did. I apologized and then told her it was a brilliant move. ""You found the last untapped monster in Hollywood. Genius!"" She was appeased and I got to deliver a sarcastic slam without her knowing it. I can tell they feel bad sending me on errands, but I have no shame. I'll go pick up their sex toys if I have to, just to leave the office and get some fresh air. It's hard when I say things like, ""Let's totally take over that empty office and create a new executive identity like Michael J. Fox did in The Secret of My Success,"" only to be met with blank stares by the other interns. Then I remember to be patient with them before I quote the entire movie word for word. Most of the time my age really isn't an issue. I think it's adorable when my boss lumps me in with the other interns who are ""too young to remember parachute pants"" or some other random fad. And he appreciates my initiative to clean up the storage room without being asked, while my younger counterparts wait to be told every little thing. Plus, I'm not afraid to defend why Sixteen Candles is better than The Breakfast Club.Lady interns are a small sub-section of the internship world. Extremely small. Seriously, I may be the only one. If there is a second lady intern, our paths can never cross or the world will end. I don't know if gentlemen interns exist. They might be up there with unicorns. It would be great to meet one, though. Someone in his early- to mid-40's with most of his hair, and that Gen X fatalism hiding a deeply disappointed optimist. While burning DVDs for the boss, we share our disbelief at becoming middle-aged and how ridiculous it is that we're back in school. We bond over our pre-internet college years and how these kids today don't understand real angst or eye contact. ""Remember Walkmans?"" he asks. ""Of course, I do, George."" His name is George, by the way. We share knowing smirks every time an executive yells at their assistant, knowing how lucky we are to be immune to that crap. Then, he verbally asks me -- no texting -- to a 1980s retrospective at the Arclight. We lament how Hollywood would never make a movie like Fast Times at Ridgemont High today, and then trip out when the credits reveal that Lana Clarkson was Mrs. Varga. THE Lana Clarkson, who was murdered by Phil Spector. Whoa. Then, like the sweetest John Hughes movie, we share a kiss over the mini bottle of wine we snuck into the theatre with us.Well, I gotta run. Those cappuccinos and finger massagers won't deliver themselves."

Adam Morrison, the mustached, grizzly-looking Gonzaga Bulldogs star junior had just finished putting together one of the best college basketball seasons in recent memory, averaging 28.1 points per game, and led his west coast school into the NCAA Tournament. Gonzaga had made it to the national stage, due to Morrison's dominance. However, the final picture of his final college season was of him lying face-first on the floor, crying uncontrollably, as he realized that his last college game had just ended in a painful loss to UCLA in the Sweet 16. Unquestionably the most popular player in all of college basketball that season, gracing the cover newspapers and magazines, the man with a knack for scoring the basketball ended his college chapter and declared for the NBA Draft. That picture of him mourning the Sweet 16 loss foreshadowed what his NBA career ended up being: a sob story. Selected as the third overall pick by the Charlotte Bobcats in the 2006 NBA Draft, Morrison averaged 11.8 points per game as a rookie, but his career spiraled downwards from then on, as injuries and a lack of ability limited him, as he never put up more than 4.5 points per game in a season in the final four of his short career. He moved on from playing the game, and is now a coach on Gonzaga's bench. Someone who has drawn comparisons to Morrison is Chicago Bulls rookie Doug McDermott. At 6'8 and 225 pounds, McDermott is slightly heavier than what Morrison was listed at, but is the same height, and is coming off a college season in which he put up 26.7 points per game and suffered an emotional loss in the NCAA Tournament. Both players won multiple player-of-the-year awards in their final college season. Both went to non-traditional basketball powerhouses, as McDermott played for Creighton, and brought them to national-attention. Both were the most popular players in the country during their final seasons, hands-down. But, NBA fans have learned from the career of Morrison, who entered the league with extremely-high expectations to continue his college success. No one expects McDermott to produce at an elite level right away. No one expects him to make an All-Star team anytime soon, if at all. It seems as though we all don't want to get our dreams dashed... again. But, here are some reasons why McDermott will be extremely successful in the NBA, compared to Morrison's dud of a career. First, he's coming into a much better situation in terms of what team he was drafted to, compared to Morrison joining the expansion Bobcats and becoming the most leaned-on player right away with the highest expectations. The Bulls have a talented roster, with the likes of Derrick Rose, Pau Gasol, Joakim Noah, Jimmy Butler, and Taj Gibson a part of it. Their head coach, Tom Thibodeau, is among the best in the NBA. He will largely benefit from a complimentary role, in which he is the third, fourth, or fifth option on the court, as Rose, Gasol, and possibly Noah will demand more of a defensive focus from the opposition. Secondly, McDermott has an uncanny ability to shoot the ball accurately from the outside. A career 45.8 percent shooter from three-point range in college, McDermott made an incredible 598 three-pointers during his time at Creighton. His ability to stretch the floor, with the bulk of being able to play the ""four"" spot, in addition to the ""three"" spot, will only bode well for him and Chicago's offense. Morrison proved he could shoot the deep ball in his final season at Gonzaga, but McDermott has a much better track record, dating all the way back to his freshman season. Next, ""McBuckets"" spent some time in the post in college. During his four years, he averaged 7.5 rebounds per game, and developed a strong, underrated offensive post game as well, as he was used to playing as one of the biggest men on the court for the slightly-undersized Blue Jays. Morrison lived on the wing, and his game was limited to that spot. McDermott can play on the wing or on the post, thus proving to be more developed offensively and defensively. Finally, as coach Thibodeau recently noted to the media, McDermott has a ton of swag. As an NBA player, you need to be able to walk the walk and talk the talk to be an elite player. The last time I checked, LeBron James and Kobe Bryant are not some of the most humble guys in the world. Confidence is not something you can teach, it's an innate ability to believe in yourself, even when you're struggling. Following McDermott's career since he was a freshman in college, all the way through the NBA's Summer League, it's evident that McDermott is one of the most confident players in the NBA already, which, as a potentially high-volume shooter, is an important attribute to have. If McDermott can average between 14 and 16 points a game, as I project him to be around by the end of the season, everyone better watch out for the Bulls, if and only if Derrick Rose stays healthy. But, that's another debate for a different day. Do you believe in Chicago? The Bulls are trading at 6 percent to win the NBA Championship on Tradesports.com.

But the cable giant maintained it had nothing to do with the firing.Conal O’Rourke, an accountant in Northern California, alleged in a letter sent last week by his lawyer that Comcast charged him thousands of dollars for equipment he did not order. In an interview with Ars Technica, O’Rourke said he'd had several problems with his service and was not able to get help via phone or in person. Following the year-long dispute, during which O’Rourke said his requests for explanations and clarified bills were repeatedly mishandled, O’Rourke contacted Lawrence Salva, Comcast’s chief accounting officer and controller. O’Rourke told Ars Technica that soon after he spoke with Salva’s assistant, his employer, accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, called him in for an internal ethics investigation. Just over a week later, he was fired.Salva, according to his bio, worked for 12 years at PricewaterhouseCoopers before joining Comcast in 2000. On Thursday, Comcast admitted O'Rourke's nightmarish customer service was “unacceptable.""“We simply dropped the ball and did not make things right,” Charlie Herrin, the Comcast executive promoted last month to resolve a spate of recent customer service debacles, said in a statement. “Mr. O’Rourke deserves another apology from us and we’re making this one publicly.”But Herrin denied that Comcast had asked O’Rourke’s employer to terminate him.“We also want to clarify that nobody at Comcast asked for him to be fired,” he wrote. O’Rourke threatened to sue the cable giant in a letter sent last week by his lawyer, in which he also demanded “a full retraction and apology, his re-employment with his former employer, and $100,312.50” by next Tuesday.So far, only one of those demands has been met.

However, the general international response has been slower than the rate of transmission of the disease,"" Koroma said.Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, also speaking by video conference, listed her country's vast needs and called for a ""more timely and decisive response"" by foreign governments.She said that within the next month treatment and testing centers were needed, staffed by both local and foreign health workers, with more resources to set up community care centers, as well as help for healthcare workers dealing with non-Ebola patients.""We need to ensure that it all comes together immediately,"" Johnson Sirleaf said.Donald Kaberuka, president of the African Development Bank, urged donors not to impose excessive bureaucratic structures, calling the response so far ""too slow, too little, too late.""The World Bank on Wednesday estimated that the two-year economic impact to the region if Ebola is not contained will reach $32.6 billion.""Unless we quickly stop this Ebola epidemic, nothing less than the future of Africa is at stake,"" World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in opening remarks at the meeting on Thursday.Sierra Leone and Liberia are still emerging from years of civil war, which left basic infrastructure in ruins and their governments dependent on aid, although they have been helped by stronger economic growth and growing foreign investment in recent years.The roundtable included 40 officials from donor governments, development groups and global institutions, and took place alongside IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington.Bruce Aylward, assistant director-general for polio and emergencies at the World Health Organization, said there was still no common strategy among donors, ""and we must get to common purpose very, very quickly.""

Mark Begich (D-Alaska), frequently talks about how he ""actually read"" the Affordable Care Act and ""spent weeks -- weeks! -- reviewing that law."" But that doesn't mean Sullivan is familiar with all of the law's provisions, as an interview with the Alaska Dispatch News published Wednesday revealed: Sullivan does, however, want to preserve one key element of the Affordable Care Act -- insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions. Sullivan wants to do that through high-risk pools, which have in the past forced those individuals to pay higher premiums than people get on the standard market.The Republican was professing ignorance of the Affordable Care Act's ban on the practice known as ""gender rating,"" whereby insurers would charge women higher premiums than men for identical plans. Sullivan perhaps said he supports -- or doesn't know about -- those provisions because polling shows a paradox: Americans dislike the law, but like that it allows children to stay on their parents' plans until 26, bans discrimination based on gender and eliminates lifetime coverage caps. This paradox is also illustrated in the manner in which Begich's campaign is approaching the law in Alaska. Though Begich has said in in radio ads he has worked to ""fix"" the law, a super PAC backing his bid also ran television ads featuring a breast cancer survivor describing how the law enabled her to get health insurance despite her pre-existing condition.The senator has taken pains to distance himself from President Barack Obama, but two new polls this week show Sullivan ahead.Sullivan's campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."

The president was a (failed) West Texas oilman. The vice-president had been the CEO of the giant oil field services company, Halliburton, and before taking office, when speaking at the Petroleum Institute and elsewhere, was known to say things like, ""The Middle East, with two-thirds of the world's oil and the lowest cost, is still where the prize ultimately lies."" The national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, long on the board of Chevron, had a double-hulled oil tanker named for her. They were a crew with the global flow of oil and how to control it on the brain. Just in case you forgot, and I know you haven't, the new vice president had barely taken office and set up an ""energy task force"" to develop future policy that he himself would chair when a parade of top oil executives began arriving at the White House to meet secretly with it.And then, after 9/11, came the assault on the oil heartlands of the planet. I'm sure you remember how, amid the chaos of a burning Baghdad, American troops were ordered to guard only the buildings of Iraq's Oil and Interior Ministries, and... well, I don't really have to review all of that for you, do I? Then, of course, Americans put into office the guy who swore he was going to end oil wars and attend to our global warming future instead -- a fellow named Barack Obama who, everyone knew, would step into office without an oil slick in his head.That was then and this is now. The Barack Obama of 2014 is essentially running a drill-baby-drill White House in a country where oil consumption is actually rising. His administration has been opening up ever more coastal areas to exploration and drilling from the East to the Arctic waters of Alaska, while encouraging the creation of a ""Saudi America"" in the American frack lands.

Our speakers and panelists will discuss the myriad ways in which food supports personal and public health; fails to deliver on the promise of better health; and both drives and responds to other cultural forces in America today.In anticipation of this two-day event, we're holding Health Month on the JBF blog. In the post below, we conclude our extended interview series with actor and activist Wendell Pierce, exploring his views on potential solutions to issues of food access, both locally and globally.--JBF: How can government-based initiatives and the private sector best work together to combat issues of food security?WP: It's a crisis, so all hands on deck. Of course there's going to be discussions of strategy, what some people think is beneficial, what others think. I say that we try them all, because all of them contribute to everything. Sterling Farms takes advantage of the Healthy Fresh Food Initiative. It's part of the Farm Bill specifically written for American businesses that choose to bring a grocery store into a designated food desert.Then there's the Let's Move campaign, which is educating kids early on. And then you have advocacy from nonprofit groups like the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, where I'm a board member. We have programs in over 3,000 schools. The Healthy Fresh Food Initiative of the Farm Bill, the advocacy of the First Lady, and the nonprofit world--I'm happy to be a part of all of them. Instead of having a debate about which strategy works best, I challenge people to ask, ""What is going to be your contribution to changing the paradigm?"" By the mere fact that we're different, we're going to have a multitude of different solutions brought to the table. JBF: In New Orleans or beyond, are there any companies or initiatives that you've been inspired by?  WP: One of the things I'm proudest of is the new culinary arts discipline at my high school, New Orleans Center for Creative Arts. These young chefs are learning to put together a five-star tasting menu along with the best red beans and rice, and actually have their own sustainable urban farm. We're teaching the chefs of the future to interact with the community, and showing them how the culinary arts can actually change the paradigm.We have to teach that new generation to look beyond fine dining and the celebrity world and notice the local, everyday people who have really influenced cuisine and cooking. That's what makes Anthony Bourdain so appealing. You know that you can take him anywhere and he appreciates how people connect with their food, and how they deliver that food to their community.I was in Zimbabwe, which is isolated from the world right now, and I'll never forget seeing rush hour on a Friday in Harare. People can't use their cars, and the buses are few and far between because they can't afford the gas. Masses of people are literally walking home down the middle of the street. And in the median? Corn, collard greens. They've taken any piece of land and they are farming. It amazed me because I immediately saw that this was the ultimate food desert. That should be celebrated as one of the most courageous and bravest acts demonstrated through food, and it left an impression on me.I think about all the community gardens around the country, and the endless possibilities if we called on grocers to give them a distribution arm. I'm a believer that everyone has a role to play. The more the merrier. Those people in Zimbabwe, the community gardener in South Los Angeles, that farmer's market in Michigan, and Whole Foods and Publix and Le Bernadin and Daniel--we are all of the same world. And there but by the grace of God go I. --Maggie Borden is assistant editor at the James Beard Foundation. Find her on Twitter and Instagram."

The ark will be the centerpiece of a proposed $170 million religious theme park that has been approved for $40 million in taxpayer-funded incentives. A state tourism board gave preliminary approval on Tuesday, July 29, 2014, for up to $18 million in tax rebates for the proposed full-sized replica of Noah's Ark as described in the book of Genesis. An independent consultant will now study the feasibility of the project and make a recommendation for the board to consider.

The project has been financed through donations and bonds, but Zavath said the state's incentives could help finance future phases.In July, Ark Encounter, LLC, received preliminary approval to collect a rebate from a portion of the sales tax revenues generated at its park.The tourism tax credit is potentially worth more than $18 million over a 10-year period.Zovath said the state has added a requirement about hiring practices that is not part of the existing tourism tax credits law.But a state official said on Wednesday that everybody knows laws regarding hiring practices and that the states doesn't need to elaborate them for companies seeking incentives.""We expect all of the companies that get tax incentives to obey the law,"" Gil Lawson, communications director for the Kentucky Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet, said.

Potentially damaging storms are forecasted to hit parts of the east coast with potential for causing power wide spread outages. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d8d11f000040022575af.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Welcome back once again to our ongoing pigeonholing exercise for this year's midterm Senate races. The big question, of course, is whether Republicans will pick up the six seats they need to wrest control of the chamber from the dastardly (according to them) Harry Reid and his Democratic minions. The answer to this pressing question is still not clear, and it actually may not be definitively answered until long after election night (for various interesting and wonky reasons).Still, that doesn't stop the punditocracy (""wonkocracy,"" perhaps?) from making our predictions, so let's just dive in and make some rash and reckless prognostications, shall we? As always, in making these determinations I use the criteria of: news I've read about each race, all polling data available, and a good dose of common sense. That last one could also be read as ""what my gut is telling me about each race,"" I fully admit.The public is increasingly paying attention to each individual race, and in many states public debates have been held in the past week or so. Some races have firmed up as a result, and some are more chaotic than ever.The current Senate stands at 45 Republicans and effectively 55 Democrats (counting in the two Independents who caucus with them). Because a tie vote is broken by Democratic Vice President Joe Biden, the Republicans need 51 seats to gain control of the chamber -- a net pickup of six seats. Throughout my categories, I will provide a running net total to see how close Republicans will come to achieving this goal, although the number of races which are totally up in the air precludes actually predicting whether it'll happen or not.For those interested, my remarks below refer to my previous Senate overview column, from a few weeks ago. I use only five categories: Safe Democratic, Leaning Democratic, Too Close To Call, Leaning Republican, and Safe Republican. Any questions? Leave them in the comments, along with any disagreements you might have about which race belongs where.Safe RepublicanThe list of Safe Republican states hasn't changed much: Alabama, Idaho, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming. The only change here is that South Dakota moved down to Leaning Republican. More on that in a moment.This starts Republicans with a net pickup of two seats (Montana and West Virginia) held by Democrats.Safe DemocraticI'm going to go out on a limb and move New Hampshire into this category, because carpetbagger Scott Brown doesn't seem to be gaining any ground. The full list of Safe Democratic seats: Delaware, Hawai'i, Illinois, Oregon, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Virginia.Some might argue my gut is being too optimistic about Michigan (as well as the inclusion of New Hampshire), but the news this week was that Republicans have very quietly cancelled all their last-minute ad buys because they think Michigan is now a lost cause for them. And who am I to argue?However, none of these seats is currently in Republican hands, so this list represents no net gain or loss for Democrats in the Senate.Leaning RepublicanThere was a lot of movement both in and out of this category this time around. Kentucky dropped down to Too Close To Call, while South Dakota was added, moving down from Safe Republican.The race in Georgia remains very tight, and might even merit moving down to Too Close To Call next time around. The Republican was just caught in a cringe-worthy gaffe (where he extolled his personal experience outsourcing jobs to foreign countries), and then he essentially doubled down on his pro-outsourcing stance. This is not exactly a popular idea anywhere in America, so we'll see whether it improves Michelle Nunn's poll numbers in the next week or so.Louisiana remains very close in the polling, but the Republican challenger to Mary Landrieu seems to be holding an edge. At this point, it has to be counted as Leaning Republican.South Dakota is an interesting race because it has become a true three-way contest. Previously, the Republican was holding a big lead over the Democrat and the Independent was far behind, but recent polling shows the Independent moving up quickly, and one poll put his support higher than the Democrat's. However, both are still trailing the Republican, meaning at best the state has to be considered Leaning Republican. But anything can happen in the late days of a three-sided race, so it can't really be considered Safe Republican at this point.If Republicans took all their leaning states, it would add two more takeovers (Louisiana and South Dakota) to their total, but it wouldn't put them over the top. They'd still be two states short of a Senate majority.Leaning DemocraticThe Leaning Democratic category shifted around a bit as well. New Hampshire moved up to Safe Democratic, Alaska moved down to Too Close To Call, and the special case of Kansas was added to this category (since it doesn't really belong anywhere else), up from Too Close To Call.By the numbers, Colorado should probably be in Too Close To Call, but I'm more optimistic about Mark Udall's chances than perhaps I should be. It's been a tight race all year in the polling, but Udall seems to have retained an edge. In Colorado, as in many states, it's all going to come down to turnout. For now, I'm keeping it as Leaning Democratic, although admittedly a lot of that is just gut feeling.Kansas doesn't really belong anywhere on this list, because there is no ""Safe Independent"" category. Since the dramatic exit of the Democratic candidate from this race, Greg Orman is beating Pat Roberts soundly in the polls. This is a breathtaking reversal of fortunes for Roberts, and has not changed much in the past few weeks. Of course, Orman refuses to say which party he'll caucus with if he wins, but at the very least this race is ""leaning non-Republican"" at the moment. A few more good polls, and it might even move up to ""safe non-Republican"" -- but that could all change after the election, if Orman does decide to caucus with Republicans after all.North Carolina remains in this category, as Kay Hagen has held a small edge over her Republican challenger. If she manages to hold this lead, the Democrats will have won a very hard-fought race here. North Carolina is one of the states which have held candidate debates recently, so if any movement is going to happen (good or bad), look for it in the next week or so.If Democrats win Colorado and North Carolina, if Greg Orman wins Kansas, and if (the biggest ""if"" in the list) Orman does caucus with the Democrats, they will have picked up one seat from Republicans. This brings our rolling total to a net of three Republican gains.Too Close To CallAs always, this is the category with the most movement. Kansas moved upwards (this time around) to ""leaning non-Republican,"" while Kentucky moved down from Leaning Republican and Alaska moved down from Leaning Democratic.Up in Alaska, my gut still tells me Mark Begich is going to eke out a victory. Democrats have been spending a lot of ""get out the vote"" money here, and polling is notoriously unreliable in the state. However, the Republican has gotten a few good polls of late, so I have to bow to the numbers and classify the race as Too Close To Call, at least for the moment.Arkansas is still incredibly close, as polls have been mixed (in some, the Republican has a tiny lead, in others Mark Pryor has a tiny lead). One interesting announcement from the campaign trail is that both Clintons, Bill and Hillary, will be stumping for Pryor in the coming days. The Clintons are still fondly remembered in Arkansas, so this may boost Pryor's numbers in the closing weeks. But it still remains one of the closest races in the country.The other contender for closest race of 2014 is still Iowa, where Bruce Braley has been struggling but is still neck-and-neck with Joni Ernst. A scandal was recently announced (Ernst's husband getting government contracts while she was in a lower office), but it remains to be seen whether it'll affect the polling or not.And, lastly, we have the race in Kentucky. Mitch McConnell has been up in the polls, and most everyone has called this race as either Leaning Republican or even Safe Republican, but Alison Lundergan Grimes just posted a lead over McConnell in the latest poll. This may be an outlier -- one poll showing a boost that doesn't actually exist -- but until this is made clear, the state has to be seen as Too Close To Call for now.Assuming the lean and safe lists pan out, Republicans will have to win three out of these four races to capture control of the Senate from Harry Reid. If Democrats can manage to win any two of them (assuming Greg Orman from Kansas joins them), it would put control of the Senate out of reach for Republicans.Chris Weigant blogs at: Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantBecome a fan of Chris on The Huffington Post"
