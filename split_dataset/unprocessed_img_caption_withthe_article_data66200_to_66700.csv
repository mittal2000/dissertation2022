0,BUSINESS,U.S. Fourth-Quarter GDP Rose At A 0.7 Percent Rate,"Lucia Mutikani, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/economic-growth-q4-2015_us_56ab6f6fe4b00b033aaeb194,The growth pace was in line with economists' expectations and followed a 2 percent rate in the third quarter.,2016-01-29,"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on January 29, 2016 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ab71a81a00001001ab1910.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth braked sharply in the fourth quarter as businesses stepped up efforts to reduce an inventory glut and a strong dollar and tepid global demand weighed on exports.Gross domestic product increased at a 0.7 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Friday in a report that showed a further cutback in investment by energy firms grappling with lower oil prices. Growth in consumer spending also slowed as unseasonably mild weather cut into spending on utilities.But with the labor market strengthening and some of the impediments to growth largely temporary, economists expect output to pick up in the first quarter of 2016. First-quarter growth estimates are for now mostly above a 2 percent rate.""The economy took its lumps late last year. It's not going to be smooth sailing in 2016, but we don't see the ship sinking either, and the rising concern about a recession later on this year triggered by China, those fears need a reality check,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.The Federal Reserve on Wednesday acknowledged that growth ""slowed late last year,"" but also noted that ""labor market conditions improved further."" The U.S. central bank raised interest rates in December for the first time since June 2006.Though the Fed has not ruled out another hike in March, weaker growth and financial markets volatility could see that delayed until June. Excluding inventories and trade, the economy grew at a 1.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter.The fourth-quarter growth pace was in line with economists' expectations and followed a 2 percent rate in the third quarter. The economy grew 2.4 percent in 2015 after a similar expansion in 2014.The GDP data, together with a surprise decision by the Bank of Japan to cut a benchmark interest rate below zero in a bold move to stimulate the Japanese economy, buoyed the dollar against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose and U.S. stocks were trading higher.In the fourth quarter, businesses accumulated $68.6 billion worth of inventory. While that was down from $85.5 billion in the third quarter, it was a bit more than economists had expected, suggesting inventories could remain a drag on growth in the first quarter.The small inventory build subtracted 0.45 percentage point from the first estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth.LIMITED SPILLOVERConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.2 percent rate. Though that was a step-down from the 3.0 percent pace notched in the third quarter, the gain was above economists' expectations.Unusually mild weather hurt sales of winter apparel in December and undermined demand for heating through the quarter.With gasoline prices around $2 per gallon, a tightening labor market gradually lifting wages and house prices boosting household wealth, economists believe the slowdown in consumer spending will be short-lived.""The consumer will continue to power ahead, as spillovers from the weak mining and manufacturing sector to services industries remain limited,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York.Income at the disposal of households after accounting for taxes and inflation increased 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter after rising 3.8 percent in the prior period. Savings rose to a lofty $739.3 billion from $700.6 billion in the third quarter.While a separate report from the University of Michigan showed a dip in its consumer sentiment index in January because of the recent stock market sell-off, consumer optimism remained at levels consistent with steady economic growth.The dollar, which has gained 11 percent against the currencies of the United States' trading partners since last January, remained a drag on exports, leading to a trade deficit that subtracted 0.47 percentage point from GDP growth in the fourth quarter.The downturn in energy sector investment put more pressure on business spending on nonresidential structures. Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts dropped at a 38.7 percent rate after plunging at a 47.0 percent pace in the third quarter.Investment in mining exploration, wells and shafts fell 35 percent in 2015, the largest drop since 1986.As oil prices appear to level off, the energy sector drag on the economy is expected to ease in the coming quarters. Oil prices have plummeted more than 60 percent since mid-2014, forcing oil field companies such as Schlumberger and Halliburton to slash their capital spending budgets.Business spending on equipment contracted at a 2.5 percent rate last quarter after rising at a 9.9 percent pace in the third quarter. Investment in residential construction remained a bright spot, rising at a 8.1 percent rate.With consumer spending softening, inflation retreated in the fourth quarter. A price index in the GDP report that strips out food and energy costs increased at a 1.2 percent rate, slowing from a 1.4 percent pace in the third quarter.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)"

A new HuffPost/YouGov survey of GOP activists finds that he's increasingly seen as electable.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ab9f262a00002c000318bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The most politically active members of the Republican Party have warmed to Donald Trump’s bid for the party’s presidential nomination since last summer, according to a new Huffington Post/YouGov poll, which finds 68 percent now think he could win the general election. While most surveys attempt to reflect the entire electorate, this one is the latest in a trio of polls focusing solely on Republican activists: well-informed party stalwarts who've run for or held office, served as party officials, worked on campaigns or volunteered their time before elections. Their views shouldn't be seen as representative of the horserace as a whole, but they provide some insight into the role of GOP political leaders in an election cycle where public opinions have repeatedly flouted the establishment. With days until the Iowa caucus and only a scattered handful of endorsements coming from elected officials in Washington, there are increasing signs that the Republican establishment is losing its grip on its activist base.Prior HuffPost/YouGov activist surveys map the stages of Trump's political ascent among that group. Last July, while he attracted a significant fraction of support, just over a quarter believed he was capable of winning the Republican nomination or the general election, with even fewer considering him acceptable to most Republicans. By September, he'd convinced a slim majority he was electable. Much of the data, however, still painted him as a ""factional"" candidate with intense support in some corners of the party but a ceiling to his appeal. He was still viewed as unacceptable to a majority of the GOP, with a significant group of activists saying they could never support him, or would be angry to see him nominated.The latest survey, conducted Jan. 14-20, finds that activists now see Trump as one of three candidates, along with Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who are capable of delivering victory in November.As in national polls, Donald Trump leads as the activists' first choice, taking 29 percent, with Cruz at a relatively close 25 percent. Previous waves of support for former neurosurgeon Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina have all but entirely ebbed, leaving Rubio, at 17 percent, as the only other candidate in the double digits.With first and second choice combined, Cruz takes the lead with 50 percent, followed by Trump with 45 percent and Rubio at 33 percent. A gap persists between two groups: volunteers, who've donated significant time or money, and ""semi-pros,"" who've worked in politics or run for office themselves. The volunteers split solidly for Trump, while the professionals are close to evenly divided between Trump and Cruz.More dramatic than the horserace numbers is the change to Trump's image and his perceived legitimacy as a candidate. In September, 40 percent of activists rated him unfavorably. Now 30 percent do, giving him lower negatives than anyone else in the field except Ben Carson, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. The percentage who say they could never support him has fallen from 28 percent to 20 percent in that time, while the share naming him acceptable to most Republicans has risen from 40 to 54 percent.While there's little precedent for candidates who lack political experience winning a nomination, let alone the presidency, a 68 percent majority of the activists surveyed now say that Trump is capable of winning a general election. That's up from just half of the activists last fall and 26 percent last summer, and outpaces the perceived viability of any other candidate. Candidates, of course, can shed those perceptions as easily as they earn them. In September, a majority of activists thought either Carson or Fiorina would be capable of winning the presidency; those numbers have since plummeted.Just two of Trump's rivals, however, seem currently poised to take advantage among the activists if he falters once voting begins. Cruz, at 61 percent, and Rubio, at 60 percent, are the only other contenders currently seen as electable by a majority of activists.Cruz, who leads in combined first- and second-choice preference, seems especially well-positioned. As in the previous survey, he is the top choice among activists who are self-described Tea Party members, among whom he leads Trump by 10 percentage points. He also retains a narrow lead among evangelical voters, although that could be threatened by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr.'s endorsement of Trump, made after the survey was conducted.Rubio, the lone establishment-friendly candidate to attract significant support among the activists, is rated positively by 69 percent of those surveyed. While that's down about 10 points from the previous survey, he remains largely popular, with just 11 percent saying they could never support him, and is considered slightly more electable than Cruz.Other establishment candidates fare considerably more poorly. While former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has leaned hard on his prospects in the general election, just 17 percent of activists consider him electable. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who's made headway in polls of the New Hampshire primary, does about equally badly, with 16 percent believing he can win.An outsider winning the nomination would be a historic upset, and without a single vote yet cast, there's time for both GOP activists and the electorate as a whole to shift. But the current trend lines suggest that the Republican base currently sees its non-traditional front-runners as its best bet.The survey consists of 500 completed interviews of self-identified Republicans selected from YouGov's opt-in online panelists who met the screening criteria for party activism. Interviews were conducted Jan. 14-20, 2016. Full results of the survey are here and crosstabulations are here.The screening criteria were as follows: Respondents who think of themselves as Republicans, say they would vote in a Republican primary in their state and say they have either run for office, held elected public office, been a paid staffer for a political campaign or elected official, been a party official or substantively contributed time or money to a campaign.For weighting purposes, a sampling frame was created based on the American National Election Studies using similar measures of political activism. Cases were weighted to the frame using an iterative process known as raking. Weights were based on party identification, age, gender and education.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here. More details on the poll's methodology are available here.Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov's reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample, rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling.

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oregon-militants-court-battle_us_56ab940ee4b0010e80e9c7d4,Most of the people who occupied a federal wildlife refuge for a month will be defended at the expense of U.S. taxpayers.,2016-01-29,"FBI agents remove a road block sign at a checkpoint at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon on Jan. 28, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ab94ab1f00005000216ec6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- While four militants continue to occupy a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon, the eight individuals swept up in a law enforcement operation this week are behind bars, facing federal felony charges and preparing for a legal battle that could send them to prison and permanently take away their right to possess weapons.As of Friday, six of the militants have been assigned a federal public defender or court-appointed lawyer, meaning the federal government they were protesting will be footing their legal bills. Ammon Bundy -- the son of rancher Cliven Bundy, who engaged in a prior battle with the federal government over unpaid grazing fees -- is crowdsourcing online to pay for his private legal defense.All of the people arrested -- Ammon Bundy and his brother Ryan Bundy, Jon Ritzheimer, Joseph O'Shaughnessy, Ryan Payne, Brian Cavalier, Shawna Cox and Peter Santilli -- have a court appearance scheduled for Feb. 3 and an arraignment set for Feb. 24. They all face a charge of conspiracy ""to impede officers of the United States from discharging their official duties through use of force, intimidation, or threats.""In a statement issued by his lawyers, Ammon Bundy called on the militants still occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge to turn themselves in peacefully. ""The world is listening,"" he said. ""We will use the criminal discovery process to obtain information and government records. We will continue to educate the American people of the injustices that are taking place.""Bundy is crowdfunding for a total of $100,000 in legal fees. The online pitch his legal team set up says that while the protest was the first stage of Bundy's plan to deliver his message, ""Phase 2 is through the courts."" As of Friday, 21 supporters had pledged $1,979. Lawyers for Bundy told local news station KATU that they believed their client started a national conversation on public land rights. ""Ammon's argument is sound. Their message is clear. And they're going to continue even if they're in custody, continue to believe in liberty and freedom for American citizens,"" one lawyer said.Lissa Casey, another one of Bundy's lawyers, told local station KEZI that her firm took the case because it's interested in the Constitution, individual liberties and disputes between citizens and the government. ""This case has gone on to a national debate about federal government interacting with citizens in the form of land management. But I think that it’s going to be an even larger debate. And we wanted to help,"" Casey said.The militants began occupying the wildlife refuge on Jan. 2. Seeking to combat rumors about Tuesday's fatal shooting of militant Robert ""LaVoy"" Finicum, the FBI released aerial footage on Thursday that showed him fleeing law enforcement, nearly striking an FBI agent with his vehicle, then emerging from his car and appearing to reach for a loaded weapon in his pocket.In addition to the loaded 9 mm handgun that was in Finicum's pocket, agents found three other loaded weapons, including semi-automatic rifles, inside the truck, according to the FBI.David Fry, one of the four militants still at the wildlife refuge who has been livestreaming on YouTube under the name ""DefendYourBase,"" told the Los Angeles Times that he and his remaining colleagues were willing to leave, but wanted the FBI's guarantee that they would not be arrested.One video Fry uploaded on Thursday titled ""Maybe last Dance?"" shows a couple in camouflage slow-dancing to music blasting from a white pickup truck. The man in the footage said in a prior video that members of law enforcement were going to come in and kill them.In another video on Thursday morning, Fry said that one of the militants was wanted on a warrant, so only three of them were free to go. They believed the government might arrest them at a later date.""It turns out that if you do leave, they end up charging you later, and they are pressing everyone here it sounds like with that same felony charge of interfering with a federal employee's job,"" Fry said. ""If you get a felony, you can't vote anymore and they take your guns away."" The approach was ""unfair,"" he added.""A lot of those rioters over there in Ferguson and whatnot, they went to the riots with intentions of robbing and burning down cities, and everyone here came with intentions of thinking it was a peaceful, you know, revolution,"" Fry said.Many of the armed militants said over the course of their occupation of federal land that they would match force with force if law enforcement confronted them.CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that the FBI's video footage was shot from a helicopter; it was shot from a plane."

When she steps onto Air Canada Centre’s sidelines on Sunday, Feb. 14, Hammon will become the first woman ever to coach in the NBA All-Star Game, serving on Gregg Popovich’s Western Conference staff. This feat is just the latest ceiling-shattering stepping-stone for the San Antonio Spurs coach. After playing in the WNBA for over a decade, Hammon was hired by Popovich and Co. in August 2014, becoming the first female assistant coach paid by an NBA team in the process. The following summer, she became the first female head coach of an NBA Summer League team, earning words of salute and praise from the San Antonio players themselves (“This day will go down in the books for years to come … I love her. I barely know her and I love her already,” said Jonathon Simmons, who was the Las Vegas Summer League's Championship Game MVP).Popovich was named head coach of the West as a result of the NBA’s “Riley Rule,” which mandates that the same head coach can't lead an All-Star team in consecutive seasons. And so, despite the fact that the Golden State Warriors have the conference’s best record, Steve Kerr is ineligible this year, shifting the coaching burden onto Popovich’s shoulders instead.From there, Popovich picked Hammon to serve on his All-Star staff. At this point, Hammon is making history virtually every time she takes the floor -- so thanks for knocking on that glass ceiling for the rest of us, Coach.Also on HuffPost:"

12,SCIENCE,How A Firm Helps Small Communities Remove Contamination From Their Water,"Matt Weiser, Water Deeply",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/simplewater-remove-arsenic_us_56aba78de4b00b033aaee7a1,"John Pujol and his team at SimpleWater, a Berkeley-based engineering firm, have developed a new way to put contaminated wells",2016-01-29,Berkeley-based engineering firm SimpleWater has developed a new way to remove arsenic from groundwater through the age-old rusting process. SimpleWater chief science officer Susan Amrose works in her lab.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56aba8452a00002c000318c6.jpeg?cache=nke3y9UFQf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"John Pujol and his team at SimpleWater, a Berkeley-based engineering firm, have developed a new way to put contaminated wells back into service by making friends with the age-old process of rusting metal. It could be cheaper and easier for many communities dealing with arsenic problems.The way some people look at it, California has plenty of water to survive its periodic droughts. The problem is much of that water isn’t drinkable, and can’t be made drinkable, because it is too contaminated.Water Deeply: How serious is the arsenic problem?John Pujol: An estimated 4 million Americans are drinking water with arsenic in it. This creates a 1-in-300 chance of developing cancer. There’s a lot of places in California where they cannot access their water in a drought because of a very small arsenic problem. It’s not like there’s no water in California. It’s just that it’s dirty.Water Deeply: What’s the typical solution?Pujol: You either have to drill new wells – and that’s a gamble – or you treat the water you’ve got, and that can get very expensive. Many treatment systems rely on filters or chemicals. These also require a staff to maintain and monitor.Water Deeply: How does your water treatment system work?Pujol: It’s a process called electrochemical arsenic remediation, or ECAR. We immerse an iron plate in the water flow. Then when we electrify the iron plate with a particular current, it coaxes iron particles off the plate. These bind with the arsenic in the water and settle out, leaving the water clean.It’s really painfully easy. This is an opportunity to change the way we treat water – switch it away from complexity. But scientifically, it’s unknown exactly what the mechanism is. Chances are, iron is a very good coagulant, so it’s good at removing any charged particles (like arsenic).Water Deeply: Is your system in use anywhere currently?Pujol: We’ve done a number of test projects. And later this year we’ll launch our first significant pilot project in the town of Grimes, in Colusa County, California, which has about 500 water connections. It’s a very low-income area, and they’ve already tried three other solutions, all of which were either ineffective or too expensive.Water Deeply: How much will this cost, and who’s paying for it?Pujol: It will cost between $300,000 and $400,000, which is more than it would cost in normal operating conditions because that includes extensive documentation and data analysis. Even so, we estimate it will be 60 percent cheaper than what they’ve tried before, mostly from operational savings. They won’t need to hire engineers or buy any chemicals.Every small water system has been burned at least once after paying for a full pilot project and then finding out afterward that it’s too expensive. There’s a Red Sea of failed arsenic technologies. So when we show up, we have to be careful. That’s why we’re paying for the pilot in Grimes with help from a $100,000 grant from the EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency).Water Deeply: Doesn’t the iron plate eventually erode away completely in your process?Pujol: Yes, it nearly corrodes the iron plate to extinction. And it creates a nontoxic, arsenic-laden solid waste from the eroded iron particles, which are gathered in a collection tank. But then our trucks will come pick up the old iron plate, replace it with a new one, and we’ll haul away the waste material. The water agency doesn’t have to manage this.Water Deeply: What other projects are you working on?Pujol: We’re working on a subscription-based water filtration solution for homeowners that we call DropDrop. It’s a small filter that screws onto your kitchen faucet. It’s a coconut-fiber cartridge that filters out lead, chlorine, arsenic and pharmaceuticals.Our goal, ultimately, is to shift water treatment away from the current model of a centralized water treatment facility. This is proving inadequate to treat the water problems we have in America today. No longer will municipalities have to solve water-quality problems on a regional basis. They can solve it at the tap.Water Deeply: How much will this cost?Pujol: We’re estimating it will cost the homeowner $7 per month. The problem with current faucet filters is that the replacement filters have to be purchased at a store, and you have to find a store that sells the right one. Also, many of these are clunky objects that get in the way of washing dishes, or they’re installed under the sink where they are easily neglected. Often, the homeowner forgets to change the filter for months and months, which renders the filter useless. Or they can’t find a replacement.With our solution, for a subscription fee of just $7 per month, the homeowner gets a new filter in their mailbox every month, which serves as a reminder and an incentive to change out the old one. And it’s easy: You just unscrew the end of your faucet just like you’re installing a faucet aerator. Then you pop out the old filter, drop in the new one, and screw it back together.

Researchers believe it is 11,000 light-years long and 2,500 light-years across. Fox and his team recently used the Hubble Space Telescope to learn about the cloud's chemical composition and origin.According to Hubblesite.org:The astronomers found that the Smith Cloud is as rich in sulfur as the Milky Way's outer disk, a region about 40,000 light-years from the galaxy's center (about 15,000 light-years farther out than our sun and solar system). This means that the Smith Cloud was enriched by material from stars. This would not happen if it were pristine hydrogen from outside the galaxy, or if it were the remnant of a failed galaxy devoid of stars. Instead, the cloud appears to have been ejected from within the Milky Way and is now boomeranging back.How the space cloud was catapulted from the Milky Way in the first place -- and what has kept it together -- remain unknown. Only more research will tell.The astronomers' findings appear in this month's edition of The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Also on HuffPost:"

Fox and his team recently used the Hubble Space Telescope to learn about the cloud's chemical composition and origin.According to Hubblesite.org:The astronomers found that the Smith Cloud is as rich in sulfur as the Milky Way's outer disk, a region about 40,000 light-years from the galaxy's center (about 15,000 light-years farther out than our sun and solar system). This means that the Smith Cloud was enriched by material from stars. This would not happen if it were pristine hydrogen from outside the galaxy, or if it were the remnant of a failed galaxy devoid of stars. Instead, the cloud appears to have been ejected from within the Milky Way and is now boomeranging back.How the space cloud was catapulted from the Milky Way in the first place -- and what has kept it together -- remain unknown. Only more research will tell.The astronomers' findings appear in this month's edition of The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Also on HuffPost:"

Despite the best efforts of his rivals, however, the front-runner’s shadow loomed large -- even though he wasn’t actually present at the Fox News Republican presidential debate.Trump’s decision to stage a dramatic, last-minute boycott of the event, which was hosted by the news network and Google in Des Moines, allowed candidates to engage in a more meaty -- yet decidedly less entertaining -- affair.Over and over again, though, the eerie specter of The Donald, who held a counter-rally for veterans at nearby Drake University, was felt on stage.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) attempted to dispense with Trump in the opening minutes of the debate, winning points from the audience by mocking the elephant in the room for being a no-show.""Let me say: I'm a maniac, and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat and ugly. And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon,"" Cruz said sarcastically, directing his final comment at Ben Carson. ""Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way,” Cruz added, garnering a round of laughter from candidates and viewers alike, “I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country.”Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush put it more succinctly.""I kind of miss him,” Bush said. Trump, the governor cheekily added, was “like a teddy bear to me.”The businessman's influence didn't end there.Responding to Trump’s proposal to ban all people of Muslim faith from entering the United States in the aftermath of the Paris terror attacks, famed neurosurgeon Ben Carson seemingly agreed, arguing the United States needed “to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.”Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), one of few candidates to issue a call to reason, pushed back against anti-Muslim rhetoric by objecting to the notion of closing mosques, which Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) have suggested in the past. Paul said going forward with such a plan was a “huge mistake.”Bush echoed the sentiment, and said that disparaging women and Hispanics (as Trump has done) would only produce a “toxic environment in our country.”Trump’s presence was felt on the issue of immigration as well. In one of the most notable exchanges in the night, Bush and Rubio argued over who changed their stance on granting undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship, an issue Trump has brought to the fore with his call to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.Bush said he had laid out his own immigration plan for legal status, not citizenship, in his book.""That is the book where you changed your position on immigration,"" Rubio shot back. ""Because you used to support a path to citizenship.""""So did you,"" Bush retorted. ""So did you, Marco.""And in an exchange between Rubio and Cruz, the Florida senator accused his Texas colleague of wanting “to trump Trump on immigration” -- suggesting how far the front-runner has dragged both men to the right in hopes of winning the GOP nomination.Cruz again followed Trump’s lead on the matter of the war against the so-called Islamic State. Asked whether he still wanted to carpet-bomb ISIS ""into oblivion,"" following Trump’s desire to “bomb the shit out of them,” Cruz doubled down.""It is not tough talk. It is a different fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama,” he said, dismissing the risk of striking civilians in Iraq and Syria.Democrats gleefully piled on. ""Make no mistake. Donald Trump was on that stage tonight,"" said Priorities USA, a super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton. Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that Trump’s “offensive and out-of-touch message was on full display” in Des Moines, where each candidate “tried to out-Trump each other on anti-immigrant bluster.”Unfortunately for Fox News, which failed to convince Trump to join the stage, Trump even managed to dominate the conversation online. According to Twitter, the percentage of users who discussed the businessman on its social messaging service stood at 37 percent during the debate, compared to Cruz, who garnered 16 percent of the conversation, and Rubio, who drew 13 percent.Asked whether Trump’s absence made a difference in the debate, Alex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, answered in the affirmative.“We got a lot more time, which was good,” Conant told reporters after the debate.Even Cruz, who left the debate without speaking to the press, conceded the GOP could not quit Trump.""He's always with us,"" he said.The GOP businessman, meanwhile, took the opportunity to gloat online.Also on HuffPost:"

But the list of witnesses does not include Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R), an omission that some are calling inexcusable.The oversight committee has called a hearing for next Wednesday at 9 a.m. focusing on violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act in Flint. The Flint water crisis came as a result of officials in the Snyder administration telling city officials not to use corrosion treatment after the city began pulling drinking water from the Flint River. The water then corroded the city's pipes, causing lead contamination. State officials dismissed complaints from Flint residents about the water quality for over a year.The committee released a list of witnesses Friday that includes Joel Beauvais, the acting deputy assistant administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Water; Keith Creagh, the director of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality; and Darnell Early, a former emergency manager for the city of Flint.The Detroit Free Press confirmed that Snyder was not invited to appear on the panel.In response, the Sierra Club is calling on the House committee to bring in Snyder. The group launched a ""Make Snyder Testify"" campaign Friday, which will include press events and a Twitter campaign under the hashtag #MakeSnyderTestify.""It's just amazingly inconceivable that the House Oversight Committee would hold a hearing looking into the Flint water crisis and not call the person most responsible for it happening,"" David Holtz, executive committee chair of the Michigan Sierra Club, told The Huffington Post. ""It smacks of them trying to divert attention and accountability away from Gov. Snyder, and it sounds like it's a big partisan effort to get people's attention focused elsewhere.""Holtz said that Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the oversight committee, is ""abetting Snyder in what some have called criminal acts"" by not calling him to appear before the panel.“The state of Michigan is conducting its own investigation,"" a spokesperson for the House committee told HuffPost in an email. ""Our responsibility as a Committee is at the federal level. We are looking at this from an operational standpoint and our witnesses reflect that.”The crisis has already led to the resignation of the EPA's regional administrator, after it became clear that the EPA knew about the contamination but did not effectively address it.A congressional staffer close to the process, speaking on background so as to be able to comment freely, said Democrats have requested that Snyder be called to appear. The staffer said the issue of who is invited to the hearing is ultimately up to the committee's Republican leadership.Democratic House members from Michigan are also calling for Snyder to appear before Congress.""Flint deserves answers from the state on how this terrible water crisis happened and what is being done to make it right,"" said Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) in a statement. ""Governor Snyder and his administration’s policies led to this man-made crisis and he must testify so that the whole truth can be found.""Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.), who serves as the ranking member on the oversight committee's Subcommittee on Interior, put out a statement this week calling for Snyder to testify.“Gov. Rick Snyder was at the top of my list of witnesses due to the central role that he has played in this manmade crisis; from the decision to shift from Flint’s original water source for cost-savings to the appalling delay in response to months of complaints by lead-poisoned residents and their children,” Lawrence said in the statement. “I am deeply disappointed at the Majority’s lack of commitment to a thorough and meaningful hearing. A sincere search for truth and justice requires a full review by the entire Committee of the decisions and policies of all those involved.""Lawrence plans to hold a press conference with members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and Congressional Black Caucus after Wednesday's hearing.Snyder's office did not respond to a request for comment."

20,POLITICS,The White House Wants To Know How Much Your Company Pays Women And Minorities,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-equal-pay_us_56ab977be4b00b033aaed292,Officials say it could help end pay discrimination and close the gender wage gap.,2016-01-29,"The White House announced the proposal on the seventh anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The White House announced Friday that it plans to start collecting data on the earnings of women and minorities at large U.S. companies in order to address pay discrimination.Under the proposal, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Labor Department would compile ""summary pay data"" broken down by gender, race and ethnicity at employers with 100 or more employees. Companies would not be required to fork over individual worker's names and salaries, only the aggregate numbers. The government already has a similar requirement, but it only pertains to federal contractors. The new proposal, which isn't finalized, would cover big employers throughout the private sector, involving an estimated 63 million workers. Businesses have two months to offer comments.Why require companies to do this?The White House said there are two reasons. First, it would compel companies to take a closer look each year at what they're paying women and minorities relative to other employees. Having to do such an annual review might help companies find wage gaps among their own workforces and address them on their own. Half a century ago, the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act made it illegal to pay one employee less than another because of race, ethnicity or gender.But the data would also help the EEOC find pay disparities in particular industries. The EEOC is responsible for enforcing civil rights laws in the workplace, and the White House says the data it wants to collect would help the agency figure out where problems are. (Ditto for the Labor Department, which has to track discrimination among federal contractors.) Large employers already must provide the government with data on the diversity of their workforce, but those requirements don't include pay figures.Jenny Yang, the EEOC's chair, said in a statement that pay discrimination ""remains a persistent problem"" and that the new data would be a ""significant step"" in addressing it. The White House announced the proposal on a day it was celebrating the seventh anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. That law, the first signed by President Barack Obama, gave workers more time to file claims against their employers if they were victims of pay discrimination. The law's namesake worked for Goodyear Tire for nearly 20 years and discovered after her retirement -- via an anonymous tip -- that she'd been paid less than her similarly skilled male colleagues. The Supreme Court said her claim was invalid because she hadn't filed it within 180 days of her last paycheck.In a report released Friday, the White House Council of Economic Advisers said the typical American woman working full time still earns ""21 percent less than the typical man."" The council said the U.S. gender wage gap is 2.5 percentage points larger than in the average industrialized country."

Halfway through his stump speech, Trump stopped talking about Iran and China and winning, and began instead telling the audience about some of the rich friends of his who'd agreed that day to contribute money to his private charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation.Trump said the money would be donated to veterans' support groups, but as of Friday afternoon, those groups had yet to be identified.The event's real purpose was obvious -- it was a political rally poorly disguised as a fundraiser for military vets. Real fundraising events cost money to attend; this one was free. And real fundraising events let people know where and how to donate money. Somehow, Trump failed to mention this on Thursday.Instead, Trump did what he's always done when he needs to fund the Donald J. Trump Foundation: He called up a small group of people who do business with him, or who owe him favors, and asked them to pony up.Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor who rescued the Trump Taj Mahal from bankruptcy in 2014, gave $500,000 after ""one quick phone call"" with Trump. Icahn has endorsed Trump for president, and Trump has floated the idea of nominating the investor as secretary of the Treasury. Las Vegas developer Phil Ruffin, who donated $1 million, is also in business with Trump. The two men are partners in the Trump Hotel Las Vegas, which they developed together. Ruffin is married to a former Miss Ukraine, whom he met through Trump at a Miss Universe pageant. Trump later served as best man at Ruffin's 2008 wedding.Howard Lorber is a fellow Manhattan real estate developer and golf buddy of Trump's who has appeared as a guest on Trump's former reality show, ""The Apprentice."" Trump also hired Lorber's son Michael for a summer internship. On Thursday, Trump called Lorber ""a great friend of our family"" who gave $100,000 to the Trump Foundation.Richard LeFrak, another billionaire real estate developer, is the only person whose dogs (two poodles) are allowed on the grounds of Trump's Mar-A-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. LeFrak and Trump have been friends and golf buddies for years, so when Trump called, LeFrak donated $100,000.Another donor was Nine West founder Jerome Fisher, who's been a guest of Trump's at Mar-A-Lago before. Fisher made headlines in 2008 when he got into an altercation at Trump's house with another guest, Robert Jaffe, a one-time recruiter for the infamous con man Bernie Madoff. Fisher was one of the scores of millionaires with Florida ties who were victims of Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Mall developer J.J. Cafaro, who socializes with Trump in Palm Beach, gave Trump's foundation $50,000, prompting Trump to describe Cafaro as ""a fantastic man.""What Trump didn't mention is that Cafaro has pleaded guilty two different times in federal court to charges related to illegal political campaign donations. In 2002, Cafaro pleaded guilty to attempting to bribe then-Rep. Jim Traficant (D-Ohio), part of a deal Cafaro made to avoid jail time. Six years later, he again pleaded guilty to a campaign-related offense -- this time, failing to disclose a $10,000 loan he'd made to his daughter's failed bid for a seat in Congress.Ike Perlmutter, whom Trump described as an ""unbelievable man from Marvel -- one of the great, great men in our country in terms of business and talent,"" also gave $1 million. It was generous gift, to be sure, but not nearly as generous as Perlmutter and his wife have been to the super PAC backing Trump's rival, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R). Last fall, Rubio's super PAC collected $2 million from the Perlmutters.Not surprisingly, Trump managed to save some lavish praise for himself: ""Donald Trump, another great builder in New York... gave $1 million, OK?"" he told the crowd, before pausing for applause. If Trump follows through on the gift, it will mark the first time in eight years that Trump has donated to the Donald J. Trump Foundation.It remains to be seen, however, whether the pledges from Trump's friends will actually be paid -- and if so, how. Trump, for one, has a well-documented habit of donating things to charity that don't actually cost him any money, like ""Lunch with Donald Trump"" and golf trips to the resorts he owns. Nonprofits then auction off what Trump himself has donated, and are sometimes even expected to share the auction proceeds with Trump's foundation.As of midday Friday, Trump had also collected over $620,000 for the Donald J. Trump Foundation from a website he launched the day before. The site promises that ""100% of your donations will go directly to Veterans [sic] needs,"" but doesn't offer any more details.Once the money is donated to Trump's foundation, donors can expect to have little say in what happens to it. Trump runs the foundation with a skeleton crew of family members and no staff, and he makes all the decisions about donations himself.Historically, veterans' charities have not been high on Trump's list of causes to support. According to Forbes, groups that help service members have received less than 5 percent of Trump's total charitable donations since 2009, with nearly half of that $57,000 coming from his one gift to Fisher House.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misidentified one of the donors to Trump's charity. It was Jerome Fisher, not Kenneth Fisher. The two men are not related.Note to readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

""Congress has not stood up to protect its constituents, but Facebook is stepping up to protect its users.""Licensed firearms dealers will still be able to use Facebook to facilitate transactions, but not private individuals.Firearms have been easily traded on the social platform for years.

Many of the person-to-person transactions are legitimate -- allowed under loopholes in gun laws. But as VentureBeat noted, it's all too easy for sketchy deals:For instance, you can buy automatic weapons without a permit, guns with their serial numbers filed off, and weapons that may be prohibited by your state’s laws. If you’re under 18, you can buy a handgun, which federal law prohibits.The New York Times reported earlier this month that gun sales by unlicensed dealers continue to happen on Facebook. That's about to change.""Over the last two years, more and more people have been using Facebook to discover products and to buy and sell things to one another,"" Monika Bickert, Facebook’s head of product policy, told HuffPost in an email.

In 1966, the year commercial whaling was banned in the North Pacific, the population had been reduced to fewer than 1,400. Current estimates put their numbers at around 20,000. While the recovery of the species is a success story, the sanctuary recognized the need to pivot its attention to a more holistic approach. ""Managing a single species is not the way management is done, either on land or in the water,"" Tom said. ""We were trying to evolve to a much broader approach of managing some of these endangered animals as well as the resources in the ocean.""The state, however, argued the proposal went too far.Suzanne Case, head of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resource, outlined the state's concerns in a Jan. 22 letter to John Armor, acting director of NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries.""As the trustee of Hawaii’s natural resources, cultural resources, and submerged lands, the State of Hawaii supports an ecosystem-based management approach, but cannot endorse federal jurisdiction or enforcement of Hawaiian waters at this scale,"" Case wrote.NOAA's proposal came under fire from Hawaii residents concerned the plan and its associated regulations would restrict recreational ocean use and hurt business. Fishing groups opposed the proposal’s call to increase protective areas for Hawaiian monk seals, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.The NOAA proposal, introduced publicly in March, was six years in the making, according to Tom. He didn't have an estimate of the costs involved, but said NOAA ""spent a fair amount of time and energy"" on it.""But again, our mandate says that if we are working with states and in state waters, that the governor and state have the final say as to what we do,"" Tom said. ""If the state's not comfortable, or if they're not on board with our proposal, then it is wise for us to just sort of save everybody any more time and money on this.""The sanctuary says it will continue in its present form, conserving and protecting humpback whales and providing needed research support and public education.Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary is the only U.S. sanctuary dedicated to a single species.Also on HuffPost: "

Cleveland.com reports that Herold is married and her children are 1 and 3 years old.During the interview, Patton also referred to Herold as a ""young gal"" and ""sweetie.""Herold responded with a lengthy statement on her Facebook page Thursday morning, writing, ""Tom, only one man in my life is allowed to call me 'sweetie.' From now on, I respectfully ask you to refer to me as Jen, Jennifer, Ms. Herold, or your opponent.""She said it was ""insulting"" that he questioned her intelligence and whether she knew what being in state government entailed, noting she and her family took her decision to run very seriously. She also pointed out the sexism in his comments: I would also be remiss if I did not recognize the men who also serve while they have children at home. For example, our own Governor John Kasich has two teenage daughters. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s three children have all been born while he has been in Congress. He commutes weekly between Washington D.C. and his home in Janesville, Wisconsin.Female politicians frequently face questions that their male counterparts don't, often centered around how they can possibly handle their job and raise a family.When Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) ran for vice president in 2012, he rarely, if ever, received questions about how he could do so much as the father of three young children.In the 2008 campaign, in contrast, voters and the media constantly talked about how Sarah Palin, who was then the GOP's vice presidential nominee, could take care of her five children.Male politicians, however, are increasingly bringing up the issue on their own. Ryan insisted on maintaining his ""family time"" when he agreed to become speaker of the House last year. Patton has since tried to clarify his remarks, saying he apologizes ""if my words were misplaced on this matter.""""As a widower who raised five daughters, it was not my intention to suggest that a young mother couldn't serve ably in the legislature,"" he said in a statement. ""I used a poor choice of words to express what I know first-hand - raising young children and working is tough. Millions of women do just that every day, including my own daughters. I would ask to be judged on my hard work and advocacy for working families.""The Huffington Post recently sat down with four male members of Congress and asked them about how they fit time with their families into the busy schedule of being a lawmaker.

27,POLITICS,Here's The Problem With Hillary Clinton's Electability Argument,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-electability-bernie-sanders_us_56aa39bde4b0d82286d515ad,Most Democratic voters don't see her as their only chance of winning.,2016-01-28,More than half of the Democratic base now think Bernie Sanders could be elected.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56aa526b1a00002d00ab1810.jpeg?ops=crop_112_267_7206_4575%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton may have something of an electability problem.The problem is not that Democratic voters don't think she's electable. It's that they don't care who's electable. That's too bad for Clinton, since she's made electability a cornerstone of her campaign. Her ads now running in Iowa and New Hampshire describe her as ""the one candidate who can stop"" a Republican.To try to gauge how much Clinton's electability argument is resonating, HuffPost teamed with YouGov to probe the views of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters. What we found is that only 8 percent say they're backing somebody who isn't their top choice, but whom they see as more electable. Sixty-two percent say they're supporting their favorite candidate regardless of that consideration, while the rest are undecided or don't plan to vote.""I am absolutely determined that we're going to make sure we have a Democrat to succeed President Obama so we don't let the Republicans rip away the progress we have made together,"" Clinton told Iowa voters earlier this month. In New Hampshire, she similarly made what Time magazine described as ""a pitch for pragmatism, not passion.""The target audience for Clinton's electability argument also seems to be shrinking.A majority of all Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters -- 54 percent -- now say that Clinton's chief rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, is in fact electable. And not everybody agrees with Clinton's assessment of her own strength: 83 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters deem her electable, meaning nearly 1 in 5 think she does not have a chance in the general election. (Most of the latter, presumably, are already in the Sanders camp.)""[I]f the issue of electability were ever to shift dramatically to Sanders' advantage, this race would quickly and dramatically change,"" Democratic strategist Steve Kofinis wrote after conducting a focus group of mostly black South Carolina voters, who currently lean heavily toward Clinton.If Clinton is just an option, rather than the only viable possibility, for the Democratic Party, she needs to worry about attracting passion to go along with the pragmatism. Last July, HuffPost/YouGov polling found Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters 10 points more likely to be enthusiastic about Clinton than about Sanders, and 28 points more likely to say they'd be at least satisfied to have her as the nominee as to have him.Clinton hasn't become any less popular since then, but Sanders has caught up, nearly erasing that gap. Seventy-nine percent now say they would be at least satisfied to have Clinton as their candidate, while 73 percent say the same about Sanders. Forty percent would be enthusiastic about a Clinton candidacy, while 42 percent say the same about Sanders.None of this is fatal news for Clinton. Despite her current struggles in Iowa and New Hampshire, she so far has maintained a significant lead in national polls. Sanders has yet to woo the chunk of minority voters he would need to win in states like South Carolina and Florida. She also faces a primary electorate that, unlike the GOP counterpart, substantially prefers an establishment candidate over an outsider.Another problem for Sanders is that his support is by far strongest not among Democratic Party members, but among sympathetic independents who may or may not turn out to vote in primaries and caucuses. Democratic-leaning independents are far likelier than Democrats to consider Sanders electable and to express outright enthusiasm about his candidacy. Party members are considerably more positive about Clinton.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 16-19 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here. More details on the polls' methodology are available here.Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov's reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample, rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) agreed to co-sponsor a bill Thursday that would repeal a law he voted for which gives broad legal immunity to gun makers and dealers, after months of attacks from rival presidential candidate Hillary Clinton concerning his gun safety record. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act was passed in 2005, after the National Rifle Association made its passage a priority in order to shield gun manufacturers and sellers from lawsuits. Suits filed in the 1990s and early 2000s argued that they should make their products safer or track where their products are sold. The NRA’s Wayne LaPierre called the PLCAA “the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in 20 years.”Sanders voted for the legislation; Clinton voted against it.Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) introduced the Equal Justice for Gun Violence Victims Act, which would repeal the law, Wednesday. While Sanders resisted any suggestion that his vote was a mistake, he had inched towards saying that he would be open to revisiting the issue. Blumenthal and Murphy’s bill provided gun safety advocates with an opportunity to press Sanders and he announced support for it just before the last Democratic primary debate this month. Clinton's campaign said he was flip-flopping on the issue. On Thursday, Sanders said he would co-sponsor the legislation, dropping a previous demand he had made that the law must contain protections for small gun shops for him to put his name on the bill.Gun rights advocates pushing for PLCAA argued that lawsuits would bankrupt gun makers and sellers. But safety supporters advocating for its repeal say that the mere fact that plaintiffs would have a right to go to court under their legislation doesn’t mean they’ll succeed. They also argue that lawsuits have successfully changed the way the tobacco industry markets its products and helped ensure the safety of motor vehicles, so the gun industry should be held to the same standards of care. “Repealing PLCAA would not mean anyone would automatically be held liable -- it would merely put gun makers and dealers on equal footing with everyone else. But while the law remains on the books, our absurd reality is that the gun industry, which sells the most dangerous consumer product on the market, is subject to the lowest duty of care in the country,” Blumenthal and Schiff wrote in a post on Medium Wednesday. “By providing this unique immunity, Congress has effectively empowered the gun industry to ignore best practices and act with impunity. Rather than adopting commonsense policies that could reduce the deadly tide of gun violence across the nation, negligent sellers and manufacturers are protected from the consequences of their actions.”Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence, which has endorsed Clinton, celebrated Sanders’ co-sponsorship of the bill Thursday.“This great victory is proof of what can happen when the public holds politicians accountable -- which is happening on the gun violence prevention issue like never before,” Gross said in a statement. “Senator Sanders has defended his checkered record on gun safety very comfortably until very recently – until the American people held his feet to the fire. They knocked on his door and flooded his office with phone calls demanding action. And Sanders finally took notice. His next step must be to champion this legislation in Congress.”Gross pointed out that the family of Josh Adames, who was accidentally shot and killed by a friend in 2001, met with Sanders’ senate staff Wednesday. Hours after that meeting, Sanders’ office reached out to the Brady campaign to say he’d cosponsor the legislation.Adames was killed while visiting his friend's home in Chicago. His friend, who wanted to show off his father’s gun, removed the gun’s magazine and fired at Adames, thinking there were no longer any bullets in the weapon. But a bullet still in the chamber hit Adames in the stomach. His family’s lawsuit against Beretta, the maker of the gun, claimed that the company failed to put proper warnings or safety mechanism on the gun. But PLCAA blocked their suit in the Supreme Court, which declined to consider it in 2009.Hector Adames, Josh’s uncle, told The Huffington Post Wednesday that they were happy with Sanders' support of the legislation and that “any help, whether it comes early or late, is well received.”“We respect the politicians who realize it was a mistake and try to amend the mistake,” he added. “The problem was refusing to change, that hurts the cause, when there's no growth there.”Congressman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who is sponsoring the law in the House, said that “it was a tragedy that this bill was passed in the first place,” when asked at a press conference Thursday about whether he, Blumenthal and Murphy were pushing their legislation because of the attention PLCAA has gotten in the Democratic primary. “Without personalizing it to the presidential candidates … the harm has already been done,” he added."

The vice president asked to answer a question on deportations last so he could go into greater detail, said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), one of the members who signed onto a letter condemning the raids.“The vice president was very passionate about this,"" Becerra told reporters afterward. “They are trying to do this in not just a constructive and legal way, but they are trying to do it in a humane way.""Biden defended President Barack Obama, painting the deportations as the kind of enforcement that happens with “a broken immigration system,” Becerra added.Attempting to quell concerns further, the vice president told members that fewer than 100 immigrants had been deported under the latest enforcement actions, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters after the meeting. Biden also pushed back at the characterization that the administration was carrying out ""raids,"" she added.“He said they weren’t raids, they were individuals who either had broken the law in other ways other than status or were newcomers to the country,” Pelosi said.Pelosi quickly added that she sides with her members who have had concerns about the raids and the conditions under which families are held by the government.""Many of us have visited the border and seen the early stages, which were deplorable, and expressed our more than dismay to the administration, and then they started building these other centers,"" Pelosi said. The meeting came a day after Obama administration officials wrote to Democratic senators and House members defending their efforts to address a stream of families and unaccompanied children coming to the U.S. border to seek asylum. The Department of Homeland Security began early this year to carry out raids on some of the mothers and children who entered the country after May 11, 2014, and have received a final removal order. They initially picked up about 120 people, but not all of them were deported.The letter from Secretary of State John Kerry and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson lays out a similar case to the one the administration has made publicly.

""The enforcement actions referenced in your letter are consistent with this approach.""Kerry and Johnson also touted the administration’s humanitarian efforts and plans to expand refugee resettlement efforts in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. They specifically referenced the Central American Minors program, which was announced in 2014 and allows parents in the U.S. to apply for their children to come legally from the three countries. Kerry and Johnson noted that there have been more than 6,500 applications -- not mentioning that the number who have actually made it to the U.S. is far smaller because the program was so slow to start up.Senators and House members received the same letter from Kerry and Johnson, even though they had written separately with similar but not identical concerns. The letter to lawmakers in both chambers thanks them for a ""January 12, 2016 letter,"" referring to the one sent by House members.

In her op-ed, she hits the nail on the head describing the double standard to which she's regularly subjected. The 32-year-old writes that while she's alway had to deal with people calling her a ""slut,"" fame has only amplified the judgement and false stories. Still, she says ""even things I had done -- things a man would never be judged for -- got me lots of hate.""Rose goes on to write that after she divorced rapper Wiz Khalifa, she felt like her dating life was put under a microscope, while her ex -- who incidentally was accused of cheating on Rose throughout their marriage -- never had to defend his life choices for a moment:After my ex-husband Wiz Khalifa and I got a divorce, I’d go out for a date at a restaurant like any normal single human and people would say, “Man, she’s such a ho. She’s out at restaurants with guys.” Then they would see my ex-husband with a bunch of women. They would say, “He’s the man! That’s so cool.” So when I went on a date, I’m a whore, and when he’s piling girls in a car, he’s the man? There’s something wrong here.But Rose, who is pretty busy living her life and standing up against inequality, has stopped wasting her time caring about what other people think.""I thought, 'This is my life. This is about me. If you don’t like it, I don’t care. I’m going to do anything and everything I want with my own life,'” writes the model and mother to 2-year-old SebastianShe added, ""It’s about loving who you are, owning who you are and knowing that it’s OK to live your life how you want to live it.""And that is just one way to be a bad bitch.

Tamarind, dragon fruit, papaya, star fruit and rambutan -- these fruits are anything but strange for most Latinos but many Americans can't quite say the same. With that in mind, Flama sat a few reluctant non-Latinos down for an on-camera fruit tasting. It's safe to say that, for the most part, the participants weren't very impressed.""It looks like a sea creature, I trust that it’s not because this is about fruit,"" said one woman before tasting rambutan. After trying papaya, one man's first thought was to compare the fruit with the Dave Matthews Band. ""Like I get that people like it, but like it doesn't work for me,"" he said. Many users wrote comments on the video about an absence of more popular fruits like guanabana, mora, lulo, mangostino, granadilla and curuba. One question we do have for Flama, who in the world eats passion fruit straight from the source? Pro tip: Instead, turn it into a refreshing passion fruit juice or a delicious tart glaze.Also on HuffPost: "

And while members in attendance reported that there were no definitive decisions on how they'll move forward with the budget, it's clear there are some potential vote issues with the spending blueprint.Members don't have any firm demands yet, but a number of conservatives both in and outside of the House Freedom Caucus have expressed concern over the top-line 2017 spending number. Conservative Republicans would generally prefer to revert back to the spending number laid out in the 2011 Budget Control Act, rather than the new number to which Republicans and Democrats agreed in October -- a difference of about $30 billion. Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), the conservative who took down former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2014, told The Huffington Post Thursday that reducing the 2017 budget by $30 billion was the ""minimum fix needed this year."" He said that conservatives should get ""pledges on paper"" for a future overhaul of entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.That could be a problem for GOP leaders.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) privately met with Republican members of the chamber's budget committee earlier this month to tell them that the 2017 number isn't really negotiable, according to a senior GOP aide with knowledge of the meeting.Ryan and McCarthy argued that they need to adopt a budget and abide by the recent government spending numbers if they're going to have any chance of passing appropriations bills, the aide said. (Republicans look at the appropriations bills as a natural place to attach policy riders restricting agencies like the IRS and the Environmental Protection Agency.)""Every member wants to get back to a regular order appropriations process, and the budget is an important first step to achieving that goal,"" AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, told HuffPost on Thursday. ""The best path ahead will be discussed and determined by the conference in the coming weeks.""The budget is emerging as an early hurdle in Ryan's young speakership. The Congressional Budget Office recently handed Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), chairman of the budget committee, some difficult baselines to work with -- at least, if he wants to carry on the GOP tradition of balancing the budget within a 10-year time frame.Republicans are stuck in the bind of having to square increasing deficits within the 10-year window, and to get to balance, they'll have to rely on painful cuts as well as, probably, a collection of budgetary gimmicks.The problem is that Congress already used up the easiest spending cuts last year, and conservatives are apt to demand real reductions to achieve balance. Moderates, meanwhile, are likely to see the budget as an election-year liability -- particularly if they're forced to vote for cutting popular government programs.Complicating the matter is that the budget -- at least in this stage of the legislative process -- is usually a partisan vote. Republicans can't rely on a single Democrat to support the document. Therefore, the House GOP, with its 246 members, can only lose about 20 votes and still have a majority for passage.Part of the discussion on Thursday for conservatives involved the question of what could they get in exchange for supporting the higher spending number. But again, members are leaving final decisions for when they return to the Capitol next week.And this is just to start the budget negotiations. Once Price produces a document, conservatives will no doubt find issues with the budget -- as could moderates. Last year, defense hawks demanded additional spending outside the budget caps for their vote, which was a major point of contention among conservative budget committee members themselves.This year looks like it could be even more difficult."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a951ca1a00002d00ab176f.jpeg?cache=tYPw5gnaaT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The California board that oversees state taxes has endorsed a measure that would bar tampons and menstrual pads from being taxed as luxury items, marking a major step in the campaign to repeal the so-called tampon tax.The state Board of Equalization on Tuesday unanimously agreed to back a bill recently introduced by two members of the state assembly, Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens) and Ling Ling Chang (R-Diamond Bar). The measure would exempt tampons and pads from state sales taxes. California is one of 40 states where tampons aren't considered a necessity, and thus are subject to sales tax. (Many other health-related items are classified as necessities under the California tax code and aren't taxed.) The Board of Equalization's members are elected. The board's endorsement is important because its administration of state taxes gives it an authoritative view of items that should be taxable and exempt from sales tax. “Effectively we are being taxed for being born as women,” Garcia said in a statement. The bill ""is about social justice, gender equity in our tax code, it's an opportunity to end an outdated tax that uniquely targets women for a function of their body, a function we don't control and can't ignore every month of our adult life.""Garcia's office estimates the bill would save California women $20 million annually. The bill's sponsors argue that the tax puts an undue burden on the approximately 2 million California women living in poverty.""By putting that money back in the hands of women, we are creating greater access to a very important health product -- especially in low-income and homeless populations,"" said Chang.Backlash against the tampon tax has picked up steam in recent months. A Change.org petition started by Cosmopolitan magazine gathered more than 43,000 signatures, while a similar effort aimed at the European Union drew over 300,000 supporters. Last year, the Canadian government was pressured into dropping its tampon tax. French lawmakers followed suit in December.President Barack Obama commented on the issue during an interview this month with YouTube personality Ingrid Nilsen, who told the president she doesn't ""know anyone who has a period who think it's a luxury.""""I think that's fair to say,"" said Obama, who said he was unaware of the tax until Nilsen brought it up. ""I suspect it's because men were making the laws when those taxes were passed, and I think it's pretty sensible for women in those states ... to get those taxes removed."" So far, just five states have specifically exempted pads and tampons from sales taxes: Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Everywhere else, women pay as much as 10 percent in taxes on the already high cost of getting a monthly period. ""When we look at other items that are tax exempt, I think it is only fair that these essential female products be included,” Garcia said in a statement this month. ""In fact, it is my hope that one day these necessary items will be free to all women.""Bills similar to California's are under consideration in New York and Ohio."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is one of a group of liberal senators who helped convince the FCC to propose a rule allowing cable customers to rent set-top cable boxes from providers other than their cable companies, saving them money.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56aa7a6e2a00006e000317a2.jpeg?cache=LnScpF6mfq&ops=crop_183_236_3817_2278%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Cable customers who are tired of paying through the nose to rent set-top boxes are about to see some serious savings, thanks to a new proposal from the Federal Communications Commission.The new regulation would open up the set-top box market to consumer choice so that customers could rent or buy devices from providers other than their cable companies. About 99 percent of cable customers currently rent set-top boxes from their cable company. According to a survey commissioned by Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), cable customers pay an average of $232 a year for those rentals -- a $20 billion market annually, just for set-top box rentals.Set-top box fees have soared, even as prices for newer technology have plummeted. Consumer payments for set-top boxes are up 185 percent over the past two decades, according to FCC estimates, even as prices for laptops and cell phones have fallen.Up to $14 billion of the total market is economically pointless profit for cable companies, according to an analysis by the Consumer Federation of America and Public Knowledge, a nonprofit Internet freedom group. Big cable companies including Comcast and Verizon have leveraged their market power to charge prices far higher than what would be permitted in a competitive industry.Cable companies and their lobbyists are furious about the plan, which the commission is set to vote on Feb. 18. But the proposal didn't emerge from a vacuum. Liberal senators have been pressuring the FCC to act on cable ""monopolies"" for months. In July, current Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) organized a letter calling on the agency to collect a host of consumer pricing information from cable companies -- a move designed to show that in many regions of the country, households pay arbitrarily high prices due to a lack of other cable options. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), Markey and Blumenthal all signed on to the letter.After Markey and Blumenthal did their own pricing survey in July, they organized another letter to the FCC in November, specifically targeting set-top boxes. Sanders, Warren and Franken all signed on, as did Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Corey Booker (D-N.J.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). A lot of congressional work doesn't involve voting on legislation. Simply writing a letter to a regulatory agency can often influence policy. That pressure can both help and hurt big firms, even in a Democratic administration ostensibly committed to helping consumers. In recent years, financial regulators have repeatedly watered down key banking rules after being pressured by members of Congress. The Senate campaign against the FCC, however, had the opposite function -- pushing the FCC to move on a policy that helps consumers save money by cutting into big corporate profits.The FCC, of course, wouldn't have introduced its rule if it didn't want to. And other expert consumer groups -- the Consumer Federation of America and Public Knowledge, for instance -- clearly played a role. But the rulemaking still serves as a concrete example of successful policymaking by a handful of liberal senators in an era of almost total congressional gridlock.Jason Linkins and Zach Carter are co-hosts of the HuffPost Politics podcast ""So That Happened.""

The latest Pew Religious Landscape Study suggests that a full 34 percent of American adults currently claim a religious identity that's different from the one they were raised in. If you count the three major Protestant traditions (evangelical Protestantism, mainline Protestantism and historically black Protestantism) as separate groups, the number of Americans who have switched religions rises to 42 percent. Author and speaker Mike McHargue, also known as ""Science Mike,"" and musician Michael Gungor are hosts of The Liturgist Podcast, a Christian program that is dedicated to serving the ""spiritually homeless and frustrated."" They were both raised in evangelical traditions, but had their faith shaken to the core when they reached adulthood -- to the point where they questioned the existence of God. McHargue told The Huffington Post that he spent two years as a closeted atheist, teaching Sunday School and serving as a deacon. He said he was consistently rebuffed by his former religious community whenever he put out feelers to see if they would accept his doubt.Still, both McHargue and Gungor believe that their doubt has actually transformed and enriched the way they think about faith. They said it's also exposed them to a whole new community of spiritual people who are convinced that the big questions about God and about life don't always have easy answers. They've shared their thoughts on the importance of doubt in Christianity with HuffPost Religion below.What makes someone “spiritually homeless” and how do you think they get this way?Science Mike: Some number of the ""nones"" or religiously unaffiliated people, they miss some form of spirituality, but can't find a home in organized religions. Perhaps because they have gay friends, or they're concerned with racism within organized religions, or they just don't like the anti-scientific platform that the most popular forms of Christianity in America tend to be associated with. Then, there are people who continue to go to church, but don't feel like they belong there. They feel that there's a bigger, more expansive and open view of love and society. Those people feel alone, but they don't realize that there are millions of other people who feel the same way.The disciple Thomas didn't believe in the resurrection until he saw Jesus alive again with his own eyes. Did you think about Thomas during your period of doubting? What do you think of him now?Science Mike: I looked at the model of Thomas, but as I started to view the New Testament as primarily mythic, he just became a literary figure. At first, I admired Thomas' doubt, but as my faith fell apart, I actually felt like Thomas gave in to belief too easily after seeing Jesus. Maybe his doubt wasn't deep enough.Michael Gungor: I certainly see doubt in Thomas, but also in the Psalms and in Lamentations. The Psalms in particular have always informed my music. There's something really honest about them. A lot of, ""Where are you, God?"" And beyond that, there's a whole thread of the ""dark night of the soul"" in church history and in the lives of the saints. There are people throughout history who have wondered. I don't know how you can have a life of hope and faith without doubting, sometimes. I think faith requires doubt. How can someone doubt well, or have a healthy relationship with doubt?Science Mike: Stop feeling guilty about it. Stop feeling like you're wrong or shameful. When you look at the world, at the problem of evil, the idea of a loving God seems nutty. To doubt healthfully is to be comfortable with questioning these ideas, but at the same time, holding out some kind of hope. Faith isn't just a matter of believing great things, but wrestling with what it means to be a piece of the universe that can look at the dark night sky and say, ""Why is all of this happening?""Michael Gungor: I think also having a little bit of humility about it. Recognize your own subjective nature. You can certainly exercise your mind to see from other perspectives, but I think there should be an ever present humility. Doubt is a gift towards that end. What would you say to someone who is beginning to doubt their faith tradition?Michael Gungor: I was very upfront with my community. If they hadn't responded with open arms, I really doubt that I would have stuck around. I'm sure if they'd tried to proselytize me or tried to show me the error of my ways or preached scriptures at me, I wouldn't have taken it seriously. The thing that kept me part of the community through all of that was love. That's the only option for Christian communities dealing with people who have doubts. All of that stuff doesn't matter, the only real power that you have is love.Science Mike: Depending on your faith background, you may have to be careful. You may actually stand at some form of risk, or your relationships could be strained as a result. I'd encourage the doubting person to start by finding one person who is safe, who you can be completely honest with. Then, find another person. Once you've brought your close loved ones into that circle, the next thing is to find a community that accepts you exactly as you are, that is challenging for you and that helps you become who you could be. That may look like a building with pews. Or it could be a bottle of wine and a good meal with five to six friends.Was there a thought or mantra that you held onto during your period of doubt that you still think is useful to you now?Science Mike: My mantra is, ""I don't know."" The need for certainty is a human addiction. It's built into our psychology. I have found that the greatest joy in life is learning to kick that habit, to let go of the need to be certain about everything.Michael Gungor: My entire worldview is still drenched in doubt. Not a crippling doubt, just more of a childlike wonder. Sometimes, my daughter will dress up like a doctor and come up to me and give me a checkup. She'll say, ""Daddy, I need to listen to your heartbeat."" But she's a child with a medicine bag. That's kind of how I feel about all of humanity. We're just a bunch of children walking around with medicine bags and phones and briefcases and we feel pretty clever, we pretend to know what we're doing. We're all really just kind of lucky to be here, but we don't have that much figured out. So what I've learned is to hold any of my views pretty loosely and pretty pragmatically. So I think -- does this belief lead me to a place I don't want to go? Or does it help lead me into living a life of love, lead me into feeling more connected to my neighbor, to God, more connected to everything?The Liturgists have dedicated two of their podcasts to how they lost and found their faith. Check it out for more on the subject. *This interview has been edited for clarity and length.Also on HuffPost:"

Disney said last year that both Disneyland in Anaheim and Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World in Florida will be getting ""Star Wars"" themed lands.Parts of Disneyland closed earlier this month to make room for the construction. However, not much is known about the attractions that will be in the themed lands, beyond that there will be one that features a battle between the First Order and the Resistance, and one that involves flying the Millennium Falcon. That could change when Ford offers a preview of the new attractions on ""The Wonderful World of Disney: Disneyland 60.""The two-hour special celebrating the park's history will also feature Elton John, Josh Gad and Witney Carson, and will be hosted by Derek Hough.In addition, the Los Angeles Philharmonic will perform ""The Sorcerer’s Apprentice"" from the 1940 animated film ""Fantasia."""
44,PARENTS,Why The Simple Solution To Academic Success Might Be More Recess,Catherine Pearson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-the-simple-solution-to-academic-success-might-be-more-recess_us_56aa35b3e4b0d82286d51354,Play is so important.,2016-01-28,"Giving young students four, 15 minute recess breaks a day may help boost learning.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56aa37271f00007f00216d0f.jpeg?cache=K0TNOoeOPO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As schools look for more time to squeeze in math, reading and other academic subjects, a long-time cornerstone of elementary school life has taken a hit: recess. According to national estimates, first graders in U.S. public schools in 2005 averaged just under 28 minutes of recess a day. By grade six, it's roughly 24. But an alternate model, inspired by the Finnish system of peppering short breaks throughout the day, hopes to reverse the tide against unstructured playtime by encouraging schools to add back precious recess minutes in order to curb burnout and improve learning.Dubbed the ""LiiNK Project"" and founded by Debbie Rhea, associate dean of research in Harris College of Nursing and Health Sciences with Texas Christian University, the program has two arms: A character development component intended to foster intangibles like empathy and self-worth, and a restructuring of recess modeled after Finnish schools. In a conversation with The Huffington Post, Rhea emphasized the importance of the character development curriculum, which is taught through three, 15-minute lessons per week. But it is the call for more recess that has captured national attention.Participating kindergarten and first grade classrooms aim to give students four 15-minute breaks a day. There are two in the morning and two in the afternoon.""It's a very basic need for human beings to have these breaks,"" Rhea told The Huffington Post.""It's great for the kids, but it's a really good break for the teachers also,"" she said. Overall, Rhea described the feeling in the classrooms as simultaneously more relaxed and more focused. Gail Hutchinson, a first grade teacher with Trinity Valley, a participating private school in Fort Worth, Texas, says the frequent breaks help her young students ""get their wiggles out"" -- a benefit that cannot be overstated in the context of high-energy six- and seven-year-olds.""We hit them hard with new skills in the morning, like math, then they go outside for 15 minutes. When they come back in, their brains are ready to absorb again,"" she said. Her students are more focused during classroom time, because they know they're guaranteed another play break soon.Transitions in and out of recess were difficult at first, Hutchinson said. The students need to line up, get in and out of any outerwear and settle back down quickly when they come inside. But they picked it up within a month.""They know, in order to keep having these breaks, we're going to have to work hard, and they're more apt to work hard anyway because they know they've got another break coming soon,"" she said.Of course, LiiNK -- which is now being utilized in the kindergarten and first grade classrooms of a handful of public and private schools, primarily in Texas -- is not the only model taking a hard look at the benefits of recess. A program called Playworks, which provides coaches who help schools improve the quality of recess, to make it more inclusive and transformative, has helped schools decrease bullying and improved transition times from play to learning. Groups like The American Academy of Pediatrics have called recess ""crucial,"" arguing that it not only provides a much-needed break, but helps foster intangibles such as perseverance and communication.LiiNK has its own specific criteria for measuring success, among them, the measuring of misbehavior during recess and off-task behavior during lessons by watching students for 10-second intervals, 10 times a day.Teachers also use more informal markers. Hutchinson has seen an improvement in students she laughingly calls her ""frequent fliers"" -- children who frequently ask to go to the bathroom or get a drink. The nature of recess has also changed, she believes. She's finding her students are more imaginative in the time allotted to them, making up creative games of their own. And parents say they see a difference, too.""I don't know if I would say she's more tuckered out,"" said Becca Williams of her daughter Emily, a first grader at Eagle Mountain Elementary in Forth Worth, who she described as active and outgoing.""But when she gets home from school now,"" she continued, ""she doesn't have that need to run and finally get all of her energy out.""Also on HuffPost:"

This could have saved more women from suffering this fate,” Nita Chaudhary, a co-founder of UltraViolet, told The Huffington Post.

He took these allegations seriously, investigated them and handled the employee discipline issues.”Complaints date back to 2008, according to a lawsuit filed against the city in September on behalf of 20 women living in public housing. According to the suit, when one tenant went to a maintenance office to inquire about repairs, a worker allegedly “pushed himself back from his desk, unzipped his fly [and] exposed his penis"" and then allegedly asked her, “What can you do with this?” The lawsuit also claimed authorities knew about the abuses since 2013.

Graziano maintains that he first became aware of the abuses in July and that the housing authority has since reformed.“The Housing Authority of Baltimore City has made sweeping changes to ensure that all residents can live in peace and dignity without being subjected to the atrocious behavior of a small group of people who inflicted indignity of an indescribable nature,” he said in an email.Graziano opened a hotline for women to anonymously report abuses and fired two maintenance workers after the lawsuit was filed. Earlier this month, the city settled with the plaintiffs for nearly $8 million. As part of the settlement, the women will be moved into livable housing and the three workers personally accused of sexual assault in the complaint have already been fired.To activists, what happened to these women is part of a larger pattern of mismanagement within Baltimore Public Housing.Many of the women said they felt they had no choice but to give in to the maintenance men.

The group's canvassers spoke to 1,689 people, 90 percent of whom cast ballots in 2012. While the report serves as a non-scientific ""front porch focus group,"" rather than a representative sample of the states' voters, its findings offer a glimpse into some voters' minds.Of the entire Democratic and Republican fields, the most popular single candidate was Donald Trump -- and it wasn't even close. Thirty-eight percent of people who had already made up their minds said they wanted to vote for the Republican real estate magnate. The candidate with the next highest share was Democrat Hillary Clinton, with 22 percent. Trump's haul was more than the rest of the GOP field combined, which was 22 percent. Democratic candidate and Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders rang up 12 percent of decided voters. The Clinton and Sanders shares, when combined, came out roughly equal to Trump's. A third of the Trump supporters were so loyal that they claimed they would not vote for another candidate if Trump were not the nominee. Not surprisingly, ""personality"" was a greater factor than policy issues for many Trump backers. Almost half of the Trump contingent said they liked him particularly because he speaks his mind.And that would partly explain this troubling finding for Democrats: One in four people who identified as Democrats said they were backing Trump.The good news for Democrats and the rest of the Republican field was that a slight majority of 53 percent said they still hadn't settled on a candidate. As Working America put it in their paper, ""key white-working class voters have not made up their minds yet in the 2016 presidential race, but of those who have, Donald Trump is the strongest choice.""Working America is a non-union wing of the AFL-CIO, known for its canvassing and ground game, particularly in the Rust Belt. The group knocked on doors outside Cleveland for obvious reasons: White, working-class voters make up more than half of the Ohio electorate. And as the old axiom says -- as Ohio goes, so goes the nation. A lot of the ""economically distressed"" communities they went to for this canvass -- four counties and 11 cities in Ohio and Pennsylvania -- are ""threaten[ing] to tip strongly toward the conservative populism embodied by Donald Trump’s rhetoric,"" Working America warned. The people they spoke to ""are fearful about their economic circumstances and prospects, angry about politicians who fail to address their concerns, and skeptical about the role of government.""While racism explained part of Trump's allure to those interviewed -- his attacks on immigrants and Muslims resonated with many -- Working America said economic anxiety seemed to play a bigger role: ""A far greater number of prospective voters are more deeply concerned about the economy and about their fates, and the future of their families, in a time of rapid change.""Read Working America's full report here.Also on HuffPost:"
