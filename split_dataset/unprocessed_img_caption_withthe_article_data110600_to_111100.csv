0,ENTERTAINMENT,Why Kevin Kline Loves Playing Charming Misanthropes,Christopher Rosen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kevin-kline-my-old-lady_n_5790070.html,,2014-09-09,"TORONTO, ON - SEPTEMBER 07: Actor Kevin Kline arrives at the 'My Old Lady' Premiere during the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival held at the Winter Garden Theatre on September 7, 2014 in Toronto, Canada. (Photo by Jeremychanphotography/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e4f0293230000a404ddd191.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Those who scroll aimlessly through Netflix on a nightly basis would be wise to put on 1991's ""Soapdish"" as soon as possible. Michael Hoffman's satire of soap operas (if you don't remember what those are, ask your parents) is still hilarious, and includes top-shelf performances from Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg and, as a washed-up actor, Kevin Kline.""I haven't seen it since it came out,"" Kline told HuffPost Entertainment. ""At the time I remember just laughing out loud when I read the script. I thought actors and people in the business would really get this, but I didn't know if the rest of the world would. But I thought that about 'A Chorus Line,' too.""Kline's back on screens this month in ""My Old Lady,"" an adaptation of Israel Horovitz's play of the same name. For Horovitz, 75, the comedy-drama about French real estate and family secrets marks his directorial debut. ""I find the best way to do these 'indie' films, which are done as inexpensively as possible, is to take each scene as it comes,"" Kline said. ""I got a taste of it when I worked with Robert Altman on 'Prairie Home Companion.' It's 'make it up as you go along,' and it's a very malleable, living and organic thing. You have to have a plan and then you have to be able to fiddle with the plan. That's the way Israel worked, too, which is pretty amazing since this is his first time out.""In ""My Old Lady,"" which debuted at the this year's Toronto International Film Festival, Kline stars as Mathias Gold, a New Yorker who inherits his father's French apartment after the older man's death. The catch? Mathilde Girard (Maggie Smith), a 92-year-old English woman living in the apartment with her daughter (Kristen Scott Thomas). Mathias' father engaged in a viager, where the home buyer agrees to pay the seller a monthly sum for the property, and can't occupy the residence until after the seller dies. Over the course of the film, Mathias and Mathilde form an uneasy alliance, and each helps the other reveal a side they had previously kept hidden from the world. Kline and Smith are predictably electric together.""People ascribe chemistry, but we're just doing our jobs,"" Kline said of working with Smith, who is 79 and aged up to play Mathilde. ""I've had four weeks rehearsal on 'The Big Chill' to get a sense of ensemble and a sense of comfort. I've had no rehearsals too, and you get the same ensemble effect. It starts with the script. If the script is good, it'll create that and the chemistry will follow.""Mathias suits Kline in a way similar to his turn as Jaques in ""As You Like It"": The character possesses a misanthropic charm, and Kline plumbs those depths for some great pathos.""There are characters who are oppositional. If you say white, he'll say black. Just difficult and ornery. But I love those guys,"" Kline said. ""There's something attractive about someone who dares to be who he is and risk not being the least bit ingratiating to anyone. He's not there to make friends. In fact, he's more comfortable making enemies.""""My Old Lady"" is out in limited release on Friday. "

2,TRAVEL,Different From the Norm: 12 Unique Hotel Stays in NYC,"Oyster, ContributorVisiting, photographing, reviewing, and rating each hotel",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/different-from-the-norm-1_b_5793132.html,"Forget chain hotels with cookie-cutter appointments: In NYC, there is a new and exciting hotel waiting to be discovered on nearly every street corner (you just probably haven't noticed them before).",2014-09-09,"The New York skyline, including One World Trade Center, is shown in this Dec. 1, 2013 aerial photo. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e48c7240000500053eb99.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New York City is a one-of-a-kind town. So it only seems right that your stay in the Big Apple be one-of-a-kind as well. Forget chain hotels with cookie cutter appointments: In NYC, there is a new and exciting hotel waiting to be discovered on nearly every street corner (you just probably haven't noticed them before). Whether you want to stay in a classic brownstone that doubles as an art gallery, or you prefer a high-design, budget-friendly hostel, New York City has it all -- and Oyster has been lucky enough to have seen them all in our travels. Here are a dozen of our favorite unique hotel stays in New York City.-- Kristina Fazzalaro, Oyster.com1. The Inn at Irving PlaceThis charming, cozy inn is a hidden gem -- quite literally. There is no hotel sign at all, and from the street, the two 19th-century, red-brick townhouses that make up the property could be mistaken for residential homes. And it's this -- coupled with an attention to detail and old-world charm - that sets this quaint boutique hotel apart from the rest of the city's smaller stays. The Inn at Irving Place's 12 rooms have been individually decorated with period antiques and fireplaces, and feature modern amenities, such as flat-screen TVs, iPod docks, and free Wi-Fi. The property lacks most of the amenities of larger hotels, including a fitness center and a full restaurant -- but it does offer an elegant tea salon (the famous Lady Mendyll's), a central location a block from Union Square, and an intimate feel that's hard to come by in bustling New York City. 2. Wythe HotelWith a hopping rooftop bar boasting jaw-dropping views of Manhattan, a wonderful restaurant, and cutting-edge industrial design, the Wythe Hotel is a destination unto itself. It's located near the subway as well as dozens of restaurants, bars, and shops in the heart of trendy Williamsburg, across the river from Manhattan in Brooklyn. Rooms are spacious and have high pine ceilings, reclaimed wood furnishings, and great amenities including flat-screen TVs, local, hand-made toiletries, free Wi-Fi, and radiant floor heating. If you're looking to explore the outer boroughs and want a truly unique, ""like the locals"" experience, the Wythe is an excellent option. 3. Chelsea Pines InnThis urban, 23-room bed-and-breakfast has an understated entrance located at the crossroads of three distinct (and cool) NYC neighborhoods -- Chelsea, the Meatpacking District, and the West Village. The Chelsea Pines Inn opened in the mid 80s, and it has become well-known for its genuine hospitality, thanks to owner Jay and his hand-picked staff. A film theme pervades, and guests will find original movie posters -- some perhaps strategically designed to distract guests from the five-floor walk-up (there's no elevator) -- classic movie-star-themed rooms, and a cat aptly named Charlie Chaplin. Free Wi-Fi, an impressive breakfast spread with Jay's homemade bread, and baked goodies in the afternoon add to the value -- and the homey, personal vibe. 4. La Maison d'ArtLa Maison d'Art is a true hidden gem, located on a brownstone-lined street in Harlem. This individualized boutique has just five rooms, and each one is beautifully curated -- much like the gallery space housed on the first floor of the property. An ever-changing array of paintings and sculptures line the walls, making even repeat stays unique. The gallery itself is open to the public and also hosts art-centric events throughout the year. The rooms are sumptuously decorated, and feature kitchenettes or full kitchens. There are no other amenities on-site, nor is there an elevator, but the homey, artistic vibe and welcoming staff make this property worth seeking out.5. Marmara Manhattan This Upper East Side gem essentially acts as a home away from home for its guests. All of the Marmara Manhattan's 108 guest rooms are either studios or one- or two-bedroom apartments with full kitchens that even include dishwashers. Some of the hotel's rooms might lack flat-screens, but it's still a clean, comfortable, pet-friendly option -- way up in a less-touristed part of the Upper East Side, within walking distance of Central Park and the Guggenheim museum. 6. Pod 39 The idea of the 366-room Pod 39 hotel is to offer very small rooms (even by New York City standards) for low prices (again, by New York City standards). Rooms range from 55 to 140 square feet, and prices start at $119 per night. The smallest rooms, or pods, only fit one person, but all have private bathrooms and smart design touches, like storage under the bed, train-inspired coat hooks, double flat-screen TVs for guests in bunk beds, and both outlets and a ""cell phone"" close to the pillows. There are three seriously cool -- and colorful -- public spaces: a fun Mexican restaurant, a rooftop bar with unique architecture, and a hangout space called the Playroom. 7. 414 Hotel The 414 Hotel is a 22-room boutique in Midtown West, situated along a quiet, tree-lined stretch of Restaurant Row (a popular area for pre-theater diners). Times Square and its eight subway lines are a short walk away, as are Broadway's main shows, making this a convenient stay for tourists. But the hotel also feels miles away from the hustle and bustle of NYC -- a vibe created by the homey nature of the hotel. Rooms in the two historical townhouses that comprise the hotel are bright and airy, with flat-screen TVs, iPod docks, and mini-fridges. Many face the hotel's charming courtyard, where guests can enjoy the hotel's free continental breakfast in warmer months. 8. Yotel European chain Yotel is known for its hip atmosphere and affordable rates. This Midtown West outpost is certainly hip, featuring three bars (including two on an enormous rooftop terrace), a Latin-Asian fusion restaurant, and a funky, outer space-like design. And it's usually affordable, at least for the area. Rooms are tiny, and the location on quiet 10th avenue is a bit out of the way, but the cool factor will make this a worthwhile option for a young, hipster set.9. Z Hotel The Z is a hip boutique in the up-and-coming neighborhood of Long Island City, Queens. Stylish rooms have dark gray accent walls with funky murals, floor-to-ceiling windows offering sweeping Manhattan views, and tons of fun details. The attractive, industrial-chic lounge is the meeting point for guests day and night, and offers a solid drinks and tapas menu well into the evening. The hotel's location (a short walk from seven subway lines and one stop on the E train from Midtown); outstanding freebies (Wi-Fi, hourly shuttle to and from Manhattan, loaner bikes, and phone calls); and reasonable rates (cheaper than Manhattan hotels) make it a great value. It's a chic option for those who don't mind staying in a quieter part of the city. 10. Hostelling International - New YorkCatering towards international travelers and groups, the Hostelling International - New York is a well-run budget property with numerous on-site features, including a theater, large business center, and several lounges, all of which are equipped with free Wi-Fi. Guests can opt to spend a bit extra on private rooms with amenities such as flat-screen TVs, coffeemakers, mini-fridges, and private bathrooms, or choose the very budget-friendly dorm rooms with small bunk beds, which can fit up to 12 guests. There is no fitness center and some find the Upper West Side location removed from major sights, but the hostel is within walking distance of Central Park and the subway, and free daily offerings include guided tours and pub crawls. It's a great idea for the adventurous traveler looking to get out and about to soak up all of New York City. 11. The Refinery Hotel  This stylish urban boutique in New York's Garment District is located in a historic building that was once a tea salon and hat factory. The property's past inspired its present industrial-chic design, and small details such as decorative milliner's tools pay homage to the building's former function. In the lobby, cool white stone and Gothic arches are contrasted against colorful contemporary art, while in the rooms, a minimalist black-and-white motif is warmed up by the oak hardwood floors. Features include a fitness center, a lobby bar (named for the historic tea salon's owner), the Parker & Quinn bistro, and a cool rooftop bar. The location is within walking distance of popular sights such as the Empire State Building, Bryant Park, and Herald Square.12. The Jane Hotel The 200-room Jane Hotel once provided temporary lodging to surviving crew members of the Titanic, and was later turned into an apartment cooperative. In 2008, hoteliers Sean MacPherson and Eric Goode (of Bowery and Maritime Hotel fame) restored the handsome West Village landmark into a cute and quirky micro hotel. Fans tout the hotel's stylish and unusually inexpensive rooms, free Wi-Fi throughout the building, polite and friendly staffers, and easy access to the West Village and the Meatpacking District. Some rooms are just 50-square-feet, so pack wisely -- and get a glimpse into the true value of NYC real estate."

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1cc9c2200003401db6b85.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Before the NFL spotlight and the success, Ray Rice was just a little guy. A sponge ready to learn. Ready to be loved. What messages did this young boy receive? Was he told to be a man? Was he shown that being a man meant using force to get his needs met? Was he surrounded by male role models that demonstrated respect and equality for the women in his life? Was he told that boys don't cry? Were incidents of physical aggression explained away by ""boys will be boys""?Ray Rice was once a preteen, presumably playing youth sports. Was he surrounded by coaches that mimicked him if he ""ran like a girl""? Was he part of a system where male teams and players were celebrated as heroes and demi-gods? Was he given a free pass for bad behavior due to his status? Did anyone talk to him about the sexist depictions of women that are commonplace in TV, music, movies and video games? Was he taught to respect his female peers? Did the males around him model respectful and healthy relationships?Ray Rice was once a teenager. Did his teachers, coaches, and family members have high expectations for the non-athlete side of his life? Did he use his male athlete privilege for the good of others? Were girls seen as an athletic conquest and a reward for his athletic success on the playing field? Was he in a locker room that objectified women and girls? Was he or his fellow athletes held accountable for their off field behavior? Did he still carry that free pass, given earlier in life, that ""boys will be boys""? Ray Rice was once a college student. Did his status as a college football player give him a road free of accountability? Did his coaches and trainers convey the messages to suck it up, be a man, victory is everything? Did anyone ever sit him down and talk with him about healthy relationship, gender equality and gender respect? Was his locker room environment filled with sexism and misogyny?  Ray Rice is now, after many years of privilege, being held accountable for his abusive behavior toward a woman. He is now being told that such abuse is not acceptable at work (football) and in life. Initially, he was given a near ""free pass"" with his two-game suspension. It seemed that the Baltimore Ravens and the NFL wanted to ignore or forget the part that happened behind closed doors, albeit an elevator door. But now with the world watching the video of him actually hitting his fiancée, they are on fire.   Imagine now if Ray Rice, as that cute little toddler, was surrounded by people, male and female, who gave him clear instructions and information on how to be a person (regardless of gender). A person who as he grows through life, respects those different than he is, that values women as equals, that uses his privilege for good, that would walk away from conflict, that doesn't buy into the belief that ""boys will be boys.""The country and media are now playing Monday morning quarterback with this story and placing a lot of blame on the NFL for how the violence was initially handled. And rightly so, the NFL as an employer, should be held accountable. But I wonder, at the same time, how many of these same folks are holding their own employees accountable? Or how many of us are sitting down with our young boys -- budding athletes, artists, scientists, doctors, spiritual leaders -- and having a conversation with them about how what happens behind doors matters -- every single time -- it matters.  What are you telling your little boy, your preteen, your teen, your college student, your young adult?"
4,POLITICS,Build We Must -- Abroad But Not at Home,"Tom Engelhardt, ContributorEditor, TomDispatch.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/military-reconstruction-infrastructure-spending_b_5783318.html,"As of this year, more U.S. and NATO money had been ""squandered"" on the ""reconstruction"" of Afghanistan than was spent on the full post-World War-II Marshall Plan to put a devastated Europe back on its feet. And how has all that spending turned out?",2014-09-08,"A US soldier of a team protection squad of a PRT (Provincial Reconstruction team) walks along a road under-construction near Bagram, about 60 kms from Kabul on January 11, 2010. Three US soldiers, one French trooper and a British bomb disposal expert were killed on January 11, NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said. There are about 113,000 foreign troops under US and NATO command based in Afghanistan, with about 40,000 more due to be deployed this year to try to turn around the costly war against the resurgent Taliban. AFP PHOTO /JOEL SAGET (Photo credit should read JOEL SAGET/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d52e240000500098f5b0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Cross-posted with TomDispatch.comIn light of recent history, perhaps it's time to update that classic U.S. Army recruitment campaign slogan from ""be all that you can be"" to ""build all that you can build."" Consider it an irony that, in an era when Congress struggles to raise enough money to give America's potholed, overcrowded highways a helping hand, building new roads in Afghanistan proved no problem at all (even when they led nowhere). In fact, the U.S. military spent billions of taxpayer dollars in both Afghanistan and Iraq on nation-building infrastructural efforts of all sorts, and the Pentagon's Inspector General (IG) repeatedly reported on the failures, disasters, and boondoggles that resulted. n 2012, for instance, the IG found that of the $10.6 billion in Afghan funding it examined, $7 billion was ""potentially wasted."" And this has never ended. In 2014, the IG typically reported that ""some 285 buildings, including barracks, medical clinics, and even fire stations built by the Army [in Afghanistan] are lined with substandard spray insulation so prone to ignition that they don't meet international building codes.""As of this year, more U.S. and NATO money had been ""squandered"" on the ""reconstruction"" of Afghanistan than was spent on the full post-World War-II Marshall Plan to put a devastated Europe back on its feet. And how has all that spending turned out? One thing is certain: those torrents of money helped create a devastating economy of corruption. As for reconstruction, the Inspector General found mainly ""poor planning, shoddy construction, mechanical failures, and inadequate oversight."" As Nick Turse, author of the award-winning book Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam, reminds us today in ""How Not to Win Hearts and Minds in Africa,"" thanks to the counterinsurgency strategy that the U.S. military has pursued in these years, most of this spending came under the heading of ""winning hearts and minds"" in the countries the U.S. invaded. Any American batallion-level commander in an Afghan village could essentially reach into his pocket and pull out the funds to build a schoolhouse. And yet, in the United States, much of our educational infrastructure, built after World War II for the Baby Boomer generation, is in need of reconstruction funds that are no longer in any pockets. The same holds true for American airports (none having been built in almost 20 years), bridges (almost half of them needing ""major structural investments"" in the next 15 years and 11% now considered ""structurally deficient""), highways, dams, levees, sewage and water systems, and the like. In 2013, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the country's infrastructure a grade of D+ and estimated that, to keep the U.S. a fully functioning first-world country, some $3.6 trillion dollars would have to be invested in infrastructural work by 2020. Fat chance. Though no one ever comments on it, the constant spending of money to win hearts and minds in distant lands should be considered passing strange when hearts and minds are at stake in Rhode Island, Arkansas, and Oregon. Stranger yet, the group designated to do that hearts-and-minds construction is also dedicated to destroying infrastructure in times of conflict. It shouldn't be surprising that nation-building, school by school, road by road, might not be its strong point.Worse yet, as Turse reports, continuing his remarkable ongoing investigation into the U.S. military's ""pivot"" to Africa, even after the disasters of Afghanistan and Iraq, it seems that there are hearts and minds still to win out there and all of Africa to build in."

Despite some spectacular flops, Hollywoodâs summer concluded with a record $4.7 billion in box-office revenue. The summer movie season closed out on Labor Day weekend as the boy band concert film âOne Direction: This Is Usâ took in an estimated $18 million from Friday to Monday for Sony Pictures, according to studio estimates Monday, Sept. 2, 2013. That wasnât enough to unseat âLee Danielsâ The Butler,â which stayed on top with $20 million. It was a positive note to end the summer for Hollywood. More than ever before, the industry packed the summer months with big-budget blockbusters that ranged from the hugely successful âIron Man 3â to the disastrous âThe Lone Ranger.â (AP Photo/Marvel, Zade Rosenthal, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb479792400003200561701.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After months of talking in circles about whether ""Iron Man 3"" would conclude Robert Downey Jr.'s tenure as Tony Stark, the actor confirmed in an interview with Variety that Marvel is not pursuing a fourth installment of the franchise.“There isn’t one in the pipe,” Downey said while promoting ""The Judge"" at the ongoing Toronto International Film Festival. “No, there’s no plan for a fourth ‘Iron Man.'”Even though this contradicts what Downey Jr. intimated to Entertainment Weekly in July, it's not like we won't see Stark Industries rise again. Downey Jr. is on board for two more sequels in Marvel and Disney's ""Avengers"" series. One of those opens May 2015, and the other is rumored for 2018. Of course, never say never. Downey Jr. didn't preclude the possibility of plans for ""Iron Man 4"" eventually springing up, but given Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige's initiatives for 2014 -- ""existing franchise, new franchise, existing franchise, new franchise"" -- and the release schedule's introduction of fresh characters like Ant-Man and Doctor Strange, it doesn't seem like Tony Stark is the commodity to anticipate right now, even if the first three movies did bring in a collective $2.4 billion worldwide.Still, could there be a recasting, á la ""The Amazing Spider-Man""? “I like that the idea is that it would be up to me, like I’m casting director for Marvel,” Downey Jr. said.[via Variety]"
