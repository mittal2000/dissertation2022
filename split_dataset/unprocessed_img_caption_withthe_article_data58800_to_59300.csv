It's even more difficult if you're gay.,2016-04-23,2016-04-23-1461388494-6260357-pride828056_1920.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-04-23-1461388494-6260357-pride828056_1920-thumb.jpg,"Image: Rainbow Flag. Stock Photo. Pixabay.comFinding a job in a country as poor as Armenia can be daunting under the best of circumstances.It's even more difficult if you're gay.That's because most employers hold the same anti-gay attitudes as society in general, and there are no laws to protect gays from discrimination.Job discrimination is just one obstacle that gays in Armenia and other former Soviet countries face, however.They must endure the scorn of family, friends and society, and condemnation from government and church leaders. Anti-gay legislation that some countries have enacted -- and that others have tried to enact -- has increased the vitriol.But the worst nightmare for gays in the region is the possibility of physical attack, including beatings, torture and death. The violence is widespread, and increasing, according to gay-rights advocates.Given the many news stories about attacks on Russian gays, and the country's recent enactment of anti-gay legislation, many people would be surprised to learn that pre-Soviet Russia was more tolerant toward gays than Western Europe. That changed when Soviet dictator Josef Stalin made homosexuality a crime.Although most former Soviet countries eliminated the law after they became independent in 1991, the long-term damage -- in terms of hardened attitudes toward gays -- had been done.Vladimir Putin, who began his career as a Soviet functionary, has obviously embraced the notion that homosexuality means deviance, perhaps a crime, certainly a sin. He has played a key role in fostering today's homophobic attitude in the region by speaking out against homosexuality and championing Russia's 2013 anti-gay-propaganda legislation. That law outlaws the dissemination of information about non-traditional sex.Russia is the trend-setter across the former Soviet Union, so it wasn't surprising when officials in other countries decried homosexuality and their parliaments tried to push through copies of Moscow's anti-gay-propaganda legislation.Although mistreatment of gays is common in the region, most people shrug it off, either condoning it or not caring.Every so often the issue surfaces in such a dramatic way that the public can't ignore it, however.In Armenia's capital of Yerevan, a club frequented by gays was firebombed in 2012.Politicians from the ruling Republican Party of Armenia and opposition parties sent a message about what they considered the deviant nature of gays by defending the brothers arrested for the crime.""I am sure these young men acted in accordance with our public and national ideology, and that they acted correctly,"" said Artsvik Minasyan, a member of parliament from the Dashnaktsutyun Party.In Ukraine, masked, homophobic thugs surrounded a hotel in Lviv where a gay festival was about to take place in March of this year and shouted, ""Kill, kill, kill!""Worried about their safety, organizers canceled the event and scurried from the city.Many Ukrainian gays took part in the Euromaidan protests in Kiev in 2014 that ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, who had tried to curry favor with Putin by championing anti-gay legislation in Ukraine.The gays, like others at the demonstrations, took part at great risk, because police ended up killing more than 100 protesters.Gays had joined in the uprising in hopes that a new, pro-European Union Ukrainian government would afford them the protections that gays in the EU enjoy. That didn't happen.In fact, anti-gay sentiment remains as strong as ever in Ukraine.In Russia, three men were arrested in Volgograd in 2013 for the brutal murder of a friend who admitted while drinking with them that he was gay.Police found the victim's naked body in a city square.His attackers had sexually abused him with beer bottles, and crushed his skull.A measure of the hate that gays engender in some Russians was the fact that the victim and his attackers had been friends not just for a short time, but for years.Another high-profile gay-bashing story in Armenia was a young man's decision this year to discuss on television how difficult it is to be openly gay in the country.Edgar Nahapetyan's main motivation for appearing on the talk show was the hope that it would help him get a job. Every employer he had contacted had rejected his application after learning he was gay -- a situation that's common in the former Soviet Union.Not only did his television appearance fail to help him land a job, but other guests on the show subjected him to horrific gay-bashing, and gay haters attacked him on social media.The gay-rights group PINK finally helped him find a janitor's job.But Nahapetyan is still shaken by the vicious reaction to his going on television.Meanwhile, human-rights defenders saw the episode as just one more piece of evidence that the journey to gay rights in the former Soviet Union will be long and harrowing.

2,HEALTHY LIVING,How Alaskan Soldiers Sleep When The Sun Barely Sets,Krithika Varagur,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alaska-soldiers-sleep_us_57193419e4b0d0042da8a4d8,Sleep takes extra effort in a land of extremes.,2016-04-22,Soldiers at a machine gun range at Fort Wainwright.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571935881600002a0031c5ea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We may think of sleep and its accessories as a luxury, but it's basically the opposite -- an essential body function whose absence leads to many complications with performance and cognition. No one knows that better than the soldiers of Fort Wainwright, an Army base in central Alaska.Its extreme northern location means each day anywhere from three to 22 hours of sunlight depending on the time of year. Right now, in early spring, they are already at 16-hour days. This irregularity means sleeping well, and consistently, is a huge challenge. So soldiers here go out of their way to make it happen, with ""happy lamps"" in the winter, blackout curtains in their bedrooms and yes, even sleep masks. ""All our senior leaders are embracing the need for sleep,"" Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Hough, an infantry battalion commander at Fort Wainwright, told The Huffington Post. ""We've all experienced the detrimental culture in which sleep deprivation was worn as a badge of honor, and we know there's only so hard we can push people before they start to make mistakes.""Hough is an active proponent of the Performance Triad, the Army's campaign to improve wellness and performance within its ranks by focusing on soldiers' fitness, nutrition, and sleep. But Hough has had to tailor the Triad's message to account for the battalion's singular environment. His soldiers observe a strict bedtime, between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m., including during the summer. Evening hours are not just device-proofed, but also daylight-proofed (with the aforementioned masks and curtains), since darkness is essential to restorative sleep. And in the winter, said Hough, Fort Wainwright's leaders are ""highly cognizant of the potential for seasonal depression."" So they organize extra social events and tell soldiers to get outside, as is customary in Alaska.""Alaskans say that it's never too cold to be outside,"" he said. ""Their culture really embraces their environment — so in winter, we try to get into hockey and skiing, and when it warms up, we celebrate things like the spring thaw.""Regardless of the season, these soldiers do their rigorous physical training at 6:30 every morning to institute some regularity in their schedule.Hough served in Iraq and Afghanistan starting in 2003, where he learned about sleep deprivation firsthand. He says this experience, common to many of today's army leaders, convinced him of the importance of sleep. ""There's really not much resistance to the Performance Triad around here,"" he said. ""My generation experienced the 'badge of honor' culture around sleep deprivation the most. We don't want to inflict that on our soldiers.""Residents of Alaska have more sleep problems than most other Americans because of the state's irregular daylight exposure, according to Heidi Knode of the Alaska Sleep Clinic. This is because sunlight is key to regulating circadian rhythms, the body's 24-hour sleep-wake cycle. Hough works to give his troops a sense of agency over their bodies within a domineering environment. ""When we use blackout shades, have regular schedules, get exercise every day, and eat well, then we get to sleep the way we want, not how the climate dictates,"" he said."

5,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Says It's 'Time To Shut Down' Pennsylvania Family Immigrant Detention Center,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-immigrant-detention_us_571a4a6be4b0d912d5fe6563,"""This is part of the broken criminal justice system.""",2016-04-22,Bernie Sanders campaigned spoke at a town hall in Pennsylvania Thursday ahead of the state's primary next week.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571a55fa22000029002544da.jpeg?cache=AYhHwltJEP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The fight to shut down a controversial family immigrant detention center in Pennsylvania received high-profile support on Thursday from Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who mentioned the issue during a campaign event ahead of the state's primary. Sanders, a Vermont independent senator, told a crowd in Reading, Pennsylvania, that he believes ""that it's time to shut down"" the nearby Berks County Residential Center. ""The government should not be in the painful and inhumane business of locking up families who have fled unspeakable violence in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and other countries throughout the world,"" he said. ""Instead we should treat these families with the compassion, the dignity and the respect they deserve.""Sanders has previously called for an end to family immigrant detention, which ballooned in 2014 after a surge in the number of mothers and children apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border. But highlighting Berks was significant for advocates in the state who have been working hard to get families, many of whom are seeking asylum in the U.S., out of detention.Berks is one of the nation's three family immigrant detention centers. Two others, established in 2014, are located in Karnes County, Texas, and Dilley, Texas. The Texas centers are far larger and privately operated, while the Berks facility is owned by the county and operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.But Berks is no less controversial. Advocates have raised questions about conditions and medical care there. Last week, a former employee was sentenced to prison for institutional sexual assault of a 19-year-old detainee in 2014.The Pennsylvania Department of Human Services announced in January it would not renew the Berks facility’s operating license as a child residential center because it was being used to hold immigrant families, rather than only children. Berks County appealed that decision.The Berks County Commissioners' Office referred questions to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE spokesman Khaalid Walls said operations will continue while the appeal is pending. Before Sanders' rally, attorney Bridget Cambria, who works with families in Berks, asked Sanders about whether he believes the facility should be shut down, given the licensing issue. Sanders did not seem to know about the specific situation, but said he supported closing it. ""This is part of the broken criminal justice system. ... I will do my best to stop the deportations, to shut down private detention centers, and I'm hearing now that the state feels that this detention center should not have a license,"" he said in video posted by the advocacy group Make the Road Pennsylvania. Adanjesus Marin, director of Make the Road Pennsylvania, introduced Sanders at the event and applauded the local community for going ""toe to toe with ICE and [demanding] an end to family detention in Berks county and across this whole nation."" Make the Road Pennsylvania and its political arm have not endorsed a candidate. Marin is also chair of the Working Families Pennsylvania PAC, which endorsed Sanders. Marin said Friday that groups dedicated to closing Berks gathered more than 1,000 signatures for a petition to shut down the facility at the Sanders event. Erika Almiron, executive director of the immigrant rights nonprofit Juntos, said in an interview Friday that she hopes other candidates will call out Berks specifically as well. Clinton has similarly called broadly for an end to family detention. ""It shows how important the issue is,"" Almiron said of Sanders' remarks. ""This isn't just a local issue, this is a national and global issue."""

In 2017, ""we suspect [Costco] will take its basic membership to $60 and its executive membership to $120,"" the report states. The analysts spoke with Costco and Richard Galanti, its executive vice president and chief financial officer, in their research.Costco declined to say if or when it might introduce a fee hike.""We have not announced if, or when, we would increase our annual membership fee,"" Galanti told The Huffington Post on Friday.""Historically, it has been increased about every five or six years,"" he added. ""I would guess that many equity analysts following our company might assume that same pattern.""The retail giant last upped its membership fee in 2011, from $50 to $55, according to financial news site The Motley Fool. Costco increases fees on a fairly regular basis, and investors have been predicting the company would increase its membership fee soon. Costco generates a large portion of its revenue from annual membership fees. Those fees brought in $2.53 billion for Costco in fiscal year 2015, accounting for 70 percent of its operating income. Increasing the membership fee could speed up the company's earnings growth in coming years. In the early part of 2016, revenue growth for the company was slow. For the 31 weeks ending April 3, 2016, Costco reported net sales of $68.96 billion, just a 2 percent increase compared to the same period last year, according to a Nasdaq report. But UBS's analyst note projects solid growth for the company in the coming year, due in part to the expected fee hike."

The,2016-04-22,"Former presidential candidate Ben Carson (L), Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie (C), and Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571a266a2200003600254472.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rarely have two U.S. presidential front-runners needed more from running mates than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.The Democratic and Republican leaders in the 2016 White House race are unusually unpopular nationally, polls show, despite their success with voters in their respective parties. Clinton has struggled to generate excitement about her candidacy and assuage voter concerns about her trustworthiness, while Trump fares badly among women and minorities in polls.Their weaknesses only increase the importance of their vice presidential pick, who could potentially help them rally support in key demographics ahead of the Nov. 8 vote - if each gets their party's nomination.Hispanic advocacy groups are lobbying Clinton to choose a Hispanic running mate. The person most often mentioned - Julian Castro, the housing and urban development secretary who is one of the party's rising stars - is opposed by liberal activists who accuse him of favoring Wall Street firms in the sale of distressed mortgages.Some of the groups have started an online petition against Castro's candidacy, which has angered the Latino Victory Fund, a nonpartisan advocacy group that has been pushing for a Latino vice-presidential nominee.“These attacks against Secretary Castro are completely unfounded, short sighted, and only serve to pit us against each other,” said Cristobal Alex, the fund’s president. The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce has called on Clinton to choose Castro.Democratic strategist Joe Velasquez, a Clinton supporter, said a Hispanic running mate could make a difference in swing states like Florida, Colorado, Nevada and Virginia, which have large Hispanic populations. Polls show Hispanic voters overwhelmingly dislike Trump, in part because of his comments likening illegal immigrants to criminals.U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez has also been mentioned as a possible Latino pick.But Clinton’s decision isn’t clear-cut.Given Trump’s unpopularity with some moderate Republicans, she may want a vice-president who can wrest away some of those voters. Someone like Tim Kaine, a senator from Virginia who personally opposes abortion, or New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who has close ties to the financial sector.There was no immediate comment from Castro, Kaine, Perez or Booker.Clinton though could give a higher priority to winning over liberal democrats, who see her as too pro-Wall Street and have flocked to her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Sherrod Brown, a senator from Ohio who is a fierce opponent of global trade deals, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a fierce critic of the banking industry, have both been named as possible vice president picks.Brown and Warren did not respond to requests for comment.Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis is skeptical that Clinton needs to spend much time appeasing the liberal wing of her party if she wins the nomination.“As much as people have made out this race between Clinton and Sanders to be an ideological death match, Donald Trump will do more to bring the Democratic Party together than anyone has ever done,” he said.Trump is viewed unfavorably by 80 percent of Democrats, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll.But other Democrats fear the increasingly bitter Clinton-Sanders battle, has fractured the party. Jim Manley, a former top aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, said Clinton's pick ""has to be viewed through a prism of, among other things, their ability to bring on Sanders voters.”SLIM PICKINGS?Both the Clinton and Trump campaigns refused to comment on the vice-presidential speculation, saying they remain focused on winning their respective nominating contests.Clinton holds a commanding lead among the party delegates who will pick the party's nominee, but Sanders has pledged to keep fighting. Trump may not have the Republican nomination locked down until the summer, if he can beat off challenges by Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, who is running a distant third in the Republican race.Typically, vice-presidential selections are vetted for weeks after a candidate has emerged as the party’s nominee and are announced shortly before the party conventions in the summer.Trump’s polarizing candidacy could make his job of finding a running mate more difficult. For much of the campaign season, many in the Republican establishment, along with well-funded political committees, have been looking for ways to keep Trump from winning the Republican nomination.Trump has stated his preference for an established office-holder rather than a political neophyte like himself, specifically listing Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and Kasich.Walker, who has endorsed Cruz, laughed when he was asked about the prospect, but has been noncommittal. Rubio has repeatedly rejected the idea. Kasich last week said there was “zero chance” of his playing second fiddle to Trump, despite mounting speculation that he would be an ideal candidate because of his deep government experience and Ohio’s crucial role as a general election swing state.A source close to Kasich told Reuters the governor has no interest in working with Trump as the two don't agree on much.Cruz, too, said this week he would not be Trump’s running mate, while telling reporters in Hollywood, Florida on Wednesday that ""a Trump-Kasich ticket loses to Hillary Clinton.""Tony Fratto, a Republican strategist, said Trump may be forced to turn to “guys at the end of their careers, not people who believe they have a future. Someone in their last act who has nothing to lose by accepting an offer from Trump.”That might include New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who has been one or the few establishment politicians to campaign for Trump, or Florida Governor Rick Scott, who has endorsed Trump. Both are in their final terms in office.Christie was asked about the prospect in an interview with a New Jersey radio station on Thursday.""The way I think about these things, you never say 'never,'"" he said.Other names linked to Trump include former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, a Trump adviser, and Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate.There was no immediate comment from Sessions, Scott and Giuliani. Armstrong Williams, a close adviser to Carson, said the former White House hopeful doesn’t want the slot.""At this point he has no interest in being in politics ... none,” Williams said. “I think Trump is looking for someone with government experience, someone who is more political.""(Reporting by James Oliphant, John Whitesides, Amanda Becker, Emily Flitter, Ginger Gibson, Steve Holland, Luciana Lopez, and Alana Wise.

8,BUSINESS,The Huge Question Uber's $100 Million Settlement Leaves Unanswered,Ben Walsh and Alexander C.

Instead, it's a neutral technology platform that connects drivers and riders. And its drivers aren't employees but independent contractors, free to work when they want and even for multiple competitors simultaneously, Uber argues. That difference is worth billions of dollars. Skirting labor law means Uber doesn't have to pay minimum wage, a huge windfall that keeps costs for the company low. By not treating drivers as employees, Uber saves an estimated $4.1 billion a year avoiding costs like payroll taxes, workers' compensation and reimbursing drivers for the costs of driving.Uber settled a class action lawsuit for up to $100 million on Thursday, keeping its drivers classified as independent contractors. The proposed 153-page settlement, which a judge must now approve, is a victory for the company. That's despite the requirement for the ride-hailing titan to pay $84 million to ""all Drivers in California and Massachusetts who have used the Uber App at any time since August 16, 2009,"" until the date when a court agrees to the settlement.But crucially, the legal deal leaves the outcome of several similar class action lawsuits across the country open. Uber faces action lawsuits from its drivers in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, Maryland, and Ohio.""The case is being settled -- not decided,"" said Boston-based labor lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan, who is representing the drivers, in a statement. ""No court has decided here whether Uber drivers are employees or independent contractors and that debate will not end here.""The settlement for drivers in California and Massachusetts is unlikely to directly impact class-action suits in Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania because they make their own labor laws around who qualifies as a contractor or an employee.An Uber spokesman would not comment on pending lawsuits. Liss-Riordan declined to comment beyond her statement on Friday.Uber told The Huffington Post it has no estimate for how much it would cost to reclassify its drivers as employees due to differences in how frequently drivers currently use the service. The company said 60 percent of its drivers work fewer than 10 hours a week.While the cash portion of Thursday's settlement applies only to drivers in California and Massachusetts, other aspects of the agreement would apply to drivers across the country. Uber has agreed to stop deactivating drivers without explanation or recourse, and will set up a ""'drivers' association"" that ""can play a role similar to a union,"" Liss-Riordan said in her statement. Drivers would be allowed to solicit tips from passengers. ""We believe these to be very significant changes that will improve work conditions for Uber drivers,"" Liss-Riordan added in the statement. ""While this case has been pending, we have heard many complaints from drivers about being deactivated without good cause and frustrations about pay issues that they have not been able to get addressed by Uber management.""

Terry McAuliffe.,2016-04-22,"Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe (D) said he would sign an order to restore voting rights to state residents who have completed their prison sentences, probation and parole. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571a49c522000036002544c5.jpeg?ops=crop_0_196_3676_2255%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) signed a major executive order Friday circumventing the state's Republican-controlled legislature by restoring voting rights to over 200,000 of the state’s residents who have been disenfranchised by past felony convictions.McAuliffe’s order will allow those who have completed their sentences and probation or parole to have their right to vote restored, run for office and serve on a jury or as a notary public, without having to petition the state to be re-enfranchised. “Throughout my administration my team and I have operated on a simple principle: Virginians who have served their time and reentered society should do so as full citizens of our Commonwealth and country,” McAuliffe said in a statement. “Too often in both our distant and recent history, politicians have used their authority to restrict peoples’ ability to participate in our democracy. Today we are reversing that disturbing trend and restoring the rights of more than 200,000 of our fellow Virginians who work, raise families and pay taxes in every corner of our Commonwealth.”McAuliffe’s rights restoration order applies to all ex-felons who have completed their sentence and other requirements as of April 22. Similar orders will be issued monthly to restore the rights of individuals who complete their sentences in the future.The order builds upon McAuliffe’s move last year to end the requirement that ex-felons pay outstanding court fees before they have their voting rights restored. In 2014, he also reduced the number of years that Virginians convicted of violent felonies had to wait before they could apply to vote again. The New York Times first reported that the governor’s move, which may very well be challenged in court, would overturn a provision in the state’s Constitution that was enacted as a means to prevent African-Americans from having political power. One in five African-Americans in the presidential battleground state don't have voting rights, according to The Sentencing Project. A press release from McAuliffe’s administration said the governor has already restored the rights of more than 18,000 Virginians, which is more than the past seven governors combined.The Republican Party of Virginia said McAuliffe's order was ""a transparent effort to win votes.""""Mercy requires that we as Virginians be a Commonwealth of second chances. But there are limits,” said the party’s chairman, John Whitbeck. ""[McAuliffe] could easily have excluded those who have committed heinous acts of violence from this order, but chose not to. Blanket restoration, without regard to the nature of the crimes committed, doesn't speak of mercy. It speaks of political opportunism.”Virginia House of Delegates Speaker William J. Howell (R) said in a statement that Republicans would ""immediately begin a detailed review of the Governor’s policy to determine what options are available to the General Assembly."" “It is hard to describe how transparent the Governor’s motives are. The singular purpose of Terry McAuliffe’s governorship is to elect Hillary Clinton President of the United States,"" he said. “When convicted felons have completed their sentence and paid their debt to society, they deserve the opportunity to demonstrate they once again deserve their civil rights. However, there should be a clear, consistent, and delineated policy that applies fairly and equitably. That policy should take into account the nature of the crimes committed, whether they have paid back their victims and the court system, and their willingness to serve as productive members of society."" Democrats and Republicans have also fought over other voting restrictions in the state. The Democratic Party of Virginia sued to block a voter identification law signed by former Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) in 2013 that requires voters to bring a photo ID to the polls, arguing that it would disproportionately burden low-income voters and racial minorities. A federal court heard arguments for their lawsuit in February.As the Brennan Center for Justice has documented, there is growing momentum for restoring voting rights in the states with the most restrictive laws. Legislation to restore federal voting rights to certain types of ex-felons has picked up some bipartisan interest in Congress, but some Republicans -- like governors in Maryland and Kentucky -- have remained resistant to rights restoration moves by their Democratic predecessors or legislators. Nearly 6 million Americans are currently banned from voting because of prior felony convictions. Maine and Vermont never strip voting rights from people convicted of felonies, while three states -- Kentucky, Iowa and Florida -- permanently disenfranchise all people with past felony convictions. Update: This story has been updated with comments from the state's Republican leadership."
10,BUSINESS,Tackling Climate Change Could Jump-Start The Economy,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tackling-climate-change-economy_us_57190c3fe4b0d912d5fdd92f,There's too much pollution and too little economic growth. A green revolution could fix both.,2016-04-22,"People ride their bikes in heavy smog on Feb.12, 2015 in Liaocheng, China.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57191a1322000029002542c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There's little doubt that curbing pollution and halting the relentless rise in global temperatures would improve the environment. Turns out, it could also create countless jobs and stimulate the global economy.That's the takeaway from remarks by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who spoke at the United Nations on Thursday ahead of the planned signing of the Paris climate accord on Friday, which is Earth Day.Nearly 200 nations agreed last December to reduce pollution in order to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over average temperatures at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. More than 170 nations are expected to sign the agreement.To Carney, an influential central banker, implementing the Paris agreement and tackling climate change is just one effort global leaders should pursue to lift the world's economy out of its ""current malaise"" of persistent low growth.Goals like arresting climate change and ending poverty are an ""economic imperative,"" Carney said. ""Their achievement would mean greater productivity, increased labor supply and ultimately, stronger growth. In short, they could pull the global economy out of its current malaise of secular stagnation.""Secular stagnation is a theory recently popularized by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers that describes an economy shackled by low growth despite low interest rates and little inflation. Carney had spent much of the past few years arguing that Summers is probably wrong, but he appears to be reconsidering his position. Aside from a massive amount of additional government spending, there's likely little that can be done to improve prospects in such an economy -- and that could well be the case in the U.S.But perhaps the shift away from a fossil fuel-powered global economy could do the trick. Putting a price on carbon emissions, which forces fossil fuel producers and users to pay for the pollution they cause, might be the best way to get there.""Carbon pricing is an invaluable tool for redirecting investments and transforming markets to build low-carbon, climate-resilient economies that will drive prosperity, strengthen security and improve the health and well-being of billions of people,"" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.Ban and heads of other global organizations like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund are pushing nations to quickly implement carbon pricing schemes, calling them ""essential"" if the world is to deliver on the promises of the Paris climate agreement. They want national leaders across the world to double the amount of carbon emissions subject to pricing by 2020 and quadruple today's levels by 2026.Just 12 percent of today's emissions carry explicit costs, according to the IMF. About 40 nations have attached prices to carbon pollution. The U.S. has not.Officials such as World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said they hope that attaching a price to emissions will cut pollution and stimulate more investment in green energy.""Prices for producing renewable energy are falling fast, and putting a price on carbon has the potential to make them even cheaper than fuels that pollute our planet,"" Kim said.Companies and the financial industry could encourage a green revolution if they start reporting the risks they face from climate change, Carney said, and if they increase the issuance of so-called green bonds, which are securities that finance environmentally friendly projects.Less than one percent of the world's outstanding bonds are ""green,"" he said, adding that ""financing the de-carbonization of our economy is a major opportunity for investors.""Moody's Investors Service this week increased its forecast of green bond issuance this year from $50 billion to as much as $70 billion.Some U.S. environmental groups are skeptical that financial markets can bring about the kind of change necessary to halt global warming. They've also criticized the Paris agreement as inadequate.""The Paris Treaty is largely symbolic and wholly toothless in dealing with the threat of climate change,"" said Wenonah Hauter, the executive director of the consumer protection group Food & Water Watch. ""False 'solutions' like market-based schemes and carbon pricing will only keep us using and abusing fossil fuels when what we need is a clean energy revolution.""Ángel Gurría, the secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said this week that his organization of mostly rich countries has been pushing carbon pricing for decades.But OECD members and other nations still have nearly 800 spending programs and tax breaks on their books that encourage fossil fuel production or usage."

12,GREEN,"This Guy Raps About Climate Change, And Bill Nye Loves Him",Casey Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-rap-baba-brinkman_us_5717baa3e4b024dae4f0bae1,"""The man can spit.""",2016-04-22,"Baba Brinkman calls himself a ""peer-reviewed rapper.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571a4a1a22000036002544c7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even the most political hip-hop songs don't typically delve into the intricacies of policy reform. Canadian rapper Baba Brinkman knows that. He raps about climate change anyway.Brinkman’s live rap show and forthcoming album, “The Rap Guide to Climate Chaos,” plunges into the abstract, intricate and often dry world of climate science and policy. He covers geophysics, climate justice and renewable energy, and makes the case for policies that would reduce carbon emissions.He uses smart, satisfying rhymes to educate, question and opine over original beats. “Scientists are telling us we’re perching on a precipice,” Brinkman raps in “Make it Hot,” a song about carbon pricing. “We need to convert the global economy and make it emission-less.”Brinkman might not be a big name in the rap world, but he's a respected and increasingly popular activist. He calls himself a ""peer-reviewed rapper,"" and the work he's doing -- using a familiar and expressive medium to teach people about science and policy -- is becoming more and more important as the effects of climate change make themselves felt around the world, according to scientist and educator Bill Nye.“Baba is amazing,” Nye told The Huffington Post. ""He writes hours of lyrics, learns them, and performs them -- telling you fantastic and important stories.""“The man can spit,” Nye added.The son of farmers and naturalists, Brinkman grew up on a tree farm on which he personally planted over a million trees. Since then, he has been dedicated to using rhymes to teach people about science, covering topics from evolution to the history of medicine.Brinkman came up with the idea for a climate change-themed rap while performing a hip-hop play about Charles Darwin in New York. A climate scientist saw the show and offered to help Brinkman write something about climate change.“He said, ‘If you want to do climate change, I’ll be your peer-reviewed contact and guide you through it,’” Brinkman told HuffPost.The artist began writing songs that synthesized the major scientific findings and policy positions on climate change. He debuted his climate-themed live performance at last year's Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland. It was a hit. Brinkman was invited to perform some of his rhymes at the Paris climate talks in December, where he was a crowd favorite.Given its popularity, hip-hop is becoming a useful way to communicate the urgency of climate change to the public, Nye said. “Hip-hop is what is fashionable right now,” he said. “It's the style of communicating ideas these days.”Brinkman is a particularly adept communicator. He condenses an encyclopedic knowledge of climate change into 90 minutes of digestible rhymes. Brinkman's rapping is smart, funny and informative. And he approaches his craft as a devoted student of hip-hop, lacing his songs with rhythmic and lyrical allusions to the genre’s greats: De la Soul, Nas, Run The Jewels.One of Brinkman's biggest challenges in creating ""The Rap Guide to Climate Chaos"" was incorporating vastly different perspectives into his songs. “I was dealing with this exact conundrum,” he said. “Am I going to be a doomsayer or am I going to be a bright-sider? Am I going to be a techno-utopian? Am I going to be a pro-market person?” “I said, ‘I’m going to create personas based on all these different views, and by the end you’re going to be familiar with what almost everyone thinks about climate change,’” he continued. In ""Laudato Si,"" Brinkman takes on the persona of the pope to make a moral case for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. ""Run the Joules"" covers basic geophysics and climate science. In an interlude, Brinkman adopts a libertarian point of view, arguing that we should do nothing at all to deal with climate change. But by the end of the show, Brinkman concludes that the most dramatic effects of climate change -- massive crop failures, superstorms, water shortages -- will start rocking the world long before markets can fix the problem. Ultimately, Brinkman proposes a carbon tax. “It’s not rational to just chill, like the contrarians say, because it’s hugely risky and you’re gambling against the mainstream scientific consensus,” he said.Brinkman's songs, which have titles like “Solar Panels on My Tesla,” might resonate with liberals, but seem unlikely to convert skeptics. Fortunately, there aren't many of them left. Over 90 percent of Americans believe the planet is warming, and 87 percent think humans are at least partly to blame.Not everyone feels compelled to act, though. Like many people in other high carbon-emitting countries, Americans aren't nearly as concerned about the effects of climate change as people who live in places, like parts of Africa and Asia, where climate change is already causing significant problems. In fact, only 41 percent of Americans think climate change is harming people today, according to Pew. Brinkman's target audience isn’t hardcore denialists, but those people in the middle -- folks who are sympathetic to climate science but who may not understand the scale of the problem.“I hope there’s a value to preaching to the converted in the sense of just energizing them to go back to the debate table,” Brinkman said. Ultimately, Brinkman said he wants to encourage people to push for aggressive climate policy wherever they are. “One of the things I want people to confront is that ... atomized, private responses to this are a recipe for disaster,” he said. “I don’t give people an easy answer about what they should do, because there is no easy answer.”Brinkman will be performing his ""Rap Guide to Climate Chaos"" through June 11 at the Soho Theater in New York. His album is scheduled to drop later this year. "

""It is like stealing Iran's money and we condemn it,"" Ansari said, according to Reuters. He added that the ruling ""is incompatible with international laws.""Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said during a visit to New York on Thursday that his country won't abide by the ruling.""The U.S. knows this well, too, that whatever action it takes with respect to Iran’s assets will make it accountable in the future, and it should return these assets to Iran,"" Zarif said, according to a report on Iran's state television.In 2012, Congress passed a law that instructed courts to award nearly $2 billion in frozen assets that Iran held in a New York bank to families and survivors of the 1983 Beirut bombings and other acts of terrorism the U.S. blamed on Iran.Bank Markazi, Iran's central bank, challenged the law all the way to the Supreme Court, claiming it violated the Constitution's separation of powers because Congress and the president were intruding on the judiciary's independence.In a 6-to-2 vote, the Supreme Court rejected the Iranian bank's argument, asserting that ""Congress acted comfortably within the political branches' authority over foreign sovereign immunity and foreign-state assets.""But Chief Justice John Roberts, who already seemed skeptical about the law's design during oral arguments, dissented forcefully, all but accusing the other two branches of preordaining the outcome of the case.""Congress has decided this case by enacting a bespoke statute tailored to this case that resolves the parties’ specific legal disputes to guarantee [the victims'] victory,"" Roberts wrote.At a briefing Thursday, State Department spokesman John Kirby disagreed with Iran's characterization of the ruling. The court's decision was ""not unexpected,"" he said, and was ""consistent"" with the Obama administration's support for the legislation in 2012.Asked about what the ruling might mean for the future of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, a State Department official told The Huffington Post in a statement that the decision bears ""no relation"" to the commitments the U.S. and Iran have made under the deal.""We have consistently supported compensation for the families in this case,"" the official said. ""We believe the court decision is consistent with U.S. international obligations. This case has been the subject of robust U.S. judicial proceedings, including by our highest court.""As fate would have it, Zarif met with Secretary of State John Kerry at the United Nations on Tuesday -- a day before the Supreme Court ruling -- precisely to discuss the banking obstacles the Islamic republic faces on the road to implementing the nuclear agreement.""We are both working at making sure … the Iran agreement is implemented exactly as it was meant to be and all the parties to that agreement get the benefit that they are supposed to get out of the agreement,"" Kerry said, according to The Wall Street Journal."
14,SPORTS,USWNT Lawyer Says U.S. Soccer Distorted Pay Numbers,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carli-lloyd-uswnt-equal-pay-jeffrey-kessler_us_57193b58e4b0d4d3f722c91f,"The federation is ""comparing soccer balls to beach balls"" in pushing back against the women's equal pay complaint, the lawyer said.",2016-04-22,Members of the U.S. Women's National Team are fighting the U.S. Soccer Federation for equal pay.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Three weeks after five members of the U.S. Women's National Team filed a complaint against the U.S. Soccer Federation alleging that the sport's American governing body had failed to pay them equally to their male counterparts, the federation offered its most detailed response yet when it released financial documents to multiple news outlets Thursday.Those documents, according to espnW and the New York Times, showed that the pay gap between the women and U.S. Men's National Team was much smaller than the five players had asserted in their complaint to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or EEOC: The gap was just 2.2 percent among top players, instead of the 25 percent the women players claimed.As espnW's Melissa Isaacson explains:While the women in the filing say they have earned nearly 25 percent less than their male counterparts this year, the figures supplied by the USSF show that for the 25 top-earning U.S. national team players over the past four years, 14 of whom are women, the average compensation is $695,269 for the women over that span, compared with $710,775 for the men, a difference of 2.2 percent.""Some of the financial information that's been provided has been either inaccurate or misleading,"" U.S. Soccer spokesman Neil Buethe told espnW. ""We wanted to share this information to help provide clarity.""But Jeffrey Kessler, the attorney for the five players who filed the claim, isn't buying U.S. Soccer's argument.""This is complete distortion. It's comparing soccer balls to beach balls,"" Kessler told The Huffington Post on Thursday. U.S. Soccer pays women who play for the national team $72,000 per year, plus a $1,350 bonus if they win a friendly match. USMNT players do not receive a base salary, but are paid through incentives for making rosters, playing in matches, and winning or drawing those matches. At minimum, the men receive $5,000 for each friendly match played, and they can earn more by winning or drawing.To get the full salary, women are required to play at least 20 matches during a single season. U.S. Soccer pointed out in its documents that individual men rarely play that many -- none did in 2015 -- and thus rarely earn the maximum in bonuses they are eligible for, which makes the salary figures between men and women closer to equal.But that's irrelevant, Kessler said, because if a men's national team player were called into the roster for 20 games in a single year, the minimum he would earn from the federation is $100,000, even if the USMNT lost all of those matches. A player on the women's team, meanwhile, would earn less than that -- $99,000 -- even if the USWNT won all 20 of its friendly matches in a given year.""The legal standard is equal pay for equal work. So you look at, what does a man and a woman make for just showing up for games?"" Kessler said. ""What does a man get for winning a game versus the women winning the game? There is no way under the math that there is equal pay for equal work. It's insulting.""Aside from that, U.S. Soccer's calculation of salaries includes the bonuses the women earned for playing in and winning victory tour matches that followed their win at the Women's World Cup. In other words, Kessler argued, the only reason the women's salaries were as close to equal as U.S. Soccer says they are is because the women were more successful and played more matches than the men's team. Without the incentives the women earned by winning matches, the gap would have been much larger, Kessler said.U.S. Soccer's calculations also include the cost of health and maternity benefits it provides women players but that men do not receive.""They added benefits, they added what women got for the victory tour,"" Kessler said. ""They loaded in everything they possibly could.""As the New York Times examined Thursday, there are other factors that complicate the equal pay dispute, including overall shares of revenues; the fact that the two teams collectively bargain separate agreements with U.S. Soccer; and that 2015 was a World Cup year for the women but not the men, which helped the women generate more revenue than the USMNT (though, as SBNation noted, U.S. Soccer made this argument on the revenue side while also relying on the women's 2015 salary numbers).But Kessler and members of the national team who brought the complaint remain confident in their claim despite U.S. Soccer's response.""This will not withstand more than five minutes of analysis from the EEOC,"" Kessler said."

She agrees with Donald Trump’s comments earlier this week opposing the law — comments that came under attack from Ted Cruz, who supports the law — and said it was “kind of bizarre” that we’re talking about bathrooms ""in presidential elections.”In an interview with me on SiriusXM Progress, Brewer said she hadn’t followed the news about the bill and Gov. Pat McCrory’s signing of it, but listened to Trump's statements opposing the bill. Brewer has endorsed Trump for the GOP nomination for the presidency.“I will tell you, we did have a bill in the legislature when I was governor regarding the use of bathrooms,” Brewer recalled, referring to a bill introduced in 2013 by GOP state representative John Kavanagh that similarly sought to regulate public rest room use by transgender people. “It never got to my desk. I didn’t hear a lot of debate about. But according to the Arizona legislature, they didn’t think it was worthy, whatever was in it, to send up to the governor’s office.”She then addressed a ""religious liberty"" bill she vetoed in 2014 that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT people, also similar to the North Carolina law, and which received enormous media attention at the time and condemnation from corporations including Marriott, Apple, American Airlines and the NFL.“Well, it was discrimination,” she said. “It was total discrimination, bill 1062. Once it got out of the legislature and came to my desk, the world exploded. Like I said in my veto message, it became more divisive than we could ever imagine if I’d signed it.”Regarding Trump’s comments on North Carolina and McCrory’s actions in signing the anti-LGBT bill into law, Brewer said: “It’s hard for me to sit on the outside, not knowing the details, and make a comment on it, but it would seem that what Donald said makes sense… What I heard him say was basically that it seems to be working fine the way it is right now. I don’t know if they’ve had extraordinary issues with bathrooms [in North Carolina]. To be honest, I find it kind of bizarre that we’re talking about bathrooms in presidential elections.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

On Monday, two Senate candidates will participate in a debate with questions submitted only by voters, not moderators. The so-called Open Debate in Orlando, Florida, between Reps. David Jolly (R-Fla.) and Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) will be the first of its kind. The format is the brainchild of the Open Debate Coalition, founded in 2008 by organizations across the political spectrum to advocate for presidential debates that better represent what people want to know.The coalition invited Grayson and Jolly to participate after the two candidates agreed to debate each other before their primaries for Florida's open Senate seat this summer. Jolly, Grayson and a slew of other candidates are vying to replace Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who gave up his seat for his unsuccessful run for president. The race is one of a handful that will determine which party wins control of the Senate in November. “At a time of so much dismay about our campaign finance and voting laws, bottom-up Open Debates are a bright spot for our democracy -- and we are proud to co-host Monday’s big Open Debate in Orlando,” said Adam Green and Stephanie Taylor, co-founders of the Progressive Change Institute. “This will empower regular people in an unprecedented way. We hope this historic event helps makes Open Debates the norm in the future, from state and local races to Congress and all the way up to president.""The Progressive Change Institute is co-sponsoring the debate with Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform. Moderators will include hosts from the online news show ""The Young Turks,"" which is popular among progressives, and from the online news site Independent Journal Review, which is popular with conservatives. The moderators will draw roughly eight to 10 questions from the top 30 questions submitted by voters in Florida. Floridians, along with people outside the state, can vote on the questions, influencing which are trending on the debate website, where the event will be live streamed. More than 225,000 votes had been cast as of Friday afternoon. The question leading in the voting was, “Would you vote in favor of a constitutional amendment to repeal Citizens United?” In second place was, “What will you do in your position to keep Social Security and Medicare strong?” Other top questions ask about breaking up big banks, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, voting and reproductive rights, climate change, the Supreme Court vacancy and prescription drug prices. “Bottom-up Open Debates unite people across the political spectrum because they are not about right versus left, but new versus old,” said Lilia Tamm, the Open Debate Coalition’s program director. “With modern technology, we can utilize the wisdom of the crowds at FloridaOpenDebate.com to bypass silly questions, gotcha questions, and questions about the news of the week -- and focus on issues voters care about most. We are thrilled to have members of Congress, moderators, and co-hosts from across the political spectrum for this historic Open Debate.”Mike McCurry, the co-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates, said his organization was keeping an eye on the Open Debate to better understand how the Internet can be used to get “real questions from real people.”“This is a real opportunity to shape the future of presidential debates, not only in the primaries, but the general election as well,” McCurry said. Grayson faces Rep. Patrick Murphy in the August Democratic primary for his party's nomination for the seat. Murphy declined to participate in the debate. On the Republican side, Jolly is hoping to stand out in a field that also includes Rep. Ron DeSantis, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, developer Carlos Beruff and businessman Todd Wilcox. Jolly's GOP rivals didn't qualify for the debate, which requires participants to have at least 15 percent support in polls."

Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/travis-moser-feinsteins-54-below_us_57058611e4b053766188ac38,Travis Moser brings the Rodgers and Hart songbook to the stage.,2016-04-22,"Rodgers and Hart were two ""of the first writers who wrote how people actually spoke,"" Moser said. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571947d51900002d0056be97.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Travis Moser used to envision New York as a wonderland of tuxedos, supper clubs and cocktails. As is the case for most transplants, however, he said the reality of day-to-day life in the city set in shortly after he relocated from Pennsylvania to Manhattan in 2006. Of course, none of that made Moser’s fantasy take on a bygone era less appealing. The singer hopes to transport audience members to a more glamorous New York when he takes the Feinstein’s/54 Below stage on May 4. (Check out a video of him performing ""This Can't Be Love/Thou Swell"" at top.) Moser said his show, “This Can’t Be Love: The Songs of Rodgers and Hart,” will offer a “glimpse into my idea of what New York was before I moved here.” As its title suggests, the show is dedicated to composers Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, who wrote more than 500 songs together from 1919 until 1943. He’ll be joined onstage by special guests Samantha Shafer, who appeared on Broadway in “Rocky"" and the 2009 Broadway revival of “West Side Story,” and Laura Fraenkel of The Jersey Follettes. The 31-year-old Moser is no stranger to the Rodgers and Hart repertoire. He said the first CD he ever owned was “Bobby Short Celebrates Rodgers and Hart,” and his passion for the songwriting duo’s work has never waned. In February, he released a live album which captured an earlier version of the show he’d performed at New York’s Metropolitan Room. That set featured classics like “My Funny Valentine,” “My Romance” and “Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered.”A portion of the May 4 show’s proceeds will be donated to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS (BC/EFA), a non-profit group dedicated to AIDS-related causes across the country, and is is Moser’s version of “the ultimate Rodgers and Hart playlist.” The revamped evening will feature some new orchestrations as well as mashups.“They’re two of the first writers who wrote how people actually spoke,” Moser told The Huffington Post. “I want to prove how modern they were as composers.”The composers, he said, couldn’t have been more different in their approach to their art, which, ironically, made for terrific music that resonates with him now as much as it did with his teen self.“Richard Rodgers was a very traditional, straightforward hard worker with a family, while Lorenz Hart was basically a raging alcoholic,” Moser said. He likened Hart to one of his personal heroes, Elaine Stritch, in that both artists gave audiences the impression that they “knew a little bit more about the world and its charms” in their work. “Hart knew the ups and downs of life in a time when people were a lot more optimistic,” he said. We're sure both Stritch and Hart would approve of an evening of classic songs and cocktails for a great cause. It doesn't get much more New York than that. Travis Moser performs ""This Can't Be Love: The Songs of Rodgers and Hart"" at New York's Feinstein's/54 Below on May 4. Head here for more details. "

While the vote is non-binding, the majority of the district's board of commissioners say they will adhere to the outcome of the vote, The Key West Citizen reports.The testing, which would be run by British biotech company Oxitec, would involve releasing about 3 million male mosquitos on a semi-isolated peninsula north of Key West over the course of 22 months.""I think a referendum is great, as long as it is done in an independent way,"" Derric Nimmo, Oxitec's product development manager on the project, told the Associated Press. ""An informed choice is what we want."" But not everyone in the Keys is excited about the prospect of their home being used as a testing ground for GMO mosquitos. The Citizen reported there were 60 anti-testing signs visible in Key Haven, the neighborhood of 444 homes where the testing would take place. The battle about GMO mosquito testing is an ongoing issue in Key West, where in 2012 the city commission passed a resolution to prevent GMO mosquitos being released within city limits (Key Haven is outside of the city-limit boundaries). In the four years since then, a Change.org petition against mosquito testing in the Keys has garnered more than 165,000 signatures, many of them from people who don't live in Key West but feel passionately about GMOs. “People just don’t want to be guinea pigs,” Mila De Mier, a former nurse and real estate agent who started the petition, told the Miami Herald in March.GMO mosquitos work like this: Scientists genetically alter male Aedes aegypti mosquitos to create ""self-limiting"" strains that only reproduce offspring that won't develop past the pupae stage. The female Aedes aegypti mosquito is the variety that bites and transmits diseases like Zika, dengue and chikungunya to humans, and by effectively ending reproduction in a community, carrier mosquitos will eventually die off.Oxitec has already conducted successful small-scale tests of GMO mosquitos in Panama, Brazil and the Cayman Islands, and the company says that there haven't been any adverse effects to humans or the environment. The FDA confirmed this conclusion with preliminary findings of its own in March, when the agency stated that GMO mosquitos pose no significant danger to the environment. ""Aedes is generally an invasive species, so removing an invasive species shouldn’t have any negative ecological implications in terms of the environment,"" Omar Akbari, an assistant professor at the University of California’s Center for Disease Vector Research who isn't affiliated with Oxitec, previously told HuffPost.Aedes aegypti mosquitos cover a wide territory range in the United Sates during the summer, and experts anticipate local Zika outbreaks in humid southeastern states like Florida in coming months. For now, GMO mosquitos are one of the best potential solutions to a fast-approaching problem."

Latinos are eager to take to the polls to vote against Donald Trump in 2016. And Trump supporters don't think Harriet Tubman should be on the the $20 bill. This is HuffPollster for Friday, April 22, 2016. GOP VOTERS NOW THINK OF TED CRUZ AS ESTABLISHMENT - HuffPollster: ""Here’s the latest proof of how strange this primary cycle has become: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who’s long tried to leverage his colleagues’ loathing into a version of outsider cred, is overwhelmingly viewed by his party as an establishment candidate. In a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, 62 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters say that Cruz is more of an establishment candidate, while just 29 percent describe him as an outsider. That’s a marked shift since December, when just 36 percent considered him part of the establishment….While that might help Cruz make his case on the floor of a contested convention, it’s unlikely to endear him to his party — 62 percent say they’d prefer a political outsider. In contrast, just 26 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say the same."" [HuffPost] LATINOS MOTIVATED BY TRUMP TO VOTE: Esther Yu-Hsi Lee: ""[T]here’s evidence that Latino voters may be 'enthusiastic' to hit the polls in November to defeat Trump’s anti-immigrant, anti-Latino agenda. A national poll released Thursday by [the pro-immigration reform] America’s Voice and Latino Decisions found that 79 percent of voters had a 'very unfavorable' opinion of Trump….In an open-ended question about why voters were enthusiastic to vote this year, the poll found that 41 percent wanted to fight 'against/stop Trump/fight back anti-immigrant/Latino.' Only three percent noted that they were enthusiastic because they were hoping to be 'against/stop Cruz…' As Trump continues to infuse more anti-immigrant and anti-Latino rhetoric into his speeches, it seems likely he’ll continue to bleed support from Latino voters."" [ThinkProgress]TRUMP SUPPORTERS DISAPPROVE OF HARRIET TUBMAN ON THE $20 BILL - Kayte Korwitts: ""Yesterday, historic news hit: a woman will finally appear on the face of American currency...Over half (56%) believe this is the right move….Presidential hopefuls have their own opinions on the matter as well. Donald Trump has expressed his disapproval. His supporters have Trump’s back here with 7 in 10 agreeing that this wasn’t a great idea. On the Democratic side, it’s nearly an even split with 81% of Clinton supporters and 85% of Sanders supporters agreeing to agree with one another….Perhaps surprisingly, slightly more credit users prefer Tubman on the bill than those who pay with cash (60% vs 54%)."" [SurveyMonkey]‘WALMART MOMS’ FOCUS GROUPS SHOW DISTRUST OF PRIMARY SYSTEM - Margaret Chadbourn: “Any attempt to deny Donald Trump the Republican Party’s nomination if he wins the most votes would be wrong and corrupt, a focus group of GOP voters in Pennsylvania said Wednesday night as the state’s primary approaches. Trump has complained about the primary system for weeks, calling it 'rigged,' a message that appears to resonate with these Keystone State voters….Two focus groups organized by the GOP polling firm Public Opinion Strategies and Purple Strategies were questioned Wednesday evening...One group was made up of Republican voters from the Pittsburgh area and the second was comprised of undecided voters from the Philadelphia suburbs….The pollsters who conducted the sessions said the participants were clearly concerned about the idea that a candidate who secures the most votes in the primary could lose the nomination after falling short of the number needed to win outright, which they said contributes to their cynical attitude about the 2016 campaign.” [ABC]AMERICANS WANT TO LEAD ON GLOBAL HEALTH BUT DON'T THINK MONEY IS THE SOLUTION - Liz Hamel, Ashley Kirzinger, and Mollyann Brodie ""The latest survey finds that a majority of the public wants the U.S. to take either the leading role or a major role in trying to solve international problems generally, as well as in improving health for people in developing countries specifically....Seven in ten Americans believe that the current level of U.S. spending on health in developing countries is too little or about right, yet the public is somewhat skeptical about the ability of more spending to lead to progress, with more than half saying that spending more money will not lead to meaningful progress. Another notable trend is the decreasing visibility of U.S. efforts to improve health in developing countries; just over a third of the public says they have heard 'a lot' or 'some' about these efforts in the past 12 months, a decrease of 21 percentage points since 2010.""

22,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Hardcore Fans Don't Want Him To Be More 'Presidential.' And Neither Does He.,Scott Conroy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-presidential-fans_us_571a5ed8e4b0d0042da912fa,The GOP front-runner was the same Trump he's always been at a Thursday rally in Pennsylvania.,2016-04-22,"A few of the people trying to get into the Trump rally this week in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571a6461160000e90031c7d3.jpeg?ops=crop_301_133_2949_2294%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"HARRISBURG, PA. -- By the time Donald Trump was scheduled to take the stage on Thursday night, the wait to get through the metal detectors and into the indoor arena was still several thousand people deep.But there was plenty to draw the eye’s attention among the people who were still stranded in the long line that snaked around the Pennsylvania Farm Show Expo Center & Expo Center, where an alpaca show was splitting the bill with the Republican frontrunner.The sartorial choices of Trump’s younger-leaning, mostly male fans who turned out for the event ranged from cutoff T-shirts and shorts to full suits and ties.There was also the broad-shouldered gentleman in a tank top who displayed his stars-and-bars-themed iron cross tattoo on his arm, as well as the unsubtle duo standing next to him, whose own outfits showed off the slogans, “Don’t Ever Think That The Reason I Am Peaceful Is Because I Forgot How To Be Violent"" and ""If You Don't Bleed Red, White & Blue, Take Your Bitch Ass Home.""Vendors, meanwhile, hawked T-shirts to men, women and pre-adolescent children alike that said, “Hillary Sucks But Not Like Monica.""There was something for everyone -- as long as you weren’t advocating for multiculturalism, inclusiveness and any of that other namby-pamby stuff.A small group of protesters just outside the arena chanting, “Black Lives Matter” was drowned out by the louder retorts that came from the pro-Trump faithful, which included one man who demanded to know why the agitators didn’t all just move to Syria, if they loved Muslims so much. For these efforts, he was rewarded with a boisterous round of cheers and high-fives from the people standing in line next to him. But it wasn’t just Trump’s fans who were intent on serving up a big bowl of abuse to anyone who disagreed with them.When a Trump-supporting woman stepped out of line for a brief moment to continue the verbal sparring she’d been conducting with a female protester, a young man from the anti-Trump forces presented himself inches from her face, and called her a “skank.” A couple of people “oohed” and then got back to the business of spewing their own animosities.""Did you see the black lady in Chicago?” a goateed man in a black T-shirt asked his companion, just before entering the arena. “Trump’s, like, ‘Get her out!’ So they picked her up and dragged her out kicking and screaming!""""Oh, man,” his buddy replied. “I hope something like that happens tonight.""For all of the talk about how a kinder, gentler Trump found his presidential footing in the New York primary by way a staff shakeup that “professionalized” his seat-of-the-pants campaign operation and public bearing, the vibe among the people who attended his latest rally was as volatile and abrasive as ever. And so was the candidate.Trump’s central Pennsylvania fans didn’t want to see a “more presidential” version of the man who’s broken all of the rules of political decorum and decency. And if Trump knows how to do anything, it’s giving his fans what they want. “Now my wife is constantly saying, ‘Darling, be more presidential,’” Trump said at the rally here, a few moments after the latest in a series of protesters was escorted off the premises by local police. “I just don’t know that I want to do it quite yet.”Trump’s wife isn’t the only one who’s been giving him that advice.At a closed-door briefing with RNC members in Florida on Thursday, the Associated Press reported, Trump’s new Senior Adviser Paul Manafort promised those who were present that his boss understands the need to tamp down the vitriol and had been merely “projecting an image” thus far that he would now adjust accordingly.“The part that he’s been playing is now evolving,” Manafort said, according to the AP. “The negatives will come down. The image is going to change.""But in spite of those assurances from his staff -- or perhaps because of them -- Trump went the extra mile at his rally to make clear to some of his most zealous supporters here in central Pennsylvania that he was still the same guy, thrilling his fans and exasperating his detractors in the same manner as always.Even before he took the stage, Trump made it clear that he wasn’t about to throw out his non-playbook by making an announcement to the fraction of people who'd showed up early enough to get into the building on time.""I'm supposed to wait a half hour because there are thousands of people outside, but I can't do that to you,” Trump said from behind the curtain, with a touch of “Wizard of Oz” mystique. “I’m going to come on right now!”Yes, the candidate was still the boss of his campaign.During his speech, Trump did allow a few moments to touch on some of the messages that his new overseers -- the so-called adults in the room -- want desperately for him to emphasize, decrying the loss of manufacturing jobs and promising to repeal Obamacare.But Trump spent far more time being, well, the guy we’ve seen since day one of his campaign. He belittled the protesters who interrupted him at regular intervals, boasted about his crowd sizes (“far bigger than Bernie’s, by the way”), and, of course, made particular pains to try to emasculate “Lyin’ Ted Cruz.""""This guy, I mean, he went to New York, and they threw him around like a rag doll,” Trump, who we’ve all been assured is set to tone it down a notch and move toward uniting the party, said of his top Republican opponent.Though he took particular delight in trashing Cruz, Trump appeared equally intent on sticking a thumb in the eye of anyone who had the gall to tell him -- the guy who defied all the pundits by getting this far -- that he was somehow doing it all wrong.""At some point, I’m going to be so presidential that you people will be so bored, and I’ll come back as a presidential person, and instead of 10,000 people, I’ll have about 150 people,” Trump said, his voice oozing with the sarcasm of someone who thought that would be a terrible idea. “And they’ll say, ‘Boy. He really looks presidential.’”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

""I'm not transphobic. I'm not homophobic.""Schilling added he has never treated a person differently based on their sexual preference, religion or race.""I don’t care. I’ve never cared,"" Schilling said. ""As long as you’re not sleeping with my wife, I don’t care who you sleep with.""The interview with ""Breitbart News Daily"" host Stephen K. Bannon came just two days after Schilling was fired by ESPN over a post on social media in which he mocked the transgender community in the wake of an anti-LGBT law that requires to use whichever restroom matches the gender on their birth certificate. The network called his conduct ""unacceptable.""In addition to his views about the LGBT community, Schilling opened up about his recent firing, religion, the ""nosedive"" the United States is in as a result of the Obama Administration, and the hypocrisy of people like rock star Bruce Springsteen.Schilling said that his 16-year-old son is a founding member of the LGBT club at his high school. If his son came home and said he wanted to be a woman, Schilling said, ""I would be disappointed, because as a man and a father I want my son to experience fatherhood and being a father and being a grandfather and yada yada. But I wouldn’t care. I wouldn’t care. I would not feel any differently about him. I would not love him any less. I would actually be proud of the fact that he’s trying to be true to himself. Even if I don’t agree with whatever it is that’s happening, I’m good with that.""On the subject of Schilling's recent firing, ""Breitbart News Daily"" co-host Alex Marlow said its no secret ESPN has a ""left-wing tilt,"" and that his theory is the journalists at ESPN ""go to the same journalism schools ... as the ones in the mainstream media we all complain about and pretty much acknowledge are openly left-wing.""Schilling, a conservative, said he loves, and will always love, talking about pitching. ""But at a company where the rules are different based completely and solely on your perspective and your beliefs, it didn’t work. They didn’t like that.""In addition to his view that the United States is on a downhill slope, one that's ""gone from a gradual descent to a nosedive"" under President Barack Obama, Schilling said hypocrisy among Americans has never been as rampant as it is today. ""And that makes me mad, in a way,"" Schilling said. ""Bruce Springsteen, this guy is a hero for some reason, right? I mean, he cancelled the concert in North Carolina over this bill. Is he going to cancel all of his concerts forever in Italy where same-sex marriage is against the law? Or in the Middle East where they behead and execute people that aren’t heterosexual ... Or is this just a stance of convenience? -- where, 'Yeah, I can skip North Carolina and people love me for doing it.'”Bruce Springsteen is among a number of performers to cancel North Carolina shows in protest of the state's anti-LGBT law, which prevents local municipalities from passing protections against LGBT discrimination and requires transgender people to use public restrooms that correspond to the gender they were assigned at birth. The post that got Schilling fired from ESPN was apparently in response to the controversial North Carolina law. In it, Schilling commented: “A man is a man no matter what they call themselves. I don’t care what they are, who they sleep with, men’s room was designed for the penis, women’s not so much. Now you need laws telling us differently? Pathetic.”Asked Friday by ""Breitbart News Daily"" if he is, as the media has portrayed him, a hater, Schilling said, ""There's very little of anything in the world that I hate. Hate takes effort.
