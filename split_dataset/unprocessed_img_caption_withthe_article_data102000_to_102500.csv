0,POLITICS,Congress Secretly Voted Themselves a Cromnibus Luxury Car Perk,"Erik Ose, ContributorActivist and political blogger at LatestOutrage.org",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/after-congress-secretly-v_b_6330644.html,"It's good for the rich, the powerful, and D.C.'s luxury car rental companies. But the Cromnibus is bad for America, and President Obama needs to step up with his veto pen and do the right thing.",2014-12-17,2014-12-16-OurMessageToPresidentObamafinalgraphic2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-16-OurMessageToPresidentObamafinalgraphic2-thumb.jpg,"Over the weekend, the Cromnibus budget deal passed the Senate by a 56-40 margin after narrow approval by the House. The outcome is a win for big corporations and wealthy campaign donors, and a huge letdown for 99 percent of Americans, who once again have been shafted by back room negotiations and legislation written to favor the rich and powerful.There's a lot to make ordinary citizens sick about the Cromnibus. Republicans used the legislation as an end-of-year Trojan Horse to pass numerous stealth provisions that benefit the few at the expense of the many. Two of the worst are rolling back Dodd-Frank financial regulations so banks can once again gamble with money insured by taxpayers, which re-opens the door to more bank bailouts; and further gutting campaign finance reform by letting rich donors give up to $1.5 million a year to political parties, ten times the current limit.But the one Cromnibus secret that wasn't reported anywhere in the media until after the bill cleared both the House and Senate was that the budget deal grants members of Congress a lucrative new perk: the ability for each member to spend $1000 of our tax dollars per month on a luxury car allowance.Democratic Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado was the first to alert the public to this impending perk, when he posted about it on Facebook last Wednesday, the day after House Republican leaders filed the legislation. The relevant language was hidden on page 982 of the 1,603-page bill:""None of the funds made available in this Act may be used by the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives to make any payments from any Members' Representational Allowance for the leasing of a vehicle, excluding mobile district offices, in an aggregate amount that exceeds $1,000 for the vehicle in any month."" At a time when U.S. families are finally getting their feet under them again after our economy's long climb back from the Great Recession, the audacity of Congress to vote itself a luxury perk like this is breathtaking. It passed only because it was buried in an enormous spending bill, with no public discussion or media coverage.President Obama has said he will sign the Cromnibus, but he deserves to hear the American people's opinions about it. Act right now to tell President Obama to veto this deal, and send it back to Congress for an honest debate over its Congressional luxury car cash and many other unacceptable provisions. You can call the White House at 202-456-1111, or send him a quick e-mail using this tool powered by Represent.Us: The silver lining in this battle was that it showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is willing to take on Wall Street and the super wealthy when it comes to fighting for the rest of us. The Cromnibus fight boosted her national profile overnight, and cemented her status as the Democrat who could most likely wrest the Democratic nomination from Hillary Clinton in 2016.Where was Hillary when the Cromnibus reared its head? As Politico made clear, ""Clinton has not commented on the $1.1 trillion spending bill, which Warren claims will undo (financial) reforms made under the Dodd-Frank law."" Other Cromnibus provisions that advance the GOP's agenda include allowing corporations to cut up to ten million workers' pensions; slashing $300 million from housing assistance to the homeless; reducing the EPA's budget by $60 million, which will lead to massive cutbacks and layoffs; and cutting $300 million from grants to low-income students.It's good for the rich, the powerful, and Washington, D.C.'s luxury car rental companies. But the Cromnibus is bad for America, and President Obama needs to step up with his veto pen and do the right thing.Erik Ose is a veteran of Democratic campaigns in North Carolina and blogs at The Latest Outrage."

(AP Photo/Michael Sohn)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14271240000360076f174.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BERLIN -- Sustainable thinking and action continues to gain increased importance in business and technology. Above all, it has become a political guiding principle. As such, it merits examination.The three pillars of sustainability -- the economic, the environmental and the social pillar -- are equal in importance. In terms of practical policies, sustainable conduct means preserving our world in such a way that it will still be a decent place to live in tomorrow. Conservation of vital resources and creation of opportunities for future generations are major considerations in any policy decision. Sustainability is, ultimately, one of the fundamental principles underlying Christian conservative thought and action. A rather broader but no less feasible step is the application by analogy of sustainability principles to foreign and security policy. I say ""by analogy"" because there are comparable interests at play and also because there are not yet any separate arrangements for sustainability in the field of foreign and security policy. What does sustainability in foreign policy mean in practical policy terms?First of all, measures of technological support in other countries, relating, for example, to the use of energy from renewable sources or to more efficient processes, may be regarded as foreign policy focused on environmental sustainability. Foreign policy focused on the economic and social pillars of sustainability, however, is far more significant because of its greater impact. Helping to alleviate the distress of people suffering the effects of crises and conflicts in various countries of the world, standing up for the rule of law, engaging in the economic reconstruction of countries in disarray and seeking compromise between conflicting parties by political means can clearly be regarded as sustainable action in the realm of foreign and security policy.In terms of practical policies, sustainable conduct means preserving our world in such a way that it will still be a decent place to live in tomorrow. This can be explained by citing some topical examples which, despite their diversity, are all illustrations of sustainable action:In Syria and Iraq we are experiencing the return of barbarism -- a great danger not only for the surrounding states but also for the global community. The jihadists who call themselves Islamic State pose a threat to everything that characterizes our way of life -- personal freedom and well-being, equality between men and women, the rule of law, freedom of religion and much more. This is why Germany must recalibrate the instruments of its foreign policy in order to curb the Islamic State as quickly and resolutely as possible together with our NATO allies and partners. From the perspective of sustainability, of course, wars and combat operations can only ever be the last resort, because they exact the heaviest economic, environmental and social toll. But military action, as a last resort, may be required in order to ensure permanent peace in the region and thus the subsequent generation. Military and economic empowerment of the Kurds to enable them to fight for a more self-determined and freer life is consistent with the basic principles underlying the economic and social pillars of sustainability. Current relations with Russia may be cited as another example of a sustainable German foreign policy looking at the conflict with Ukraine. Acting sustainably and responsibly means resolving the conflict peacefully by political means rather than resorting to military force. This is the only way to ensure optimum protection of economic, environmental and social interests. In this case, by contrast with the ISIS issue, it can be shaped through direct talks, which is the only way to proceed. There is no alternative to cooperation. Intensified economic cooperation can play a key role in this respect. Germany and Russia complement each other quite ideally. Each country has what the other needs. Germany has one of the world's most advanced manufacturing sectors, producing a wide range of machinery, plants and goods. And Russia has vast deposits of the natural and mineral resources on which German industry is crucially dependent.Even without prescribed indicators and management rules for foreign and security policy, the principle of sustainability is deeply etched into the minds and hearts of German politicians. Germany's scope for exerting influence in other countries by political and economic means and brokering political compromises in negotiations between conflicting parties with a view to obtain improvements in people's lives and in economic and environmental conditions outside as well as inside Germany -- that is what is meant by sustainable foreign and security policy."

""Today we face the extremely crucial task of implementing the peace plan.""Rebels disagreed with Poroshenko's assessment, accusing Kiev of further artillery bursts overnight. But his comments sounded an upbeat note ahead of a two-day visit to Kiev by the new European Union foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini.That optimism was later tempered by the report of a soldier killed on Tuesday near the contested Donetsk airport, the first Ukrainian loss in six days. But the Kiev military highlighted a decline in the intensity of attacks - to an average of 8-10 incidents of shelling per day from a previous 70-80.Last week, prospects for a fresh round of peace talks between a ""contact group"" comprising Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) watchdog were dashed by renewed clashes in the east.On Monday, senior Ukrainian presidential official Valeriy Chaliy said the contact group should meet ""as soon as possible,"" but no date had been agreed.Russia denies Ukrainian accusations of intervening militarily on the side of the eastern rebels. It has also called for a new round of peace talks on the conflict and on Monday urged Kiev to allow more autonomy to Russian-speaking eastern areas of Ukraine.Contradicting Poroshenko's reports of a fully-observed truce overnight, the separatist self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) accused government troops of carrying out artillery strikes on rebel positions.

Below are the notes I took regarding the general plot of the show.ACT I The story begins, as many deviances do, in the living room of a huge Russian house. You can tell the house is huge, because the living room is so big you could have a whole ballet troupe in there and still have room for a tree and some tables. The adults are drinking and the children are playing, but they are also all dancing. They do this for a while. A girl dances more than the other girls. She is the main girl. I think her name is Clara, which isn't very Russian. There is a short, asshole, kid hounding her. He is her brother. His name is Fritz, which is also not very Russian. A total freak show arrives, and he is dressed like an 1700's Burning Man person. He brings in a giant clock as a Christmas gift. Everyone is pumped and still dancing. The clock does some weird shit. People dressed as clowns and toy soldiers are dancing and it is very confusing, but some are better dancers than others. There is definitely a hierarchy of dance here and the kids are at the bottom. Their dancing pretty much sucks and is basically just skipping to music. Everyone loves this though, and the weird dude is getting pervy with Clara giving her special attention. No one is alarmed. The Burner gives Clara a ""Nutcracker"" doll. Fritz promptly breaks it. Burning Man guy does a half-assed job of fixing the doll, and the parents catch on that he's getting too friendly with the kids. Everyone gets shooed out, and Clara is put to bed. THE WEIRDO IS IN HER ROOM. He sprinkles something on her (Hallucinogenic?). The house is infested with rats. The smaller rats are not great dancers. The toy soldiers aren't having any of this shit. They organize under the large gestures and prancing of the nutcracker. Shit goes down (in dance). Many rats and toy soldiers die. A giant multi-headed rat appears. He's wearing a crown and is obviously the level boss. He is wielding an exotic and curved looking scimitar as opposed to the Nutcracker's european-style saber in case you were wondering who the bad guy is.The Nutcracker kills the mutant rat in a classic, Russian ""Whoa! That was a little severe"" kind of way. Clara is mad crushing. He's not even a toy anymore. He's now a dude in tights. They dance. The set totally changes. It snows on stage, which is pretty cool. The good dancers come out. They do the total ballet thing. ACT IIClara and The Nutcracker sit down. That's it for them. Now they're just watching a show like the rest of us. There is a series of ethnic dances of increasing cultural insensitivity, they are:Spanish: A lot of stuff happening. Four people prancing. Arabian: Oof. No Burkas here. A lot of skin. Dude and girl. Very sexy.  Chinese(?): Oh Christ. No way. This is so offensive. Why doesn't someone say something? Russian: Classic Russian dudes. Very gay. A lot of leather slapping.  Good Dancers: These people are obviously very good because they got a lot of applause at various intervals.Everyone recaps what we just saw (in Dance). Clara leaves. She's in bed again. She wakes up! It was all a dream! Or was it?The End."

7,TRAVEL,Safari Experiences Around the World,"Elizabeth Gordon, ContributorFounder, Extraordinary Journeys",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/safari-experiences-around_b_6328866.html,These amazing destinations get me excited about all the possibilities and all the experiences that can be found around the world for a safari-lover like me.,2014-12-16,2014-12-15-TentedsuiteverandaatBeyondBanjaarTolaTentedCampKanhaNPIndia.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-15-TentedsuiteverandaatBeyondBanjaarTolaTentedCampKanhaNPIndia-thumb.jpg,"I think we are all clear by now that I am a serious Africa-phile. That said, I do sometimes get the itch to travel somewhere other than Africa. But, wherever I travel, I still look for that ""safari"" type of experience. For me that means small properties in amazing and remote natural settings, exclusivity, personal service, talented guides, fun, good food and wine, and responsibility to the local community.Once you start looking you really can find these experiences all over the world! Here are just a few places and properties I have found that I think any safari-lover would really enjoy:India Do you love game-viewing and have already checked Africa's Big Five off your list? Well then go find them in India! India has a wealth of stunning national parks and is home to Asiatic lions, rhinos and elephants as well as leopards, hyenas and buffalo. Of course what sets India apart are the tigers. Although sightings of tigers are not as guaranteed as lions are in Africa, there are some fabulous properties where that offer a true safari experience -- and you most likely will get some great tiger sightings as well as a new animals and birds to add to your list! Tiger in Pench Tiger Reserve, Jamtara Wilderness CampJamtara Wilderness Camp is a great example of a property that captures that safari-feel in India. Staying at Jamtara one can almost forget that this is not Africa. This intimate camp, is in a large private area bordering the National Park so you have nature all to yourself. Camp guides are knowledgeable and fun and the whole scene is reminiscent of all the fun of Africa. The nearby farming village is picturesque and very welcoming. Read more about my mother Marcia's time at Jamtara in Pench, and in Kerala here. Star bed sleep-out at Jamtara Wilderness CampI would recommend combining Jamtara in Pench with Kanha National Park to increase your chances of seeing a tiger. In Kanha you can stay at AndBeyond's Banjaar Tola Tented Camp. AndBeyond owns several gorgeous properties in East and Southern Africa (including Phinda Reserve in South Africa and Ngorongoro Crater Lodge in Tanzania) and in India they keep classic safari style and the high level of service they are known for. AndBeyond Banjaar Tola Tented Camp, Kanha National ParkThe Atacama Desert, ChileIf you like the desert (think Namibia) then you will love the Atacama Desert in Chile, the driest desert in the world. In 3-5 nights in this martian landscape you can go on desert treks, sand board, horseback and bike ride, visit hidden lagoons and hot springs, and explore local villages. As in Namibia, there are no lights on the ground so taking in the incredible night sky with a local astronomer is sure to be a highlight (find all the reasons you should visit Namibia here).  Awasi AtacamaAtacama is a year-round destination but I recommend going between April and September. October through March is busier because this is the season to visit Patagonia and many people add on a visit to Atacama. There are several great properties in Atacama including Tierra Atacama and Explora Atacama but my favorite is Awasi Atacama because it is the smallest property in the area and offers all of its activities on a private basis, so you will have a vehicle and a local guide all to yourself. Awasi Atacama Awasi AtacamaIf you want to add to your Chile safari experience the fertile wine regions of the Colchagua Valley are an easy parallel to the Cape Winelands and the magnificent Torres Del Paine in Chilean Patagonia offers all the hiking and horseback riding an active traveler could ask for, Mt. Kenya or Namibia's Tok Tokkie Trail meets Zambian walking safari. Horse-backing Riding in Torres Del Paine, Chilean Patagonia with Tierra PatagoniaThe Galapagos, EcuadorVisiting the Galapagos and seeing the unique species that call the islands home is definitely on my bucket list, but I'm not crazy about being locked on a cruise ship with people I don't know. Luckily I have found the perfect alternative: Galapagos Safari Camp, a gorgeous tented camp perched on a hill on Santa Cruz Island overlooking the sea and a several of the most famous islands. This camp is a real treasure, offering incredible access to all the diving, sea lions, tortoises and blue-footed boobies you can handle AND an intimate tented camp safari experience. You can take day trips to nearby islands or if you want to go further afield, you can easily combine a 3 or 4 night cruise with 2-3 nights at Galapagos Safari Camp.  Tent at Galapagos Safari Camp Blue Footed Boobies, Galapagos Safari CampI also recommend staying at the stunning Hacienda Zuleta before you fly out of Quito. The Ecuadorian highlands are very beautiful and what better way to experience the area than on a working hacienda owned and managed by a prestigious Ecuadorian family. Hacienda Zuleta's decades of history and welcoming atmosphere will give you a real taste of Ecuador. Hacienda ZuletaThe HimalayasFor me the safari experience is as much about authentic cultural interactions and getting out into local communities as it is about game-viewing. Tiger Mountain Lodge in Pokhara, Nepal checks all of those boxes for me. It is an intimate, understated, socially responsible lodge in a perfect location, surrounded by views of Everest's Fishtail Peak and the Annapurna Range. The lodge and its amazing local guides offer treks through this gorgeous mountain setting. Tiger Mountain has all the attributes of a great safari camp: fresh local food, lantern lit pathways, coffee and tea service in the morning to watch the sunrise from your deck and attentive staff who come from the community and have a genuine authenticity and joy in sharing their love of their little corner of the world. Read about a recent trip to Tiger Mountain Lodge here. Shakti Himalaya offers several similar experiences in India.These amazing destinations get me excited about all the possibilities and all the experiences that can be found around the world for a safari-lover like me.But don't get me wrong, I love Africa! I am writing this from a hotel in Harare before heading out to explore Zimbabwe's Eastern Highlands by road and I couldn't be happier, more about that in the New Year!"
