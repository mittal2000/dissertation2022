To learn more about the field, and about Arnold herself, HuffPost Science posed a series of questions to her via email. Here, lightly edited, are her answers:Did you always want to be a scientist?I did not choose to become a researcher until I was almost 30. I tried other careers, but science spoke to me more and more, especially after I started studying the biological world and all the amazing molecular machines made by nature.As a little girl, I thought I might be a heart surgeon, CEO of a multinational company or even a diplomat some day (until I figured out I had no diplomatic skills). When I went to college, I never really thought about being a scientist or an engineer, but of course that was always on the list of possibilities.I had tried lots of odd jobs — from taxi driver to waitress to assembling electronic devices — and later a few science and technology jobs in nuclear power and solar energy. But I loved languages, I enjoyed economics, I spent every break traveling and seeing different cultures. I loved learning and did not think too much about the future until one day it happened!Why do women continue to be underrepresented in engineering and other STEM fields?Because talented women choose to do other things. But if they knew how important technology is for supporting our well-being and that of the planet, and how fun it can be, more would choose STEM fields.What barriers keep women from choosing STEM careers?I believe that some women still face external barriers, but other barriers are more self-imposed: lack of confidence or desire to compete and a misunderstanding of what science and technology can contribute to society.Science is not for everyone; it takes a lot of time and devotion to become really good, and the same is true for engineering. You have to love it. What I see is that the most talented women have many opportunities. Whether they choose to pursue science or engineering depends on how they feel about their whole life experience, perhaps more so than men. Opportunities today are excellent, but there are challenges to having a family and competing at the highest levels that women often feel more acutely.What can be done to eliminate these barriers?At the very least, girls should not be discouraged from using their natural talents in mathematics and science. Even better, they should be encouraged and praised.What's a typical workday like for you?Rich, never boring, something new and interesting every day. Full of brilliant young people who want to change the world.So now about your research -- what is directed evolution?It's a technology that allows us to reliably create improved proteins for a wide range of applications. Just as farmers and breeders have used artificial selection processes over thousands of years to create higher-yielding crops or pets that please us, we can direct the evolution of proteins to perform better in applications, from laundry detergents to green chemistry.Modern methods of DNA manipulation allow us to make iterations of mutations and artificial selection on a gene rather than in an organism, and to shorten the generation time to a few days. That way we can accumulate beneficial mutations in the gene that encodes the protein, making it better and better until it meets our needs.What makes proteins so important?Proteins are the workhorses of life, responsible for nearly all the interesting things we and other organisms can do. Just one (very important) class of proteins, the enzymes are responsible for turning food (for example, for some microbes this means sunlight, carbon dioxide, sugar, etc.) into all the materials and energy needed to support life and reproduce life. That’s pretty amazing chemistry, and we should learn how to harness that for our own purposes.We have already been using microbes and the enzymes in them to improve our lives for thousands of years, from making bread, beer, wine, cheese -- to, more recently, having laundry detergents that take stains off of clothes in cold water (thus saving significant energy), making fuels and chemicals from renewable resources or making drugs to treat diabetes.How does directed evolution differ from evolution as we commonly think of it?It differs from natural evolution in that it is directed by the researcher. Mutations are directed (by me) to a specific gene, and since the researcher has a goal in mind, it is also directed in that sense. How is directed evolution being used commercially?Directed evolution has had big impact in the fields of drug synthesis. Many popular drugs, including the cholesterol-lowering drugs simvastatin and atorvastatin, have been developed with the help of directed evolution. The same is true for making consumer products (key ingredients for creams, laundry detergents, animal and human nutrition products and many more) and for making non-ethanol fuels like isobutanol from renewable plant resources.What are the biggest advances that have come from the commercial application of directed evolution?My former student and one of the first people to use directed evolution, Dr. Jeffrey Moore, and his collaborators figured out how to manufacture the diabetes drug Januvia using an evolved enzyme. Their process replaces chemical methods that were far from optimal, lowering the cost of the drug and especially the waste products. Their process won many awards, including the President's Green Chemistry Challenge.Many companies now incorporate enzyme catalysts into their processes. More will do so as we move to greater sustainability in manufacturing.A number of companies that make fuels and chemicals from renewable resources have used DE to optimize enzymes. Enzymes optimized by directed evolution are being used to make nutritional products for humans and animals, fuel from biomass and to test new drugs for toxicity. They are being used directly to treat human disease.Engineered enzymes are used in everything from DNA sequencing to glucose sensors for diabetes, laundry detergents and food processing.What do you foresee for directed evolution in the future?The wonderful thing about directed evolution is that it is both simple and general. Because the technology is accessible, it can be implemented in any laboratory. It opened up a new way for people to look at the inventions of the biological world and fit them into their own creations.So many clever people all over the world have taken this technology and done all manner of brilliant things with it, things I would never have thought of. This will continue in the future. What are you going to do with all that prize money?I will use some of it to invest in work done at Provivi, a startup I cofounded with two of my former students, Peter Meinhold and Pedro Coelho. Provivi is developing the non-toxic alternatives to pesticides, which I think is such an important goal.Why so important?Pesticides get into our food, streams and rivers and cause all manner of harm. Imagine spraying a little bit of ""perfume"" in a field to confuse the insect pests so that they can't mate. If they can't mate they are not going to damage your crops. Wouldn't it be wonderful to do that instead of dumping highly toxic pesticides? Our hope is to make these complicated insect perfumes quite cheaply using enzymes.Is there a particular scientific question you're trying to answer?I am very interested in the evolution of novelty — how do new functions appear in the biological world. I am tackling this question by evolving enzyme catalysts that catalyze chemical reactions not known in the biological world."

2,SCIENCE,Science And Technology Combine In Search For Underwater Resting Place Of WWII MIAs,Lee Speigel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/project-recover-mia-wwii-plane_us_5748a738e4b055bb117231b1,"""Families of MIAs never quit -- they never stop missing the person who's been taken out of their lives,"" says BentProp Project founder Patrick Scannon.",2016-05-31,Scattered debris from a U.S. Navy WWII TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bomber has been lying on the floor of the Pacific Ocean since 1944.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574cea3d1200002e00894d55.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The remains of American airmen missing in action since 1944, along with wreckage from their plane, have been located on the ocean floor off the Pacific island republic of Palau.Members of Project RECOVER, a collaborative effort to seek out the final resting places of World War II armed forces personnel, discovered the U.S. Navy TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bomber in March. However, it took a couple of months to secure the location and collect DNA samples, so they felt it was appropriate to announce the new WWII crash site as Memorial Day weekend approached.""It was a way of saying that we do care, that Memorial Day is an important day. The two just happened to come together and it seemed to make sense to us,"" said Patrick Scannon, founder of the BentProp Project, one of the entities that make up Project RECOVER.Established in 2012, Project RECOVER was co-founded by the BentProp Project, Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, and the University of Delaware's College of Earth, Ocean and Environment. Their efforts combine science, technology and archival research to find the remains of MIAs lost among Palau's underwater coral reefs and mangrove forests.Here is newly-released Project RECOVER video showing the Avenger's final resting place on the ocean floor, 80 feet below the surface of the water.Pictured below is a typical three-person crew TBM-1C Avenger aircraft that saw combat during WWII.Project RECOVER aims to locate as many MIAs as possible so that the U.S. government may bring them home for a proper burial.""This recovery is another step closer towards Project RECOVER's goal of finding the final underwater resting places of all Americans missing in action since World War II,"" stated Dan Friedkin, who is chairman of the Air Force Heritage Flight Foundation and provides financial backing for Project RECOVER. ""Every family member impacted by the loss of a service member deserves this type of closure.""The primary search region for missing-in-action American aircraft and their crews centers around Palau, located in the Pacific Ocean east of the Philippines and north of New Guinea. Scripps Institution of Oceanography estimates that there are several dozen U.S. aircraft and the remains of some 80 American MIAs in the area.The BentProp Project has focused on this endeavor for 20 years, conducting historical and archival research to support yearly month-long searches.""We've always limited ourselves to one area -- the republic of Palau, but that's only because there's a lot of missing aircraft there,"" physician and BentProp founder Scannon told The Huffington Post. ""When we were thinking of a name, the first thing that came to my mind was that I always see bent propellers at these crash sites. We decided that it captured the tragedy and it just stuck.""The people involved with the BentProp Project have individual backgrounds and skills in areas crossing over aviation, archaeology, history, navigation, photography and anthropology -- all necessary ingredients to look for and find these crash sites.Partnering with UCSD and the University of Delaware in 2012 has made even more discoveries possible.""Since we started jointly working together, we found a total of six aircraft underwater ... and we have up to 10 MIA associated with the crashes,"" Scripps oceanographer Eric Terrill told HuffPost. ""Five of those are U.S. aircraft, one was a Japanese airplane, and several of those aircraft have MIAs associated with them."" ""Many times, targets are very apparent in the sonar imagery, and others take a while to analyze the data to find the manmade objects,"" Terrill said. ""Sonar doesn't give us a clear-cut picture, especially a lot of these wrecks that don't necessarily look like an airplane once they've broken up, as the wings get torn off and the engines get pulled off.""Yet even after 70 years, Terrill says, seawater helps preserve the remains of those lost in action. ""Between DNA techniques, dental records and dog tags, there's a number of different forensic tools that the U.S. government has at their fingertips ... to do the identification process,"" he explained.Pending final DNA identification of the missing Avenger crew members, the families will be notified.""One only has to be with a family, once the remains are returned, to understand how important this is,"" Scannon said. ""My initial thought was, 'would the families even care?' But once I started meeting them, I realized very quickly that families of MIAs never quit -- they never stop missing the person who's been taken out of their lives. Even more surprising is that second and third generation family members often have stronger feelings because they never met the person.""Scannon described what it's like when he's underwater and discovers a crash site for the first time.""It is an arresting moment...almost like a knee jerk. I pull up and look at it and realize that we haven't found just a historically interesting site, but we've found the temporary tomb of Americans who've been missing in action for a long, long time. It is a privilege to be there and a privilege to finally study and know what happened so that the families can understand the fate of their loved ones.""Certainly, it's a national responsibility to find and recover remains from our past wars,"" added Terrill. ""It's a great teaching moment to remind the American public about a lot of the sacrifices family members have made. For me, personally, it's been very humbling to take some of my trade craft from ocean science and ocean technology and apply it to this type of problem."""
3,POLITICS,DOJ Pushes Back On Judge's Order Seeking Ethics Sanctions For Administration Lawyers,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doj-immigration-sanctions_us_574da830e4b03ede44155c24,"The government also staunchly opposes turning over the ""sensitive"" personal information of undocumented immigrants.",2016-05-31,"While the Supreme Court weighs the fate of President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration, a smaller battle over ethics is playing out in a Texas courtroom.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574db0981600002a00f94dba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Department of Justice on Tuesday contested a federal judge's order that imposes ethics sanctions and other wide-reaching remedies against the federal government in the ongoing challenge to President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration.The case, which the U.S. Supreme Court will decide between now and the end of June, has remained active in the Texas courtroom of U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen, who earlier this month determined that department lawyers were not truthful and had acted in bad faith while the dispute was still in its early stages.Specifically, Hanen determined that DOJ lawyers were not forthcoming about the fact that the administration had granted relief to thousands of undocumented immigrants under the challenged programs while the lawsuit was still pending. Hanen called this conduct ""unseemly"" and ""unprofessional.""But the government on Tuesday ""emphatically but respectfully"" disagreed with that assessment, and asked Hanen to put on hold his ruling -- which, among other sanctions, orders U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to take steps to ensure her department's ethics are in order -- while DOJ seeks to appeal to a higher court.""The sanctions ordered by the Court far exceed the bounds of appropriate remedies for what this Court concluded were intentional misrepresentations, a conclusion that was reached without proper procedural protections and that lacks sufficient evidentiary support,"" DOJ said in its request to Hanen.Lawyers for the department argued that if Hanen did not stay his order, the government ""will suffer irreparable injury... resulting from impaired enforcement of immigration law."" They added that compliance with the ethics education requirement could cost up to $8 million in direct expenses and lost manpower.Hanen's order, which could affect up to 3,000 DOJ lawyers, ""intrudes on core Executive functions and imposes heavy administrative burdens and costs on both DOJ and [the Department of Homeland Security] that cannot be recouped,"" the administration said.More critically, DOJ challenged the part of Hanen's ruling that instructs the department to turn over the identifying information of thousands of immigrants who received deferred action from deportation under the announced initiatives. Immigration advocacy groups roundly denounced Hanen for going that route.DOJ said that complying with this directive would be ""extraordinarily burdensome"" and ""could undermine public trust in DHS’s commitment to protecting the confidential information contained in immigration files.""This portion of Hanen's order ""risks injury to tens of thousands of third parties who were brought to this country as children, and who are not parties to this litigation, in circumstances where the States have not identified harm that would justify such an intrusion,"" DOJ argued.Patrick Rodenbush, a Justice Department spokesman, said in a statement that the government intends to seek review of the order in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.In a separate declaration filed with Tuesday's motion, Leon Rodriguez, the director for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, warned the court that disclosing this information would intimidate the kind of people who apply to his agency for various kinds of relief.""I believe the production of such information would have a chilling effect on the willingness of individuals to seek a wide range of immigration benefits from USCIS,"" he said.UPDATE: 6:30 p.m. -- On Tuesday afternoon, Hanen agreed to hold a hearing regarding DOJ's request on June 7. Stay tuned.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story described the events therein as having taken place on Monday, May 30. In fact, they happened on Tuesday, May 31. "

6,MEDIA,Donald Trump Wants Journalists Thanking Him Instead of Asking Tough Questions,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-media-veterans_us_574dce9be4b02912b240e806,Here's what a Trump White House press conference could look like.,2016-05-31,"Donald Trump calls journalists ""dishonest"" for asking him questions about donations to veterans.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574dcf8b1600002a00f94e0d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Donald Trump repeatedly attacked the “dishonest” press on Tuesday for pressing him to explain where the nearly $6 million he claimed he’d raised for veterans had gone.The business mogul’s open hostility toward reporters was on full display throughout the press conference at Trump Tower ― a contentious performance he suggested would continue if he is elected president. Stories asking where the money went were “probably libelous,” he said, a troubling accusation given his open musing about modifying libel laws to better target news organizations. In the days leading up to the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, Trump received extensive media coverage for savvily skipping a Fox News Republican debate due to his on-again, off-again spat with anchor Megyn Kelly. During this gambit, he not only stole the spotlight but also claimed to have raised almost $6 million for veterans, $1 million of which he’d personally pledged.News organizations understandably followed up, and were met with a Trump campaign unwilling to provide details. In March, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks criticized reporters for asking about the money, telling The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold, who has doggedly covered the issue, that the press shouldn’t “disparage Mr. Trump’s generosity.”Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski recently declined to reveal where the $1 million personal donation had gone after the Post reported that 22 veterans charities said they hadn’t received it. Last week, Trump called Fahrenthold a “nasty guy” for staying with the story. The reality TV star kept the insults rolling on Tuesday as he berated other reporters who asked him about the donations.“It seems as though you’re resistant to scrutiny, the kind of scrutiny that comes with running for president of the United States,” CNN’s Jim Acosta said during the news conference. “I like scrutiny,” Trump responded. “But you know what? Excuse me. Excuse me. I’ve watched you on television, you’re a real beauty.” (He wasn’t being complimentary). He next called ABC News’ Tom Llamas a “sleazy guy.”Trump's view that ""the press should be ashamed of themselves” for following up on his claims shows a fundamental misunderstanding of reporters' roles. The news media isn't just there to promote his candidacy, but to vet him him as he seeks the nation's highest office. “Instead of being like, ‘Thank you very much Mr. Trump’ or ‘Trump did a good job,’ everyone says, ‘Who got it? Who got it?’” he said early in the press conference. “I have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job.”CBS News' Major Garrett later asked Trump, “Don’t you believe you should be accountable to the people?” “I’m totally accountable,” he replied. “I didn’t want to have credit for it. Actually, what I got was worse than credit. They were questioning me.”Trump’s press conference was carried live for around 45 minutes on CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News. The GOP hopeful was less critical of reporters who veered away from questions over his campaign's evasiveness about the donations.When asked about the recent shooting of a gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo, for example, he was happy to respond. Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

But on Tuesday, Americans' searches for gorilla news briefly eclipsed their interest in looking up the presumptive Republican nominee. According to Google Trends, which monitors search interest online, the term ""Gorilla"" overtook the term ""Donald Trump."" The numbers represent the relative popularity of different searches, and are not absolute. Below is a screenshot from Google Trends taken around 1:30 p.m. EST.People are searching for the term ""gorilla"" because zookeepers at the Cincinnati Zoo this weekend shot Harambe, a 17-year-old western lowland gorilla, after a 4-year-old boy fell into the primate's enclosure.Footage of Harambe picking up the boy went viral online, and on Tuesday, Yahoo reporter Hunter Walker asked Trump at a press conference about the zoo's decision to kill the endangered animal.Trump gave a long answer, and the ease with which he opined on a decision by zoologists left many in the room speechless. ""There were moments with the gorilla, the way he held that child, it was almost like a mother holding a baby,"" Trump said.""I don't think they had a choice,"" he added about shooting the animal. ""It's too bad there wasn't another way.""Zoo officials on Tuesday defended the decision to shoot the critically endangered anima, citing the imminent danger to the trapped boy.Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reporting.

Upon arrival, officers found 160 damaged crosses, each worth $100.Volunteers from the Henderson Fire Department and the American Legion banded together to restore 140 of the crosses to their rightful places, WFIE reported. Twenty crosses were completely destroyed, and it was unclear if they would be replaced in time for the Memorial Day service on Monday. The Henderson Police Department took to Facebook on Saturday to issue a series of appeals for information about the incident. The first (above) revealed the crash damage.

A group of men in Kansas reportedly beat up a Muslim student while shouting Trump's name.Trump has dismissed concerns that his xenophobic rhetoric is hateful. The former reality TV star, who has also made racist statements about Mexican immigrants, said that two of his fans who beat up a Hispanic man were simply ""passionate.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Forty-five bodies arrived in the southern Italian port of Reggio Calabria on Sunday aboard an Italian navy ship, which picked up 135 survivors from the same incident.German humanitarian organization Sea-Watch, operating a rescue boat in the sea between Libya and Italy, distributed the picture taken by a media production company on board and which showed a rescuer cradling the child like a sleeping baby.In an email, the rescuer, who gave his name as Martin but did not want his family name published, said he had spotted the baby in the water ""like a doll, arms outstretched"".""I took hold of the forearm of the baby and pulled the light body protectively into my arms at once, as if it were still alive ...

She beat the son and namesake of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos to become vice president.Duterte, 71, was in Davao on Monday and was declared winner in absentia.He won the ballots of nearly 40 percent of 44 million voters, lured by his success against crime in Davao, despite the questions his policies raised among human rights campaigners.Duterte has been criticized for allowing a spree of vigilante killings, and critics fear he could let them happen on a larger scale as president.He has denied ordering killings, but has not condemned them.CONTINUATION IN ECONOMIC POLICYThe former prosecutor has said he will continue his predecessor's economic policies, which focused on infrastructure and fiscal efficiency, to help push growth up to 7-8 percent.Growth has been on average 6 percent a year under Aquino, but it has not translated into jobs and improvement in the lives of ordinary Filipinos.Among several appointments Duterte has announced is Ernesto Pernia, an economics professor from the University of the Philippines, as economic planning secretary, and a former agriculture secretary, Carlos Dominguez, as finance minister.Duterte is due to announce his cabinet on Tuesday.The president also inherits a territorial dispute with China but he has indicated his willingness to repair strained ties by inviting Chinese investment and offering to set aside sovereignty issues in exploring resources in the South China Sea. He has said he will not abandon Philippine claims.Duterte has also said he would pursue peace with Marxist guerrillas and has even offered their leaders government roles.He has said he wanted a more even distribution of power and wealth and has called on Congress to revise a 1987 constitution to allow for a more federal system of government to accommodate Muslim rebels in the south.But confrontation looks to be looming with the influential Roman Catholic church.Duterte has said he will defy the church and seek to impose a three-child policy and he has called Philippine bishops ""sons of whores"".(Reporting by Manuel Mogato and Karen Lema; Editing by Robert Birsel)"

A spokesmen for Japan's defense ministry declined to comment.The missile tubes on a Patriot missile battery on the grounds of Japan's Ministry of Defense were elevated to a firing position.The South Korean defense official declined to comment on what type of missile might be launched, but South Korea's Yonhap News Agency said officials believe it would be an intermediate-range Musudan missile.""We've detected a sign and are tracking that. We are fully prepared,"" said the South Korean official, who also declined to be identified.A Pentagon spokesman, U.S. Navy Commander Gary Ross, said: ""We are closely monitoring the situation on the Korean Peninsula in coordination with our regional allies. We urge North Korea to refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments.""Ross said he would not discuss U.S. intelligence assessments. The White House declined to comment.North Korea tried unsuccessfully to test launch the Musudan three times in April, according to U.S. and South Korean officials.Japan has put its anti-ballistic missile forces on alert at least twice this year after detecting signs of launches by North Korea.North Korea's nuclear and missile tests this year triggered new U.N. sanctions. But it seems determined to press ahead with its weapons programs, despite the sanctions and the disapproval of its sole main ally, China.Last Friday, leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations, including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Barack Obama, met in Japan and demanded that North Korea comply with a U.N. Security Council resolution to stop all nuclear and missile tests and refrain from provocative action.On the same day, North Korea threatened to retaliate against South Korea after it fired what it said were warning shots when boats from the North crossed the disputed sea border off the west coast of the Korean peninsula.Japan has advanced Aegis vessels in the Sea of Japan that are able to track multiple targets and are armed with SM-3 missiles designed to destroy incoming warheads in space before they re-enter the atmosphere.Patriot PAC-3 missile batteries, designed to hit warheads near the ground, are deployed around Tokyo and other sites as a second and final line of defense.(Reporting by Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo in TOKYO and Ju-min Park in SEOUL; Additional reporting by Lisa Lambert and Jeff Mason in Washington; Editing by Robert Birsel and Dan Grebler)"

The local Il Gazzettino newspaper reported that the amount was 300 euros, or about $335, per month.But when a crippling recession struck the southern European country in 2008, the 50-year-old professional pizza maker from Padua could no longer afford to hand over the support in cold, hard cash.Instead, he offered to stump up the equivalent sum in the form of pies, calzones and other meals made by his take-away business.""In lieu of money, the defendant offered his ex-wife the same amount of compensation in the form of take-away pizzas from his workplace, an offer promptly rejected as 'beggar's change,'"" said Judge Chiara Bitozzi in her ruling.According to the Independent, Toso went on to remarry and have three more children. He shuttered his business in 2010, which is when Zuin filed a criminal complaint against him, alleging non-payment of child support. It culminated in a criminal case, which was heard at a courthouse in Padua last week.Toso's defense attorney argued that, despite enduring extremely tough times, he'd still fulfilled all his other custody obligations and even taken in his daughter in 2011 when her relationship with her mother broke down -- after which Zuin was then supposed to pay 300 euros per month in maintenance to Toso.Judge Bitozzi found there was no evidence of any crime being committed, and Toso was acquitted."

Both were knocked off their bikes by the kangaroo. Heinrich, at 5’4”, said the animal was taller than she is.The fall gave Salter a concussion, while Heinrich wound up with three cracked ribs and scratch marks. Heinrich also ruptured her breast implants, which she jokingly says helped cushion her fall.“They worked as air bags and have been ruptured by the ordeal,” she told the Associated Press.She added that the kangaroo seemed “peaceful” and not like it was acting out of anger.That’s a good thing, since an aggressive kangaroo can be a formidable enemy. Last year, another South Australia woman was nearly killed after a kangaroo repeatedly struck and scratched her while she was out with her dog. But kangaroo attacks are “extremely rare,” Deb Kelly of Australia’s Department for Environment and Heritage told the Adelaide Advertiser at the time, noting that the kangaroo was probably afraid of the woman’s dog, which had followed it into the water."

The party went forward and guests left monetary gifts at the celebration. But the daughter didn't show, texting her dad that she didn't feel up to it. She didn't open the gifts, either. The letter mentioned that the teen also ignored her grandparents, who flew in for the occasion, during their stay.The writer notes the daughter's ""extremely rude behavior"" and asks Miss Manners if it would be rude to keep the gifts.With what seems to be steam coming out of her pen, Miss Manners answers thusly: ""It seems to Miss Manners that this is the least of your problems, considering that you have a thoroughly rude and callous daughter.""The etiquette expert, who now produces the Miss Manners column with her children Nicholas and Jacobina, counsels the parents to return the money with a note explaining that since their child did not participate in the celebration, she doesn't deserve it.Then Mom and Dad get theirs: ""Miss Manners does not consider you to be free of responsibility for this fiasco. Leaving aside your duty to teach your daughter manners and consideration for others, there is the question of why you even considered giving a party for someone who hates parties and your willingness to allow guests to make plans that you offered to cancel a week before.""Some readers of the column in the Washington Post wondered whether the child has an anxiety problem and noted that the dilemma was presented from a parental perspective without the kid's side of things.

Just a month ago, researchers said 93 percent of the reef had been affected by the mass bleaching event.The latest statistics apply specifically to the northern and central parts of the Great Barrier Reef, where scientists said they had ""never seen anything like this scale of bleaching before.""Terry Hughes, convenor of the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce and the scientist responsible for the latest aerial surveys of the reef, said in a press release this was the ""third time in 18 years that the Great Barrier Reef has experienced mass bleaching due to global warming, and the current event is much more extreme than we’ve measured before,"" spurred by an unusually strong El Nino weather event.This repetitive cycle of bleaching, he warned, would only make it more difficult for the already fragile structure to recover in the future.Perhaps the only good news to come from the latest research points to regions along the southern Great Barrier, where just 5 percent of coral has died. Scientists said they expect the ""mildly bleached"" coral along that part of the reef to recover in a few months.Coral becomes bleached most frequently when water becomes too warm. During such times, the colorful algae that live in the coral leave it, causing it to turn bright white. Reefs are able to recover from bleaching if temperatures drop again, but if water remains warm for too long, the coral can die in droves. This is the case with the latest bleaching event.Scientists have been ringing warning bells about the state of the Great Barrier for months, after Hughes and his team first reported the scale of the bleaching. UNESCO had planned to list the World Heritage site as ""in danger"" just last year, but the Australian government successfully lobbied to avoid such embarrassment, claiming the reef was still mostly healthy.Last week, the Guardian reported the government had pressed the UN to intentionally leave any mention of the Great Barrier off a key report outlining the threats of climate change to World Heritage sites. Officials told UNESCO they were worried inclusion would damage tourism to the region.The same day the report was published, the study's lead author published a blog with the information meant to be included in the original report. He called for urgent action after the ongoing ""degradation of the reefs and the likelihood of much worse to come.""Australia has promised to address the reef's bleaching crisis, allocating some $200 million annually towards conservation efforts. But scientists have long said the only way to ward off climate change-induced ocean temperature increases is to curb greenhouse gases.As Hughes notes, however, the Australian environment minister recently approved the country's largest coal mine, despite fierce objections from environmentalists.""The key threat to the Great Barrier Reef is climate change -- the government has recognized that many times,"" Hughes told the Sydney Morning Herald. ""[But] there is a disconnect in the policy around governments issuing permits for 60 years for new coal mines and how that might impact on the Great Barrier Reef and reefs more generally."""

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2a4b8200000e800fffd1a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you think presidential elections are rigged, watch Wal-Mart's annual meeting this Friday.I bought one share of Wal-Mart stock in 1994 as a way to keep an eye on the company. As a shareholder, I have a right to go to Bud Walton Arena on the campus of the University of Arkansas on June 3rd to vote for 12 nominees to the Wal-Mart board, and 3 shareholder proposals. Of the 12 Board members to be coronated, only one is new: Steuart Walton, 34, who is replacing his dad, Jim Walton. Rob Walton has been on the Board for 38 years. He is joined by the company's current CEO and former CFO. It's an in-bred corporate culture. What makes the Wal-Mart board like the White House race, is that very rich people win every time. As for the shareholder's proposals, the Wal-Mart Board of Directors always opposes them---and they always fail. A decade ago, for example, the Wal-Mart Board recommended against six shareholder proposals, ranging from humane poultry slaughter to a political contributions report. According to the company's August, 2006 10-Q report to the S.E.C., the ""shareholders voted upon and rejected"" all six proposals.In 2005, the Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund submitted a proposal dealing with executive compensation. A resolution from the United Methodist Church sought a company ""sustainability"" report. A third resolution proposed studying whether ""there is an equity compensation glass ceiling at Wal-Mart."" A resolution was offered by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to produce a political contributions report. The Sisters of Charity in New Jersey asked for an equal employment opportunity report. None of these proposals got any traction at all.In 2008, all seven shareholder proposals received 17% or less of the total shares voted.In 2013, four shareholder resolutions went to defeat with 83% or more of the voting shares against them. In 2014, there were three shareholders resolutions. None were adopted.Last year, shareholders presented  five proposals, all of which were opposed by the Wal-Mart Board of Directors, and none of which gained more than 18% of the vote. And so it goes, year after year. In 2014, I spoke with Sonia Kowal, Director of Socially Responsible Investing at Zevin Asset Management, who introduced a Wal-Mart shareholder resolution calling for ""full disclosure of our company's lobbying."" Kowal's resolution got 11.7% of the votes cast. Kowal told me that shareholder resolutions at Wal-Mart are a steep climb. ""We recognize that it is very unlikely that we will achieve a very sizeable vote for this resolution given the high percentage of insider ownership,"" Kowal said, ""but it is still important for us to shine a light on the company's lack of disclosure and strongly encourage them to improve."" Kowal said the ""dirty little secret"" in proxy voting ""is that fund managers may feel pressure to side with management against shareholders' best interests because they manage (or want to manage) those companies' 401(k) plans."" This Friday at Bud Walton arena, 3 shareholder proposals will die. The Wal-Mart Board doesn't like any of them. One proposal calls for the retailer to develop criteria for operating in nations with ""a questionable record on human rights [read gay rights] and religious freedom,"" like Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and China. Another proposal asks the company to create an independent board chairman: ""Recent developments---including ongoing investigations into bribery and corruption at the Company's subsidiaries in Mexico, China, Brazil and India; revelations of accounting fraud at the Company's China operations; the Company's refusal to compensate families of workers killed and injured in a fire at a supplier factory in Bangladesh; and a ruling...against the Company for its illegal discipline of employees who exercised their rights---highlight the need for enhanced oversight of corporate culture and behavior. A board led by an independent chairman is best positioned to drive such change.""But shareholders are not the only ones clamoring for culture change at Wal-Mart. It's own employees are getting into the act again this year. The group OUR Walmart is organizing a social media ""thunderclap"" for 9 am on Friday morning, to ""blast a wave of posts from Twitter, Facebook, and/or Tumblr from supporters at a particular time."" The workers want ""family-sustaining wages and...full-time hours."" ""Wal-Mart is the largest retailer in the world,"" OUR Wal-Mart says, ""owned by the richest family in America. Paying poverty wages is a choice. Keeping hours and staffing levels low is a choice...If enough people spoke out about these things, the Waltons might make a different choice."" A group of OUR Walmart members will attempt to gain the floor at the Bud Walton Arena ""to deliver our call for $15, full-time hours, and respect."" Wal-Mart's Board of Directors has been wired against shareholder-driven change since the 1960s. The Walton family controls sufficient shares to bottle up any grassroots initiatives. Rather than stay in a totally rigged game, these institutional shareholders---who own millions in Wal-Mart shares---would do better to dump their WMT stock entirely. By investing their money in socially responsible companies, they will create a ""thunderclap"" that will shake the rafters inside Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville.

It leads to worry-filled, restless nights as our brains try to process all that didn't get accomplished during the day.Kevin's suggestion is to stop living from unfinished and stressful to-do lists and start organizing your world from your calendar.Stop living from a stressful to-do list and start organizing your world from your calendar. (Click to tweet)Rather than a slew of tasks on paper, which have no context as to complexity or time-requirements, set aside time blocks on your calendar to complete those tasks.You'll kill two birds with one stone-you're less likely to procrastinate a big task if the time is already secured (i.e. no meetings or phone calls scheduled during that time) and you'll reduce your mental stress as you don't have to think about what hasn't gotten done.Tools, such as Calendly and even good old Outlook, exist to help you manage your personal and professional time; effectively allowing you to align your tasks and schedule to your values and priorities.  2. Limit MeetingsCan you imagine Bill Gates bopping in and out of meetings all week? Of course not! His time, just like yours, is extremely valuable and 99% of the time is better spent doing his actual job.In fact, nearly every one of the ultra-productive leaders Kevin surveyed said they have strict rules in place to how often they would schedule and attend meetings.Some set aside one day a week where they won't schedule any meetings to not interrupt the flow of productivity, while others swing to the other extreme and allow just one a day a week for planned meetings.Atlassian even suggests that as much as $37 billion in salary costs is wasted in the U.S. alone due to employees attending unnecessary meetings. It's not only a productivity killer, it's a profitability drainer, too.3. Make Your Mornings CountConsistent morning routines which include drinking water, eating breakfast, and some form of exercise, are another common habit of ultra-productive people.Meeting your body's basic physical needs, combined with some form of mental preparation such as reading or meditating, is a proven way to set yourself up for an energized and productive day.""If you want to do more, you need to become more"" says Kevin on why you can't forego your morning routines.Block out an hour on your calendar every morning for your ""pre-work prep."" It doesn't have to be CrossFit or a gourmet breakfast, but whatever it is, it needs to be consistent.It can be as simple as drinking a protein shake and 20 minutes on a treadmill while watching the news-these few tasks awaken your mind and body, and set the tone for the rest of your day.ConclusionKevin dropped this nugget of wisdom, saying, ""If you're not attacking the day, you're letting the day attack you!""""If you're not attacking the day, you're letting the day attack you!"" -Kevin Kruse (Click to tweet)Take control of your time and productivity through a series of intentional actions.Swap your to-do list for a calendar. Be ruthless about which meetings are critical and which should be scrapped. Start your day by invigorating your mind and body, so you can achieve productivity like you've never known.You can find the interview that this post was based on, and many more, by subscribing to the B2B Growth Show on iTunes.___________________________________________________________ James Carbary is the founder of Sweet Fish Media, a done-for-you business development service that guarantees new relationships between B2B companies and their ideal clients.

I agree with Alec Ross, author of The Industries of the Future, that the most important job I have is being a Mom. My kids are growing up with challenges and opportunities my generation thought were fantastical themes in movie scripts. What does this all mean for how we prepare our kids in school? What do we teach them about the innovations that are available right now and what do we teach them to ensure they are part of the innovations that are coming soon? For five years, The Global Search for Education has been exploring those questions; once again this month, we share more fascinating insights from around the world. Michael Sweeney, CEO of Steinway & Sons, talked to me about the impact his new concert pianist - a robot called Spirio - will have on the world of music.

With Spirio, there is the potential for the concert to be live-streamed into your living room. Michael Sweeney, CEO of Steinway & Sons, discusses the miraculous capabilities of Steinway's Spirio (a new high-resolution player piano that provides an unrivaled musical experience, indistinguishable from a live performance) and offers some insight into the future of music. Dr. Brian Annan's company, Infinity Learn Ltd, explores the merger of learning and wellbeing. In his interview with The Global Search for Education, Brian envisions a future for schools that will extend the boundaries out into museums, libraries, the corporate world and environmental communities. ""[These] places are potential sites for learning and development whereby our youth contribute to community and environmental improvement. So the community at large rather than the school or network of schools is seen as the vital engine room for integration of technology and media."" Roland Kupers wants students to develop the kind of habits conducive to understanding their world in all its complexity. We need a new science that is capable of explaining the intricacy that has been introduced to the world by globalization and technological advances. For example: ""Understanding the influence of climate change on the crises of agriculture, urbanization and poverty in the Middle East casts a different light on the links between environmental policy and terrorism, and our choices therein""; and ""Understanding that a human body is constituted of 90% non-human cells sheds a different light on the nature of our individuality.""Language is the ultimate tool of humanity. Our Global Teacher Bloggers are pioneers and innovators in fields such as technology integration, mathematics coaching, special needs education, science instruction, and gender equity. This month we asked them to share answers to the question: How do we do a better job of cultivating young readers? Our experts from very diverse schools around the globe agreed that reading should be more fun and fulfilling than forced and tedious. We should not only teach reading but engender a love of literature. ""As educators, we should be role models. If we want our students to love reading, we need to love reading,"" notes Todd Finley.And speaking of books.... did you know that after the bible and Shakespeare, Alice In Wonderland is the most quoted book of all time? It's been five years since my daughter and I self-published The Real Alice in Wonderland, a book which tells the actual story behind the publication of the handwritten, hand illustrated original manuscript, Alice's Adventures Underground, which Lewis Carroll gave as an early Christmas present to our relative Alice Liddell in 1864. A simple question - ""Mom, how are we related to Alice Liddell?"" - made us very curious. This led to research, a successful school book day presentation, a series of creative book workshops, and then meetings with booksellers which culminated in the production of our lush coffee table book now in stores again 5 years after it was first released. As Alice would I am sure agree, curiosity is a truly amazing gift - it takes you down rabbit holes where you are able to explore fantastical problems and learn important things in the doing. And when that curiosity is nurtured, who knows how far you might go? What new opportunities might present themselves?

It first appeared on Youtube.Of A Soldier's PassingOf why he fought and wherefore he fell ought not to be Of what we dwell As we lay to rest our martyr's holiest of devotions; And how his fate came to he and what worldly hands Brought him to be Should be invisible to we, as he is cast off to the deepest Of our oceans.For we are here not to cheer and even less to jeer At this tearful remembrance of his passing; And as his vessel is laid and begins its terrestrial fade Long we hope that he will wade in eternal everlasting.Of all the wrongs that may be songs None be more thunderous as cannibalism Of corpus, And of all the sins that are within None be more foul as to disembowel Lazarus Of sarcophagus.So let us not discuss with wanton lust Our need for vengeance making, Nor valiantly abide our softer side  And talk of foolish peaceful-making.Be he brave or be he knave Be nowhere of our thoughts, And if courageously he tried-- Or if he succumbed unglorified, We care never to be taught.Even more we dare be firmer of what we murmur  About the innards of any man Without profaning and then distaining  Sacred grave and mound; For only self-righteous gods of unfit sod  Besmirch the battled dead of God and ground.And so let us gently bow our heads and reminisce In silent sorrow As we muse about our childman of grief-stricken Comrades and clan Who will be without any more tomorrows.And we also implore the Mystery above to greet him With infinite love As he chariots to golden fields foretold of ancient scrolls; We too beseech our soldier-friend to forgive us when War and woes have made us foes of dead men being Our lost souls.--Yet, no evil ever be as great as thee As when menfolk are turned to warring hordes; And no one asks for what their tasks The sabres and the swords.Therefore, let no man ever say the query of why we fight today Be treasonous atrocity! Saving at hollowed place we let known our grace As we entomb our Son of bloom with sincerest generosity.And so curse not our folly as we sully Your goodly name for our most fallible convictions, Even though we desecrate and by default repudiate The sanctity of your most horrible of afflictions.--Still, no matter what we speak and say, even less of our Deeds today, Shall be yet seen as vanity's rage and roar; For Death enlightens the orbs awake to no more ache As it brings sight to all our fleeting might But being sand-castles forged on breaking shores."
