0,MEDIA,New York Times Names Elizabeth Spayd Public Editor,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/liz-spayd-new-york-times-public-editor_us_573c4e89e4b0aee7b8e86eb2,"She has big shoes to fill, as predecessor Margaret Sullivan raised expectations for the role.",2016-05-18,The New York Times has chosen Liz Spayd as the paper's sixth public editor. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573c58ba1600006400f93b51.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The New York Times has named Elizabeth Spayd, former Washington Post managing editor and current editor-in-chief of the Columbia Journalism Review, as the paper's next public editor. The Times has been searching for a replacement for Margaret Sullivan since February, when she announced she would leave the publication a few months before the end of her four-year term to become a media columnist for The Washington Post. The Huffington Post reported Monday that Spayd was a finalist in a search process that considered a number of prominent journalists for the influential role. ""Liz rose to the top of that group based on her stellar track record as an uncompromising, honest and intellectually rigorous journalist, one who is deeply committed to the idea of serving our readers and holding this institution to our values,"" publisher Arthur Sulzberger, executive editor Dean Baquet and editorial page editor James Bennet wrote Wednesday in a staff memo.The Times created the public editor role in 2003, following the Jayson Blair plagiarism scandal. Some past public editors sporadically blogged, but Sullivan, who joined in 2012, dramatically raised expectations for the job by quickly addressing Times controversies online and engaging regularly on Twitter. As of Wednesday morning, Spayd has only tweeted 11 times since joining Twitter in 2008. So it remains to be seen how she'll use social media, which is where disputes over the Times' journalism often first flare up. In the memo, Times' brass noted that Spayd ""has deep digital experience, and we are confident that she will continue to adapt this role as the landscape evolves.""Spayd began her career at The Detroit News, then joined The Washington Post in 1988. She spent 25 years at the paper, rising to managing editor, before becoming editor-in-chief and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review in 2014. Last year, Spayd oversaw CJR's shift from being a bimonthly magazine to publishing two special issues a year and increasing its focus on digital. The Times will go at least several more weeks without a public editor, as Spayd is expected to start this summer. Sullivan departed in mid-April, meaning the Times hasn't had a public editor to tackle recent controversies, such as dispute over a magazine profile of top Obama White House official Ben Rhodes and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump's attack on the paper for a front-page investigation of his misogynist dealings with women.

4,TECH,Many Americans Unconcerned About Facebook Meddling With The News,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-news-bias-poll_us_573b4aa1e4b0646cbeeafbb2,Does the new poll suggest we have a non-troversy here?,2016-05-18,"Critics slammed Facebook last week for alleged bias in its ""Trending Topics.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573b4aca1600006400f93871.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The media have been in a froth lately over news that Facebook's ""Trending Topics"" are subject to human bias, supposedly to the detriment of conservative viewpoints. But American voters don't really care, according to a survey from news analytics firm Morning Consult.Forty-seven percent of survey respondents said they were ""very comfortable"" or ""somewhat comfortable"" with social media networks determining the news that people see on their sites. Seventeen percent were ""not very comfortable,"" another 17 percent were ""not comfortable"" and 20 percent had no opinion.Democrats were notably happier about the idea than Republicans -- perhaps no surprise given the particular claims about Facebook. Fifty-five percent of Democrats and only 42 percent of Republicans were at least somewhat comfortable.If the bias allegations are true -- Facebook says they aren't -- the social giant's news editors would sometimes suppress articles from conservative outlets in the Trending Topics module, a sort of sidebar where people can see ""popular"" stories. The response to those claims was strong enough that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged to meet with conservative media personalities this week.In the same poll, Republicans were more likely than Democrats -- 36 percent to 28 percent -- to say the selection of news stories on social media should be determined purely by ""the level of reader interest.""Overall, 31 percent of survey respondents chose that option, versus news being determined by ""editors at the social media companies"" or by a combination of the two.The online survey was conducted from May 13 to 15 among a national sample of 2,000 registered voters.In a sense, reader interest is what drives Facebook. While Trending Topics are edited by humans, Facebook's News Feed -- the central hub where you consume content -- operates according to an algorithm that shows you items you're likely to interact with. Despite any supposed bias in Trending Topics, conservative news is widely shared in News Feed.Of course, Facebook's automated process is still constructed and tweaked by humans who ultimately determine which parameters are prioritized. For example, the company has recently given extra attention to live videos broadcast via the Facebook app. That means you're more likely to see those videos in your News Feed even as most people say they aren't interested in using that app.In an ironic twist for a story about how people are exposed to news on social networks, 31 percent of the survey respondents said they'd heard about the bias controversy from television news while only 18 percent heard about it from Facebook. Fifty-five percent overall said they get news from social media."
5,TECH,Robot Butler's Creativity Surprises Its Own Makers,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robot-butler-cradles-item_us_573c87a9e4b0aee7b8e88cba,"""We never taught it that.""",2016-05-18,"HERB in action. Note that this isn't the ""cradling"" behavior referenced above.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573c9a2d130000d605382132.gif?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A robot designed to clear clutter has learned how to cradle items in its arms, the same way a human might hold a baby, Carnegie Mellon University said Wednesday. Even more remarkable, the robot seems to have tapped into this tender side all on its own.""We never taught it that,"" Siddhartha Srinivasa, an associate professor of robotics at the school, said in a press release.The robot, dubbed the Home Exploring Robot Butler (HERB), uses a series of algorithms to solve problems and move objects around. HERB's most remarkable feature is the ability to both recognize specific types of items and move them to certain areas. In a video shared by Carnegie Mellon, HERB can be seen locating blocks and sorting them according to color.Srinivasa's goal is for robotic assistants to move out of factories and into your home. In a factory setting, robots can be programmed to follow a very specific routine, but homes are more chaotic. The ability to recognize and handle items according to context is key.In other words: You need a robot butler that can understand what ""grab me a beer"" means. You wouldn't want one that opens the fridge and interprets every item within as the same thing. Nor would you want a robot that has to move every single item in the fridge to access your Budweiser.""When a person reaches for a milk carton in a refrigerator, he doesn’t necessarily move every other item out of the way,"" Carnegie Mellon explained in its press release. ""Rather, a person might move an item or two, while shoving others out of the way as the carton is pulled out.""The action of removing an item from a fridge seems so simple in human terms. You just reach out and grab it. But consider the fairly complex set of actions you're following when you do so. Your brain tells your arm to reach up and pull the fridge open. Your eyes locate what you want. Then you navigate ""obstacles"" in the way (some old pasta sauce, maybe, or a stick of butter), close your fingers around the drink, remove your arm while clasping it and push the refrigerator shut.From a programming perspective, that's challenging: Machines lack your human intuition, so it's up to algorithms and artificial intelligence to get the job done.""So, our algorithm learns to cradle the object in the same way you learn to solve the Rubik's cube,"" Srinivasa explained in an email to The Huffington Post. ""We are also actively developing ... algorithms that simultaneously learn the rules of engagement as they solve problems. This is critical because physical properties like friction are hard to estimate and change all the time.""Put a different way, HERB learns according to context. It realized that the best way to transport a certain item was to cradle it, so that's what it did, expressing some measure of ""creativity"" in the process.Srinivasa told HuffPost he hopes his team's research will bring us closer to robotic assistants in our homes.""If we want robots in our everyday lives, we need to either turn our homes into factory floors or enable robots to understand and work with the clutter and uncertainty in our homes,"" Srinivasa said. ""Our work takes a step towards solving that problem."""
6,GREEN,"Human Developments Are Wiping Out The West's Natural Land, Report Finds",Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/disappearing-west-report_us_573b713fe4b0ef86171c5104,The wild West is getting a lot less wild.,2016-05-18,"Urban sprawl in places like Arizona, pictured above, was the biggest contributor to natural land loss in the American West between 2001 and 2011.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573bb430130000d605381fcd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Human activity is responsible for the disappearance of a football field's worth of natural land in the American West every two and a half minutes, a report released Tuesday found.Conducted by the Center for American Progress and the Conservation Science Partners, the ""Disappearing West"" project is the first analysis to quantify how much natural landscape the region has lost due to road construction, energy infrastructure, agricultural and timber operations and urban sprawl.In the 11 states studied -- Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming -- researchers found that between 2001 and 2011, about 4,300 square miles of natural areas disappeared because of development. That's an area slightly larger than Yellowstone National Park. The groups undertook the project in hopes of providing the broadest look possible at what development is doing to the West -- which they say no analysis has done before. ""For those of us who are from the West or live in the West or even if you're a periodic visitor, you can see a landscape that is changing,"" Matt Lee-Ashley, a senior fellow and the director of public lands at CAP, said on a call with reporters. ""At the local level it's relatively easy to see. You see rapid growth of energy infrastructure in places like northwest New Mexico ... but the real question is, what does this all add up to? How much of the West's wetlands, deserts and other natural areas have we already lost to development? How quickly are these areas disappearing? And where is that loss happening most rapidly, and why?""Of all states studied, Wyoming lost the highest percentage of its land to human development, CSP senior scientist David Theobald told reporters.An interactive map released with the project breaks down, county by county, where development is taking the biggest toll. In Campbell County, Wyoming, for example, energy developments between 2001 and 2011 are largely responsible for the loss of more than 113,000 acres of natural land -- a rate of loss 680 percent higher than the state overall and more than 530 percent higher than than the western states as a whole.But the biggest contributors to land loss region-wide were urban sprawl and commercial developments, which accounted for more than half of natural lands being wiped out. That's most evident in Arizona, where there was a 30 percent increase in natural land lost to urban sprawl during the decade studied. Energy infrastructure and road developments come in second and third, respectively, as contributors to natural land loss.All that development poses a serious threat to the habitats of wild animals. As it stands, ""a bear walking a random path through natural areas in the West is an average of only 3.5 miles from significant human development,"" the report notes. ""I think overall this is a reminder that natural area loss in the West is still a problem and that, notwithstanding the work of folks like Teddy Roosevelt and John Muir and others, there is a race to save some of the last places in the West,"" Lee-Ashley said, pointing out that only 12 percent of land in the region is permanently protected for the preservation of its natural character."

Greg Abbott (R) spoke out against transgender rights in a tweet Tuesday. ""JFK wanted to send a man to the moon. Obama wants to send a man to the women's restroom. We must get our country back on track,"" Abbott tweeted, branding the tweet with ""#tcot,"" or ""top conservatives on Twitter."" Since the Obama administration announced last week that public schools should allow transgender students to use the bathroom that best corresponds to their gender identity, conservatives have loudly opposed the Justice Department guidance.Abbott's message follows Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) saying he wants to “let every school decide, let the parents decide"" about transgender students' bathroom choices.Failure to comply with the Title IX gender equity law's application to transgender discrimination puts Texas at risk of losing $10 billion in federal funding for its public schools and universities. But Abbott is continuing his fight. ""The constitution and the federal government has been turned upside-down,"" Abbott said in a Bloomberg interview when asked about transgender bathroom laws.""The real issue here, and the bigger issue that is wrecking America, is the way the Obama administration is rewriting the Constitution by rewriting the law, which it does not have the power to do,"" he added.This is not the first time Abbott has been openly opposed to giving legal protection to transgender people using the bathroom of their choice. Many conservatives, including Abbot, opposed Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance, which was struck down in November 2015. Conservatives referred to the proposition as the ""bathroom ordinance"" and used the slogan ""no men in women's bathrooms"" to fight the movement."
8,POLITICS,Increasing Numbers Of Americans Support Marijuana Legalization,Bob Tognetti,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/polls-marijuana-legalization_us_573cb8abe4b0646cbeebd478,There’s been a lot of polling on the topic lately.,2016-05-18,More and more Americans are expressing support for legalizing marijuana.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5877d14c1200002d00ad73e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A wave of recent polls shows that majorities of voters in five states, and a majority nationwide, support legalizing medical marijuana. Many voters also support legalizing marijuana for recreational use.Eighty percent of Florida’s registered voters would support a state constitutional amendment to legalize medical marijuana. While support drops when voters are asked about recreational use, the issue still garners a majority with 56 percent for it and 41 percent against.Ohio’s House of Representatives recently passed a bill that would legalize medical marijuana in the state. Ninety percent of Ohio voters support the measure while full legalization has a narrow majority of support at 52 percent to 45 percent.Rhode Island is much more open to the idea. Sixty-seven percent of voters there support the state’s current law allowing the use of marijuana for medical purposes. A majority, 55 percent, support passing a law to legalize it for recreational use. The same proportion of registered and likely voters in Maine supports full legalization in that state.Even in conservative Utah, about 66 percent of all voters, including 55 percent of Republicans, support the legalization of medical marijuana.A recent CBS national poll of adults found that 56 percent of Americans support marijuana legalization and 36 percent of adults disapprove of it. Almost 90 percent say medical marijuana use should be allowed. Opinion has changed drastically on this issue over time. In a 1979 CBS national poll, only 27 percent of Americans supported marijuana legalization while 69 percent wanted it to remain illegal. That’s a gain of 29 percentage points for legalization.According to Gallup, the reason for the shift is that newer generations are more inclined to accept legalization.But even as time goes on, older generations are increasingly supportive of legalization. When Gallup first asked the question in 1969, only 20 percent of those born between 1936 and 1950 supported the idea. Last year, support from people born in those years, who are now 65-79 years old, increased to 40 percent.The only age group that did not show any stark changes in levels of support were those born in 1935 and earlier and grew up in a time where the vast majority of people didn’t support marijuana use. From 1969 to 2015 support for legalization only rose from 8 percent to 19 percent among that group."

And often, where it does exist, it’s sexist,” the humanitarian said during her address. “It misses women and girls entirely, or undercounts and undervalues their economic and social contributions.”The ambitious plan will involve collecting the data that was neglected in the past, improving the collection process and equipping decision makers with clearer evidence about programs that are effective.Gates underscored data’s crucial role in supporting women by pointing to recent successes where numbers were key.Since 1990, the number of women dying in pregnancy and childbirth every year has dropped by nearly half.Gathering information about these women was made possible largely because clinics keep records about maternal and infant mortality rates, Gates noted during a press briefing.Even with those gains, though, data surrounding life and death is still lacking.Globally, one in three births and two-thirds of deaths, and their causes, aren’t registered.These lapses in data span nearly every facet of a woman’s life, Emily Courey Pryor, senior director of Data2X, told The Huffington Post. Data2X is a U.N.-led group that works with data collectors and policymakers to identify gender data issues and to help bring about solutions.Data2x is one of a number of groups that, together with the Gates Foundation, agreed to work toward closing the gender data gap in order to achieve gender equality. Another data issue that disproportionately affects women is inadequate marriage and divorce registrations, Pryor said. In those cases, women are often unable to inherit property or take out loans. They may not even be able to register their own children, since many countries require a marriage license to go through the process, according to Pryor.Statistics related to taboo topics, like violence against women, also haven’t been properly assessed, Pryor added.Gender-based violence, for example, is an expensive and painstaking issue to assess. It requires finding willing respondents and a cadre of mostly female surveyors to ask these questions. The added hindrance is that these countries then have to make the unfavorable data public.Data is also falling short in areas that are considered “complicated,” according to Pryor.Women’s economic roles, for one, are considered complex because their contributions aren’t cut and dry.Surveys typically focus on the primary economic activity of the household. That, in turn, leaves out the woman who may mostly work in the home, but may have a side business that’s not neatly categorized in a survey.This also excludes the woman with seasonal work who may not be technically employed when the surveys are being conducted.“They tend to reinforce stereotypes; man producers, woman as reproducer,” Gates said. “This has the effect of making women appear more dependent and less productive than they actually are.”But when given the opportunity to speak up, these women prove to hold a major stake in the workforce.When Uganda introduced survey questions to cover secondary activities, such as subsistence farming, the workforce “magically” increased by 700,00 people, Gates said. The majority of them were women.Surveys also leave out the “unpaid” work women contribute, which includes raising children or caring for an elderly family member.Yet, this overlooked work has an estimated value of about $10 trillion annually, according to a 2015 McKinsey report.One of the ways homemakers create value, for example, is by making room for someone else in the household to earn an income.Assigning monetary value to such work is key to elevating these women in society and to devising empowering programs that cater to their specific needs. “The assumption is ‘it’s hard and it’s expensive,’” Pryor said of the data-collection process. “My thing is, maybe it is expensive. And, maybe it’s not all easy. But that’s OK. It is worth figuring out because we’re talking about the lives, contributions and the realities of half the population.”"

The Republican candidate, 69, offered a few vague and unspecific thoughts about the movement for transgender rights in a Washington Post interview Tuesday, but noted that the U.S. government must act ""to protect all people."" ""It is a very, very small portion of the population, but as I said, you have to protect everybody, including small portions of the population,"" he said in the interview. Access to health care and appropriate restrooms for transgender people should be addressed at the state level, rather than the federal level, he said. ""I think we have to help people,"" he said. ""I don’t view it as civil rights or not civil rights. I think it’s something where we have to help people — and hopefully the states will make the right decisions.”As to whether or not he had any personal experience working with members of the trans community, Trump noted, “Now, I may not know about it, but I do not think I have any exposure to it from the standpoint of knowing people.""Trump's remarks came in response to the Obama administration's May 13 directive aimed at combating discrimination against transgender Americans in schools and health care coverage. The move sparked the ire of a number of Republican lawmakers, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who blasted Obama for ""turning bathrooms into courtroom issues"" in advising schools nationwide that they must allow transgender students access to bathroom facilities that correspond with their gender identity, the Associated Press reports. Abbott said he was working closely with North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to ""fight back"" against the directive. McCrory, of course, has been at the epicenter of controversy after he signed North Carolina's House Bill 2 into law on March 23. Dubbed the ""bathroom bill,"" HB 2 effectively bans transgender people from using the bathroom consistent with their gender identity and also prohibits cities from implementing non-discrimination measures. At an April town hall-style event in New York, however, Trump said he thought transgender people should be allowed to “use the bathroom they feel is appropriate,” including at Trump Tower. Days later, trans icon Caitlyn Jenner filmed a short video of herself dropping by the Trump Tower in Manhattan to use the women's restroom. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S. "

Any moves by her campaign to try drive Sanders out could risk angering Democratic voters and end up backfiring.So Clinton must continue her primary fight in Kentucky and Oregon, where analysts predict she will have a hard time winning. The Democratic race is unlikely to wrap up before California, New Jersey and several other states vote on June 7.Oregon, with a heavily white, liberal population, politically resembles its northern neighbor Washington, which voted for Sanders. Oregon voters cast their ballots by mail, meaning voting there actually began in the last week of April.After Sanders won both West Virginia and Indiana this month, analysts said he has a good chance of taking Kentucky. But Louisville and the western part of the state are more moderate politically, and Clinton spent Sunday and Monday campaigning there.Sanders has insisted that he will stay in the presidential election until the Democratic convention on July 25-28, but Democratic strategist Jim Manley said Sanders should be careful he does not wind up helping Trump.“I have no problem with Senator Sanders staying in until the end,” said Manley, who supports Clinton. “If that’s what he chooses to do, I just hope he plays it smart and doesn’t give the Trumpcampaign any more ammunition than it already has to take on Hillary Clinton.”Some Democrats are concerned Trump could repeat any criticisms Sanders makes against Clinton. Clinton allies also fear that Sanders could so damage the former U.S. secretary of state in the eyes of his supporters that they will choose not to vote in November if he is not on the ballot.Sanders supporters played down this concern. Jeremy Schofield, 45, of Albuquerque, N.M., said he would flip to Clinton if she's the nominee. He thinks the long primary process is helping, not hurting, the Democratic Party.""I think it’s important for him to continue to demonstrate that there is an awful lot of support for those policies,"" Schofield said of Sanders. ""I'm not terribly concerned about Trump being elected.""Chanelle Hayes, 34, of Fort Mills, S.C., said she wants Sanders to remain as a candidate, even if it helps Trump, whom she called a ""racist"" she could never support.Hayes acknowledged that Sanders could lose the nomination and also said it was possible that a prolonged Democratic race would help Trump in the general election. But she said she backs Sanders because she thinks he is more honest than Clinton.(Reporting by Ginger Gibson and Emily Stephenson.

15,BUSINESS,This Is How Much More Money CEOs Make Than The Typical American,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/executive-pay-average-american_us_573b6a92e4b0aee7b8e806a1,"The CEO-to-worker pay ratio is 335-to-1, says a new AFL-CIO report.",2016-05-17,"The CEO-to-worker pay ration has risen from 42-1 in 1980 to 335-to-1 last year, according to the AFL-CIO.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573b6b2e1300000105381dc3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last year, executives at S&P 500 companies earned a whopping 335 times the pay of the average U.S. worker, according to a new analysis by the AFL-CIO. In their annual “Executive Paywatch” report, the labor federation said the typical CEO raked in $12.4 million in 2015. The average rank-and-file worker, meanwhile, took home just $36,875, based off data from the Labor Department.“Corporate CEOs have rewritten the rules of our economy to allow themselves to continue to amass wealth and power, while the rest of us are left to the scraps,” Heather Slavkin Corzo, who directs the AFL-CIO’s office of investment, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.The AFL-CIO produces the annual analysis to shame companies over sky-high executive pay and tax avoidance. This year, the federation took aim at Mondelēz International, owner of Oreos and other snack staples, which is in the process of laying off 600 of its 1,200 workers in Chicago. Mondelēz told workers their jobs would move to Mexico unless they could give up $46 million per year in pay and benefits.As The Huffington Post reported earlier this month, Mondelēz’s CEO, Irene Rosenfeld, earned a total compensation package of $19.7 million last year. That's 534 times the pay of the average non-supervisory worker in this country, according to the AFL-CIO report. The report breaks down executive pay by industry and state, and highlights CEOs with the most eye-popping hauls. Topping the list for 2015 was Joe Kiani, CEO of the medical device company Masimo Corporation. Kiani’s total compensation last year came to $119 million. As Modern Healthcare previously reported, most of that money came in the form of 2.7 million shares of restricted stock that Kiani will be entitled to only under certain circumstances.Other CEOs at the top of scorecard were Horizon Pharma’s Timothy Walbert, with $93 million; GAMCO Investors’ Mario Gabelli, with $89 million; GoPro’s Nicholas Woodman, with $77 million; and Palo Alto Networks’ Mark McLaughlin, with $67 million.The AFL-CIO took a close look at S&P 500 companies with the highest levels of unrepatriated profits -- that is, profits stashed overseas to avoid paying taxes in the United States. The analysis found that at the 25 companies in the index with the most unrepatriated profits, executive pay was 79 percent higher than it was at other companies. According to the AFL-CIO, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio has climbed from 42-to-1 in 1980 to its current level of 335-to-1.In the future, the public should have a better idea of how extreme those ratios are within particular corporations. For now, companies do not have to disclose their average worker pay, which is why the AFL-CIO relies on economy-wide pay averages from the Labor Department. But as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms, the Securities and Exchange Commission has finalized a rule that will force public companies to release their own internal pay ratios. Corporate trade groups lobbied hard against the rule, most likely because the disclosures would be embarrassing. It's set to go into effect next year.""We think it’s important information for investors to understand the compensation practices within individual companies,"" Slavkin Corzo said. ""We don’t have a good sense of what the workers are making within each company. That pay ratio will start to paint a picture for us."""
16,POLITICS,Donald Trump Has Invited The Media To Pick A Side,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-media-authoritarian_us_573b354fe4b0aee7b8e7d099,We may as well take him up on the offer.,2016-05-17,Donald Trump's candidacy is pushing the media to not be neutral. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Reports started bubbling up in the press this spring about how the corporations that provide millions of dollars to fund the Republican National Convention were suddenly skittish about participating in their traditional role of facilitating the GOP's quadrennial confab. The reason: Donald Trump.As The New York Times' Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman reported at length, big corporate brands like Walmart, Coca-Cola, Apple and Google had become alarmed that Trump's ""divisive candidacy [had] alienated many women, blacks, and Hispanics."" In other words, being seen as too closely tied to the GOP front-runner might be bad for business.A few weeks later, Politico's Anna Palmer and Brianna Gurciullo reported on the somewhat-predictable twist: Trump was similarly imperiling the Democratic convention and the corporate funds they use to subsidize their gathering:None of the firms are publicly pointing to Trump as the reason they're staying away. But the GOP's more well-documented struggles appear to be taking a toll on Democrats, since many companies prefer to give to both conventions or neither in order to project an image of balance.That the party conventions -- ostensibly a public good and a vital part of our democracy -- require corporate boodle to even happen is something we could spend several paragraphs discussing. But for now, let's leave that aside. Here we have major corporations blanching at ponying up for a Trump convention because they properly recognize that he is, on every level, toxic waste in human form.But in their next move, this recognition is overridden by something these corporations favor even more: the need to be perceived as neutral. And so, everyone who isn't ""Donald Trump, madman,"" has to similarly suffer.It's something of a deranged arrangement. But our noble corporate underwriters of democracy needn't feel alone. This is a conundrum political journalists are also wrestling with: How can you provide ""balanced"" coverage of a race in which one candidate is entirely unconventional? In fact, let us note, one of the things we often do as this struggle ensues is use the weasel word ""unconventional,"" when we mean to say ""dangerously unhinged and narcissistic autocrat."" (And we are perhaps using the weasel word ""autocrat"" to stand in for ""fascist,"" at that.)The alternative, of course, is that the media might accidentally normalize Trump, in a witless abandonment of all the evidence that should objectively lead away from this conclusion. On the May 13 edition of ""On The Media,"" host Bob Garfield explicitly warned against this process of normalization.Garfield was reacting to Trump's recent appearances on the Sunday morning political salons, during which the hosts genially asked Trump about his plans for trade, taxes and the like as if these policy positions were the matter of singular interest to journalists covering Trump. (Trump has indicated that he has no real interest in policy positions, characterizing them all as chimeric ""suggestions"" designed to provide no foothold for critique.)Says Garfield:The man is a menace of historic proportions, so who the Chuck Todd cares about his tax proposals? It’s like asking Charles Manson about his driving record. But here comes the political press, going into standard general election mode and treating a demagogue as a legitimate standard-bearer, as if the only thing he has to answer for is the latest blip in the news cycle.The necessary prescriptive, Garfield says, is for every Trump interview to ""hold him accountable for bigotry, incitement, juvenile conduct and blithe contempt for the Constitution."" At the bottom of this post, my editors (perhaps lacking confidence in my ability to affirm these things about Trump, but that's a conversation for another day) will have affixed an editor's note confirming that we agree with what Garfield prescribes. Other media outlets have stirred in a similar direction. At PressThink, New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen provides a lengthy discursion on the topic of neutrality in the age of a Trump candidacy, citing two prominent examples of media leaders who are opting for a different approach.One is BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith, who issued a Dec. 8, 2015, social media usage directive to his staff in which he clarifies that it is ""entirely fair to call [Trump] a mendacious racist,"" because he is ""out there saying things that are false, and running an overtly anti-Muslim campaign."" This is, Smith underscores, a matter of fact, adding that ""there is nothing partisan about accurately describing Donald Trump.""A second example was the nearly simultaneous broadcast of a Tom Brokaw editorial on NBC Nightly News, in which the venerable newsman described Trump's proposed blanket ban on Muslims as ""a dangerous proposal that overrides history, the law and the foundation of America itself,"" reminiscent of other historical moments in which ""the consequences of paranoia overriding reason"" were laid bare.Smith's and Brokaw's actions did not go unnoticed. CNN's Dylan Byers, in a Dec. 10 column, made note of this ""backlash"" against Trump, calling it a ""watershed moment"" in which ""news organizations [abandoned] concerns about impartiality and evenhandedness and stating what they believe are objective truths"" about Trump.Rosen discusses how ""impartiality and evenhandedness"" became a sort of ""ritual,"" semi-divorced from ""objective truth"" at length. It would be of benefit to read the whole thing, because Rosen's discussion would help reinforce what ""picking a side"" means in this context. It's not advocacy for some sort of journalistic skullduggery. Telling the truth is still the order of the day: to lie about Donald Trump is to undermine the overall cause of integrity. This is about couching reporting in equivocating terms, which -- as I'm sure Smith and Brokaw would contend -- robs the truth of its vitality.But in summation, Rosen notes that while the ""ritual"" of neutrality would normally lead news organizations to adopt some point of view high above the fray, Smith and Brokaw made a different call, one in which they either decided that they were not ""vulnerable to criticism"" for doing so, or ""didn't care"" if they were.That's really what the ""neutral"" feint is: an effort expended by news organizations to insulate themselves from these type of attacks. This, Rosen reckons, is an ""understandable"" pose to take, but didn't, in and of itself, make journalism ""legitimate.""Per Rosen:Protection will come from being specialists in verification who are allergic to any party line. Accountability journalism blows “balance” out of the water. Intellectual honesty is far more important than a ritualized objectivity. Recover your voice and people will have reason to listen.Of course, it can be difficult for many news organizations to simply adopt a ""bring it on"" attitude about these things. Elections tend to be reported as events of warring, equally worthy ideas. Deference is offered to all comers out of both the desire to be polite arbiters, and to also maintain media access to the players. The political media tends to like their grand narrative of competition, with ups and downs, best weeks and worst weeks, stumbles and comebacks. So equivalences are drawn for the sake of staging.In fairness to most other American presidential candidates, very few provide the media with a strong case for deviating from this approach. Trump is unique to this milieu in that he routinely, and intentionally, says highly disturbing and irresponsible things that can't not make one question whether he belongs within a country mile of the nuclear football. He's made it ripe to break with the ritual of even-handedness -- it should actually not be surprising at all to see people like Smith and Brokaw explicitly break from traditional paths.But Trump is unique in another way that should make it easy for journalists to abandon this neutral pose. In another move unique among American political candidates, Trump has openly invited us to do so, by declaring himself, rather forthrightly, to be in open hostility to a free press. He's not merely complaining about coverage or carping about media bias, as Newt Gingrich famously did during the 2012 presidential primary debates. Trump explicitly talks about destroying the freedom of the press.In other words, he's taken a side, which absolves the media of the consequences of doing the same.Trump's promise to menace the media is something he has consistently voiced throughout this campaign season. For example, much attention has been paid to his threat to ""open up"" the libel laws, to enable him to take a measure of revenge against the media. As I've discussed before, I don't necessarily think of this as something that could be practically implemented. To change libel laws, Trump would have to convince Congress to take up his ""protect me, specifically, from criticism"" cause. It's unlikely the legislature would do so, unlikelier still that the courts would uphold this as constitutional. But even if he could convince legislative majorities and five Supreme Court justices to go along with a plan to change the libel laws, it's highly unlikely these bodies would arrive at the standard that Trump clearly prefers. Current law mandates that the standard for demonstrable libel is a higher hurdle for people like Trump to clear, than individuals who cannot be reasonably thought of as ""public figures."" But even if the public figure/private citizen standard could be made square, there is a longstanding tradition in libel cases that the truth is always the best defense, and it's hard to see even hardened Trump allies changing this standard -- if only because it would greatly benefit their own political opponents.But this is why it's useful to reflect on Trump's stated desire to ""open up"" the libel laws -- Trump doesn't distinguish between negative commentary about him and objectively true facts that cast him in a bad light. To Trump, these are one and the same. Reporting that makes Trump look good is permissible, that which does not is, as far as he's concerned, libel and slander. And Trump has more potent ideas about how he'd tear down media organizations that do not conform to his desires than simply altering libel laws.New York Magazine's Jonathan Chait, in explicating how Trump's brand of ""authoritarianism would actually work,"" seizes on an example that involves the press.As Chait reports, Trump, in a rambling monologue recently delivered to Fox News' Sean Hannity, took issue with the negative coverage he has received from The Washington Post, along with the Post's stated intent to just go right along reporting true things about him. Seizing on the fact that the paper is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Trump sends this basic message: It'd be a real shame if something happened to Amazon because of the Post's reporting.TRUMP: It’s interesting that you say that, because every hour we’re getting calls from reporters from the Washington Post asking ridiculous questions. And I will tell you. This is owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos, who controls Amazon. Amazon is getting away with murder, tax-wise. He’s using the Washington Post for power. So that the politicians in Washington don’t tax Amazon like they should be taxed. He’s getting absolutely away — he’s worried about me, and I think he said that to somebody ... it was in some article, where he thinks I would go after him for antitrust. Because he’s got a huge antitrust problem because he’s controlling so much. Amazon is controlling so much of what they’re doing.Unlike his plans for libel laws, this is something that Trump could potentially pull off as president, in conjunction with the legislature. Trump would also command a host of regulatory agencies to do his bidding. As Chait notes elsewhere, Trump ally Roger Stone has already spoken about Trump using the office to ""turn off"" CNN's ""FCC license."" Of course, every great con job begins with a kernel of truth, and as Chait notes, there is a decent argument that Amazon does have a ""huge antitrust problem."" But this isn't Trump advocating for fair business practices (that would sure be a first!). He's threatening to use anti-trust law exclusively against his perceived media enemies. By extension, it's clear that the reverse is true: Favorable coverage from The Washington Post would lead Trump to look the other way.You see, Trump doesn't want the media to be neutral. He wants the media to shower him with favor, and he promises to reward those that do and punish those that don't. His hope is that by threatening to use his office to destroy the media, he will encourage fervent, hagiographic coverage of his candidacy, and limit its criticism.Really, the best argument against attempting ""neutral"" coverage of Trump is that Trump has very plainly demanded that coverage of his campaign not be neutral. This is, as with all things Trump, a ""deal"" he wants to make, with very clear terms. One can choose to join a Trump brigade of latter-day Pétainist sycophants, flatter Trump as a savior and be rewarded in kind, or one can factually condemn him, using his own words and deeds, as a dangerous presidential nominee and risk his wrath. But as the reporting of ""true things that Trump doesn't like"" is enough to earn this enmity, performing the old ritual of even-handedness no longer offers anyone any protection. There is no ""third side."" You can't go ""down the middle"" anymore. This is, as they say, a time for choosing. However you decide, I suggest you go all in.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

The town's name and unique history has often made it a target of Islamophobic rhetoric and threats. But on Sunday, the hate Holy Islamberg expected from an anti-Muslim rally was overshadowed by an outpouring of love and support from their interfaith neighbors.More than 400 people reportedly traveled to Islamberg on Sunday to show a solid front against the American Bikers United Against Jihad, a group whose stated goal is to mobilize like-minded ""patriots"" against ""violent and stealth Jihad,"" which they claim is threatening their freedom and security. On a Facebook page for the event, advertised as a ""Ride for National Security,"" the group called on bikers to join them in protest against Islamberg, claiming the town had links to terrorist organizations. Law enforcement officials have dismissed theories that members of the town have violent intentions. Although 73 people accepted the online invite, only about five bikers showed up, according to The Guardian. A few more protestors showed up in cars, The Daily Star reported. Instead, Islamberg's 200 residents were surrounded by hundreds who traveled to the town to participate in a counter rally for peace. They held up signs and waved American flags as the bikers rode by.After the rally, the counter protestors banded together for a luncheon, a series of talks, and a tour of the town and its mosque.Islamberg officials told the Guardian that the peace rally was proposed by people who did not live in the town and who found details about the bike rally online.Dr. Bilqees Abdullah, a resident of Islamberg for about 30 years, said that the show of support from the local community was ""heartwarming.""“To see so many people come and join and actually say: ‘This isn’t right, this isn’t fair, and we’re not going for it,’ it’s wonderful. Very wonderful,"" she told The Guardian.The local chapter of the NAACP reportedly chartered two buses to help counter protesters get to Islamberg. Michelle Osterhoudt, the education chair for the chapter, told The Huffington Post that it was important for her to support Islamberg's residents because ""they have been target of hate for over 10 years now.""""I hope that by showing up in such a large group, we could show the nation, and perhaps the world,that peace and love prevail,"" Osterhoudt told HuffPost in an email. ""I can now speak on the behalf of my Islamberg friends and let everyone know what I always believed to be true: the residents of Islamberg are a peaceful community with families just like yours and mine.""Islamberg is the headquarters of Muslims of America, an organization founded on the teachings of a Pakistani Sufi cleric named Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani who in the 1980s encouraged his followers to leave urban areas to create religious communities in rural areas. The group has helped establish more than a dozen towns across the nation. This isn't the first time bikers anti-Muslim groups have planned and failed to muster up support for rallies at Muslim American sites. In October 2015, armed protestors tried to set up hate rallies at mosques and Muslim community centers around America. The majority of these events were canceled and in the end, the rallies ended up encouraging interfaith activists in local communities to show up in force to show their solidarity for their Muslim neighbors.

The pair will also be on probation for three years after their prison sentences end.The Leaders were arrested on Aug. 19 on suspicion of beating Rodriguez, then 58, as he slept in a subway station. The men told police they targeted their victim because they believed he was an illegal immigrant.The victim, Guillermo Rodriguez, said in a statement that he was in fact a permanent resident.""I came to this country many years ago and worked hard in the farm fields to provide produce to people here. I actually became a permanent resident of this country years ago, although if I had been undocumented I still would not have deserved to be beaten this way,"" Rodriguez said in a prepared statement read by Assistant District Attorney Nicole Rimar before the sentencing.The pair punched and kicked Rodriguez, and one of the men repeatedly struck him with a metal pole, before the two walked off laughing, prosecutors said.According to a police report, they told officers, ""Donald Trump was right: All these illegals need to be deported."" Prosecutors said Scott Leader told arresting officers that he believed the attack was justified because the victim was homeless and Hispanic. The pair also allegedly threatened police officers while in custody.Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the U.S. presidential race, has been vocal on immigration, proposing to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and promising, if elected, to deport the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States.Trump, a real estate developer and reality television personality, initially described the attack as an outcome of passionate views on immigration but later called it ""terrible.""Lawyers for the two men could not be reached for immediate comment on Monday night.(Reporting by Scott Malone in Boston; Writing by Curtis Skinner; Editing by Sandra Maler)Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
19,ARTS & CULTURE,A New Film About Motherly Love Leaves Cliches Behind,Maddie Crum,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/maggies-plan-rebecca-miller_us_573a2a94e4b077d4d6f3bd31,"Rebecca Miller, the director of ""Maggie's Plan,"" talks gender disparity in filmmaking.",2016-05-17,"Greta Gerwig and Bill Hader seen filming Rebecca Miller's ""Maggie's Plan"" on February 23, 2015 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573a46c81600002a00f93714.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Motherhood may be complex and many-splendored, but there are few feature-length films that portray it that way. Instead, on-screen moms tend to be shoved into the strictures of stereotypes, as stifling as a pair of Spanx.“Mommie Dearest,” the campy 1981 film that makes mothers out to be petty and violent, is an extreme example, but more lighthearted films are guilty of flattening women caregivers, too. Think of the “Freaky Friday” update, wherein Jamie Lee Curtis is power suit-clad but largely absent and judgmental, falling short of her motherly duties no thanks to her own ambitions. We see a carbon copy of the character in Paul Weitz’s 2015 film “Grandma,” in which a caricature of a power mom barks orders while walking on a treadmill. On the other end of the spectrum, there are mother characters who are doting and without personal wants, and these portrayals lend themselves to schmaltz.There are, of course, exceptions. Annette Benning and Julianne Moore make a perfect team onscreen as flawed but sympathetic co-parents in “The Kids Are All Right”; Laura Dern shines in “Wild” as a loving and irresponsible mom. A worthy addition to the list: Greta Gerwig’s performance as Maggie in this year’s “Maggie’s Plan,” a screwball comedy about the whims of love, be it romantic or maternal. The movie, written and directed by Rebecca Miller, begins with a set-up we’ve seen before: a couple of attractive young friends -- a man and a woman -- idly discuss the pros and cons of raising kids. They’re an odd couple. He’s enthusiastic and geeky, she’s bright-eyed and naïve. But their squabbling is benign enough to be endearing. While Maggie (Greta Gerwig) defends her plan to impregnate herself with donated sperm, Tony (Bill Hader) gawks that she’s too young for that, that insemination should be seen as a last resort rather than a plan in itself.We see where this is headed -- maybe the two will fall in love in spite of their differences! -- but this is a film that, in its undulating liveliness, dodges cliches. Tony and Maggie remain just friends, but Maggie meets a married-yet-charming academic (John, played by Ethan Hawke) around the same time of her planned insemination.Flash forward a few years, and the two have shacked up along with Maggie’s now toddler Lily. The couple shares custody of John’s two preteen children with his ex-wife Georgette (Julianne Moore), who’s as self-serious as Maggie is aimless. The ensuing dramas comment on parenthood without making judgments about approaches of best fit; while Georgette deliberately builds a fertile learning environment for the kids, Maggie’s Midwestern work ethic and childlike wonder allow her to embrace motherhood, begrudgingly sacrificing her career goals in the meantime. As her passion for John recedes into resentment -- he spends his days working on a cerebral, labyrinthine novel, neglecting to help around the house -- she devises a plan: reunite John and Georgette, so that she can mother Lily without the added chaos romance has caused her.In an interview with The Huffington Post, Rebecca Miller described why she wanted to create a story that champions maternal love.“There’s an element of romance in every parental relationship. I don’t mean that in an icky way, I mean that it’s the deepest kind of love,” Miller said. “I think of this as a movie with five love stories in it, and definitely one of the love stories is Lily and Maggie. And maybe for her it’s the primary one.”Miller is suited to write honestly about motherhood. She and husband Daniel Day-Lewis have parented two sons, Ronan and Cashel, both in their teens. She explained that she does draw material from her own life, but that filmmakers shouldn’t be restricted to doing so.“I never actually try to do things in that kind of schematic way. I try to let things happen. But because I am a certain way, it just falls out that way,” Miller said. “I’m interested in the female experience. I’m having one. I’m interested in men too, and how we interact and how we affect each other.”In addition to relating the experience of womanhood, Miller draws the goofy, whirlwind pace of “Maggie’s Plan” from her life. The film repeatedly pokes fun at the tangled, jargon-fueled language of academia, as John and Georgette attend a conference for Ficto-Critical Anthropology, snowed in with a crew of eccentrics. Subsidiary scenes such as these can distract from a central story, but the rapid-fire banter between the pair makes their in-jokes engaging. “I as a person am a little bit screwball by nature, so I think it was just natural,” Miller said. “I just followed my nose. The humor and the rhythm of it was one of my great joys. It was almost like writing a musical score. It is a language movie in that the humor is carried by the situations but also by the words, and that was really fun.”Although writing from life is an approach well-suited to the types of films Miller writes and directs -- funny or surreal reflections on contemporary life -- she asserts that expecting women to write about womanhood is restrictive, and further fuels the problem of gender disparity among directors.“Not every man who directs a movie about the mafia is himself in the mafia. That means that women might be able to direct films that don’t directly line up with their realm of experience,” Miller said. “It’s almost like a quota mentality. I think this goes for women and minorities both. [Movie executives] say, 'We really want a woman to direct this movie.' The minute you say that, you mean that we’re all the same. Any woman could direct this movie, and it doesn’t matter which one?”She added, decisively: “Really, we have to start thinking of ourselves as individuals. That, for me, is the answer.”"

The ice cream giant on Tuesday announced a new flavor, Empower Mint, as part of the nascent effort to register voters in states where new rules meant to curb virtually nonexistent fraud threaten to keep eligible voters away from ballot boxes. The mint ice cream contains chunks of brownie and swirls of fudge.“There’s been an organized and coordinated attempt to keep certain groups of voters out of the process -- people of color, low-income people, especially,” Jerry Greenfield, one of the Unilever-owned company’s co-founders, told The Huffington Post in an interview last week. “Instead of expanding voting and making the United States as democratic as it can be -- setting an example for the rest of the world -- there has been this effort to prevent people from voting when there’s been no evidence there’s any kind of problem with voting or voting fraud. It’s absurd,"" said Greenfield.Ben & Jerry's campaign, though national in scope, is centered on North Carolina, which has become a major political battleground during this fever-dream of an election year.The state has served as a theater for a dramatic fight over the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, the latter of whom became the target of the hastily passed HB2 ordinance, the so-called bathroom law that banned trans people from using the restroom associated with their gender identity. A coalition of giant companies cried foul and went to war with the state, which is now facing a civil rights lawsuit from the federal government.But that’s not what drew Greenfield and his Ben & Jerry's co-founder, Ben Cohen, to the Tar Heel state. Last month, a federal judge upheld a North Carolina law that requires voters to show a photo I.D. at the polls. Such laws, which have passed through state legislatures after the election of President Barack Obama, make it harder for minorities, the elderly and students to vote because they disproportionately lack the required form of identification. Additionally, North Carolina's measure prohibits people from registering and voting on the same day, reduces the number of days of early voting, disqualifies ballots cast in the wrong precinct and bans the pre-registering of teenagers before they turn 18.“The reason Ben & Jerry’s chose North Carolina is there’s a lot of activity in terms of voter rights and overcoming voter suppression efforts there,” Greenfield told HuffPost. “There’s also a real history of civil right struggle in North Carolina. For us, it’s about the groups doing work there.”A forthcoming documentary, ""The New Fight for Voting Rights,"" offers a historical look at the South's checkered history on this issue and the new challenges that exist today:The New York Times called North Carolina the “purest distillation of the nation’s wars over voting rules and legislative gerrymandering.” The Washington Post dubbed the state the “epicenter of the voting rights battle.” Richard Hasen, a law professor University of California Irvine who writes at Election Law Blog, declared the state’s new rules “the most sweeping anti-voter law in at least decades,” designed “to make it harder for people -- especially non-white people and those likely to vote Democratic -- to register or cast a vote that will be counted.”In response to the North Carolina law, Ben & Jerry's partnered with the North Carolina chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to lead a registration effort. The company plans to send Antonio McBroom, a Ben & Jerry's franchise owner in Greensboro, around the state in a branded ice cream truck to give out free scoops and literature on how to avoid the pitfalls of the new voting law, and why Ben & Jerry’s opposes it. “Ben & Jerry’s is good at raising issues, and we’re also good at partnering with local organizations that are doing the actual work,” Greenfield said. “Let’s not pretend that Ben & Jerry’s is going to be the experts in terms of swooping in and fixing the problems. That’s not where we can be the most effective.”The campaign marks one of the ice cream barons’ most notable political pushes this year. Last month, the founding duo was arrested outside the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., during a rally against the influx of money in politics. In January, the Vermont-based company released Bernie’s Yearning, a limited-edition ice cream flavor championing Sen. Bernie Sanders’ fight against income inequality. The company denied working with Sanders’ campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, as both Unilever and Ben & Jerry’s have policies against endorsing candidates or partisan issues. But Ben & Jerry’s has a long history of stumping for political causes that align with the hippie flair of its founders' beliefs. Among them were pushes to support LGBTQ rights and marriage equality, environmental justice and the labeling of foods containing genetically modified crops. “The idea that business exists simply to maximize profit and not use its power to be helpful in society is really destructive,” Greenfield said. “The reality is businesses are always very political, it’s just that, normally, they’re political behind the scenes in a covert way.” "

If all goes as planned, VA will renew Ad Hoc's contract for another two years to keep expanding the site.Smith said he feels personally invested in this project's success.“I want the site to be a delightful experience for veterans. I want them to start to have trust in their system and feel like their requests are responded to quickly and accurately,” he said. “We loved working on the beta site. People at the VA were excited. Everyone was excited. It felt good. It felt like this is the right way to build software.”HuffPost reached out to Scott Davis, a program specialist at the VA’s Health Eligibility Center in Atlanta and a past whistleblower on VA mismanagement, to ask what he thought the biggest problem is for veterans trying to access their benefits online. He said that vets applying for health care online often end up filling out multiple applications, and the most commonly used form is a PDF that can’t be downloaded.HuffPost went ahead and asked Smith if he could fix that. He was already on it.“I’m aware that there are PDFs at the end of the rainbow,” Smith said. “We’re going to build forms and services that take a veteran to a meaningful place, not just another dead end.”"

Rather than rattling off the Pledge of Allegiance, they followed New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton in reciting a pledge to ""study hard, to work hard, to obey my parents, to work with my teachers and to always try to do good.""They also took on the title of ""junior New York City police officers for the day.""NYPD officers visited 340 elementary schools across the city to participate in team-building exercises with children. The visits were part of Team Up Tuesday, a new initiative to encourage positive relationships between children and local law enforcement. Dozens of police officers greeted students at P.S. 112 on Tuesday morning, as did Bratton and New York City Education Commissioner Carmen Fariña. The two leaders spent time reading stories to groups of kids, and other students participated in outdoor activities led by uniformed police officers. Bratton told students that teachers and local police officers ""need to work together to keep you safe so you can come to school and learn in a safe environment.""""We need you working together with us, to keep the city safe, to keep your schools safe, to keep your neighborhood safe,"" he added. Bratton told reporters at P.S. 112 that local police officers often visited his school when he was a child, and that it helped inspire him to go into law enforcement. Although there aren't specific plans for future Team Up Tuesdays, Fariña said she expects to see more activities designed to foster strong relationships between students and law enforcement in the city. The public's confidence in police officers has declined following a number of high-profile deaths of black men at the hands of officers. New York City cops have been embroiled in some of these controversies. Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, died in July 2014 after an NYPD officer put him in a chokehold. A grand jury's decision a few month later to not indict the officer sparked protests across the nation. Team Up Tuesday was meant to be a step toward fostering more trust in law enforcement.“Building meaningful community relationships from an early age is critical to ensure that New Yorkers across the city are aware of the many supports available to them,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in April, per The New York Daily News."

After a whirlwind marriage and subsequent divorce (which was put on hold after the former NBA player was hospitalized last year), Kardashian is reportedly still planning on filing again. Kardashian got candid about the couple's split in a new essay for Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner's Lenny Letter. The 31-year-old spoke of her spirituality and how it impacted her decision to end her marriage. ""It was a challenge for me when I decided to get divorced,"" Kardashian wrote. ""At my core, I don’t believe in divorce, but I came to a point in my marriage where I had to make the choice to take care of my own mental and emotional well-being in order to protect myself and my happiness. I am at peace with that decision and do feel like I honored my vows to the very end.""The ""KUWTK"" star has been open about Odom's infidelities throughout their marriage, telling Howard Stern in January that the basketball player cheated on her multiple times. ""I feel that I kept the serious vows I made in front of God with every inch of my heart, which is why I am still honoring them today even though my relationship with my ex-husband is in a different place,"" Kardashian said. ""I believe in caring for my partner — past or present — 'in sickness and in health,' and feel at peace with my relationship with God even after the fact.""To read the rest of Kardashian's Lenny Letter, head here.
