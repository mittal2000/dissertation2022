0,COLLEGE,What the Liberal Arts Did for Me,"Victor M. Feraru, ContributorLaw student and author of the upcoming autobiography 'Victor's...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-the-liberal-arts-di_b_7654426.html,,2015-06-25,2015-06-24-1435158229-6404868-1280pxGuilfordcollegewalkway.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-24-1435158229-6404868-1280pxGuilfordcollegewalkway-thumb.jpg,"Several years ago, driving down Friendly Avenue, in Greensboro, North Carolina, my mother pointed to Guilford College and said, ""You will go there."" Her words hung in the air like a dense fog. Guilford has been compared to a lot of things, like Hogwarts Academy. It is the kind of place where someone who wants to be challenged and changed would want to go. Its grounds are historic and its ties to the Quaker faith are an important part of its heritage. Even though you might be getting an education from an Ivy League educated Ph.D., it is a Quaker custom to call everyone by his or her first name. At the time my mom, who adopted me as an adult, said that I would attend this enchanted private college, I thought she must be joking. I never thought someone like me was meant for a place like that.  Guilford's Walkway to Founders Hall.  Early in life I realized the world is divided into the haves and the have-nots. In my earlier life I fit in the latter. I never resented those who had things; there was no time to worry about that. Raised in multiple, sometimes abusive foster homes, homeless and in legal trouble as a hopeless, misdirected teenager, I was just focused on finding safety for myself and a way to stay alive. Still, like my dream of finding family and love, education was something I was eager to earn. It would take me many years to realize that I was up to the challenges of higher education. Being adopted offered me access to things, such as a roof over my head, and the time and space to nurture learning that would have otherwise been impossible.  I met and corresponded with Dr. Noam Chomsky after reaching out to him for quotes for an article in Guilford's student newspaper. Education is a lot like food, clothing and healthcare. Seeing a doctor, eating a meal and having clothing are a given for some and a struggle to obtain for others. I should know, from a past life of loss and need. I was able to flourish at Guilford. Always liking history and stories, I was eager to write news. I am a natural writer; I have wanted to write since I was a child. It wouldn't be until I spent hours in the office of Dr. Jeff Jeske, Dana Professor of English and the advisor for the century-old student newspaper, The Guilfordian, that I started to learn my craft. After a semester or so, editors said they were noticing a marked difference in my writing. My broken childhood and teenage years left me with only having earned my GED. I bore that in mind on my first day of class at Guilford College. Education was once outside of my reach and now I was entering a place of privilege. However, it was in the classrooms of Guilford that I learned why people who'd grown up like me face the challenges they do. And while the sticker price of an education at the college is a bit high, Guilford caters to those most in financial need and therefore not allowing the door to shut for those who want a college education.   Meeting famed retired Episcopal bishop of New Hampshire, who I later interviewed at Guilford College.Guilford caused me to grow as a person and an academic. Discussions in close-knit classes and having unchallenged notions met with new ideas was a gift I had only thought possible in an imaginary life. Not only did I have a family, but my college also embraced me. Each professor and class I took touched my life, expanded my mind and made me a better student. Guilford was not the kind of place where you could miss a class and not hear about it. Now excellence was expected of me. Guilford's wooded campus, that was once part of the underground railroad, offers less frills and more academic meat than many other schools. Not only are students, faculty and administration interactive, so are most of the distinguished trustees. On more than one occasion, I have been able to turn to Trustee members for advice, to interview or to share concerns. Unlike other places that are filled with bureaucracy, Guilford is an accessible place from the top down.    Me on Graduation DayAs I graduated from the college last year and readied myself for law school, I realized that higher education is in danger everywhere. Not too far away, Sweet Briar College announced it was shutting its doors, before a court ordered, for the time being, that the institution stay open. Faced with lower enrollment and a $3 million deficit, Guilford's new president, Jane Fernandes, has had to make tough decisions about positions within the college. In a recent meeting with Jane, she said that Guilford students make a difference in this world. She is correct. The college also makes a difference in the lives of those who attend. It certainly changed my life for the better, and I will be eternally grateful for all of my experiences there. It turned a once forgotten child into someone educated enough to face the rigors of law school and to face the world in a principled way."

The 21-year-old accused of killing nine people inside a black church in Charleston made his first court appearance, with the relatives of all the victims making tearful statements. (Centralized Bond Hearing Court, of Charleston, S.C. via AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2b78b2500003500374555.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Our nation is struggling to comprehend yet another horrific act of violence. We are searching for answers to understand what prompted a 21-year-old man to brutally murder nine members of the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, after the church had welcomed him into its Bible study group on the evening of June 17. Much of the media coverage has focused on Dylann Roof's white supremacist Facebook posts and racially charged comments made before the shootings -- all of which reveal intense hatred that is hard to imagine in someone so young. If early reports are accurate, Dylann Roof is another kid from another troubled family who fell through the cracks of our society. We know that he struggled with and never finished high school. It appears that he drifted, unemployed, living on his own from the time he was 15 years old. We know he had prior brushes with the law for trespassing and drug use, and it appears that he may have witnessed significant and frequent violence in the house he grew up in with his father and step-mother, who eventually separated in 2008. Dylann Roof's defense team may attempt to use his background as they build their case to defend him, but it is unlikely to be a successful strategy. It does not appear that Dylann Roof was psychotic or delusional at the time of the shootings. It seems that he knew exactly what he was doing, and reports indicate that he has expressed no remorse for his actions. But regardless of whether his background provides an effective legal defense, there are important lessons to learn from his story. Dylann Roof developed into an emotionally troubled young man who found an identity and a distorted sense of purpose in a belief system that fomented hate and glorified violence. And while we may never know the exact combination of factors that formed his character, it is very likely that the neglect and abuse he probably suffered during childhood set the stage for the expression of an ugliness that is difficult for most of us to imagine. Dylann Roof must be held accountable for his actions. And our nation must continue discussions about gun control and race relations. But if our goal is to prevent future acts of violence -- if we hope to build healthier, more tolerant communities -- then we must also ask ourselves a very simple question. How did we fail the 15-year-old boy he once was? He wasn't born a killer and he wasn't born with the type of hatred that would later fuel the murder of six women and three men who happened to be African American. Whether or not we feel sympathy for him because of the depression, anxiety, loneliness, or torment he may have experienced growing up, our failure to pay attention to how he became a killer will prevent us from reaching other kids at risk of following a similar path.We need to recognize this type of hatred for what it is, a sign of severe emotional disturbance. And we need to take more responsibility for those around us who seem to be suffering -- before their pain becomes unbearable and is turned inward against themselves or outward as it seemingly did with Dylann Roof. Think about this for a moment. Does someone who is mentally healthy commit unprovoked, premeditated murder? This type of overwhelming, all-consuming hatred cannot exist within an emotionally healthy human being. Anger is a normal human emotion. And hatred can be an understandable reaction to abuse or trauma or loss. We can all imagine the hatred a victim might feel toward the rapist that attacked her or the rage a soldier might feel toward the insurgent who killed a battle buddy. As we heal through abuse or trauma or loss, we must move beyond hatred or we will most certainly become consumed by it. But if we are a 15-year-old kid living on the streets with little or no supervision, no guidance, and no love . . . if we find drugs and hatred before we find a healthy alternative, it is easy to imagine how hatred can twist our thoughts and shape our actions. Some might accurately point out that not all kids from deprived or harsh backgrounds turn out to be racist or violent. Thankfully, we humans are complex creatures. Some of us have the capacity to overcome obstacles and find opportunities. But capacity doesn't equate with certainty, and not every kid has the right combination of internal resources and good luck that allow someone to overcome a lousy roll of the environmental, familial, or genetic dice. Others might say that it isn't our responsibility to look out for, provide assistance to, or care about the kids who go astray or have severe emotional problems or who are abused and neglected. Ironically, had Dylann Roof wandered into the Emanuel AME church feeling scared and alone, the men and women he found there would have most certainly offered support, concern, and care. They would have accepted the responsibility for a lost soul and they would have responded to his suffering. As we mourn the loss of those who died and we look for answers and hope for solutions, we have an opportunity, and perhaps an obligation. Future tragedies can be prevented if we pay attention to the signs of emotional suffering--in ourselves and those we love--and, if we take responsibility for reaching out to those in need, to those who are falling through the cracks. Children are not born hating themselves or others. It is our collective responsibility to give them other options.

I ordered my usual double shot of espresso, iced. As I waited at the end of the bar I watched the barista take the lid off of my cup. While resting her hand on the counter she inadvertently put the lid face down in a pile of crumbs only to place it back on my cup. I quickly explained to her that I couldn't drink the coffee and got in to the, ""I have celiac disease, I promise I'm not being picky, I hate to ask you to make it again,"" conversation that so many of us dread. Thankfully this woman understood and very kindly agreed to make me a new cup of coffee. But still, the incident got me thinking. How many other times has something like this happened? What if I just didn't notice before? How many times could this happen again?This is what is so difficult about being gluten-free, the lack of industry knowledge about celiac disease and what it means for a product to really be gluten-free. In my coffee example, it is not the product that is the problem; instead, it was the means of preparation. Another challenge is that it can sometimes be hard to know when you've been glutened. More often than not I have a very violent reaction when I am glutened. However, there are times where I just feel incredibly drained or ""out of it,"" and the signs aren't necessarily as apparent.Ever since the coffee incident I have had countless similar experiences. Last night for example, as I browsed the shelves at my local Whole Foods looking for flax seeds to put in my morning smoothie, I was shocked to find the gluten-free flax nestled in between active wheat gluten and sitting under shelves of flour. The bags of flour were completely dusted with what I can only assume is wheat flour, which sprinkled down onto the gluten-free products, thus rendering the gluten-free products sharing the same space NOT gluten-free after all. I was completely disheartened by this. If Whole Foods isn't safe, then what is? I know that sounds silly, but really, how many other stores, shops, restaurants out there are not educated about what it means to be gluten-free? And I am not talking about the fad of being gluten-free, but to be gluten free because of a medical necessity. And let me take this moment to say that if you are gluten free by choice, good for you! I support you 100 percent. I personally think that no one should consume gluten. However, I hope you can understand that while your choice has created much awareness, and for that I thank you, it also can make the lives of people with celiac disease more dangerous. We need to have training programs, really in-depth programs, to educate individuals working in the food and beverage industry about what it really means to be gluten-free. Not just that the product itself is, but that the shelves and their hands, gloves, tools, and workstations are completely gluten-free as well. Hopefully, more in depth education will rectify these issues. This type of training is critical in a world where diagnosis rates are rising, and many people do not even know they have celiac disease. And thanks to a lot of hard work the celiac disease diagnosis rate may reach 50-60 percent by 2019. So if you are reading this and you are a restaurant or grocery store owner, staff member, or anyone else who may need to deepen your understanding of gluten free procedures; or if you want to broaden your knowledge for your clients and customers with celiac disease, please feel free to contact me at hannah.crane@nyu.edu. I would be more than happy to provide you with an in depth awareness training straight from the mouth of a consumer with celiac disease."

On Saturday the rapper decided to share his thoughts on white supremacy in the wake of the Charleston Shooting. The church massacre has left many speculating about the role white supremacy played in inciting such an act of terror. In an open letter posted on Instagram, Fiasco brilliantly broke down how misguided the concept of a ""supreme"" race is in the first place.""White Supremacy is a lie white regularists tell to themselves in hopes that they can get a one way ticket to the top and hope we other colors overhear it,"" Fiasco wrote. ""Here's the bad news, ain't no top. Here's the good news though, ain't no bottom neither!"" Fiasco argued that no one race has contributed more to the world than any other. When you strip away the privilege that whiteness bestows, what you are left with is what Fiasco calls ""white regularity.""""There is nothing about [white people] biologically or physically that denotes an innate mode of supremacy,"" he writes. ""And to be diplomatic there is nothing about you that denotes innate inferiority as well...You are regular. White Regularity is congruent to all other forms of regularity i.e. Black, Brown, Etc etc. But in regularity there is room for differences and this is where White Regularity shines!"" He goes on to point out just how interconnected different identity groups are when it comes to invention, entrepreneurship, recording history -- and even upholding the concept of white supremacy. ""White Supremacy has to validate it's (sic) own identity based solely on its relationship to other races!,"" he writes. ""I mean now that's what I would call joined at the hip. Without us there is no white supremacy because there would be nothing to be supreme over!""Read Fiasco's comments in full, below: "

But a white man, in a church, where he was trusted to sit with a small group of worshippers who were opening their hearts to God? It pushes us close to the edge. Just how close? I conducted my own opinion survey by listening to some of my black friends talk.An usher at a local church told me that upon seeing an unknown white man in the service, he will now inquire, ""Is everything all right?"" He went on to say, ""White people don't just appear in an all black church!"". He got universal agreement from the older men in the mix. ""I don't trust 'em."" Somebody else said, ""I work with 'em, but it wouldn't have happened like that in the '60s."" ""I don't care how nice they are. They're still white.""My 17-year-old son was taken aback. He came home and told his mother, ""Some men were talking crazy."" To him, it's not right to make judgments based on race. He accepts integration on good faith; his mind set is one that is open to all people, accepting all kinds of differences.Growing up under Jim Crow, I wasn't surprised at any of these reactions. Even though I didn't agree with my friends' conclusions, was I prepared to call their comments ""crazy""? Given the path upon which this country seems to have taken, they're not at all crazy.It's not crazy to wonder whether a black man who had shot nine white people would have been afforded the same kind of treatment received by their killer, Dylann Roof. Would he have been arrested without a gunshot fired? Would he even still be alive? Would a black man be given a bulletproof vest for his safe passage from place to place and given the chance to listen in court to expressions of concern about the impact of this incident on his (the murderer's) family from the arraigning judge? It was as if the judge thought, The young man comes from such a nice family. I wonder what happened to make that boy go crazy like that?Sympathy, concern, due process and denial. This is where we see the cover provided for racism in America through the use of the institutional protective shield, the over-concern for due process and even earlier denial by conservative media pundits and politicians that the murders were motivated by race. In situations like these, it's always an individual act, somebody's loose screw, and never an examination of the institutions that created him and so many other racist policies and practices. The Southern Poverty Law Center said of Dylann Roof:On his website, Roof left a 2,000-word manifesto in which he identifies himself as a white nationalist and says he was ""truly awakened"" to his beliefs after reading the online propaganda of the Council of Conservative Citizens, a notorious, racist hate group....Incidents like the killing at Emanuel AME Church just release all the bigotry and hate stored up by these people over the years. Learned responses to anything ""black."" Stored, protected and promoted by some (not all) members of the media, politicians and law enforcement.So, what does it mean for black folks, the ones in my unofficial survey, and others? Some family members of the deceased and other members of Emanuel AME have forgiven, and their acts of forgiveness trumpeted across the world by the American media. Pastors in Newark called a press conference and some talked about increasing security. Many in the black community smolder with anger and a desire for revenge. They may never find relief. They cannot prevail in a race war, and notions of revenge and hatred will only wreak havoc upon their hearts and minds and spirit. But Rev. M. William Howard, pastor of my home church, Bethany Baptist in Newark NJ, preached about resolution through strength. He surprised many of us on Father's Day with a masterful sermon, based upon Old Testament action, and not upon New Testament forgiveness. ""We need Strength, based upon the ability to survive and overcome.""We all know the story of David and Goliath. Little David, against the most well-armed and boastful giant of the day, armed only with five smooth stones and a slingshot, toppled the giant with one well-placed blow by his stone to the giant's massive head. He routed the enemy, and put to rest the naysayers who said it couldn't be done.  Without talking about forgiveness, the message was clear: forgiveness is an individual act, but collectively, we need to learn how to be strong like David. But how do we, as a people, get strength like that? In closing, Rev. Howard proclaimed, ""We have to get our dignity back!"". To me, the prescription is prophetic. Dignity comes from positive self-identity. This means we must acknowledge that we are ""black and proud."" We have to stop relying upon the false premises and promises of ""post-racial America."" We must once again clearly articulate our interests as a people and hold our leaders accountable for promoting these interests. We must reclaim those aspects of our culture which have historically made us strong, like our music and our stories of resistance; and renounce those aspects that divert us from the truth and divide us.As we do these things, we can gladly welcome the support of white people and all others who are willing to accept us for who we are. And like David, become exponentially strong enough to take on Goliath.

Creatively, they signify so much to me: knitting, weaving, sewing. I love the feel of threads and strings and I love using my hands to work with strands of color.In my best moments, I follow threads. Sometimes when I'm sitting for meditation, I feel like I'm following the thread of a plume of incense smoke. When I lose direction in a town that's not yet familiar, it seems more like the breeze that carries the thread.Yesterday, while I was connecting with a friend online, I felt a blush of warmth and a pull at my sternum, like a thread gently tugged. Yet another one of those quiet, easily passed over moments that Rumi spoke of when he wrote: These sensations communicate a kind of knowing to me, but that may have been the first time I saw that communication as a form of love itself. This thread is the closest I can come to describing the feeling of intuition. Quiet, deep, strong... but somehow also easily torn by words, thoughts, expectations.I have never been shy to use words. My parents recount stories of meetings with elementary school teachers: ""Susan is very bright, but she talks too much."" Anyone who has known me for any length of time will not be surprised by that statement. I love words and I labor over them, choosing carefully the ones I use.but in silence the secret speaksWhen I relax enough to take the time to be in silence, that thread is never very elusive. It waits there, just below the surface, patiently waiting for me to call it.There are so many different forms of silence. Meditation is one, but simple rest is, too. Taking the time to unplug, unjudge and undo makes space for that thread to be rediscovered and reconnected. Sometimes I lose that thread for days (or even weeks) at a time. In those cases, it can take some time to reinforce the thread before it comes so quickly at my call. At other times, like in conversation with my friend, the thread tugs at me to remind me to pay attention to something not conveyed on the inter-webs. (But, then the moment might have been only made possible with the assistance of the web and its own threads.)I wrote a week or so ago a piece about ""deepening the love groove."" I shared an image I encountered in hospice work of a human being as a record with the history of one's experiences etched as grooves on the surface. How making choices more in line with the ""love groove"" feels like a choice to move toward more freedom. These threads are the visceral, human indicators of the direction in which more love lies.Love is a small word. It's over-used, and, frankly, who the heck knows what it means anymore? Sometimes the word itself can be used as the one which ""tear[s] the thread."" But when I use it, it is only because it is the best approximation I can muster for a feeling of warm, spreading relaxation and expansion.Sometimes I like to think about the way we use words in terms of cooking. When cooking, I try to sense how to prepare my ingredients in the way which will be most comfortably (and pleasurably) digested. With my words, I aim to do the same. (With varying degrees of success; I still sometimes overfeed my guests or add a bit too much spice to a dish.) Just as with dinner, I work to make my words more simple, straightforward, without too many ingredients and made with love. A surprising amount can be communicated in fewer words. And the rest? Maybe it's not really communicate-able, at least in words."

AFP PHOTO/ANDREW PATRON (Photo credit should read Andrew PATRON/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb901d12100005002c971e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Friday morning, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush continued to emphasize his push for a more inclusive Republican Party in a much anticipated speech at the annual National Urban League Conference.Bush has centered his presidential campaign around his efforts to emphasize upward mobility, particularly in minority communities. But Bush’s relationship with the African-American community in Florida during his governorship was rocky, particularly as it related to the botched felon “voter purge” that took place under his tenure preceding the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. In light of Bush’s speech this morning, we are reposting our story from last month on that complicated episode. Read it below.MIAMI –- Something was noticeably different about the crowd packed inside a gymnasium at Miami Dade College’s Kendall campus last week to welcome Jeb Bush into the ranks of the announced 2016 Republican presidential candidates.  In a vivid departure from the nearly all-white audiences that typically turn out to greet GOP White House contenders, Bush’s racially and ethnically diverse supporters mirrored the demographics of this multicultural city.The scene was meant to emphasize a core Bush strength, if not send a message to fellow Republicans, that an inclusive and aspirational brand of politics offers the GOP an opportunity to re-engage with minority voters, including African-Americans, who long ago abandoned the party of Lincoln en masse.   Even some Democratic operatives acknowledge privately that Bush -- a fluent Spanish speaker with a Mexican-born wife -- has a biography and demeanor that could chip away at the coalition that twice propelled Barack Obama to the White House.  Bush’s critics in Florida, however, scoff.  As the 2016 campaign heats up, an episode from his tenure as Florida governor reveals why Bush's image as a “uniter, not a divider,” as his older brother used to put it, may not stand up. The state's deeply flawed purge of felons from its voting rolls in advance of the 2000 presidential election remains a scar that still has not healed for many in the state.“I’ll never the forget people that came up to me and said, ‘You let them steal our votes,’” Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.), who became state's first African-American elected to Congress since Reconstruction when she won her seat in 1992, told The Huffington Post. “So many people were just wiped off the rolls -- people who’d been voting for years and years. You had the obligation to prove that you weren’t a felon.”The felon purge wrongfully denied thousands of legitimate voters the ability to participate in a presidential election pitting Republican George W. Bush against Democrat Al Gore. Ultimately, a few hundred Florida ballots would determine the presidency, and with it, the nation’s path for the next eight years and, really, well beyond.  Though it received little notice outside of Florida in the election’s immediate aftermath, as hanging chads and butterfly ballots took center stage during the recount, the purge remains for many the most egregious example of voter disenfranchisement that took place during the 2000 presidential election, which was ultimately decided by a Supreme Court ruling.  “The purge was right out of one of these playbooks in how you diminish minority turnout -- there was absolutely no justification for it,” said Dan Gelber, a former Democratic state legislator and a longtime Bush nemesis. “It was almost a purposeful crashing of a car. They knew it was irresponsible and about something incredibly important, and they went forward knowing that the only mistakes were going to benefit them.”  Florida has banned convicted felons from participating in elections since 1868. But it wasn’t until 1998 -- the year before Bush took office -- that state legislators passed a law intended to clean up the voter rolls after a Miami mayoral election was overturned amid widespread cases of absentee ballot fraud.   The secretary of state’s office subsequently awarded Database Technologies Inc., or DBT, a $4 million contract to carry out the effort to ensure that felons, deceased voters, and non-residents would be blocked from participating in the 2000 election.  It would not be an easy task.  Since Florida did not track its voters by Social Security number, the company was instructed to engage in a subjective process that attempted to match felon names and dates of birth with voter records, allowing for “ near matches” that were close, but not exact.  After Jeb Bush took office in 1999, this process continued. In the months leading up to the 2000 presidential election, local election supervisors began receiving lists from state officials of people DBT had identified as convicted felons and thus needed to be eliminated from the voting rolls.  It became immediately clear that the effort was generating a slew of false positives. Voters in good standing, who happened to share names with convicted felons, but had never been in trouble with the law, were being taken off the voting rolls.  But election officials in Tallahassee -- led by Secretary of State Katherine Harris, who would later gain infamy over her controversial handling of the election recount -- declined to make the process more transparent and uniform.   Charges that the purge was politically motivated grew louder when it was revealed that the man responsible for determining the parameters for voter removal was Emmett “Bucky” Mitchell IV -- a Division of Election attorney who went on to become general counsel for the Florida Republican Party.  In early 1999, DBT product manager Marlene Thorogood warned Mitchell of false positives generated by the guidelines that he had set. But in an email Mitchell sent in March of that year, he instructed Thorogood not to concern herself with wrongly eliminating non-felons from the voter rolls. It was better to purge too many people than too few, in Mitchell’s estimation.  ""Obviously, we want to capture more names that possibly aren't matches and let the [county elections] supervisors make a final determination rather than exclude certain matches altogether,"" Mitchell wrote.  This decree from Tallahassee having been made clear, county-level election officials began receiving lists of voters they were told to remove from their rolls in the months leading up to an Election Day that would prove to be among the most memorable in American history. The local officials’ responses to this instruction varied. Some tossed out the lists altogether. Others used their discretion to try to correct them. Some used the lists with full knowledge that they were defective.  Many county officials decided to mail certified letters notifying people on the lists that the Department of Law Enforcement had identified them as felons and that they would need to provide evidence to challenge that conclusion or face permanent removal from the voter rolls. In short, voters who had been swept up in the net had to prove their innocence.  Some Floridians who learned that they had been wrongfully removed from the voting rolls attempted to bring the matter directly to the governor.   In a message sent on Aug. 28, 2000, to jeb@myflorida.com -- one of the governor's official email addresses -- a man named Gene Gay noted that he had recently received a letter indicating that he had lost his right to vote.  “I have search all weekend for a site to access that type of records with no success,” Gay wrote. “Where do U go online to get that sort of information without paying these scalpers prices … This is a lot of stuff, for a person whom knows, he has NOT been convicted of any felony. This is very important to me please respond asap.”  In another email to an official gubernatorial account (flagov@myflorida.com), sent on the Wednesday before Election Day, a man named John Browne expressed intense frustration to Bush in a 760-word note about a brother, who Browne said had stolen his identity repeatedly over the previous decade. This traumatic experience, Browne explained, had led to an erroneous determination from Martin County that he was a convicted felon. Browne wrote:  “I have spent an enormous amount of time dealing with the local county Sheriff’s offices, the State Attorney’s Office, the Social Security Administration, private attorneys and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Not one person to date has told me what I can do to protect myself or how to file charges against this person or anyone else using my personal information ... Mr. Bush, I have a family to provide for and I have worked very hard to get to where I am today. This continued abuse of my records is seriously impacting on my ability to continue a normal and productive life. I also think the fact that I am being denied the right to vote is a violation of my civil rights. I would hope that you take this situation very seriously and offer some measure of relief.”It's unclear whether Bush read either email. As governor, he primarily used the email address Jeb@Jeb.org, but also had access to several other state email accounts, including the two in question. A campaign aide told The Huffington Post that these accounts were primarily used by the governor’s Office of Citizen Services and that Bush himself did not see most of the incoming messages sent there, unless they were forwarded to his Jeb.org account.(Coincidentally, on the same day that Gene Gay sent his email to Bush, likely 2016 rival Scott Walker -- then a Wisconsin state legislator -- sent Bush a request via jeb@myflorida.com for information on a new Florida law that prohibited possession of vehicle airbags that lacked identification stickers.)  Estimates vary on just how many non-felons in Florida were wrongly denied the right to vote on Election Day, but the total was at least 1,100, according to a 2001 Palm Beach Post analysis, and may have been much higher.   Following the election recount, in which he officially recused himself, Jeb Bush sought to distance himself from the botched purge, arguing that as governor, he was not charged with administering the election.  A post-election investigation by the U.S. Commission On Civil Rights, however, in which Bush was subpoenaed, was dubious about this reasoning, noting that the actions Bush took immediately after the 2000 election demonstrated that he did, in fact, have the ability to act on voting-related matters.   “Florida’s governor insisted that he had no specific role in election operations and pointed to his secretary of state as the responsible official,” the commission wrote in its report. “After the election, however, the governor exercised leadership and responsibility in electoral matters in the commendable action of appointing a task force to make recommendations to fix the problems that occurred.""  The report found a “strong basis” for determining that violations of the 1965 Voting Rights Act had occurred during the election in Florida. While it did not find that “the highest officials of the state conspired to disenfranchise voters,” the report singled out Bush and Harris, saying their “overall lack of leadership in protecting voting rights was largely responsible for the broad array of problems in Florida during the 2000 election.”“The state’s highest officials responsible for ensuring efficiency, uniformity, and fairness in the election failed to fulfill their responsibilities and were subsequently unwilling to take responsibility,” the report said.   African-Americans were nearly 10 times more likely than white voters to have their ballots discounted in Florida, the report found, and it singled out for criticism the felon voter purge’s “sloppy and irresponsible” implementation.“The governor, the secretary of state, or the director of the Division of Elections should have provided clear instructions to their subordinates on list maintenance strategies that would protect eligible voters from being erroneously purged from the voter registration rolls,” the report said.  Aides to Jeb Bush at the time criticized the report by the Commission On Civil Rights, controlled by a Democratic majority, as “biased” and “sloppy” in its own right -- charges that did nothing to quell widespread outrage, particularly among African-Americans, in Florida.  But any lingering bad feelings about Bush were not apparent at his presidential campaign announcement last week, when R.B. Holmes, Jr. -- an African-American minister from Tallahassee -- delivered impassioned praise of the former governor in introducing him on stage.  In an interview with The Huffington Post, Holmes noted that he appreciated Bush’s efforts to appoint more African-Americans to judgeships in Florida when he was governor.   “Jeb Bush is a very compassionate person,” Holmes said. “I respect his core values. I respect that he married a minority, and he did that back in the day. Think of how unpopular that was for a Bush of his status to go to Mexico and find a bride.”Holmes is far from the only African-American in Florida who retains positive feelings toward Bush. After famously saying during his failed 1994 gubernatorial run that he would do “probably nothing” to help blacks, Bush changed his tone dramatically when it came to engaging in matters of race and identity during his 1998 campaign. That year, he ended up earning the support of 61 percent of Hispanics and 14 percent of African-Americans -- impressive numbers for a Republican.  Even though he didn’t do as well with either group during his successful 2002 re-election bid, Bush’s reputation as a bridge-builder who actively concerned himself with lifting up minority communities -- boosted, in part, by his high-profile push for expanded educational opportunities -- remains a central tenet of his political identity.   Mac Stipanovich, a Florida Republican lobbyist who advised Harris throughout the 2000 recount, was blunt in arguing that Bush had not erred in failing to provide any oversight of the botched felon purge.   “Any time you attempt to pare the voting rolls in Florida, regardless of what the reason is, you are anti-democratic with a small-D and probably racist,” Stipanovich said by way of discounting those accusations.   But criticism of how Bush and members of his administration handled the purge became even louder four years later, when he and other Florida officials failed to correct the problems that arose during the previous presidential election year and, in fact, may have made it worse.  The 2004 iteration of the felon voter purge -- this time carried out by the Department of Elections itself -- ended with a whimper when a peculiar (some would say ""fishy"") anomaly was discovered the summer before Bush’s brother stood for re-election.  That year’s list of 48,000 felons who were to be purged from the voting rolls contained more than 22,000 African-Americans' names, but just 61 Hispanics. (In Florida, Hispanic communities tend to be more Republican-leaning than they are nationally.)  Bush administration officials denied there was any partisan motivation in the discrepancy, calling it “unintentional.” But as Democrats scoffed and public pressure mounted, Florida officials ended up scrapping the list entirely.Some 15 years later, Jeb Bush, now running his own presidential campaign, has treated the Florida voting purge as a foreign object -- an episode that had little if nothing to do with him.   Asked during a press conference during a campaign swing through Iowa last week whether he believes that African-Americans were disproportionately affected by those efforts, he waffled a bit before rephrasing the question in his own manner.   “I don’t think so,” he said. “I don’t think there was any -- no, if you’re going to say, ‘Did the Florida Department of Law Enforcement target African-Americans?’ No.”  Meanwhile, Florida remains one of just three states where all convicted felons automatically lose their voting rights and must petition the governor and a clemency board in an arduous process in order to try to get them restored.  In 2007, Gov. Charlie Crist, then a Republican, initiated a change in the clemency policy, which made it so that most convicted felons in Florida would automatically have their voting rights restored after the state ensured that they had paid restitution to victims.Those new guidelines were then rolled back by Gov. Rick Scott (R) shortly after he took office in 2011.  According to a 2012 study by The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit group advocating for judicial sentencing reform, Florida continues to have the highest rate of African-American disenfranchisement in the country with 23 percent of the adult African-American population in the state barred from voting.  “I think that the purge system brought a real apartheid type of politics that was going on in Florida,” said former Democratic state Rep. Tony Hill. “Look at the people who were purged -- they were African-American. They just discounted our votes without any recourse.”"
7,GOOD NEWS,Sweden Blood Bank Texts Donors To Notify Them Whenever Their Blood Helps Save A Life,Cameron Keady,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sweden-blood-donors-text-message_n_7657156.html,,2015-06-25,"In this Tuesday, April 26, 2011 photo a man voluntary donates blood at the National Center for Hematology and Transfusion in Sofia. It's a grim reality for patients and families in Bulgaria, a struggling EU nation where donors are troublingly scarce, hospitals are strapped for funds and blood traders _ mainly Gypsy, or Roma, men _ are thriving. Trading in blood and blood products is illegal in Bulgaria, punishable by a fine of up to euro5,000 ($7,100). But lawyers say it's difficult to prove an illegal blood transaction because that requires an official complaint lodged by the person who pays the donor _ and families are so desperate they consider the black market blood donors lifesavers. (AP Photo/Valentina Petrova)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5be38fe22400004c0299af06.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Though technology may seem like a lifeline for many people today, for Sweden’s blood bank, it is exactly that. Sweden’s blood service notifies donors via text message whenever their blood is used, The Independent reports. The initiative aims to raise awareness for the need for blood donation, which has recently been on the decline. “We are constantly trying to develop ways to express [donors'] importance,” Karolina Blom Wilberg, a communications manager at the Stockholm blood service, told the news outlet. “We want to give them feedback on their effort, and we find this is a good way to do that.”The program started in Stockholm three years ago but has recently gained traction after a positive response, according to the Independent. Donors are also able to share news of their contribution on social media channels. “We get a lot of visibility in social media and traditional media thanks to the SMS,” Blom Wilberg said. “But above all we believe it makes our donors come back to us, and donate again.”Because of advancements in medicine, fewer blood transfusions have been needed in recent years, the New York Times reported. But blood donations are still in demand, with each pint of blood helping save up to three lives, according to the Red Cross. Sweden’s text message initiative may just keep these numbers up. In 2013, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine observed the effects of social media on organ donation with a study: “The Facebook Effect: Social Media Dramatically Boosts Organ Donor Registration.” On the day the study began, 57,451 Facebook users shared their organ donor status on their personal profiles. The first day of the program, there were 13,012 new online donor registrations, the study reported. “If we can harness that excitement in the long term, then we can really start to move the needle on the big picture,” said study leader Andrew M. Cameron, an associate professor of surgery at the university. “The need for donor organs vastly outpaces the available supply and this could be a way to change that equation.” Like Us On Facebook   Follow Us On Twitter"
8,FIFTY,Strong Dollar Makes This Colonial Caribbean Haven A Bargain,"Kathleen Peddicord, ContributorPublisher, Live and Invest Overseas",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/retire-to-colombia_b_7603692.html,"Founded by the Spanish in 1533, Cartagena grew quickly to become a thriving seaport. At one time it was second only to Mexico City in commercial importance in the Western Hemisphere. Today Colombia's best-known city on the Caribbean is also an appealing coastal retirement option.",2015-06-24,2015-06-17-1434551055-2156063-CartagenaColombia.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-17-1434551055-2156063-CartagenaColombia-thumb.jpg,"Founded by the Spanish in 1533, Cartagena grew quickly to become a thriving seaport. At one time it was second only to Mexico City in commercial importance in the Western Hemisphere. Today Colombia's best-known city on the Caribbean is also an appealing coastal retirement option.Cartagena is one of the world's few remaining walled cities. Its is a massive wall indeed, more than 40 feet wide, wide enough to drive two pickup trucks abreast on top, and almost 7 miles long. Within that wall is one of the finest colonial centers in the Americas that is right now a bargain. This UNESCO World Heritage Site had grown expensive in recent years. Today it's far more affordable thanks to the dollar's current strength against the Colombian peso. The dollar buys 2,534 pesos as of this writing, meaning property prices in Cartagena have rolled back to levels not seen in six years.The beautifully preserved historic center with its cobblestoned streets and alleyways, parks, and hole-in-the-wall restaurants and cafes is what puts Cartagena on the map for most people. However, for expats and property investors, it's only part of the appeal. Cartagena also offers more than 12 miles of Caribbean beaches outside the historic center, and this is the area that's really on the move. If Cartagena appeals to you, the first thing you need to decide is whether you're interested in the historic city or the beach areas, which are a few minutes away by cab. If you prefer the colonial city, then you've got another choice: inside or outside the wall. Within the wall, you'll find Centro and San Diego, the colonial sectors that are almost 100 percent restored and form the heart of Cartagena's tourist industry. These areas are safe and attractive, and the Cartagena market's most expensive sectors. Of the two, San Diego is more homey, less touristy, and a better place for expat living.Outside the wall -- but still in the historic district -- is Getsemaní. Real estate in this neighborhood is less expensive but not cheap. Ten years ago, this area was run-down and dangerous. You had to be careful during the day, and no one with sense wandered around here at night. Today even The New York Times travel section is talking about Getsemaní, so its days as an undiscovered bargain are over. Within easy walking distance of Centro and San Diego, it's become trendy, with bars, boutique hotels, and popular night spots. It's also become relatively safe. Of course, now it's also more expensive, though real estate in most of Getsemaní is about half the price of properties inside the wall.Among the beach areas, the most popular are El Laguito, Bocagrande, and Castillogrande, all within walking distance of one another and a short cab ride from the historic district.El Laguito is the most bustling beachside tourist destination, with an attractive area of cafes and restaurants. It's the most popular area for expats. The beaches are busy with vendors selling everything from tablecloths to cold drinks and cigars. Women prowl the beach with bottles of lotion offering massages to both male and female beachgoers, while the occasional call girl strolls the sands looking for clients. The best beach home buys are in El Laguito, where properties tend to be smaller and to perform better as rentals. Castillogrande is a high-end residential area with quiet, peaceful beaches and few tourists. The tranquil, tree-lined streets are well-kept and lined with attractive homes and high-end apartments. Unlike El Laguito, apartments here tend to be large (more than 2,500 square feet) and are more apt for year-round living or luxury part-year living.Spanning the short distance between the ocean and the bay, Bocagrande is a cross between El Laguito and Castillogrande. Its ocean side is a quieter version of El Laguito, while the bay side looks and feels like Castillogrande. At current exchange rates, it's possible to own an ocean-view apartment in Laguito or Bocagrande, for example, for as little as $150,000 or less. You could buy a new, high-end, and well-finished water-view apartment in Castillogrande for as little as $200,000; $250,000 is a more reasonable budget.The two biggest downsides to Cartagena are the weather (it's hot) and the tourist annoyances -- the ever-present vendors trying to sell you something, the scamming moneychangers, and, at times, the volume of tourists themselves. Pay attention to where the tourists congregate in greatest numbers when considering options for where to base yourself. Some neighborhoods are definitely less comfortable in this regard than others, and these annoyances are generally worst in Centro, on the bay side of Bocagrande, and on the beach at El Laguito. They're less notable in San Diego, Getsemaní, and the off-beach areas of El Laguito, and they're almost nonexistent on the bay side of Bocagrande and in Castillogrande.Related Articles:Retirement Lifestyle Options In Cartagena, ColombiaMaking A Plan For Living, Retiring, Or Investing In ColombiaColombia Is The World's Next Top Lifestyle And Retirement HavenEarlier on Huff/Post50:"

Make it precious and near to Thee through Thy bounty and bestowal.(Image: Baha'i House of Worship in Wilmette, IL on the 4th of July)Abdu'l-Baha also said the following in 1912, some time before the League of Nations and United Nations were established:May this American Democracy be the first nation to establish the foundation of international agreement. May it be the first nation to proclaim the unity of mankind. May it be the first to unfurl the Standard of the Most Great Peace ... The American nation is equipped and empowered to accomplish that which will adorn the pages of history, to become the envy of the world, and be blest in both the East and the West ... the American continent gives signs and evidences of very great advancement. Its future is even more promising, for its influence and illumination are far-reaching. It will lead all nations spiritually. Again Abdu'l-Baha said:America has become renowned for her discoveries, inventions and artistic skill, famous for equity of government and stupendous undertakings; now may she also become noted and celebrated as the herald and messenger of universal peace. Let this be her mission and undertaking, and may this blessed impetus spread to all countries.The first decade and a half of the 21st century have been admittedly difficult for the US and many countries in a number of ways. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Baha'i Faith from 1921 to 1957, anticipated a long path with many potential setbacks along the way and challenges to be overcome. Some examples of these challenges include racial prejudice, which he said had ""bitten into the fiber and attacked the whole social structure of American society"", and excessive materialism, which he described as ""cancerous"" and ""undermining the fabric of human society."" His vision of the ultimate destiny of America, however, is dazzling.This is from a letter he wrote in December 1938, just before World War II broke out:Delays must inevitably arise, setbacks must be suffered, in the course of that country's evolution towards its ultimate destiny. Nothing, however, can alter eventually that course ordained for it ... such an evolution must persist until such time when that nation will, through the active and decisive part it will have played in the organization and peaceful settlement of the affairs of mankind, have attained the plentitude of its powers and functions as an outstanding member, and component part, of a federated world.And again in 1947 Shoghi Effendi wrote: however severe the storms that may buffet it in the days to come in either hemisphere .... that great republic ... will continue to evolve, undivided and undefeatable, until the sum total of its contributions to the birth, the rise and fruition of that world civilization, the child of the Most Great Peace ... will have been made and its last task discharged.In celebrating the anniversary of the birth of this nation, may the perspectives contained in these passages offer our festivities an added dimension. Please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments below, and Happy Fourth!"

Affectionately known as Cic', this bachelor uncle seems to have lived in the background of other people's lives. Even the pictures of Cic' in old age that I found among my own grandfather's (his brother) papers are faded and overexposed, their physical condition seemingly recreating the fog that surrounds Cic's life. We know that he spent most of his life caring for others: animals on the ranch, his mother in her old age, and his brother's grandchildren in his own later years. They remembered Cic giving them treats of 'sugar sandwiches', and knew him as well as anyone could, yet they didn't know if he had an education, if he had friends, even what he did during the day. He is remembered simply as 'always there. Good to us.' Though always around, Cic' somehow remained unknown. When he died, Cic' left only one record behind: a small cigarette tin of photos. Inside, along with a child's glass marble and a few family pictures, were snapshots of numerous men, including one of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer I call the 'sultry Mountie'. The 'Sultry Mountie' (Cecil Bengry Collection)Unlike every other photo in the tin box, the picture of the Mountie included no information -- no caption, no name, no date. He simply stands there, anonymous, leaning casually against a wooden rail with hips thrust forward, looking confidently and directly at the camera. Posing for effect, he invites observation and perhaps objectification. I struggled to understand this image and the homosocial collection of photos with which it came. The tin of photos inspired me to organize, with Amy Tooth Murphy, workshops on what we called 'Queer Inheritances' at the London Metropolitan Archives in December 2014. We wondered: How do we discern a queer life from incomplete personal effects whose existence and content are often mediated by other family members? How do we, as queer inheritors, navigate lives lived before many could proclaim to be 'out and proud'? Ultimately, I wondered, was Cecil queer? Cecil Bengry near the Bengry homestead, Alberta, Canada, no date (Oswald Bengry Collection)Cecil Bengry was born in 1905 and raised in the foothills of Canada's Rocky Mountains. According to family stories, he worked on the family ranch, aiding his parents. And when they moved into town in old age, leaving the family homestead to his brother Joe, Cic appears to have followed them. After his father died, he cared for his ailing mother, finally joining Joe's family in British Columbia by the time of their mother's death in 1954. Living with Joe, and by now nearly 50 himself, Cic' was his brother's companion, 'chief cook and bottle washer', and helped to care for Joe's grandchildren. He lived simply, remembers one of those children: 'His room was upstairs. A window. Neat and tidy. A simple but nice armoire for his clothes. A red child-sized chair beside his bed. An ashtray, brown seashell and an iron dog sat upon it.'(L-R) Joe Bengry (brother), Selina Bengry (mother), Violet Lukenbill (sister), Cecil Bengry, Selina's 82nd and final birthday, 1953. (Oswald Bengry Collection)Cic' died in 1971 and Joe inherited his meagre possessions. (Joe lived another 20 years, and I remember meeting him when he was nearly 100.) 'Old Joe' was a meticulous hoarder of family and local history who saved everything: papers, diaries, artefacts, notes, recipes, slips, books, dirty stories from 1912, even a prophylactic from WWII. An incredibly self-aware curator of his own life history, Joe labeled, relabeled, corrected and annotated family photos. Nothing passed through Joe's hands unmediated. When Cic' died, Joe incorporated his brother's possessions into his own archive, and it is through these that we gain some sense of Cic's life and perhaps what was important to him. Joe gave that small cigarette tin a simple label: 'Cic's photos'. It later passed to my cousin, being the oldest son of the oldest son of the oldest son. (The Bengrys are rather fond of primogeniture!) Being the youngest son of the oldest son of a middle son, I've fared less luckily in acquiring family treasures, but my cousin kindly gifted Cic's cigarette tin to me. Amid a couple family and childhood photos including one of Cic' with his brother Ernest, who died aged 18 in 1929, other photos in Cic's collection require more scrutiny. The remainder comprises a collection of men, including the sultry RCMP Officer. Several photos show two men in particular and were originally labelled with a fountain pen in a careful hand (Cic's?): 'They two Villains Woodruff & Bert'. Joe has corrected the label much later using a ball point pen and his scratchy hand to include a note of a very different tone: 'Old friends and neighbors of mother Bengry & family, Cardston'. Cic also saved and labelled pictures of local male school teachers, likewise 'corrected' by Joe, who were active in rural southern Alberta and died in the First World War. One, from Nova Scotia, came out west as a young man to teach before going to war. Another photo is just a few centimeters in length. All these photos are annotated in multiple hands. And yet not a single mark appears on the photo of the Mountie.What are we to make of this collection of men's pictures? They could, of course, simply be the record of a lifetime of memories of the friends and acquaintances of a confirmed bachelor. But the number of men in the photos, their poses, even the marginality of some as itinerant, rural male school teachers raises questions. Could this collection speak to a queer life on the Canadian prairie in the years between the wars, and perhaps beyond? Is it possible that this unassuming cigarette tin illuminates a history of queer lives outside of the cities and spaces where we more easily recognize them? Teacher from Harrisville, Alberta, no date. (Cecil Bengry Collection)Family folklore about Cic' is sparse. My cousin's mother remembers asking outright as a child why Cic' never married. He answered that there wasn't a woman out there for him, and that he didn't think much of marriage anyway. She remembers it all seeming very final. Was this an empty statement to end an impertinent question, or a more poignant clue shared safely with a child? Whatever Cic's sexuality, and I use the term cautiously, he did live outside of normative expectations of adult masculinity. Queer, then, can be a useful term for thinking about Cic's life. We have no concrete reason to believe Cic' ever identified as homosexual. But nor did he live a typical life, and his experiences don't neatly break into binary gender roles. The many silences in Cic's life encourage questions, and open up conversations.Whatever Cic's understandings of himself were, we know from historians working in other regions of North America and Europe at this time that sexual fluidity between heterosexuality and homosexuality was not uncommon. Indeed, scholars have concluded that fixed understandings of sexual binaries, that we now take for granted, seem to have solidified only some time after the Second World War in many western countries. Helen Smith has previously written here at Notches about working-class men in England's industrial North who, until at least the 1950s, accepted homoerotic encounters and even sex as being compatible with 'normal' -- what we might imperfectly term heterosexual -- manhood. Nor did wives, families, or communities find their actions incompatible with local norms. (Left) 'They two Villains', no date. and (Right) Woodruff, no date (Cecil Bengry Collection)The term queer is also useful in the present because it provides a way to frame how we look at the past. It gives me other ways to think about Cic' and his life. How much am I, as a twenty-first century gay man, projecting onto Cic'? In a search for some kind of 'queer inheritance' am I creating rather than discovering a queer forebear in the family? I'm unwilling to assign to Cic' any kind of ahistorical sexual identity based on my own understanding of myself. But I -- and my cousin, who's gaydar first picked up on Cic' in ways that 'Old Joe' Bengry may well have missed (or not) -- am also sensitive to recognizing layers of sexual diversity and fluidity in the past. Freddie, February 1940. (Cecil Bengry Collection)We are unlikely ever to uncover the 'truth' of Cic's sexual identity. But engaging with Cic' allows us to think about the past differently, and also to engage with the present. For queer men and women today, it's critical to see that there is a queer history, many queer histories in fact, even if they don't map precisely onto today's understandings of LGBT. As my cousin who first found Cic's collection put it:That's the question of alone-ness, of reflection ... of seeing oneself reflected somewhere, and most importantly in family ... Surely I'm not the only pink sheep in the family. But that question is there for those long dead too: surely I'm not the only one who has ever loved men. Surely I have gay forebears somewhere. For me, Cic's possibility means my possibility. Cecil Bengry in old age (Oswald Bengry Collection)All of which brings us back to 'queer inheritances' and the possibility of doing family history queerly. Surely the quest for a queer past is more powerful at the more intimate level of family, in the networks of kinship, and the familiarity of photo albums passed on from loved ones. Going beyond the lists of so-called 'famous queers' of the past, queer family history locates us in a shared history; it gives us a history in which to place ourselves.And so we need to talk about Cecil, and about the men and women like him whose experiences may not conform to easy binaries and familiar categories, and who have often left no more than a cigarette tin to stand in testament to their complex and unknowable lives. For in those photographs are images, desires and possibilities.Justin Bengry is an Honorary Research Fellow at Birkbeck, University of London.

Whether you're new to meditation, or you've been practicing it for a while, there are always new and fascinating things to discover about this age-old practice.To the uninitiated, meditation appears mysterious and downright strange. To the well-practiced however, it's just a normal part of their daily routine.So how does meditation really work and how are you supposed to do it?Read on to discover some surprising secrets about meditation. Photo Credit: Moyan Brenn1. Your Mind Will Quiet Itself As opposed to actively trying to quiet your mind, when you meditate, your mind will quiet itself -- all on its own. Whether you are following your breath or chanting a mantra, you'll eventually start to just be present, to ""just be."" If you try to tame your thoughts, they'll just multiply instead. When you notice a sunset or you look up at the stars, all of your thoughts seems to disappear as you become more present to the moment. And that is how your mind quiets itself when you meditate, by becoming more present.2. It Doesn't Have to Take More than a Few Minutes There are no hard rules that your meditation session has to take 30 minutes. Who says you can't be present and meditate when you have a few spare moments to yourself? While a daily formal practice is preferable, you can be present while you're standing on line or waiting for a friend. You can incorporate meditation into your daily life any way that works for you.3. It's as Simple as Observing Your Breathing While meditation can seem mysterious and obscure to someone who has never tried it before, it actually couldn't be more simple. In Zen meditation, you simply observe your own breathing. You sit quietly and keep following and watching your breathing, as it goes in and out. In and out. And that's basically it. Easy, right? However, your mind will wander, you and you'll have to keep returning your awareness back onto your breathing. Simple, but not easy.4. Noticing How You React When Your Mind Wanders For most beginners, when you start meditating you'll notice that your mind wanders. Before you know it, you've been thinking about what to eat for dinner for the last few moments without even realizing it. If you get frustrated when this happens or if you beat yourself up, you'll create more distress. Instead, it's important to gently return your awareness back to your anchor (your breath), with the warmest compassion you can give to yourself. This is part of the process of meditation.5. Anyone Can Meditate Contrary to popular belief, there are no age restrictions on meditation. Whether you're 90 years old, or your 5-year-old daughter wants to give it a whirl, go for it! There are very few limitations on who can meditate. There's no discrimination on your ethnicity or gender. Even if you don't consider yourself ""spiritual,"" plenty of people who don't consider themselves spiritual meditate just for the health benefits alone. Christians, Muslims, and Jews alike can practice it. And if you have ADHD, research suggests that meditation will help you to concentrate and focus more.6. You Can Meditate In Any Position  When you picture someone meditating, you usually imagine them in the lotus position, sitting cross-legged on the floor. But you can actually meditate in any position. The lotus position is usually recommended because it helps you stay focused. But you can also meditate while sitting in a chair, laying down, or even standing! Whatever body position you choose, you should feel comfortable and relaxed.7. You Can Be Present Anywhere, Anytime While I'm not suggesting that you try to meditate in the middle of a rock concert or while your 2-year-old is throwing a tantrum, you can be present anywhere, anytime. There is a very beautiful walking meditation in Zen, where you stay mindful of each step as you walk. No matter where you are, you can be mindful and aware of how you're feeling and what you're hearing and seeing. You can even meditate on a train or at your desk. Give it a shot.8. Observe The Feeling Within Your Body As Eckhart Tolle writes extensively about, being present is natural and actually easy when you bring your attention to what it feels like inside of your body. Even if you don't feel anything remarkable going on inside of you, when you bring your attention to the ""aliveness"" and sensations you feel within your legs, arms, and torso, you'll become more present, and your mental chatter will begin to quiet down. This is how your dog lives his life -- present to his body.9. You've Always Known How to Be Present, You Just Had to Re-Learn Have you ever noticed the look in a baby's eyes when they're looking into your eyes? There's no worry or regret, no disappointment or judgement. Babies are present in a way that seems very appealing to adults. They're not absorbed in their own thoughts like adults are. You've probably had this experience of ""no thinking"" right when you're about to fall asleep or after waking up. It can be argued that being present is our natural state.10. There is No ""One Right Way"" To Do It There are countless schools and techniques for meditation. According to an ancient Hindu text, the Vigyan Bhairav Tantra, there are 112 ways to meditate! In some traditions, you focus on the breath, while in others you focus on a mantra. There is Zen, Transcendental Meditation, Vipassana meditation, mantra meditation, and so on. You can experiment with different meditation techniques or even create your own.Learn how a life coach can help you meditate by clicking here."

They leave home with few possessions, and often, in fear of their lives.   While millions of refugees receive food from humanitarian agencies, the food still needs to be cooked before it can be eaten. Yet without access to modern cookstoves and fuels, women and children must risk their safety, health, and sometimes their lives, to search for and collect firewood in order to cook over smoky, polluting open fires that damage health. As we commemorate World Refugee Day, now is the time to raise awareness about this critical issue and to encourage decision makers to address the urgent need for increased access to cleaner and more efficient cookstoves and fuels and to help ensure the dignity and safety of refugees around the world.   Displaced women often must walk for hours to find firewood and carry loads of 20 kg or more back to camp, which puts them at risk for physical and sexual attack, dehydration, and physical injury. In fact, a 2014 UNHCR assessment in Chad found that 42% of refugee households experienced incidents of assault, attempted rape, rape, or other forms of sexual gender based violence during firewood collection over a six month period. At night, lack of access to lighting further increases women's vulnerability when navigating camps to use latrines and other services.  Women and children in refugee camps are also exposed to health risks, including respiratory infections from smoke produced by inefficient stoves and fuels. A review in the Journal of Conflict and Health in 2010 stated that acute respiratory infections (ARIs) such as pneumonia are the leading cause of mortality among children under five worldwide. Yet they receive comparatively little attention in humanitarian relief policies despite the fact that in crisis settings the burden of ARIs tends to be exponentially greater than in non-crisis settings. In Nepal, for example, ARI mortality rates were roughly 10-17 times higher among refugee populations than among those in non-crisis settings. In Burundi, mortality rates from ARI were four times higher among refugees than their non-displaced peers.  Lack of access to cleaner and more fuel-efficient cooking technologies also has direct consequences on food security in crisis settings. In camps in North Darfur, 80% of internally displaced persons interviewed reported selling food from their World Food Program ration to buy firewood, and on average they missed 3 meals a week when they had food but lacked cooking fuel.  So what is being done to address these issues? The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (Alliance) and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are working together with the Safe Access for Fuel & Energy (SAFE) Humanitarian Working Group to develop and implement comprehensive programs in refugee camps that reduce fuel usage and emissions by improving access to cleaner and more fuel-efficient cookstoves and renewable energy products such as solar lanterns and solar home systems. The Alliance and UNHCR are conducting ongoing research to better monitor and evaluate the impacts of energy access programming, and are training humanitarian staff on how identify refugees' energy needs, plan, and implement high-quality energy programs.   The Alliance and UNHCR are also conducting advocacy to ensure that the humanitarian community prioritizes energy access during the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit and includes energy access within any new humanitarian policies and funding mechanisms.   What we need now is for all of you to join us in this effort.   Humanitarian staff should include questions on household energy needs in rapid assessments, and when energy needs are expressed, address these comprehensively within programs.   The general public can support this effort by donating or advocating on social media in support of humanitarian energy access. Follow @SafeFuelEnergy, @cookstoves, and @UNHCREnv on Twitter. Research the issue on www.safefuelandenergy.org and on the Alliance's and UNHCR's humanitarian energy pages.   Policy makers and donors can support the effort by recognizing the importance of energy access in ensuring the dignity and safety of refugees, and by prioritizing energy access in humanitarian policies and funding mechanisms, which should be key priorities as global leaders work this year to finalize the Sustainable Development Goals.   Together we can improve energy access for refugees and other displaced populations, and in doing so we can improve the health, safety, food security, and livelihoods of millions of people."
17,HEALTHY LIVING,Regrow Your Knee: How a Meniscus Implant Can Encourage Self-Healing,"Kevin R. Stone, M.D., ContributorOrthopedic Surgeon and Regenerative Medicine Pioneer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/total-knee-replacement-fo_b_7596538.html,"The availability of the CMI is good news for people who badly tear their meniscus cartilage. Ideally, meniscus cartilage tears must be repaired and reconstructed when they are freshly diagnosed",2015-06-24,2015-06-22-1435008430-3294284-CollagenMeniscusImplantcropped.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-22-1435008430-3294284-CollagenMeniscusImplantcropped-thumb.jpg,"When people injure their meniscus, the fibrous shock absorber in their knee, the torn part is often removed. Sometimes it is sutured. Unfortunately, when tissue is removed, the force is concentrated on a narrow part of the joint and arthritis ensues. [1]Patients often ask me ""Isn't there a shock absorber you can put back in my knee?"" The answer is yes. A meniscus transplant uses donor tissue to replace a missing meniscus. But this approach relies on a supply of healthy, young donor tissue, which is not always easy to acquire, and a highly specialized surgical procedure. Now, however, there is new approach to fixing torn and missing meniscus tissue, called the Collagen Meniscus Implant (CMI). The CMI is a biological device made of highly purified collagen, which is designed to promote a self-healing process by acting as a trellis for new meniscus tissue to grow into, reconstructing missing segments of the meniscus shape.In fact, the Collagen Meniscus Implant is not so new. I invented it in 1986.[2] It was the world's first orthopedic tissue regeneration template and it was tested extensively in animals and people, and found to be safe and effective. A private company ultimately developed the device and conducted further trials, gaining Europe's CE mark of approval in 2000. It has been available in Europe ever since, with over 4000 procedures performed. It was briefly available in the USA (2008 - 2010) but a dispute with the FDA has meant that the implant has been off the market for almost 5 years. This dispute has just been resolved and the CMI is once again available to people in the USA. I don't benefit financially from the recent FDA decision, but it brings a smile to my face and warmth to my heart that good science can eventually prevail over politics, and devices that benefit patients eventually can be used by surgeons. Here is why this is important: In multiple studies [3,4,5,6] of patients who had a meniscectomy alone versus a meniscus reconstruction with the implant, the latter group did better. People who had previously had a resection of their meniscus and had continued pain also benefited. Whether or not the progression to arthritis is prevented has not yet been demonstrated but intuitively we understand that more tissue is better than less. In our practice, the Collagen Meniscus Implant was also used as a stem cell and growth factor carrier to augment difficult to repair meniscus tears.The availability of the CMI is good news for people who badly tear their meniscus cartilage. Ideally, meniscus cartilage tears must be repaired and reconstructed when they are freshly diagnosed. [7] The challenge now is to get surgeons to deploy and insurance companies to approve such tools not just for the patients with refractory pain but to also help patients avoid a problem that may not appear for a decade or more.

But, I'm going to write it anyway. The first day we took her home, she walked around the kitchen a little confused. A scorching hot day during New England's July, she selected a cool kitchen tile and sprawled out. Worried she hadn't sipped enough water or eaten enough food, I fed the newest addition to our family from my hand. Her tiny tongue took the soft food with a growing trust. She was disoriented, but seemed to at least know she was safe and cared for. We named her Lyla. She was home. Growing up, I was never allowed to have a pet -- in the true sense of the word. I had a few fish at one point, but you can't walk, train, or play with fish. I don't really count that as an authentic ""pet"" experience. Accordingly, for much of my life, I had difficulty showing appropriate affection towards people's pets, most notably, dogs. I never understood how people could feel real love towards animals and, quite frankly, would do just about anything to make sure their slobbery, shedding selves stayed away from me. It wasn't that I didn't like them; I just didn't get it. Fast forward to last year, when I somehow agreed to my husband's proposal of getting a puppy. If I had known what we were in for with an 11-week-old Yorkshire Terrier, I would have never done it. She was a little terror at first; it's probably a good thing that I went in blindly! However, my heart has changed, as I am utterly in love with my dog. For the first few months, when we woke up in the morning to get ready for the day, she would follow me out of our bedroom and stop before heading down the stairs. She would back up and then step forward. Then, she'd repeat this. Certain of her inability to make her way down a staircase, I would gather her up and carry her. Eventually, she would try climbing a few on her own, with her tiny sweet paws just slightly unsteady. I remember how proud I was, watching her go from cowering at the stairs to taking them in stride. Similarly, I remember weighing myself without her and then with her to measure how much she was growing, Googling puppy weight charts to make sure she was on point. It turns out she is rather large for a Yorkie! In addition to being struck by this love and pride that I did not know I was capable of, I have also become fascinated, inspired, and warmed by the veterinary care that Lyla has received from our local animal hospital. When we brought her for her initial check up, her new vet picked her up and couldn't help but kiss her tiny 2-pound self when he first met her, remarking that she still smelled like a little baby. While a small detail, he referred to her care as something ""we"" would all do, in a collective and inclusive way. When referring to her future spaying, he would say ""I don't want to have to sedate us twice."" There was something about how he said it. I felt that he was in it with us. Vets care so much because animals are important. There is still good in this world.Our pets teach us about our tempers, our limits, our stressors. They pull out of us a different type of love and devotion. They hold the role of supporting you and your family in a way that only an animal companion can. They are a great source of wisdom: whether we are kind to them or not, they show us who we are. Thank you, Lyla. I get it now."

While working as a staff writer for the Christian Science Monitor, she made a bold move by leaving behind security and striking out on her own to fully unleash her talents as a media communicator. She founded The Aftermath Project in 2003, after documenting what she describes as the other half of the story, the aftermath of war in Bosnia, published as a book in 2005. She moved on to documentary filmmaking with the support of the Sundance Documentary Institute, with a film on a grassroots program in post-war Sierra Leone in 2011. One of the things she describes being most proud of is becoming a 2012 Guggenheim Fellow. Sara is a cherished member of the EverydayClimateChange (ECC) Instagram feed and a confidant on maintaining a high standard of photography and content on the feed. (Photo by Sara Terry @saraterry13 for @everydayclimate change: An artificial grass lawn in Venice Beach, CA. Scientists reported on Friday that 2014 was the hottest year on earth, since record-keeping began in 1880, undermining claims by climate change contrarians that global warming had somehow stopped. It was also the hottest year on record for California, where many environmental groups are urging citizens to take measures to adapt to the changing climate, to reduce stress on resources like water.  A 1,000-square-foot lawn, watered for 10 minutes a day with sprinklers, uses 8,400 gallons of water a month.  By comparison, the same size garden planted with natural ground cover, watered for 20 minutes a week with water efficient rotator sprinklers, uses 200 gallons a month.  Artificial grass is groomed by brushing it, and occasionally rinsing it with water.) ECC: You're one of the few photographers on the feed based in North America. How do you see your role in forwarding the conversation about climate change?Terry: Well I was surprised, and flattered, when you asked me to be on the feed, but I wasn't sure what I could contribute. I've worked a lot in Africa, but on post-conflict issues, not on environmental stories, or climate change. I didn't really have an archive of photos to draw on, and on top of that, I make it a point to only use my iPhone for my Instagram work. So I was a little stumped - what could I add to the conversation? But you were insistent about the importance of having photographers based in the West on the feed, so I said yes. I started out shooting as I was driving through the Sierra Nevadas, on my way to see family in Nevada, and I made my first images for the feed about the impact of climate change on the snow pack in the high Sierras. (Photo by Sara Terry @saraterry13 for @everydayclimate change: California's Sierra Nevada mountains (which means ""Snowy Range"" in Spanish) have been called a ""living lab"" for climate change. Some of the heaviest snow falls on record in the US have happened here, including the second largest one-day snowfall (5.6 ft at Echo Summit on Jan 4, 1982). heat Since 1895, the average temperature across California has increased by 1.7 degrees, and experts say the most visible effects of that warming occur within the Sierra Nevadas, where low temperatures are rising and precipitation increasingly falls as rain rather than snow. In parts of the 4 million acres of federally-protected land that take up much of the range, scientists have recorded marsh meadows going dry, wildflowers blooming earlier, and glaciers melting into ice fields.The first snow survey of the season, made in late December, found more snow than last year at this time thanks to December storms, but not enough to impact the California drought. Eighty percent of the state is in extreme or exceptional drought conditions, and snow pack in the Sierra Nevada range has historically been an important source of drinking water for a good portion of the state.)Terry continues: In some ways, I think I'm the contrarian on the feed. I have a problem with the way the press in general tends to cover the developing world (although it's more accurate to call it the majority world), and I often have specific problems with the way photographers shoot it. There's a tendency to over-dramatize, to create a kind of poverty porn, or an otherness porn that lets those of us in the West feel like we're somehow getting it right all the time, and that we have so much to teach ""others."" And I think that distances us from what the issues really are, and the way we're connected to them as Westerners, and the ways we should be examining our own lives and how we should be addressing those issues right where we are.ECC: How does that play out for you on the EverydayClimateChange feed?Terry: I feel that it's really important to cover climate change as an issue here in the US, and that doesn't necessarily make for pretty pictures. I've had to be more creative in finding images that can help tell the story. I do a lot of research and reporting on what's happening locally - how cities or citizens are grappling with climate change right where they are. A lot of the feed shows the consequences of climate change in other parts of the world - some of it quite dire - but I think we need to be equally committed to showing images that are about climate adaptability. Whenever I travel, I Google the name of the place where I am and the words ""climate change"" and I'm always amazed at what pops up. I loved learning more about Chicago's urban bike program, and similar programs in other cities, and the way those efforts are growing as a direct attempt to adapt our lifestyles so that we lessen our impact, however minimally, on climate change. (Photo by Sara Terry @saraterry13 for @everydayclimate change. ""Divvy,"" Chicago's public bike-sharing program was launched in 2013. Some 3,000 bikes at 300 stations around the city are available 24/7 for a modest fee.  Bike sharing programs continue to grow in popularity throughout the world: some 50 cities in the US now have them, and more than 600 cities world-wide. The Earth Policy Institute predicts there will be 38,000 bikes in public-sharing programs in the US by the end of 2015.According to Climate Focus, the transport sector is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. A bicycle is nearly 10 times more carbon-efficient than the most efficient of petrol cars.)(Photo by Sara Terry @saraterry13 for @everydayclimate change: Late afternoon sunlight reflects off the stainless-steel walls of Frank Gehry's Disney Hall in downtown Los Angeles.Although Gehry didn't have geoengineering in mind when he designed the much-loved building, ""reflective surfaces"" (including building and street materials) are one way proponents of geoengineering say that urban temperatures can be cooled - which in turn can reduce air-conditioning use and diminish smog. Not all researchers agree, however, and in the case of Disney Hall, some of its stainless-steel walls had to be modified because they actually increased heat in some spots nearby. [Again, Gehry did NOT design Design Hall with principles of geoengineering in mind.]Overall, geoengineering remains very controversial among climate change researchers, largely because no one knows the long-term consequences of large-scale interventions to counter global warming, such fertilizing the ocean (to increase plankton production) or putting mirrors in space to reflect sunlight away from the earth. Geoengineering is considered a plan B approach (with the reduction of carbon emissions considered as plan A), and is considered inevitable by some scientists, and dangerous by others. Last week, the National Research Council released a two-volume report recommending that the US government fund a research program into geoengineering as a response to global warming - a report which was greeted with both criticism and enthusiasm among scientists.)ECC: You were a print journalist for twenty years before becoming a documentary photographer and filmmaker. How are you using those skills in your ECC work?Terry: Well, I'm doing more research than I normally do. Usually I shoot because I'm moved by something, or interested in it. With my own projects, I'm not necessarily shooting literally - I often look for metaphorical images. But with my ECC photos, I do a lot of reading and then try to find pictures that can help bring what I'm learning to life. I dove deep into geo-engineering for a while, because I was fascinated by all the work that's going on in that field to try to adapt to climate change - and because it's very controversial among climate change researchers. I was particularly fascinated by reflective surface engineering, which uses buildings and street materials as a way to reduce urban temperatures, which in turn can reduce air-conditioning use. So I shot Frank Gehry's amazing building, Disney Hall, in downtown Los Angeles as an example of reflective surfaces (though Gehry didn't have those principles in mind when he built the hall).I also found out, while doing some other research, that the city of Burbank, which is part of the LA metro area, is one of the leaders in the US in reducing greenhouse gas emissions - they're way ahead of most other cities. So I went and shot a power plant which they've converted to high-efficiency natural gas, cutting emissions by 98 percent. Which led to a great comment on the feed, about natural gas and fracking - which prompted me to call the deputy general manager of the plant to find out more, and I learned that the city is planning to phase out that plant in another twenty years, as it continues to build renewable energy resources. And I was amazed to learn about this whole community of engineers, that he's a part of, who are doing all kinds of incredible research. So there's a lot of reporting that goes into the individual images for me.(Photo by Sara Terry @saraterry13 for @everydayclimate change: The city of Burbank, in the Los Angeles metro region, has become a leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the US. Its Magnolia Power Plant, a high-effiiciency natural gas unit which replaced four WWII-era plants, went into service in 2005. MPP produces 98 percent fewer emissions than those plants, generates more power and uses less fuel. It has won several design and sustainability awards.)Terry continues: I think the captions are a really important part of the feed. I see so many people commenting on the feed about what they're learning from it. I always feel the need to be very specific in explaining how something relates to climate change, not just writing a caption that hangs everything on vague generalities about ""global warming.""Here in California, for example, the four-year drought we're in has historic precedent - droughts happen here. You can't blame it all on climate change. However, there is some research by climate change scientists that show how climate change is exacerbating the drought. I try to make that clear when I post images that relate to the drought.I also try to write captions and find photos that encourage people to think or act differently in their own lives. I use ECC hashtags like #climatechangeisreal and #globalwarming - but I also try to include #dosomething in everything I post, and sometimes #thereareanswers, because I think it's so important for us to know that we can affect positive change. We may not be able to stop climate change, or even reverse it, but we can absolutely live our lives differently, so that we can lessen the damage that's been done.You can learn more about Sara Terry's work at www.saraterry.com or at her personal Instagram feed: @saraterry13."

(Photo by Paras Griffin/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0e4d2100000001c6c3e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the July issue of Essence magazine, Donna M. Owens brings to the fore a topic that has not been addressed in some time--the extent to which black Greek-letter organizations (""BGLOs"") are social justice organizations. Her article, ""Sister Soldiers: A Look at Black Sororities in the Black Lives Matter Movement,"" has come at an interesting time. It is a period in which at least one of the nine major BGLOs--Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity--is making an aggressive push in this area. The question that lingers is the extent of its effectiveness and the longevity of such engagement. Alpha Phi Alpha did not come into existence in a vacuum. Rather, a confluence of factors gave rise it. Given the cultural milieu at the time of its founding, founder Dr. Henry Arthur Callis, described the impetus for fraternity's creation thusly: ""[The fraternity] was born in the shadows of slavery and on the lap of disenfranchisement."" Elsewhere, he noted, ""Society offered us narrowly circumscribed opportunity and no security. Out of our need, our fraternity brought social purpose and social action."" Not surprisingly, the Fraternity has had a long history of involvement in African American's advancement and civil rights issues. Through its programs, funding of litigation, financial support and collaboration with other organizations, and the work of individual members, the Fraternity influenced public policy and helped effectuate change in the fight for African American civil rights and social justice.Rayford W. Logan, elected Alpha Phi Alpha's Director of Education in 1933, created the fraternity's ""Education for Citizenship"" campaign, now known as ""A Voteless People is a Hopeless People"" initiative. In the 1930s, fraternity members Charles Hamilton Houston and Thurgood Marshall represented Donald Murray--a Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity member--lawsuit for admission to the University of Maryland Law School. Alpha Phi Alpha paid for Murray's books and tuition until he graduated. In the Lloyd L. Gaines case, Charles Hamilton Houston assisted by fellow Alpha brother, Sidney R. Redmond, in desegregating the University of Missouri-Columbia's law school. In the 1940s, Alpha brother Lyman T. Johnson, with the help of Thurgood Marshall, desegregated the University of Kentucky's graduate school. In the 1950, Heman M. Sweatt, an Alpha brother, represented by Thurgood Marshall, desegregated the University of Texas's law school. The fraternity went-on to fund Elmer W. Henderson's--another member of Kappa Alpha Psi--suit against the Southern Railway Company, challenging dining car segregation. Then fraternity General Counsel, Belford V. Lawson, argued that 1950 case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Alpha Phi Alpha worked with and provided financial support to organizations and individuals. It joined with the NAACP and the New Negro Alliance to assist with litigation attempting to end segregation. The fraternity was a longstanding member of the American Council of Human Rights--an entity comprised of six of the then eight major BGLOs that lobbied Congress for Civil Rights laws from 1948 to 1963. This backdrop does not include the lasting work of Alpha brothers like W.E.B. DuBois, Martin Luther King, Jr., Whitney Young, Paul Robeson, William T. Coleman, Julius Chambers, C.T. Vivian, Lester Granger, Andrew Young, Joseph Lowery, Floyd McKissick, Marc Morial and others. Within the fraternity, the Commission on Racial Justice was established as a result of the actions of the fraternity's 1988 General Convention. Over the next twenty years, the Commission's engagement ebbed and flowed but really took a backseat to the symbolisms of social justice--i.e., the fraternity's 120 million dollar effort to build the Martin Luther King, Jr. Monument on the National Mall.  In 2012, Mark S. Tillman was elected General President of Alpha Phi Alpha. In 2013, the Commission, with the support of the fraternity's Public Policy and A-Voteless-People-is-a-Hopeless-People Committees pushed for the fraternity as a whole to develop several strategic partnerships around social justice. In 2013, the fraternity launched its Conversations on Race Experience with Alpha Omicron Pi Women's Sorority and Delta Sigma Pi Fraternity, focused on the groups collegiate chapters. In 2014, the fraternity provided social justice philanthropy to the Dream Defenders, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights under Law, the NAACP, and the NAACP-Legal Defense and Education Fund. In 2015, the Fraternity negotiated a partnership with each of these groups aimed at using some of their collective resources to uplift the African American community. This year, the fraternity will also work with New York Law School's Civil Rights Clinic, focusing on preparing an amicus brief to be submitted to the United States Supreme Court in one of its upcoming cases. Lastly, through the National Pan-Hellenic Council, the Fraternity will partner with the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, focusing on youth engagement with law enforcement. For some Alpha Phi Alpha members, this initiative will be the coup de grâce. However, in every way, it is merely an auspicious beginning. It is an opportunity for the fraternity to not only reclaim some past glory but also, and more importantly, a chance to reinvigorate its membership and play an impactful role in advancing African American civil rights. It may also provide a template for how the other nine BGLOs can become significantly and meaningfully engaged around social justice issues. Time will tell which road the fraternity takes."
23,HEALTHY LIVING,Where You Live Helps Determine Whether You'll Survive HIV/AIDS,Erin Schumaker and Meredith Melnick,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-hiv-rate-disparities_n_7638570.html,,2015-06-24,"A person does a blood test at a roadside AIDS testing table in Langa, a suburb of Cape Town during the International AIDS Day on December 01, 2010. A million people are now receiving anti-AIDS drugs in South Africa, a country with the world's heaviest HIV infections, Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe said. South Africa has 5.6 million people who are HIV-positive out of a 50-million population, according to UN estimates. AFP PHOTO/RODGER BOSCH (Photo credit should read RODGER BOSCH/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ee1b32200008300da3341.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the biggest misconceptions about the AIDS epidemic in the United States is that it's over. This belief is also part of why the disease is so dangerous -- and why campaigns like this week's National HIV Testing Week are so necessary. Nationally, 1.2 million Americans live with HIV or AIDS and about 50,000 more are diagnosed with HIV each year. But for a more complete view of the virus' impact, localized data is telling. Philadelphia has a citywide HIV infection rate that's five times the U.S. national average, and the infection rate in one of the city's southwestern neighborhoods is comparable to rates in Sierra Leone and Ghana.A full two-thirds of new HIV infections occur in just 3 percent of U.S. counties, according to newly released statistics from AIDSVu, a data project developed by researchers at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health that maps data about the disease using information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. census. These counties are found in both cities and rural areas, but they have one thing in common: a lack of resources. Because the disease spread is largely contained within poor communities, even medical professionals and grant-giving institutions can be unaware of the virus' prevalence, said Dr. Laurie Dill, medical director for Medical AIDS Outreach of Alabama, a nonprofit organization that services 26 rural and high-poverty counties in the state, some of which have a per capita HIV infection rate that's three to five times the national average. Getting tested, in her view, isn't just an individual act. Because testing data informs a larger map of HIV rates that highlights areas of concern, people who get screened can help doctors properly allocate support and resources. Dill's organization used Emory's data analysis, along with state health department data, to help determine communities in need and expand their access to care via eight telemedicine sites in general health clinics throughout the state (two more are opening this summer). These sites allow patients in remote areas to consult with doctors, social workers, pharmacists and mental health professionals via video chat. Putting telemedicine in general health clinics also means HIV patients can seek care without announcing their statuses by going to an HIV-specific clinic. Similarly, a program set up by HIV researchers in some neighborhoods of Philadelphia used AIDSVu data to provide targeted outreach. ""Where you live and the color of your skin is going to influence whether you survive HIV.""Nationwide, rates of people living with HIV are largely clustered in the Northeast and the South, regions that also have the highest number of new diagnoses. (In 2012, there were 8,629 new diagnoses in the Northeast and 22,629 in the South.) The overall prevalence of HIV tends to track along the same lines as poverty trends.""To quote Paul Farmer, there is a synergy of plagues,"" Dill said. ""There's no public transportation in these counties, there are huge problems with access to even primary care. Hospitals are closing, there are high rates of uninsured people. These are some of the poorest counties in the country, literally. ... Basically, they are at risk for HIV by geography."" People living with an HIV or AIDS diagnosis in Alabama, 2012It is not unheard of, Dill said, to have a teenager arrive at clinic with AIDS, the advanced disease state of HIV, indicating years or perhaps even a decade without testing and diagnosis. This highlights one counterintuitive reality about HIV treatment, namely that it is prevention. People undergoing treatment are 96 percent less likely to spread the disease, according to Dill. A community with low testing rates also has low treatment rates, which means transmission increases. Aside from geography, the major risk factors remain sexual behavior and race. And although there were big gains in reducing HIV transmissions and HIV- and AIDS-related mortality rates in the 1990s and early aughts, the racial gap hasn't shrunk in recent years. As of 2013, black men were eight times more likely to be diagnosed with HIV than white men. Black women, meanwhile, were approximately 19 times as likely to be diagnosed as white women, according to Patrick Sullivan, lead researcher on the AIDSVu project and a professor of epidemiology at Emory. While 13 percent of the U.S. population is African-American, 46 percent of the new HIV diagnoses in 2013 were among African-Americans, AIDSVu reports. ""The HIV/AIDS epidemic today is a black disease,"" said Phill Wilson, president and CEO of the Black AIDS Institute. ""Black Americans get diagnosed later than other racial ethnic groups and die sooner.""  Amy Nunn, executive director of the Rhode Island Public Health Institute and an associate professor of behavioral and social sciences at the Brown University School of Public Health, studied HIV rate disparities in Philadelphia, finding that while affluent neighborhoods with large populations of gay men had elevated HIV rates, blacks in neighborhoods with high HIV rates were more likely to die from the infection. Inner-city, black neighborhoods in Philadelphia had microepidemics of HIV, with testing and treatment centers few and far between. ""In a nutshell, where you live and the color of your skin is going to influence whether you survive HIV,"" Nunn said.Nunn used AIDSVu data to zero in on neighborhoods with high HIV rates, then partnered with community leaders to launch Do One Thing, a door-to-door outreach program that offers free HIV and hepatitis C testing.Most strikingly, this program was a success with men: The group, notoriously difficult to reach, has accounted for 60 percent of Do One Thing's on-the-street screenings. Since 2012, the program has screened approximately 6,500 people for HIV and tested about 2,500 people for hepatitis C.But testing is only one part of the solution. ""Where the rubber meets the road is linking people to care and keeping them in care and actually getting them on the life-saving medication that they need to be on,"" Wilson said.Both Nunn and Dill run programs, dependent on grant funding, that address this next stage: helping patients navigate insurance issues, and providing transportation and other barriers to care. ""So many of our solutions have been focused on behavior change, and I think that’s a real miss,"" Nunn said. ""The drivers of the epidemic are social and structural in nature. Just asking people to change their behavior is not going to address the root cause of the problem.""June 27 is National HIV Testing Day. To find a testing location near you, visit AIDSVu.org.

25,WORLDPOST,Between Default and Reform: The Night and Day Options for the Greek Economy,"Costas Meghir, ContributorProfessor of Economics, Yale University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/between-default-and-refor_b_7655698.html,The obvious alternative to the catastrophe that the government is contemplating is to implement real structural reforms. This would first require a deal with the creditors to keep Greece afloat.,2015-06-24,"Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, left, is greeted by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker prior to a meeting at EU headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, June 24, 2015. Eurozone finance ministers meet Wednesday to discuss the Greek bailout. (Julien Warnand/Pool Photo via AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1510f240000360076f60e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," In these moments of extreme danger for Greece it is important to take stock and understand what the real issues are and what the alternatives might be. We arrived at this point following decades of bad governance during which the governing parties (particularly PASOK with New Democracy having a share of the blame) established themselves by distributing favors either in the form of appointments in the public sector or unfunded increases in pensions, or legislation that would protect vested interests, such as barriers to entry in certain professions and extreme regulations in the formal labor market. They accompanied this by a tacit acceptance of tax evasion. The end result was a massive decline in productivity relative to our trading partners (it stood at 70 percent of average EU productivity in 2009), and a huge increase in the budget and trade deficits funded mainly by unprecedented increases in internal and eventually in external debt (when Greece was accepted into the Euro). The unprecedented debt levels were caused by the clientelist policies and fed an artificial level of growth. The Greek economy was built around the state, which became the most important employer and on which an important part of the private sector depended on for contracts. While PASOK started the Greek economy on this road to perdition, New Democracy followed suit with massive amounts of appointments in the public sector and huge increases in the debt to GDP ratio, even while the latter was growing fast.The result is that Greece has no tradable goods sector to speak of. In other words Greece cannot export much except for some agricultural products and, of course, tourism. Both are low value added and belong to sectors exposed to intense international competition. Witness to this is the fact that ¾ of the adjustment of the trade deficit (from 15 percent of GDP in 2009) was achieved by a reduction in imports despite the fact that Greek private wages fell at least 25 percent, which should make Greece much more competitive. However there is no serious export sector to respond to this decline in costs because overregulation of the Greek economy, corruption and bureaucracy prevents serious investment from taking place. The absence of a dynamic tradable sector is at the heart of the crisis and no amount of fiscal stimulus can correct this fundamental problem.With these facts in mind let us return to the endless negotiations of the Greek government with the troika of creditors (ECB, EU and IMF). They have already cost huge harm because thy have destabilized the Greek economy, which has reentered recession and have introduced massive uncertainty, inhibiting investment. Nevertheless, this is where we are. The position of the Greek government, as far as one can discern a position at all, is that debt should be somehow restructured, but structural reforms opening up markets to competition and liberalizing the labor market should not take place. Moreover, they have refused reforms to the pension system (which is completely unsustainable) and to current levels of pensions despite the fact they are currently over 15 percent of GDP. Instead they have proposed increases in corporation tax from 26 percent to 29 percent (which will further depress output) and other dubious tax measures, such as taxing online gambling, while at the same time promising to rehire public sector workers and offering no reforms that could possibly stimulate growth. They have also suggested that if their demands are not met they will allow Greece to default and leave the Euro. Understanding the aims and position of the government has become all the more difficult because of the absence of hard figures and fully costed proposals. In the remainder of the article, I outline the economic consequences of the two real alternatives that are on the table: either default and exit from the Euro or market based reforms with some possible debt restructuring.Suppose the Greek government carries through its threat to default. At that point, Greek bonds may not be considered valid collateral anymore and since they form an important part of the capitalization of Greek banks, the ECB may consider the Greek banks insolvent. In this case, the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA), on which the banking sector has been relying on to satisfy the demands for withdrawals, may have to cease. This would mean a collapse of the banking sector and would result in an immediate withdrawal of credit from the private sector and a default on the remaining deposits. Most trading activity would stop and the importation of even the most basic goods, such as food, medical supplies and fuel would be halted and would have to rely on foreign aid. Since trading would stop, government revenues would disappear and no pensions or public sector salaries would be payable. Since borrowing will be impossible, the austerity of the past five years will be remembered with nostalgia as a period of plenty. At this point the government would have no option but to exit the Euro and print its own currency, which would trade at a much lower exchange rate than 347 drachmas to the Euro, as was the case in 2000. This massive devaluation would not lead to an export boom (as many commentators have suggested) because there is no export sector to speak of -- indeed despite the large decline in labor costs over the past 5 years exports are still not responding substantially, and the credit crunch resulting from the collapse of the banking system would not allow for any new investment. The result will be inflation, a huge reduction in purchasing power and a complete wiping out of individual savings. The insistence of the Greek government on leaving pensions unchanged will sound laughable once the purchasing power of these pensions adjusts to this reality. In the longer run, growth will be sluggish both because we will have reintroduced massive currency and policy uncertainty and because in all likelihood the future governments will continue to refuse to implement structural reforms. Access to credit may eventually be restored after a few years (although the example of Argentina is not encouraging), but the lack policy credibility means it will be expensive. Moreover, the creditors are likely to continue to pursue Greece for at least partial repayment of the debt, which now will have mushroomed because of the devaluation (the Greek debt is denominated in Euros). But even if this does not happen and the creditors forget about their assets, the dysfunctionality of the Greek economy with its huge web of regulations will prevent serious investments. So Greece will continue to rely on the low value added informal economy. Greece will be trapped in a low growth state and its standards of living will continue to slip.The obvious alternative to the catastrophe that the government is contemplating is to implement real structural reforms. This would first require a deal with the creditors to keep Greece afloat. Achieving the fiscal targets was not much of a problem in January, but because of the confrontation, which the government initiated with Greece's partners, revenues have collapsed and the economy has entered into recession. Nevertheless the creditors have already reduced their demands to a primary surplus to just 1 percent of GDP for this year. They may even be willing to move to a lower surplus if Greece implemented real reforms. So suspending disbelief for a moment and supposing that the Greek government wished to negotiate in good will, this is what it should do.First, it should openly recognize that the source of the debt and the reason for the resulting huge recession was not the bailout agreement but the Greek economic governance and institutions (for which the current government cannot yet be held responsible -- although it seems to want to perpetuate them). Indeed, it's a fact that all the austerity we have seen up to now in Greece was required for balancing the budget from its 16 percent deficit in 2009 to a primary surplus so that Greece would not need to borrow even more -- it does not reflect repayments of capital or interest. All talk of illegal debt should stop because it only succeeds in undermining the credibility of the Greek government now and in the future.Second, it should immediately implement structural reforms that would open up professions, remove protections from sectors, such as pharmacies, road haulage, mobility of lawyers and numerous others, opening them up to competition and removing restrictions from trading. Most importantly, all bureaucratic impediments to starting and running a business (some of the worst in the OECD) should be removed. Corruption should be stamped out and tax evasion should be credibly pursued across all income and professional groups. The labor market should be completely deregulated (beyond the basic rules ensuring health and safety and non‐ discrimination) and unions should no longer have a role in collective bargaining, other than at the workplace and then only if the majority of employees have voted for representation. Deregulation would ensure more formal businesses and a decline in the low growth informal sector, which is an impediment to growth.Third, it should announce a radical overhaul of the tax code and of course reduce the corporation tax, making Greece an attractive place to invest. Part of the overhaul of the tax system should be the creation of a welfare program with a minimum income guarantee and tax incentives to work, subsidizing low pay and removing the need for a minimum wage. As we have shown in another paper this is possible to do now without extra expenditure, and would help people adjust to the new market conditions. Because of rampant tax evasion, this system will have to become contributory after a short phase-in period. However, a well-functioning social insurance system should be a priority to enable the transition to a genuine free market economy and would provide a well‐targeted stimulus.Fourth, the overhaul of the public sector should continue with primary aim to reduce its size and improve accountability. Part of this reform, but also linked to increasing competitiveness directly, is the privatization of numerous public utilities, including the electricity company (DEH) and continuing the hugely successful privatization of the Piraeus Port Authority (OLP). With a view to the longer run, the education system needs systematic overhaul, introducing high quality education from the early years to University and introducing a system of accountability of all those working there. At the same time research and development should be allowed to flourish, both to support innovative industry and to support local policy‐making. Finally, the judiciary is completely dysfunctional with commercial cases taking on average five years to be resolved -- this needs radical change.With this reform program in place, the government should then negotiate some debt restructuring, which could be based on lengthening debt maturity and fixing interest rates to the current low levels. Given a commitment to such reforms, the creditors would be happy to oblige, since Greece, instead of being the sick lady of Europe, would be one of its most dynamic economies. Such restructuring would be important in spurring growth so long as the increased funding was appropriately spent to support the reforms. With the resulting increase in growth, repaying the debt would be much less onerous, since repayments are fixed, while GDP will be growing.Despite 35 years of mismanagement, Greece still has reserves of human capital. The post war success story, which was based on expansion of education and entrepreneurship, despite all its well‐known faults, left a country with a solid human infrastructure that, in part at least, persists today. Moreover, there are numerous entrepreneurial Greeks living abroad who are prepared to return and pursue successful businesses, both because they love their country and because Greece can offer amazing opportunities due to its location and its culture: part of western Europe but with a broader understanding of the Balkans and the Middle East. In other words, Greece can compete at the top tier in both financial and high-tech industries if only the current statist system would be dismantled.This post originally appeared on HuffPost Greece and was translated into English.

The idea of Unlimited is that galleries can present work that won't physically fit within the confines of the regular Basel booths: large-scale sculptures, video projections, site-specific pieces, performance art and installations are all included.The list of contributing artists is impressively blue-chip and includes Ai Weiwei, Martin Creed, Olafur Eliasson, Pierre Huyghe, Pedro Reyes, Dan Flavin, Gilbert & George, Ryan McGinley, Sarah Morris and Kenneth Anger. Stand-out pieces include: Weiwei's ""Stacked"" (2012), created from 760 of his Chinese Forever bicycles; Reyes' ""Disarm"" (Mechanized) II (2014), part of his international project in which confiscated guns are transformed into musical instruments; Eliasson's light-based ""Your Space Embracer"" (2004); and David Shrigley's ""Life Model"" (2012), a work first seen in Britain's Turner Prize and comprising of a three-meter high sculpture figure which is being drawn by visitors to the gallery.Alongside these pieces will be Julius von Bismarck's ""Egocentric System"" (2015) a live performance taking place across the entirety of the show, and Rio art collective OPAVIVARÅ's ""Formosa Decelerator,"" which allows visitors to lounge in hammocks and blend their own tea. In reality, Unlimited is no longer a subsidiary part of the main Basel fair, but an equal partner - it just got too big for its booths.  For the full gallery list for Unlimited, visit artbasel.com. Art Basel runs through June 21. This year, 284 galleries from 33 countries will present works ranging from the modern period of the early 20th century to the most contemporary artists of today.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get the best of ARTPHAIRE delivered straight to your inbox!-- Justin Quirk is an ARTPHAIRE contributor and the Editorial Director of HOUSE magazine, as well as a contributor to The Guardian, Esquire, Shortlist, Stylist, Grazia and The Sunday Telegraph.

27,POLITICS,DeRay McKeeson: Outside Agitator,"Eric Herbst, ContributorFreelance writer based out of Los Angeles",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/deray-mckeeson-outside-agitator_b_7655560.html,"Until unaffected populations begin to acknowledge what lies beyond their purview, cops will continue to act with impunity.

Dozens of San Francisco public attorneys and activists staged a 'Hands Up, Don't Shoot' demonstration to protest the racial disparities in the criminal justice system following the non-indictments of two white police officers who killed unarmed black men in Missouri and New York.

During our correspondence, Deray McKesson, 29, came off as someone with little interest in convivial formalities. This image is bolstered by his Twitter profile -- McKesson's media of choice -- where a young, goateed, black man stares lock-jawed through the camera at an imposing angle. But in person, I find no hint of his online persona. McKesson is generously conversational and, speaking with a tone of surprising femininity, he stretches his thoughts into lengthy paragraphs of thesis quality. When we meet for the first time, over a late breakfast at St. Louis' City Diner in mid-town, the civil rights activist ignores my expectations to sip on a mimosa between bites of syrup-soaked pancakes. McKesson is clearly tired, but he refuses to give in to the fatigue that has accumulated from nights of endless protest. Sitting taut, in the ripped-red vinyl booth, he covers both eyes with open palms to smother the sleep away in waxing circles. Eight months ago, McKeeson got all the sleep he needed. He was well into a career in education, working first as a grade school math teacher, and more recently as the hiring director for the Minneapolis Public School system. Until the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, his focus was education, not the civil rights movement, saying, ""This was not my issue."" But ask him now, and he can tell you how to shut down a packed mall through organized protests; stop rush hour traffic with a line of human bodies; or even provide instructions for neutralizing the sting from a concentrated dose of CS gas -- never wear contacts. It took six months before I was able to convince McKesson to sit down with me for an interview. His caution was understandable. Since dedicating himself to activism full-time, McKesson has become the most recognizable figure from the dozens of loosely connected cadres operating under the Black Lives Matter flag. As such, he has been the target of police surveillance and suffered a barrage of online death threats from Twitter trolls -- some of whom he suspects are cops. So, for a man whose fight is against a predominantly white police force intent on maintaining their impunity, I may just look like another face in the riot-line across from him. I begin the interview by asking about his impression of St. Louis. As a native of the city, I am always curious to know how visitors perceive my hometown. The conversation usually starts and ends with Gateway Arch, but McKesson is not a tourist, and this is not a vacation. ""I only know this city through protest,"" he says. Comparing St. Louis to his hometown, Baltimore, McKesson continues, ""the police or city officials (in Baltimore) are definitely incompetent -- potentially corrupt -- but here, I am convinced that people are racist. Not just malfeasance, but legitimate racism."" It is a brazen critique, but hard to argue. The racism McKesson speaks of is seldom acknowledged by its citizens, but demographic maps of St. Louis corroborate his experience. From above, the division between blacks and whites is so defined, they look to have been engineered by city planners. One of the most notorious partitions is known as ""The Delmar Divide,"" a 15 mile boulevard that dissects poor black communities in the north from affluent neighborhoods to the south.To hear white St. Louis talk about Delmar Boulevard, sounds as if they are boasting about a local landmark -- a tourist attraction to be admired for its historic charm. Here, century old Beaux Art manses are buttressed by dilapidated row houses with caved-in roofs, exposed interiors, and forgotten yards. Just a block from the gated communities and a world-class hospital, there is a dearth of civic attention, which is evidenced by the parking lots that have been appropriated as illegal dump sites-the trash piling as tall as cars at times.McKeeson asks why I think these conditions have been ignored in the shadow of a bustling city center. I would be embarrassed to restate my answer-a torrent of uneducated drivel about structural inequalities, for which I am still paying off the student loans. As a 33 year-old white male from the Midwest, I maintained a long held belief that outward, open, racism was a relic of the past, lobbed onto the growing pile of outmoded philosophies and defunct practices because of its absurdity. McKesson understands the structural racism argument-he was a political science major at Bowdoin University-but says the textbook explanation, which excuses racism as an unavoidable byproduct of free-market democracies, doesn't fully account for the hatred he has experienced as a black man in America. ""I don't think racism is rooted in this economic thing,"" he says. ""At the end of the day it's rooted in power. And that seeps out into many things -- one of which is structures-but the more insidious thing, is that it seeps into our actions."" To demonstrate his point-that racism is instinctual, McKesson juxtaposes the development of urban housing projects with the image of an overcrowded slave ship, calling the former a, ""fascinating example of the worthiness of black bodies."" He continues, ""You would never stack white bodies the way you stack black bodies. And it's not just a function of economics, it is also a function of power. [They] will depress these people in any possible way. Privilege only works if there are others who are not privileged.""McKesson's analogy echoes a line from Saul Bellow's, Herzog, that addresses the inability of those unmolested by suffering to understand its condition. Describing the divide between experiential knowledge and allegorical knowledge, Bellow's writes, ""this is the difficulty with people who spend their lives in humane studies and therefore imagine once cruelty has been described in books it is ended."" The sentiment remains true. With each video of an unarmed black man being shot by police, those ignorant to the modern form of racism, rise up n chorus to repeat a common refrain: the victim should not have resisted. McKesson chides this response, calling it the essence of white privilege. ""It's insulting to say I wouldn't run because the reality is, the fight or flight instinct is real. I didn't do anything and [the cop] already has his gun out. Part of me wants to run to be near people-it's a momentary decision. You are speaking from a (universal) perspective, not black.""Until unaffected populations begin to acknowledge what lies beyond their purview -- a world where racism is cloaked by nuance -- the system will continue to exist in a self-policed vacuum, and cops will continue to act with impunity. As the de facto head of the Black Lives Matter movement, McKesson's goal is to drag the cloistered masses from behind their white-washed picket fences in order to show them an unacceptable reality: a black population living in fear of the very police force tasked with protecting them. And while this may seem like too heavy a burden for any one person, McKeeson has a surprisingly positive attitude regarding his new mission. Addressing the struggle that can seem unending, he says, ""In blackness, people have overcome so much, there is this solid well of joy that has existed in the midst of trauma deeper than this. And I exist in that legacy. So yes, I can find happiness and joy, but it's hard to escape."

Across the country, the ride-hailing service employs 250 lobbyists and 29 lobbying firms registered in state capitols, according to a new report by Bloomberg Businessweek. That’s at least a third more than the lobbying fleet of Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer. And we're not even talking about municipal lobbyists. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company is valued at $41 billion, making it the second-most valuable private company in the world.The sheer volume of Uber’s political force should come as no surprise. The company has faced challenges in almost every major city it has tried to enter. The opposition has been largely fueled by taxi associations fearful of losing business to Uber. As of April, the state of Nevada and the city of Eugene, Oregon had fully banned the service. Operations had been suspended in about a half-dozen other cities across the country. "

30,RELIGION,5 Faith Facts About Bobby Jindal: An 'Evangelical Catholic',,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bobby-jindal-faith_n_7657530.html,,2015-06-24,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK - MAY 22: Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal waves during the 2015 Southern Republican Leadership Conference May 22, 2015 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. About a dozen possible presidential candidates will join the conference and lobby for supports from Republican voters. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb803c03c000032000db508.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Wednesday (June 24) becomes the latest Republican to throw his hat into the presidential ring — and in this case, “last” may also mean “least.” Jindal, 44, is currently bringing up the rear in the polls among the 15 declared or likely GOP candidates. But he has a strong profile as a religious conservative, the kind of reputation that could give him a prayer, at least in the primaries. Here are five faith facts about Jindal, who has one of the more intriguing religious backgrounds among all the contenders.1. He was born and raised a Hindu.He was born Piyush Jindal in 1971, four months after his parents arrived in Louisiana from their native India. When he was 4 he asked to be called “Bobby” after a character on “The Brady Bunch,” a favorite television show.“I was raised in a strong Hindu culture, attended weekly pujas, or ceremonial rites, and read the Vedic scriptures,” he wrote in the Jesuit weekly America in 1993, the fullest account of his religious journey. “Though my prayers were a child’s constant stream of requests and broken promises, Hinduism provided me with moral guidance and spiritual comfort. It never occurred to me that I should consider any other religion; to be a Hindu was an aspect of my Indian identity.”2. His journey to Christianity “was a gradual and painful one.”His introduction to Christianity was when a childhood friend, a Southern Baptist, told him that “you and your parents are going to hell.” He was also given a Bible with his name embossed in gold. The experience did not impress him, but it did prompt him to begin examining his Hinduism more closely.As a junior in high school, he had a crush on a girl who started talking about her faith in God and opposition to abortion when he started talking to her about going out on a date. She invited him to church, and that led him to begin reading the Bible more closely — though with a flashlight in a closet at home so his parents would not find out.It took two years until he finally converted: “The single most important time in my life is the moment that I found Jesus Christ,” Jindal said at a prayer rally in South Carolina earlier this month. Then a few years later in college he became a Catholic. “I am best described as an evangelical Catholic,” he said while at Liberty University last spring to deliver a commencement address at the bastion of evangelical Protestantism.3. His parents were not happy with his conversion.“My parents were infuriated by my conversion and have yet fully to forgive me,” he wrote in 1993. “There were heated discussions, many of them invoking family loyalty and national identity. My parents have never truly accepted my conversion and still see my faith as a negative that overshadows my accomplishments.”But, he wrote, “If Christianity is merely one of many equally valid religions, then the sacrifices I made, including the loss of my family’s peace, were senseless.”4. He has become a stalwart of the “religious right.”Jindal was once considered a rising Republican star because of his mastery of policy and his championing of reasonable compromises, exhorting the GOP to “stop being the stupid party.” But in the last couple of years he has fashioned himself as an outspoken social conservative and champion of religious believers, especially conservative Christians.“I don’t know about you, but sometimes it feels like evangelical Christians are the only group that it’s OK to discriminate against in this society,” Jindal said at a Good Friday prayer breakfast in Iowa this spring.Jindal has said he has “no problem” if public schools want to teach creationism or intelligent design, and he added: “The reality is I’m not an evolutionary biologist.” He has taken up the religious freedom cause in a big way. After the Louisiana Legislature this spring rejected a religious freedom bill designed to protect companies whose religiously committed owners disagreed with same-sex marriage, Jindal quickly issued a “marriage and conscience” executive order.He has also been one of the most vocal defenders of the “Duck Dynasty” reality TV clan, whose patriarch, Phil Robertson, has in particular become known for controversial takes on faith and politics. The admiration is mutual. “I’m the kind of guy who really likes smart people … and that guy’s one of the smartest people I’ve ever met in my life,” son Willie Robertson said of Jindal earlier this year.5. He highlights the threat of radical Islam.During a visit to Europe this year, Jindal claimed that there are “no-go zones” in cities where Muslims had imposed Shariah that made police “less likely to go in.” He later stood by his comments, adding that there are “communities of people that don’t want to integrate” but instead have immigrated “to colonize, to overtake the culture.”He has repeatedly criticized President Obama for going too easy on “radical Islamic terrorism,” saying Obama was “unfit to be commander in chief” and blasting the president’s National Prayer Breakfast remarks in February about Christianity’s history of violence.“It was nice of the president to give us a history lesson at the Prayer Breakfast,” Jindal said. “Today, however, the issue right in front of his nose, in the here and now, is the terrorism of Radical Islam. … The Medieval Christian threat is under control, Mr. President. Please deal with the Radical Islamic threat today.”Bonus fact: He once helped in an exorcism.In a 1994 essay, Jindal described participating in an exorcism of a college classmate he called “Susan.” She had begun having mysterious visions, according to an account in Mother Jones, and visitors to her apartment “reported a faint odor of sulfur.” Then one evening Jindal and others staged an intervention, though without the help of a priest, as Catholic teaching would normally require.“Kneeling on the ground, my friends were chanting, ‘Satan, I command you to leave this woman,’“ Jindal wrote. “Others exhorted all ‘demons to leave in the name of Christ.’“ Finally, another student arrived with a crucifix and cast the spirit out."
31,RELIGION,Pope Francis: Divorce Can Be 'Morally Necessary' To Protect Kids,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pope-francis-marital-separation_n_7657512.html,,2015-06-24,"Pope Francis' gestures as he leads the weekly audience in Saint Peter's Square at the Vatican on June 24, 2015. AFP PHOTO / FILIPPO MONTEFORTE (Photo credit should read FILIPPO MONTEFORTE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb803bf240000300098b1ab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"VATICAN CITY (RNS) Pope Francis said Wednesday (June 24) that there are times when it is “morally necessary” for couples to separate, as part of the pontiff’s broader reflection on how to protect children from quarreling parents.Speaking to crowds in St. Peter’s Square, Francis said that in some cases “separation is inevitable” and “can even become morally necessary” at times.The pontiff was clear in specifying the extreme cases in which he saw family breakdown as justifiable: “when it comes to saving the weaker spouse, or young children, from more serious injuries caused by intimidation and violence, by humiliation and exploitation, by lack of involvement and indifference.”His comments came as part of a wide reflection on conflicts within families — “the most ugly thing!” — during which he focused on the lifelong damage wrought on children whose parents fight.“When the father and mother harm each other, children’s souls suffer greatly, feeling a sense of desperation. And they are wounds that leave a lifelong mark,” the pope said.Francis warned parents that showering their children with gifts to apologize for their quarreling would not solve their problems and risked further harming the family. “The more one looks to compensate with presents and candy, the more the sense of injury is lost — more painful and deeply — to the soul,” he said.The pope called on Catholics to recognize families suffering from internal strife and offer support: “We find many families in irregular situations around us. And this poses many questions: How can we help them? How can we accompany them? How can we accompany them so the children do not become hostages to their father or mother?”The questions posed by the pontiff come as part of the Catholic Church’s broader reflection on the modern-day family, with heated debate over how the Vatican should respond, to divorcees and gay couples in particular.The Holy See on Tuesday released a lengthy document on the family, collating Catholics’ views on the topic after a high-profile meeting of leading church officials last fall.Although the paper touches upon the possibility of opening Communion to divorced Catholics who have remarried outside the church, the issue will likely be the subject of further heated debate at the next such meeting — known as a synod — in October.The working document firmly rejects welcoming gay couples into the church, suggesting there will be little change in the Vatican’s position on same-sex unions."
