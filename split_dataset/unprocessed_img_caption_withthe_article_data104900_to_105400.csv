Between public, private and individual donations, we are making tremendous strides in turning the tide on this disease and stopping it in its tracks. Just this week, three of the major technology giants -- Facebook, Google and Microsoft in the form of Paul Allen -- have given to nonprofit groups working on the ground, including ours, because they care, first and foremost, but also because they know that their contributions will help our organization, and others on the ground, ""have an even greater impact.""That impact is being seen already in the form of Save the Children's first specialist Ebola Treatment Center, which opened in Sierra Leone earlier this month, and our first Ebola Community Care Center, which opens in Liberia today. Save the Children is building a total of 10 Community Care Centers in Margibi County, Liberia -- smaller centers where people can go and get tested, where those testing positive are isolated from others before being transferred to a more sophisticated Ebola Treatment Unit, getting basic care while waiting for a bed and receiving visits from a mobile team of doctors and nurses. Both places ensure that children receive the care and protection they so desperately need and aim to prevent further transmission of the virus.When I was in Liberia last month, it became immediately clear to me that children were among the most vulnerable -- as they are in any crisis. Indeed, 2.5 million children under five are living in the hardest-hit areas across the region, and 75 percent of all children infected in the current epidemic have died. Even those who are not infected themselves risk losing their parents to this terrible disease and often end up alone and ostracized by their communities. Fear, like the virus, is spreading rapidly.We obviously need to break the back of transmission of the disease -- reducing the reproductive rate of cases to below one -- but we also need to bring down the fear. The public health messages, chlorinated water, and radio programs are helping, but people must leave their houses and get into care and stop infecting others at the first sign of symptoms. Tragically, there is just not enough care and beds available.The generous support of donors like Google, Facebook and the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation is certainly helping us meet some of that demand, but additional resources are still needed to close the gap entirely.

This episode was about rights, being right, and admitting you're wrong:  1) Amelia gets outed as a recovering addict when some horrible woman recognizes her from NA. There was probably a better way to handle that, but the drama factor was upped 10 points. Derek jumps in -- not to save her, but to take the surgery, and maybe her job. Fellow addict Richard helps Amelia understand that she doesn't have to talk to anyone about her recovery as long as she's not slipping and using again. But our rights are usually meddled with and sometimes it's best to come out with it. Derek sort of tells Hunt that she's not good enough for the job, but that's because he wants it, too. We finally get some flashbacks of their childhood and learn McDreamy has a heart and a conscience. Sort of. I used to adore that man but he makes me mad these days. Rock bottom? I don't buy it. 2) Because he's also wrong to be so mad at Meredith! Time-outs for sex or not, they need to figure out their game. While they avoid each other, at least there's time for Maggie and Meredith to make up. Maggie, as is her right, tells Meredith how mad she was about that dinner and admits she has no friends. After work, they all gather at Karev's (or Meredith's, depending on how much of a stickler you are) house to get drunk and giggle on the couch. They toast O'Malley. Maggie's in with the cool kids. Arizona is in the guest room and Jo is hiding from her bosses upstairs. It's sort of perfect. 3) About Arizona. She decides to be hardcore and not tell Owen about how Geena Davis is going to die before the winter final, probably, so she can learn radically new techniques to save babies and moms. It's honorable. But I feel a loud conversation about medical ethics with Hunt in his office is coming and it won't be pretty. What did you think?

It was theirs now until they didn't want it anymore.,2014-11-14,"NEW YORK - MARCH 31: Gutiarist Pete Townshend of the rock and roll band 'The Who' rehearses on his Fender Stratocaster electric guitar backstage of their performance at the 'Murray the K' show on March 31, 1967, in New York City, New York. (Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb48b442400005100561c54.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"July 8, 1967.I went to the first full-length Who concert in New York at the very run-down-but-once-sorta-glorious Village Theater on 2nd Avenue at East 6th St.No preamble tonight... Let's get to the gig...I loved/love that the light show, one of the very earliest, that July 8th, was called After The Third World Raspberry and featured ""Psychloramic Lights""! The word, ""psychedelic"" was still a few months away from being formalized. Frankly, ATTWR's work was anemic crap compared to Joshua's Light Show, still eight months away from arriving with Bill Graham to transform this pit of a theater into the fabled Fillmore East. But we loved the effects, knowing no better. We sat through the noble, but after three songs, mono-chromatic Richie Havens. Then, The Blues Project thoroughly redeemed themselves after that bizarre non-performance we'd witnessed at Murray The K's show a few months earlier. This was a hot hot band! Very tight. Very tough. As close as New York City got to the mighty Paul Butterfield Blues Band in Chicago.My Who Freak pal, and later, bassist of my band, The Planets, Anthony Jones and I then suffered the first 15 minutes of Chrysalis, a dishwater local band long since disappeared under the waves.And then, along with a few dozen other brats, made them suffer the next 15 with lusty teenage cries of ""Get off the stage!"", ""We want The Who!"", etc.The stage was kept extra dark while The Who's gear was put in place. The stage lights blasted on as The Who hit the beginning of ""Substitute"".  The Who put on the most outlandish and visually arresting show I'd ever seen.There were three Vox Super Beatle amps on either side of Keith's enormous double-bass drum kit. In 1967, this looked like a wall of death by guitar and bass. Truly, for a guitar boy, one Super Beatle was a thrill to see. Six in a row was sensory overload. Ironically, The Who, among the very first clients, had long been using far-superior Marshalls in England, but, had to make due with rented Vox amps in the States, something that pissed Pete off no end when Jimi had shown up about two weeks earlier at Monterey Pop with his Marshall stacks. Jimi's manager, Chas Chandler, had been bassist in The Animals. He knew exactly how important those Marshalls were. The Who's management team, Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, were non-musician clueless. Historic Irony... not only were Marshalls far and away the loudest, best sounding amps ever made at that point, but, Pete Townshend literally drew Jim Marshall the iconic design on a napkin at a pub... ""Jim, I want two square bottoms with four 12s in each and a separate head I can put where I want.""Voila, the Marshall Stack, the most venerable and imitated amp of all time. Hell, by now, it's a pop culture icon! Thanks, Pete!Keith's sensational drum kit out-shined the six Vox amps, soon enough, literally. The entire kit was covered with all kinds of cool drippy neon-colored psychedelic graphics, Union Jacks, and sepia pin up girls from the 1900s, over a black background. Dazzling! A work of art as much as a musical instrument. Now, an icon drum kit, this was its first appearance in New York.John Entwistle was wearing (Yes!) the infamous Union Jack jacket, complete with a garish candy-apple red Fender Jazz bass with matching headstock. His black-as-coal hair and mutton-chop sideburns were exactly like his publicity shots. He looked unreal, like a photo in a fan mag come to life.Roger was dressed exactly as he was at Monterey Pop, some kind of transvestite granny-fop hard-as-granite nut. The single most unconvincing poof in history. Very very odd! Disconcerting even. Like, purposely 359 degrees off. Oh, and, without a doubt, the first guy I ever saw in two inch heels.Pete, head to toe in icy white, was playing a sunburst Stratocaster. This, of course, meant, within seconds of the show beginning, I now had to have a Stratocaster, period. No discussion. A thought that obsessed me through the whole show. And... about seven weeks later, I sold a Danelectro guitar and a Premier reverb unit and used the money to buy a November 1957 Strat for a whopping $50! Yes, I still have it!During the guitar solo of the first song, ""Substitute"", every light on stage suddenly went out. Now, the entire drum kit was glowing. GLOWING! They'd surrounded Keith's drum riser with black lights. With all the lights off and the black lights on, you could only see Pete and John's snow white pants, the swirling multi-neon-colored graphics on Keith's kit... and the fact that Keith's twirling drumsticks glowed green in the dark, too! After the show, I saw someone in the lobby with one of Keith's sticks. It was indeed pale green and at the grip end of the stick was stamped, ""Keith Moon - The Who - Pictures Of Lily"". I've never seen another.The highlight of the whole show for me (besides the last 30 seconds, of course) was my first ever exposure to ""a new one for us"", as Roger garbled in an intensely thick London accent, ""It's an old rock 'n' roll number by Eddie Cochran... 'Summertime Blues!'"" That song floored me. Still does! Later that summer, as a baby guitarist, I stumbled onto the three chord sequence in the same rhythm and attack and thought I'd come up with my first song. Played those three chords for weeks before I realized it was That Who Song! [Fun to note that Pete inverted the same three chords and came up with his classic, ""Baba O'Riley"".]Many months later, a dear Who pal, artist David Fratkin, came over to my house with a little 3 inch spool of recording tape. He told me it was a surprise. I wound it into my Dad's tape deck and out of the speakers came an incredibly murky ""Summertime Blues"" some friend of David's had recorded at a show. David and I listened to it something like 20 times in a row. ""Play is again!"" was that evening's mantra.The Who then played a superbly raw but tight take on their latest single, ""Pictures Of Lily"", contrary to Pete's swearing they never played it in the USA back then. It was also the one time I saw them perform one of Pete's less-heralded masterpieces, ""So Sad About Us"", which he announced simply as, ""So Sad"".The longer a band is playing onstage, the more human they become. This happened to the least extent with The Who of any band I've ever seen. But, yes, by about the sixth song, they started taking on a certain almost-human quality and I was able to start analyzing the sounds I was hearing.One of The Who's most significant sonic qualities came for the fact that all three instrumentalists had deliberately exaggerated their high end. While Townshend and Entwistle's guitars rumbled and thundered, both had a very raw almost brittle top end to their sound. Add to that the fact that Keith, ever the complete rule breaker, rode on crash cymbals. This alone created a white noise wash across the sonic spectrum of The Who, akin to a jet engine, as Roger described Moon's playing the first time he sat in with him, Pete and John on Bo Diddley's ""Road Runner"", also the song where Pete ""discovered"" his patented string-scrape with his pick. While a drummer will likely wince at this absurd reductivism, there are really only two kinds of cymbals, thick and thin. The thicker, the deader, the more useful to ""ride"" on, a more open looser feel than keeping your 4/4 tempo on the open/close high-hat cymbals. The thinner the cymbal, the louder, the splashier, the shorter the duration. Keith didn't bother with ride cymbals. He had 3 cymbals out front and one over his floor toms. All four were crashes.  Combine the three layers of sizzling high end and, while you heard the music clearly, there was this sonic element that was just, well, intimidating, uniquely aggressive. An aural assault!And when Pete hit his fuzz-pedal, Jesus, it wasn't really even music anymore. I had simply never seen or heard anyone play bass remotely like John Entwistle. Both Chris Squire from Yes, and Greg Lake of King Crimson and ELP, neither of particular interest to me, but, both rightly acknowledged as modern bass masters, have publicly stated that seeing John at the Marquee Club at those Maximum R&B Tuesdays, changed their lives, made 'em buy basses. 100% The Ox's doing... the world over! Entwistle (and God, he and Keith had the coolest last names in any Brit band) just flew around the neck, wildly spinning out flowing riffs, unwinding like an endless serpent. He was theatrical in his fingering, making both hands look like spiders leaping around, even from the 15th row. And, John ""The Ox""... was... LOUD! Pete's guitar could and would fight through, but, fight was the operative word throughout the entire set. It was at this show that I realized John's semi-subtle shoulder-shrugging sighs of boredom were as much theater as Roger's mic-lasso, Keith's stick-twirling, Pete's leaps and windmills.Keith... What can you say... Keith was The Who.  Noel Gallagher of Oasis, a band I have no truck with, really boiled Keith down to five words: The Jimi Hendrix of drummers. I am madly in love with Ringo, the most underrated rock musician of all time. Charlie Watts is a pure hero to me. Bonham was The Rascals' Master Dino Danelli's greatest disciple. But, Keith Moon? The mold was broken BEFORE they made him. An ADHD savant-virtuoso. His style has been described as the sound of a drum-set down a staircase. Add to that a technique of inhuman ability. One listen to ""Young Man Blues"" on Live At Leeds is enough.I would occasionally read Downbeat magazine back then. A pure jazz publication, I would read the interviews with jazz giants I barely knew anything about just because they were so opinionated and sick-knowledgable. Both Elvin Jones and Tony Williams, two of jazz's monolithically monumental drummers by anyone's standards, in separate interviews, both cited ""that guy in The Who"" as the only rock drummer that impressed them. To be fair, Elvin also mentioned Ringo. Yes!It was at this show that I got my first taste of just how utterly skewed and off-the-rails this band's overall dynamic was. The Who had to be the first group ever where the lead singer was the least important guy. This might have been the single most dramatically odd and compelling element of The Who's stage show. And Roger Daltrey was/is a genuinely and organically charismatic guy, and as strong and dramatic a singer as anyone you could name. But, he was surrounded by three actual savant/genius/hoodlums. Daltrey's saving grace (besides his magnificent voice) as a visual presence wasn't his ultra-cool extreme-fashion statements (he really was dressed like Norman Bates' mom at this show), it was the absolutely seething toughness he exuded. I can't think of another rock star who gave off this vibe as powerfully. It was clear from the 15th row, you wouldn't fuck with this semi-transvestite unless you wanted to have to drink your breakies and dindin through a straw for six to eight weeks. He famously knocked Pete out cold for several minutes with one punch during a rehearsal in the early '70s after Pete threw his guitar at him. Now, Daltrey's a rock statesman, (a leftie, too, God bless him!) but back then, Rog was a thug, plain and simple. The aura of menace on their first US Decca release's cover, was plainly evident live and in person. Particularly with Roger Daltrey.The Who's music/act was almost a weapon. They took the stage with something akin to an invasion/occupation. It was theirs now until they didn't want it anymore. Okay!? That Abby Hoffman chose this band to interrupt at Woodstock indicates that poor Abby was indeed tripping on that fuckin' brown acid. Over the decades, Pete has had many a wonderful, provocative, quote. But, if I had to choose only one, it would be from a Nik Cohn article in Eye magazine, early 1968... ""We never let the music get in the way of the show."" Chisel in granite!About five times that July evening, Pete broke into really serious lead guitar playing. In the middle of windmills, leaps, power chords, feedback, he'd suddenly be shredding 1967-style. Each time, within maybe ten seconds, he'd cut it dead with some huge blustery stage move that conveyed an attitude of, ""Why waste my time playing real guitar for you? You don't care and, frankly, neither do I. We both know this bit of plank and wire won't even exist 20 minutes from now... and that's what you're fucking here for, right!"" About halfway through the show, the PA crapped out.The Who launched into John's theme song, ""The Ox"", the absurdly over-the-top instrumental loosely based on ""Wipeout"" meets ""Green Onions"" from their first album. Pete came close to smashing that Strat several songs too early. He actually played paddle ball with the tremelo bar, holding the Strat straight out, flat, in front of him, by the trem bar, and shaking the bar with what seemed the intention of snapping it off. He did the trick twice and I have no idea how the bar survived or how the guitar stayed in tune. And, it did!   Years later, the same thing happened one night at the Fillmore East. Guitar amps okay, but, no PA for about 5 minutes. That night, The Who actually played ""Green Onions"". Turned out Pete knew all of Booker T's organ parts. It was kinda cute to see his concentration on getting them right, clearly something they jammed on a few times a year.And yes, July 8, 1967, was back in the days when they still set off smoke bombs during the chaotic coda of ""My Generation"". Even knowing it was bullshit, it still looked just fantastic. At one point, just before the Coda of Chaos began, all the stage lights went out again, but this time, while Keith's kit glowed in the dark, there was a tight hot white spotlight no more than two feet wide that landed square on Pete Townshend's white-clad ass. While The Who basically just made raw howling noise, Pete shook his ass at all of us. It was ummmmm memorable.The destruction was thorough. That gorgeous new sunburst Fender guitar definitely did not make it to another show, that much I know. I saw the pieces fly!I vividly recall, for me, the most thrilling little factor: Pete really seemed to have nothing but total contempt for the guitar. None of that ""sacrificing something I love"" jive. More like, ""Fuck this cookie-cutter piece of shit!"" A piece of shit that me and many hundreds of thousands of other kids worshipped like a sacred object. It was that impression of total jade-ment and his haughty disdainful dismissive anger, actually something akin to an ennui-fury, that made its mark on me. There was a distinctly Clockwork Orange vibe about The Who. The wanton destruction had a harsh indifference about it. Although, with Keith Moon, you did get a dose of rabid glee, too. They really never came off remotely 'zany' during the smash-ups. Pete, especially, would often look really really pissed off. God, whatta thrill!The sad fact was, I was a kid whose parents' marriage was dramatically falling apart. My reaction... I was always angry. Pete manifested my anger and vented it in the most spectacular way, destroying that which I coveted most. Pete Townshend was blindingly, impossibly, cool.The fact is, this show has taken on a remembering-a-dream-like quality over the decades. I do know this: I arrived at that venue that night an excited Who fan... and left a Warped Zealot!"

On Sunday, Nov. 9, 2014, Iraqi officials and state television said al-Baghdadi has been wounded in an airstrike in western Iraq. An Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press on Sunday that the strike happened early Saturday in the town of Qaim in Iraq's Anbar province. (AP Photo/Militant video, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1cd58200000e500ffc1b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Recent news stories have not been showing the better side of men. From police brutality to domestic violence and international terrorism, we've seen stories lately to raise horror and concern. We've seen a white male cop gun down a young black man, apparently for walking while black on the streets of Ferguson, Mo. We've seen a NFL halfback, Ray Rice, slug his fiancée on an elevator so viciously that she fell unconscious. We've heard of another player, Ray McDonald of the San Francisco 49ers, who apparently hit his girlfriend during a party. We've heard of Adrian Peterson, one of the great running backs of all time, beating his baby child. There are now documented cases of 56 serious cases of domestic abuse by NFL players in the past eight years, yet in most cases there was no punitive action taken by either NFL or law enforcement. And it's not limited to the U.S., or the world of football. We hear of young men in ISIS who are beheading journalists at will while recruits for ISIS pour in from around the globe. Recently I saw a YouTube recruiting piece from ISIS where young men, dressed in full beards and with machine guns on their laps, tell the viewers to join ISIS and the ""the cure for depression is jihad.""It is true that many young men are depressed these days. Given much that is going on in society and in our depleted earth community, one can see why. And given the dearth of healthy male role models one can understand the depression. Realistically, what are we to do with it? As I see it, the real issue has to do with what passes as masculinity in our culture. Recently two authors teamed up to express their opinion on these matters in a thoughtful article entitled ""Depression in Men Is a Public Health Problem"" by Dr. William Pollack, author of Real Boys and Jennifer Siebel Newsom, filmmaker of The Mask You Live In, a documentary exploring the bad images of masculinity among boys. In their article, they point out that boys are more likely to act out their depression than are girls, and so ""the early warning signs of depression in boys are often missed, leading to a misdiagnosis as a conduct disorder or attention-deficit disorder."" Young men in the U.S. are committing suicide on an average of three per day -- five times the rate of women. The authors conclude: Depression in males of all ages is a public health crisis that must be addressed. To do so, we must redefine healthy masculinity and recognize that even if men are putting on a face suggesting 'everything is fine,' real pain may be lurking beneath the surface.Some years ago, I addressed the issue of redefining healthy masculinity in my book The Hidden Spirituality of Men: Ten Metaphors for Awakening the Sacred Masculine.. Even today, the response from people on the frontline remains very strong. A Native American who has worked in prisons for 12 years told me that he'd found getting men to look within themselves was practically impossible -- that in prison men are always trying to project on others. After bringing my book into his program, he said it was the first he'd found that got men to look inwards and ""find the nobility inside."" That is key: Finding the nobility inside, the original blessing, effectively heals the lousy self-image that most men carry. And this is the process I offer in Hidden Spirituality: I gather ancient archetypes of the healthy masculine that take us far deeper than superficial messages of our culture (""be a winner; don't feel too deeply; be a Marlboro man,"" etc.). Such metaphors as Green Man, Spiritual Warrior, Father Sky, Hunter-Gatherer, Blue Man, Father, Grandfather and more, alert men of all ages to the greatness of which they're capable.In his recent Washington Post article, ""I Understand Why Westerners Are Joining Jihadi Movements Like ISIS. I Was Almost One of Them,"" Michael Muhammad Knight shares his own story to illustrate the appeal of jihad and ISIS to young men. He was attracted to jihad not by Muslim philosophy (of which he was ignorant), but by his growing up in American culture. Leaving his Catholic High School in upstate New York, he traveled to a Saudi-funded madrassa in Pakistan. He writes: It wasn't a verse I read in our Qur'an study circles that made me want to fight but rather my American values. I had grown up in the Reagan '80s. I learned from G.I. Joe cartoons to (in the words of the theme song) 'fight for freedom, wherever there's trouble.' I assumed that individuals had the right -- and the duty -- to intervene anywhere on the planet where they perceived threats to freedom, justice and equality.He learned from his (conservative) Muslim teachers that Muhammad had said that ""the ink of scholars was holier than the blood of martyrs"" so he eventually gave up soldiery aspirations to become a writer. But here is the crux of his testimony: We [Americans] are raised to love violence and view military conquest as a benevolent act. The American kid who wants to intervene in another nation's civil war owes his worldview as much to American exceptionalism as to jihadist interpretations of scripture. I grew up in a country that glorifies military sacrifice and feels entitled to rebuild other societies according to its own vision. I internalized these values before ever thinking about religion. Before I even knew what a Muslim was, let alone concepts such as 'jihad' or an 'Islamic state,' my American life had taught me that that's what brave men do.What DO ""brave men"" do? That is the question. What awakens a man's soul? What calls for courage and generosity and sacrifice and community? How does a boy mature to become a man? What values are we passing on to our boys and young men? The values of the reptilian brain (""be number one; conquer; win at all costs; control others"")? Or of the mammalian brain (compassion, caring and justice-making)?We are living in a teachable moment. All the bad news about men behaving badly offers us an opportunity to speak out, to ask the deeper questions, to redirect the messages our boys and young men are getting from a patriarchal and reptilian-brain-driven culture that is dangerous to women and men, children and the Earth. Feminist poet Adrienne Rich put it this way, writing about her two sons:What do we want for our sons? To discover new ways of being men even as we are discovering new ways of being women... a manhood in which they would not perceive women as the sole source of nourishment and solace... If I could have one wish for my own sons, it is that they should have the courage of women. I mean by this something very concrete and precise: The courage I have seen in women who, in their private and public lives, both in the interior world of their dreaming, thinking and caring, and the outer world of patriarchy, are taking greater and greater risks, both psychic and physical, in the evolution of a new vision... I would like my sons not to shrink from this kind of pain, not to settle for the old male defenses including that of a fatalistic self-hatred. And I would wish them to do this not for me, or for other women, but for themselves, and for the sake of life on the planet Earth.Rich has perceived deeply how men are stuck in ""a fatalistic self-hatred."" Men have internalized the lies about original sin preached not only by bad religion but also by bad consumer-capitalism more deeply than have women. Men need to find the original blessing, the ""nobility inside."" There lies the medicine for an obviously sick manhood that drives men to addictions, militaristic brutality and domestic as well as international violence."

According to AC/DC's bassist, Cliff Williams, and guitarist, Angus Young, Rudd would fail to show up to recordings in May for ""Rock Or Bust,"" the group's forthcoming album, due out Dec. 2. When asked if he would still tour with with the band next year, Young told HuffPost Entertainment, ""That's a bit of a question mark.""Rudd was charged with ""attempting to procure a murder"" (this charge was dropped due to ""insufficient evidence) and possession of methamphetamine and cannabis and threatening-to-kill. His bandmates had no prior knowledge of the news. ""It was a big shock,"" Young said. ""But we had issues with Phil before this. When we were recording, it was quite difficult to just get him in the studio. When we were in London when we were starting up to do the video shoot and stuff and it was the same then. He didn’t show, you know? That’s something we’ve got to resolve.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc140f9230000330093e2cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This is not the first time that Manuel Valls has proposed changing the name of the French Socialist Party. Truth be told, he is doing it today a bit less clearly than he did the day after the defeat of Mrs Royal in France's 2007 presidential election. Less clearly, too, than in October of that same year, when, in a review of my book, Left in Dark Times, he urged his fellow party members to dig ""deep into their history and into their name."" And less clearly than in May 2009, when he earned a scolding from those who were then the party's pundits.But that he has returned to the subject from the vantage point of his present position -- which is, like it or not, the head of the majority -- obviously gives his suggestion new weight. And this explains why the affair has provoked such an outcry from the guardians of the house of the dead, including, this past weekend, former prime minister Michel Rocard, the inventor of the ""second Left,"" who appears now to have found common cause with communist Pierre Laurent, the leader of what remains of the ""first Left,"" in attempting to bring the young and courageous prime minister to heel. Valls is right, of course.And for an essential reason handed down to us from the great nominalist tradition in philosophy. Names are never just names.The shadow of everyone who invented, bore, and defined a name stalks that name and sticks to its skin. Every name has a history: the history of the battles waged in that name or to gain control of it, and of those fought in the arena it defined. That being so, you have a choice.Either you consider the outcome of the battle: You reason -- as is fitting on the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Wall -- that ""good"" socialism won out over bad socialism, the democratic strain over frozen authoritarianism, but in that case it does seem as if, stripped of its old adversary and freed from the great dilemmas that it had been called upon to arbitrate, the name has become hollow, a signifier that has lost its use and purpose, a word without meaning, an acronym, an ideogram spinning in a vacuum as if demagnetized.Or you consider the history of the battle: This is how it is, you think, with the cells in a living body that still harbor the memory of a disease long after the disease has passed, memory that settles in the cells like sediment. In which case it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the name is haunted by too many evil spirits, weighed down or even overladen with too much foul, fossilized memory. You reason that, in this story of glory and infamy in which the worst and the best (in proportions not quite clear) came face to face, the worst simply looms too large to allow you to discern today the political form of the good, the vibrant, the unspoiled. I recall Albert Camus' remark that, whatever happens, the very word ""socialism"" will abide like a burn in the mind of half of humanity. I remember those Czech students at the University of Prague who, when Jean-Paul Sartre came to lend them his support in 1963, could not understand why he would cling to a doctrine that in their eyes had been fatally compromised on the granite tongues of tyrants.I think back to those rebels whom we called dissidents, whose message was that a word that could be used to refer both to Sakharov and Brezhnev, to the heirs of Alexandra Kollontaï as well as to those of Joseph Stalin, a word that could represent (as if they were two branches of the same family) both the ""solidarity of the shaken,"" in the phrase of Jan Patocka, and the suppression of a society under a shroud of state terror, a word that was never able to decide, so to speak, whether it was on the side of the yearning for freedom or of the will to despotism (and even of the desire for servitude) -- that word is forever lost to humanity.Manuel Valls falls within that tradition.He is a direct descendant of antitotalitarism, which, along with anticolonialism, is a pillar without which the European Left collapses and loses its bearings.In rejecting a name that cannot cast off that criminal past (a past that, in the French case, encompasses both Jean Jaurès and the anti-Semitic Jules Guesde, both the strict ethics of Pierre Mendès France and the cynical opportunism of Guy Mollet) -- in jettisoning a signifier that has become a concentrate of the catastrophic equivocations of Mitterrandism, the costs of which have yet to be reckoned, Valls is attempting to cut the Gordian knot that has forced his fellow party members to choose between demagoguery when in the opposition and betrayal when in power.The French Left can choose not to hear him. The diehards can continue to pedal along idly like Alfred Jarry's bicyclist, who failed to realize that he was dead.They can wave their wooden swords until the day the world discovers that, like Italo Calvino's knight, their armor is empty. Or they can bet on the ideological New Deal that is being offered to them.They can listen to the little bird telling them that what remains of the ""republican spirit"" and of the ""ideal of emancipation"" (the demand for which is clear in Valls's words, despite what his detractors say) can be saved only by bidding a very firm goodbye to the reactionary idea of socialism.Once that is done much will become possible, beginning with the construction of a new political group that will allow the French Left to catch up with other European leftist parties, to leave behind, finally and forever, its interminable, sickening nineteenth century, and to reform, repair, and -- yes -- change the world.

The existence of the Vatican Almoner dates back centuries: It is mentioned in a papal bull from the 13th-century Pope Innocent III, and Pope Gregory X, who ruled from 1271-1276, organized it into an official Holy See office for papal charity. Up until Krajewski came along, the almoner was typically an aging Vatican diplomat who was serving his final years before being allowed to retire at age 75. Francis changed all that, tapping the 50-year-old Pole to be a more vigorous, hands-on extension of himself. The almoner's duties are two-fold: carrying out acts of charity, and raising the money to fund them. (AP Photo/L'Osservatore Romano, ho)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f30320000099000188ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pope Francis' Almoner Archbishop Konrad Krajewski announced Thursday that three shower stalls will be added to the public restrooms in St. Peter’s Square so that the homeless in the area have a place to wash up, Catholic News Service reports.  Due to begin on November 17, the construction project will be tacked on to remodeling initiative for the restrooms that the Vatican already has in the works. Krajewski told La Stampa that he got the idea for the restrooms after speaking with a homeless man on Rome’s Via della Conciliazione in October. Franco, a man from Sardinia, had reportedly been living on the streets for the past ten years. It was the man’s 50th birthday, so Krajewski offered to take him out for a dinner. But Franco initially refused, saying that he “smelled.”“I took him [to dinner] with me nonetheless,” Krajewski said in a translation provided by The Local. “We went to a Chinese restaurant. During dinner, he explained to me that you can always find some food in Rome. What is missing is a place to wash.""Krajewski is now encouraging other Catholic parishes in Rome to follow suit by building their own showers for the poor.“It is not simple, because it is easier to make sandwiches than run a shower service,” Krajewski said. “We need volunteers, towels, underwear.”When asked if tourists would be offended by the presence of showers so close to the Vatican’s famous colonnades, Krajewski responded, “The Basilica exists in order to keep the Body of Christ, and we serve Jesus’ suffering body by serving the poor. Always, in the history of Rome, the poor congregated around the Basilicas.”The ancient role of almoner has been part of the Vatican’s charitable outreach since at least the 1200s. Krajewski was appointed to the post by Francis last November, with the explicit request to ""Go out and look for the poor.""Pope Francis has paid special attention to the plight of the poor during his young papacy. Last year, a source in Rome told The Huffington Post that the pontiff has left the Vatican at night dressed like an ordinary priest to join Krajewski on his nightly rounds to meet with the homeless. According to the AP, it's a practice he began when he was archbishop of Argentina."

This is the last press conference Draghi will hold as the ECB is in the process of moving into its newly-built headquarters away from the central banking district in Frankfurt. (Photo by Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31650250000cf0038a0a8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""Whatever it takes:"" Those three words, uttered by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi in July 2012, are some of the most important words ever spoken in Europe's history. They may have rescued the European monetary union.And they were ad-libbed.That's the claim of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, according to a transcript of an interview he gave in preparation for his recent memoir. The transcript was obtained by the Financial Times, which first reported Geithner's claim about Draghi's remarks. According to Geithner, when Draghi pledged in a speech in London to do ""whatever it takes"" to deal with Europe's sovereign-debt crisis and ""preserve the euro,"" he was making it up as he went along. Draghi, Geithner says, hadn't cleared his line-in-the-sand statement with anyone before he made it and wasn't even sure what policies he could or would use to back it up.Geithner, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment to The Huffington Post. An ECB representative also declined to comment. This is, of course, only Geithner's version of events. The Telegraph's Ambrose Evans-Pritchard is skeptical. Evans-Pritchard writes that Draghi did consult with German officials –- the European Union's de facto center of gravity –- before announcing the bond-buying program that backed up his words a month later. A senior official at the German Finance Ministry even bragged a few weeks before Draghi's comments that “nothing flies in the eurozone right now without our permission.” That would seem to include ultimatums promising to ensure the integrity of the European Union itself. The German Finance Ministry did not return a request for comment. The German official's bluster could be just that, but there is a lot of truth to it. One of the main factors, if not the main factor, constraining Draghi's response to the European crisis was Germany's refusal to offer any aid to countries like Greece and Italy without harsh, often self-defeating terms. If Geithner is correct, if Draghi really did spring his ""whatever it takes"" line without consulting the Germans, then Draghi was very clever to do so. It put the Germans in a box, forcing them to accept a public statement they likely would not have agreed to had it been pre-negotiated. Things in Europe would have gotten much, much worse if Draghi had not made his statement. And Draghi likely knew that there was a good chance he could make things better simply by making that statement, even if he had no plan to back up his words at the moment he uttered them. Draghi's statement, and the bond-buying policy that followed, had a huge impact on the stability of European debt markets. Before, Spanish ten-year bonds were hitting yields of almost 8 percent. They've been dropping ever since and are now just above 2 percent. The bond-buying plan Draghi used to back up his statement, known as Outright Monetary Transactions, or OMT, has worked despite never being enacted. Simply announcing that it existed -- not long after declaring that whatever the central bank did, ""believe me, it will be enough"" -- was enough to calm markets. Draghi understood that saying ""whatever it takes"" would force recalcitrant policy makers to act and markets to recalibrate. It's what academics call a ""performative utterance:"" Saying it makes it so. It was smart, close-to-spontaneous politics. And it likely saved the European Union. "

Confronting an electoral map in which they had to defend several Senate seats in red states, Democrats rolled out a timid midterm strategy built around avoiding white voter backlash, rather than mobilizing the base of Latino, African American, and young voters that had propelled them to victory in 2008 and 2012. At the center of this ill-conceived strategy was the president's decision to delay executive action to provide relief to millions of immigrants facing deportation -- despite polling showing that such action would have galvanized Hispanic voters.   The end result? The Democrats seriously damaged their brand with Latinos, a constituency that has been pivotal to their recent electoral successes -- and still managed to lose the Senate and nearly every major battleground election across the country.  The Democrats' misguided midterm strategy was designed in large part to help incumbents facing tough re-election bids in conservative Southern states, such as Sens. Kay Hagan, Mary Landrieu, and Mark Pryor. These three made a vocal and blatantly political appeal to the president to refrain from taking administrative action on immigration. They even went so far as to sign on to a Republican-led Senate measure aimed at blocking the president from using his executive authority to provide deportation relief -- a deeply personal slap in the face to Latino voters, a majority of whom know someone who is undocumented.   Having pulled the rug out from under the Hispanic community on executive action, Democrats did a moribund job of mobilizing Latino voters. According to an election eve poll, less than a quarter of Latinos who voted in the midterms say they were contacted by Democrats this election cycle.   Even Democratic candidates with a strong record on Latino issues failed to engage Hispanic voters. Colorado Senator Mark Udall, a vocal opponent of the president's decision to delay action on immigration, made little effort to trumpet his support for immigration reform, campaigning almost exclusively on reproductive rights issues. Less than half (46 percent) of Latino voters in Colorado -- who make up 15 percent of the electorate -- were aware that Senator Udall supported comprehensive immigration reform. In an election year in which immigration was hands down the top priority for Latino voters, that is an astonishing failure to communicate.  The Democrats' deliberate strategy of sidestepping Latino voters cost them dearly. Almost all of the Democrats who were supposed to benefit from the delay in executive action lost -- including Hagan, who won just 63 percent of the Latino vote in North Carolina, nine points less than Obama in 2012. According to the election eve poll, less than half of Latinos who voted this year -- and just one-third of registered Latinos who sat out -- think the Democratic Party truly cares about the Hispanic community.   The lessons of the election for the Democrats are clear: do not take the Hispanic community for granted. Lean in and embrace, rather than avoid, Hispanic priorities. To win, Democrats must focus on expanding the electorate, not worry about backlash from Republican base voters. And that means mobilizing Latino voters and championing their issues.   If they don't, Republicans can continue to win by attrition -- or by making their own inroads with Latinos. Consider Governor Brian Sandoval in Nevada, who more than tripled his share of the Latino vote in 2014 after supporting a driver's license bill for undocumented immigrants and Medicaid expansion -- two key Hispanic priorities. While he undoubtedly benefited from the lack of a strong challenger, Sandoval gained Latino votes by embracing issues they care about.  The 2016 elections are around the corner. If Democrats desire to retake the Senate in an election year that will include races in several states with large Hispanic populations, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, and Nevada, they must regain the confidence of Latino voters. Recruiting candidates with a strong record of support for Hispanic issues will be critical.   But the first big test for the party is right before them. The president must act boldly and swiftly to fulfill his promise of bringing relief to the millions facing family separation -- and Democrats in Congress must support him. Executive action on immigration is good policy, but as the 2014 elections made painfully clear to Democrats, it is also good politics. For in 2016, the road to the Presidency will once again run through Latino neighborhoods.-Loren McArthur, NCLR Action Fund ContributorComing Soon: Midterm Lessons for Republicans."

In this interview, she talks about feminism today and the need to be more honest with girls about the challenges they might face.   Omega: You've been working in the women's movement for decades; what do you see as the next frontier for women?Erica: I think we've only accomplished about half the revolution. Every time women make tremendous strides, the right wing gets terrified and creates laws making it hard to get an abortion or birth control. Most of these laws are struck, but we spend an awful lot of time reacting and undoing. We don't have a clear path forward, and that's been the case for feminism since the 18th century, when the idea of the rights of women actually began. Omega: How do you define feminism today?Erica: Feminism is really the right of women to be full human beings and to not be defined only by their childbearing function. It's very simple -- too much has been made of defining feminism. Feminism is really the right of women to be human beings. That's it, yet that's so frightening to a lot of people. A full human being wants satisfying work and love. A full human being is entitled to both, and is not simply defined by only one aspect of her being. Not everybody has to be a parent. In fact, in an overpopulated world where our resources are shrinking, it would be wonderful if people who didn't want children felt free to say so. In the 1970s, there was more tolerance for the idea that not everybody needs to be a biological parent. Omega: At times you've been labeled an ""outspoken feminist."" You've said that one of the problems with activism today is that people don't know where to begin because there are so many issues.Erica: Wherever you begin, it has to come from your gut. I was always a feminist. My mother was a feminist; my grandmother was a feminist. I always understood women had to fight very hard to do what they wanted to do in the world -- that it wasn't an easy choice. But I think the most important part is that we all want the right to be taken seriously as human beings, and to use our talents without reservation, and that's still not possible for women. Omega: Where might someone start if they wanted to become a more active feminist? Erica: The absolute bedrock of our independence is having control over our own bodies. You cannot be independent if the government or someone else says whether or not you can use birth control. Unless you're in charge of your body, you're not in charge of anything. I find it very provocative that we're going backward on Roe v. Wade, and every feminist has to make it absolutely clear that women are in control of their own bodies. I think that's really the bottom line of feminism.We've shown again and again, in every UN report on the status of women, that wherever women control their own bodies and have access to education, societies prosper. Men's fortunes go up, children's fortunes go up. This is not news--it's been proven repeatedly. Anywhere those things are threatened, we have to defend them.Omega: In Fear of Fifty, you discuss your life as a member of the ""whiplash generation,"" ""raised to be Doris Day, growing up wanting to be Gloria Steinem."" What would you say to women wanting to expand their role and break through expectations of what it means to be a woman?Erica: It's useful to know how much society's holding you back. My mother would talk about how she was told by the head of her art school that she was the best painter, but that she wouldn't get the biggest prize because she would waste her talent by having children. I think we have to get honest with girls about how they can expect the world to block them, and we have to prepare girls, and ourselves, to break through those blocks. Omega: What do you hope most for women in the future?Erica: I hope we don't have to keep going back over the same territory and winning the same rights over and over again. The battle for birth control. The battle for abortion. The parity of women's health. It's very depressing to think that you win these rights, but then you have to win them again, and again, and again, and fight the same battles over and over.Read more from Erica Jong.© 2014 Omega Institute for Holistic Studies, Inc.

Variety's TV Summit at Intercontinental Century City on August 6, 2014 in Century City, California.

Egyptian activist Wael Ghonim and members of Russia’s Pussy Riot are a few of the panelists scheduled to appear at the summit. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power will also attend, and will be interviewed on stage by Fusion hosts Alicia Menendez and Jorge Ramos, respectively.Lee stressed that the Fusion-hosted summit will consist of more than the one-time gathering in Washington, which will be live streamed and accompanied by related content for TV, digital and social. There will also be hackathons in New York and Miami, along with film screenings and a heavy social media component to draw participants around the world. RiseUp even has its own anthem.“This is not an event or a concert or a documentary or a web series or a social media campaign,” Lee said. “It’s all of them.”RiseUp's multi-platform nature and its focus on millennials echoes the direction in which Fusion has been headed as a media company. Fusion launched just over a year ago as a joint cable and digital venture between Univison and the Disney-ABC Television Group, and was initially aimed at young, English-speaking Hispanic-American viewers. The company has since rebranded itself as a news and cultural destination for the millennial generation more broadly.In recent months, Fusion has caught the attention of the media industry by scooping up digitally-minded journalists from outlets like The Atlantic, Vice, Reuters, Jezebel, Forbes and New York magazine. Several of these hires -- Anna Holmes, Felix Salmon, Alexis Madrigal and Tim Pool -- will be moderating panels Wednesday.Marcus Brauchli, the chair of RiseUp, told HuffPost that the summit is an opportunity for Fusion “to put a stake in the ground and say that this is the type of conversation they want to be a part of … and want to drive forward.” “It’s not a right-left thing,” Brauchli added. “There is an element of youth versus previous generations to this, which aligns quite well with Fusion."" Brauchli, a former top editor at The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, said the idea for the summit grew out of a conversation he had with Lee last spring about the intersection of social and political protests and technology. “Long before events like Ferguson, long before Hong Kong and the climate change protests, he and I were talking about how young people all over the world are simultaneously inspired by each other, perhaps to some degree guided by or empowered by technology, looking at ways they can change the world,” Brauchli said. Brauchli said Wednesday's event will provide leaders from these and other movements with an “unprecedented opportunity to learn from each other and understand the potential and possibility of these movements, and to inspire other people to take control of their world.”"

USDA photo by Tom Witham.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafd114260000cf008160bb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As I enter my third year of blogging on The Huffington Post, I would like to return to the post that generated the most debate and heat in the first two years. That post, from last September, ""Burying the Lede: The LGBT Community's Deafening Silence on Federal Transgender Employment Protections,"" provided in-depth background about the Macy v. Holder case, the most momentous federal trans-rights advance in our history, and the community silence that followed. It struck a chord.Today, thanks to the sterling reportage of BuzzFeed journalist Chris Geidner, we have reached a notable moment in movement history. Commissioner Chai Feldblum of the EEOC, the motive force behind the Macy decision, has spoken out publicly, and both the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) have now publicly stated their recognition of the significance of federal coverage of trans persons under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.Fred Sainz, Vice President for Communications for HRC, said, ""Both the Macy v. Holder EEOC decision and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) Directive 2014-2 have provided real, immediate remedies for transgender workers.""Mara Keisling, Executive Director of NCTE, added, ""We strongly believe job discrimination against trans people is illegal everywhere in this country under Title VII."" No lede being buried this time.What prompted this coming out from HRC and NCTE? Several weeks ago the National LGBTQ Task Force, coincident with the organization's renaming and ""Be You"" campaign, published several graphics that denied the reality of the Title VII protections brought about by the Macy decision and the subsequent actions taken by the EEOC and legal advocates on behalf of clients. There was no vagueness, dancing on the head of a pin or splitting hairs on the legalese as many organizations have done since the Macy decision. No, the statement was stark:""There are NO FEDERAL PROTECTIONS for employment non-discrimination.""Asked by me to clarify, Kylar Broadus, who had replaced Lisa Mottet at the Transgender Civil Rights Project of the Task Force, said:The Task Force follows the Macy decision rendered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) which is an administrative agency and not a court of law. EEOC rulings are used as guidance by courts of law in most instances. Courts aren't bound by EEOC rulings but usually give great deference to them. Court decisions rendered by appeals courts become law. A case has to be brought to win or set precedent in a particular circuit which is why there is still need for a federal statute protecting workers.An uninformed trans person, upon visiting the website or Facebook page of the Task Force, driven there by the organization's four-decades-long history of cutting-edge LGBT activism, including being the first national advocacy organization to embrace the trans community by setting up the Transgender Civil Rights Project in 2001, would leave feeling deflated and alone in the face of employment discrimination. If she didn't live in a state, city or county with explicit protections -- many of them thanks to the decade of work by Lisa Mottet, a former student of Professor Feldblum's, and her staff at the Task Force -- she would simply resign herself to the reality of discrimination.To prevent that, I have been hammering away at the new reality post-Macy. With the help of colleagues at Freedom to Work and the Transgender Law Center (TLC), as well as trans activist and icon Riki Wilchins of True Child, trans attorney and Lambda Legal board member Jillian Weiss and Gender Rights Maryland board chair Sharon Brackett, we published a brochure available on the TLC website explaining those protections. We've talked about them around the country, doing our best, with no resources, to educate the community. But without the clout of the HRC, NCTE and Task Force, our reach was limited.I ran into resistance speaking with the national media, as Task Force attorneys undercut my message to the community about Macy. One example occurred shortly after the decision, when Julie Turkewitz of The Atlantic, to whom I had spoken for 90 minutes about Macy at a trans conference, rewrote her work because she'd gone to the Task Force for a second opinion. What should have been ""Title VII now covers transgender workers in all 50 states"" was reduced to ""While the decision applies only to federal employees....""Members of the administration, including some at the EEOC, were perplexed by the silence on the issue, the vacuum at the top of the national advocacy community. This bewilderment began over two years ago but has increased since President Obama's long-awaited signing of Executive Order 13672 covering the federal-contractor workspace this past July, and the subsequent actions of the Labor Department to finally work proactively to protect trans workers under the Macy decision. Why, particularly with the end of any action on the Employment Non-discrimination Act (ENDA) for the foreseeable future, would the community surrender its one and only yet golden weapon for workplace protections? Why couldn't the community take ""yes"" for an answer? I still don't know, though I've heard many explanations, the most common being that pushing cases under Title VII will likely lead to adverse federal court decisions, or that nothing is settled until the Supreme Court rules. Some think court losses from more than a decade ago are still determinative. None of these fears makes any sense, because if you don't use your rights, they will never be tested, and who would be better off not even trying? Yet, as Geidner points out, there have been multiple cases since 2012, and the community has won almost all of them. The EEOC has exhorted the trans community to file suit; could we have a more important cheerleader? And as the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals (covering Alabama, Georgia and Florida) pointed out in the Glenn v. Brumby et al. case of 2011, which Vandy Beth Glenn won on 14th Amendment considerations pre-Macy (emphasis mine): [S]ince the decision in Price Waterhouse, federal courts have recognized with near-total uniformity that ""the approach in Holloway, Sommers, and Ulane ... has been eviscerated"" by Price Waterhouse's holding that ""Title VII's reference to 'sex' encompasses both the biological differences between men and women, and gender discrimination, that is, discrimination based on a failure to conform to stereotypical gender norms.This week Commissioner Feldblum spoke out against the Task Force's messaging:But [the Task Force statement] is incomplete -- both as a legal and practical matter. It fails to capture the reality that the EEOC currently helps thousands of individuals each year get recourse (& remedies) for their discrimination claims, without ever going to court. And they get that through the legal system set up for administrative relief via the EEOC. And that is what our 53 EEOC offices across the country are now doing right now for LGBT people under our Title VII jurisdiction. Thus, there are practical remedies being achieved through the administrative system right now in every state in the country.The commissioner's public statements prodded the HRC and NCTE statements, so now I can truly hope that the words of Tico Almeida, Executive Director of Freedom to Work and a long-time proponent of the value of the Macy decision, will be heeded:I would like to see the big national LGBT organizations use their ample budgets on a public education campaign to promote the historic nature of the Macy decision so that more LGBT Americans will know that the EEOC is open for business and willing to help.Until we get an ENDA with explicit protections or, better yet, an omnibus civil-rights bill that comprehensively protects the entire LGBT community, we need to make the most of what we have, and with a little luck Title VII may soon cover sexual orientation to the same degree that it now covers gender identity and expression. As many of us have long said, it's good to be out of the closet, once and for all. The Task Force should join us and enjoy the sunshine."
