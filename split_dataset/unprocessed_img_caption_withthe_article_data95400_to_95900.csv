0,POLITICS,Computerized School Testing Off To A Rocky Start In Florida,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/common-core-florida_n_6795140.html,,2015-03-03,Six year old boy learns the keyboard during a computer class.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ec10240000310098fc6c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Zachary FagensonMIAMI, March 3 (Reuters) - Newly computerized state tests were suspended on Tuesday in some of Florida's largest public school districts after students across the state struggled with faulty software.The 60-to-90-minute exams are a Florida version of the controversial Common Core standards that set national benchmarks for student performance. About half of Florida's school districts reported problems with online testing on Monday, according Florida Department of Education Spokeswoman Meghan Collins. Districts have this week and next to administer the exam, she added.Miami-Dade County Public Schools Chief Academic Officer Marie Izquierdo called the Florida State Assessment tests on Monday an ""epic fail"" on Twitter, blaming the state for hastily rolling out an unproven computerized testing system.The Miami-Dade school system suspended testing on Tuesday. ""We remain determined in our decision to maintain assessments suspended for today until such time that the state can confirm and assure us that their system are a complete go,"" said Superintendent Alberto Carvalho.Critics say the state is overburdening students with too many tests and that the FSA - taken on computer, not pencil and paper - favors wealthier, more technology-proficient students.Proponents argue the state needs standardized tests as a way to measure educational performance. The Florida School Board Association said it supports the tests, but not using the data to make decisions about students, teachers, and school districts.Florida's troubles give opponents of Common Core, who call it government overreach, a chance to cast further doubts on the program and its supporters. Common Core's most prominent backer in Florida is former Governor and possible presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who faces criticism from within the Republican Party over his longstanding advocacy.The testing system suffers from political manipulation, said Bob Schaeffer, Public Education Director for the National Center for Fair & Open Testing. ""We've had foul-up after foul-up over the last decade as politicians try to change the system to make it match their beliefs.""To date, 42 states have implemented all or part of the standards with varied success, Schaeffer said. Over the past year, states like Oklahoma and Louisiana have fought the program in federal courts.""There were several states in the Midwest, Kansas for example, where they had to cancel the scores because of huge breakdowns,"" he said.Meanwhile, some large Florida school districts, like the one on the state's west coast where Tampa is located, opted to resume testing on Tuesday despite snags.

Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, president pro tempore of the Senate, on look, March 3, 2015. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ec122400003200577915.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On March 5, 1946, almost 69 years ago to the day, former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill gave his famous ""Iron Curtain"" speech before an audience of thousands in Fulton, Missouri. Churchill was in Fulton at the invitation of Westminster College, where he spoke. He traveled there aboard a train, accompanied by President Harry Truman. In his speech, Churchill declared that ""an Iron Curtain has descended across the [European] Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of central and eastern Europe... all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere."" At the time of his speech, the world was less than a year removed from the horrors of total war which had gripped Europe. The United States was engaged in difficult diplomatic maneuvering with the Soviet Union over the shape of post-war Europe. George Kennan, a renowned American diplomat then stationed at the United States Embassy in Moscow, had just written his famous ""long telegram"" which served as the foundation of a developing policy of containment of Soviet power and influence by the United States and its allies. There were concerns among hardliners in Washington, DC, London and elsewhere (Churchill foremost among them) that the United States might, in the aftermath of a successful campaign against one existential threat (Nazi Germany) lose focus on the existence of another (Soviet Russia). Churchill's speech was intended to provide some ""stiffener"" to the spine of American politicians who, in his opinion, might be inclined to avoid confrontation with the Soviets in the short term, with long term consequences. There was, at the time, a risk of America returning to its pre-war policies of isolationism. Churchill opposed such a stance, and vociferously spoke out about the real consequences of such. His was a non-partisan, apolitical message which cut across party lines, and it was well received by his American audience.On March 3, 2015, the serving Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke before a joint session of the United States Congress about the existential threat to Israel and the world -- including the United States -- by what he termed Iran's nuclear weapons program. Netanyahu was at the nation's capital at the invitation of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ohio Republican John Boehner. Netanyahu, in a breech of protocol, had failed to consult the President of the United States, Barak Obama, about his visit. His appearance before the assembled elected political might of the United States Congress came little more than a week removed from a closely contested election in Israel where Netanyahu's continued tenure as Prime Minister is anything but assured. Netanyahu claims that his speech, which attacked a looming deal being negotiated by the United States, Russia, China, France, Great Britain and Germany with Iran over its nuclear program, was a wake-up call about a bad deal that would empower an out-of-control theocratic state sponsor of terrorism with a break-out capability to produce nuclear weapons. Netanyahu and his supporters claim he has a case. That may well be. But one cannot escape the highly politicized environment, both here in the United States and back in Israel, which surrounded his appearance before the United States Congress. The level of acrimony that exists between the White House and Netanyahu because of this speech is unprecedented in the history of these two nations. Winston Churchill left Fulton, Missouri in the company of President Harry Truman, arm in arm. Netanyahu leaves Washington, DC having received the cold shoulder from President Barak Obama, and the subject of acrimonious commentary from a White House that feels betrayed by an Israeli politician -- not leader -- who has hijacked American national security objectives for his own political use.The merit of Prime Minister Netanyahu's case against Iran -- or lack thereof -- is not the focus of this piece. The concept of being lectured on the threat of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East by the largest proliferator of nuclear weapons in the Middle East is a bit disconcerting. Israeli politicians have been declaring the imminent danger of Iran's ability to acquire nuclear weapons capability ""in less than a year's time"" since before 2001. At some point in time the world must wake up to the distinct possibility that Netanyahu, like his predecessors, is merely crying ""wolf."" While I am loath to give Iran the benefit of the doubt when it comes to its nuclear ambitions, I do believe that the nations negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran take that task seriously, and that the reality of any threat posed by Iran's nuclear program is much more sober than the near-frantic hyperbole contained in the Israeli Prime Minister's speech before Congress.What is of interest here is the concept of process, especially as it applies to the foreign policy of a sovereign United States. According to the Constitution of the United States, the power to conduct foreign policy rests squarely with the executive branch of the government -- the President. This is done with the advice and consent of the United States Senate. The role of the House of Representatives is limited to that of the power of the purse -- allocating funds to pay for the execution of this policy. For the Speaker of the House to invite a foreign leader to appear before the Congress of the United States for the purpose of giving a speech which seeks to undermine the Constitutional prerogative of the President of the United States to conduct foreign policy represents about as big of a departure from the roles envisioned by our founding fathers as one can imagine. And to allow an Israeli politician to use the venue of the United States Congress as a platform for political grandstanding in support of his re-election bid is equally demeaning to Americans and Israelis alike.While some 50 Democratic members of Congress boycotted Netanyahu's speech, the majority did not. In retrospect, they may wish they had. Not since the time of Leonid Brezhnev's presentations before the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has one witnessed such a Pavlovian response to pointless politicized speech as occurred on the floor of the United States Congress, with American politicians being ushered to their feet with every carefully crafted sound bite uttered by the Israeli Prime Minister -- American politicians whose loyalty to the State of Israel would, by their actions, seem to trump their loyalty to the system of checks and balances that are the bedrock of American democracy.It is not that I don't agree with much of what Netanyahu said -- I do. There was also much with which I disagreed. This is fodder for another debate on the merits of his argument. But it wasn't his place to say it before the United States Congress in the manner he did -- at the behest of a political opponent of the President, in opposition to American foreign policy objectives, in support of a domestic Israeli political campaign. The public relations value of the imagery presented by a sea of awe-struck American politicians surging to their feet at the beckoning of Bibi Netanyahu has considerable political value in Israeli politics, something any American politician who has undergone a tight election should understand. As President Obama observed after Netanyahu's speech, there was ""nothing new"" in what the Israeli Prime Minister had to say. Rather than put at risk the relationship between Israel and the American President by inopportunely accepting what was obviously a politically motivated invitation from the House Speaker, the Israeli Prime Minister could have just as easily found an appropriate forum -- his version of Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri -- to make his case. He could have done so at a time that was far less sensitive to both Israeli political sensibilities and American sovereign concerns. Who knows -- his words could have gone down in history as the modern-day equivalent of Churchill's ""Iron Curtain"" speech. Instead, his speech will be forever viewed as a blustery blunder, an unwise foray into the festering sea that defines domestic American politics today, designed to interfere with the sovereign right of the American people to pursue an independent foreign policy, while reinforcing his own bid for continued political relevance in Israel. The deal that is being negotiated between Iran and the world over its nuclear program will succeed or fail on its own merits, Bibi's American sojourn notwithstanding. The consequences of failure are grave, both in terms of accepting a deal that fails to check any potential for an Iranian nuclear weapons program, or failing to close a deal due to misplaced fear and undue pressure brought to bear by outside parties. Either one pushes the West and Iran to the brink of conflict at a time when the Middle East is already burdened with ongoing sectarian strife and regional unrest. Netanyahu's warnings aside, Iran simply does not pose the kind of existential threat to international peace and security that a Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia did. We do not live under the same reality faced by the world in March, 1946, when Churchill gave his famous speech. As Americans, we would do well to keep our own counsel with regard to our own sovereign interests regarding Iran and its nuclear program, and not let political bickering between the House Speaker and the President, or an Israeli domestic election, determine the path we eventually choose to take."

(AP Photo/Jason DeCrow)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c5a72200004301dc884e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Liberal watchdog Media Matters has sent a letter asking New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan for a “prominent correction as soon as possible” on a story about Hillary Clinton’s use of personal email during her tenure as Secretary of State. The Times’ story, which says Clinton “may have violated federal requirements that officials’ correspondence be retained as part of the agency’s record,” has come under fire for failing to specify which laws or regulations Clinton may have violated.After the article was published, several journalists and outlets, including Media Matters, argued that the relevant Federal Records Law provisions outlining how private email should be handled were only finalized in 2014 — well after Clinton left office. Citing the author of the Times piece, however, Politico’s Dylan Byers contends that the relevant National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) rules date from 2009 and require ""agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.”Media Matters Chairman David Brock* writes:While the Times did report that former Secretary of State Colin Powell also used a private email account, rather than a government-sponsored email address, you reported that he did so ""before the current regulations went into effect.""The Times' public editor published a piece this afternoon addressing concerns about the headline of the Clinton piece but did not directly clarify which laws or regulations the newspaper was suggesting the former Secretary of State violated.*CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story identified Media Matters President Bradley Beychok as the author of the letter.

I'm not smart enoughWe're not all meant to be Einstein. Successful people don't have to be smart. They just have to be smart enough to have smart people around them.2. I don't have the right degree/titleHello? Steve Jobs. Richard Branson. Mary Kay Ash. Frank Lloyd Wright (look it up). Not one of these people had a degree in the industries they ruled. It's wonderful if you have a formal background in a particular field. However, a degree doesn't give you permission to excel. You do.3. I'm brokeMoney can make some things easier but it doesn't rule everything. Money can't buy innovation. If you are creative, passionate, and persistent enough, someone else will be willing to invest. Other people's money works just as well as your own... if you have any.4. I'm too old""You can't teach an old dog new tricks."" Correction. You can't teach uninterested, lazy, complacent dogs new tricks-or scared dogs for that matter. Age should be used for nothing more than record-keeping purposes. People who say this should be old enough to know better.5. I don't have any connectionsIn the time of social media, the theory of six degrees has been cut down to two or three. Virtual connections have shown themselves to be just as important as physical ones. Be valuable enough to others and watch the network grow.6. No one will help mePeople who don't receive help are generally the same ones who don't ask for it. Requesting help makes people feel vulnerable which is something many of us don't want to be. Extraordinary people don't worry about how they might look. They just get things done.7. I don't know howThis is an excuse of the industrial age. These days, we suffer from information overload. If there is something you need to know, the answers are literally at your fingertips. If technology scares you, then ask someone to help you with it. See number 6. (Unfortunately, if technology scares you, this post will never cross your path...)8. It's too hardUnwillingness to take on a challenge is the proclamation of the complacent. Living in a box is easy. Conversely, those who strive for excellence see living with constraints as hard. It's all in how you choose to frame it.9. I haven't done that beforeThe masses will choose to hide behind the familiar. Innovators thrive off of unfamiliar territory. The willingness to face the unknown will always separate the mediocre from the excellent.10. I don't have timeMany of us lead busy lives. However, busy does not necessarily translate into productive. Moving into excellence requires that we learn to value our time and engage in activities that reflect that. The bottom line is that we make time for the things we value. If you value success, you will find the time to work towards it.11. The rules won't let meRules are meant to provide guidance. They are not meant to absolve us of common sense, creativity, or vision. If you are in an environment that robs you of these qualities, mediocrity is a given. Excellence can't thrive in these conditions.12.

Brawn doesn't win over practice and determination.

From Paris: Photo: World ArcheryTo Shanghai:To Utah:And while you can watch most events on Archery TV, in-person spectators are usually welcomed. Did someone say vacation?Just as Intense as The Hunger Games... but Nobody DiesAfter a qualification round which usually consists of 72 arrows, archers then compete head to head, based on their ranking from the qualification round. Recurve archers shoot matches consisting of three arrow ""sets,"" shot at a distance of 70 meters.For each set of three arrows, the highest scorer earns two points, and ties earn one point each. The first archer to reach six set points wins the match. If the archers are tied at five points, the match goes to a single-arrow shoot-off, with the arrow nearest the center winning the match.For compound matches, archers shoot five three-arrow ""ends"" at a distance of 50 meters, which are scored cumulatively instead of using sets. The winner of the match is determined by the highest overall score out of a possible 150 points (ten possible points per arrow, fifteen total arrows). With a high caliber of shooting, these matches can be extremely close. Ties are broken by a one-arrow shoot-off.Archery competitions aren't as dramatic as Katniss Everdeen saving humanity from the Capital's corruption - but tension, drama and excitement still run high.Amazing Paralympic ShootersIf you ever need some inspiration, just watch the amazing Paralympians competing on the World Archery circuit.

He makes treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate; but he alone negotiates. Into the field of negotiation the Senate cannot intrude, and Congress itself is powerless to invade it. As Marshall said in his great argument of March 7, 1800, in the House of Representatives, 'The President is the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and its sole representative with foreign nations.'"" This consensus, respected by both parties for much of American history, is why John Boehner's sly decision to offer Benjamin Netanyahu a congressional platform to attack President Obama's negotiations with Iran may represent a watershed moment both for the Republican Party and American support for Israel. It's unclear whether the invitation says more about Republicans' confusion about who precisely they've been sent to Washington to represent, or more about the weakening influence of the conservative pro-Israel group AIPAC as pro-peace, pro-Israel groups like J Street and Jewish Voice for Peace have come on the scene. What seems clear is that when even Chris Wallace of Fox News is calling the Netanyahu-Boehner manoeuvre behind President Obama's back ""wicked,"" then something has gone very wrong with the Republican sense of the national interest.Netanyahu's speech may be evidence of hubris run amok on his part, but it is also a vivid illustration of the pervasive and destructive rise of partisanship in American politics over the last few decades. Even as the centre ground vanished on contentious domestic issues, there was at least the idea that the country should speak with one voice on foreign policy. Boehner's invitation to Netanyahu has taken a sledgehammer to that consensus. Many of the founders including Madison and Washington viewed factional interests as one of the main threats to the growing American nation. In Federalist 10, Madison defined faction as:""a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community."" For George Washington, the great fear would be what happened if the factions that animated Madison's concerns became intermingled with foreign influence, a theme which dominated the President's Farewell Address in 1796. Washington's warning of the dangers to the United States from the combination of foreign entanglements and factional interests seems more relevant than ever:""Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification. [...] And it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation), facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with popularity; gilding, with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation."" A clearer diagnosis of the Republican attachment to Netanyahu would be hard to find. Especially pernicious is the narcissistic obsession to be 'seen' to be pro-Israel at all costs. Concerned more with getting on the good side of AIPAC, lawmakers ignore the long-term interests of Israel, which are certainly not served by its land grab on the West Bank that have all but destroyed any possibility of a two state solution including a viable, contiguous Palestinian state.The Republican-Bibi lovefest stands in stark contrast to the short shrift given to the Prime Minister by the chief rabbis of France and Denmark after his recent calls for European Jews to emigrate to Israel. Almost unnoticed is that Netanyahu's recent message to Jews in European countries that they should come to Israel where they'll be safe seems irreconcilably at odds with his insistence that the Jewish state is facing an existential threat from Iran. Here, Netanyahu's use of the ""existential"" label has been undermined by senior former Israeli defence and security officials. Chuck Freilich, a former Israeli national security adviser, argues that the Iranians are ""probably rational actors,"" while the former head of Israel's internal security service, the Shin Bet, argues that the lack of a peace agreement with the Palestinians is more of an existential threat than Iran's nuclear programme. Claims by Netanyahu and others that just one Iranian nuclear bomb would be enough to destroy a ""small country"" like Israel ignore the reality that such a bomb would also wipe out the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, which is almost as sacred to Muslims as Mecca and Medina. Just why the Islamic Republic of Iran would want to annihilate one of the holiest sites in Islam along with millions of Palestinians, incurring the wrath of every Muslim in the world is unclear.Yet this is the apocalyptic premise that Netanyahu will conjure up before Congress in a hubris-filled polemic directed against the President's negotiations with Iran and the foreign policy of the United States. Congressman Steve Cohen believes that ""providing a forum of such immense prestige and power to the leader of another country who is opposing our nation's foreign policy is beyond the pale.""What makes the Republican decision to invite Netanyahu perhaps even more irresponsible than his decision to accept it, is that if President Obama's diplomatic negotiations with Iran fail, then Washington and Tehran may be on ""a path to war,"" as the writer Peter Beinart sees it. Would those Republican lawmakers that are funded by AIPAC to support the interests of a foreign state, ever be called to account if American lives end up being sacrificed because of the hyperbolic assertions of Benjamin Netanyahu?More serious even than Republicans putting the interests of Israel before their own constituents, is the mistake of equating Israel's interests with the one figure of Benjamin Netanyahu and the one party of Likud. According Netanyahu a party political platform to address voters shortly before Israel goes to the polls in a tight election illustrates the myopia of the GOP in seeing Israel only through Bibi-tinted spectacles. It is a condition that George Washington warned about:""Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people, to surrender their interests."" As Republicans prepare to do homage to Netanyahu at the heart of American democracy in order to sabotage the foreign policy negotiations of the current American president, cooler Republican heads might just wish to consider the counsel of its first president.David Miles is a Carnegie Scholar at the University of St Andrews researching Anglo-American and German constitutionalism.

Bush tours the remnants of a home after it was hit by a wildfire in San Diego, California, 25 October 2007. Bush viewed some of the hardest-hit areas during a helicopter tour, visited a neighborhood of San Diego, and met with rescue workers, firefighters and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The president's swift visit to California comes two years after he was accused of responding sluggishly to devastation in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. AFP PHOTO/SAUL LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae07cc2000003000ff300c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On March 7, many in the United States will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the march in Selma for voting rights. President Obama, Congressman John Lewis, and 95 members of Congress will join community and faith leaders and ordinary citizens to march through Birmingham, Selma, Montgomery, and Marion. Recently, however, it was reported that another individual would join the stage in Selma with President Obama: George W. Bush. To commemorate Selma is to honor all those who were beaten and terrorized by the police on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on ""Bloody Sunday."" It is to appreciate those individuals, many of whom remain nameless and faceless, who sacrificed their careers, freedom, bodies, and indeed their lives, so that African Americans could cast their ballots free from discrimination or exclusionary measures. We commemorate Selma to celebrate the work of these activists and the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But in 2005, President George W. Bush nominated John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court. Six years later, the ""Bush"" Supreme Court, under the leadership of Chief Justice John Roberts gutted the Voting Rights Act, paving the way for mostly southern states to establish measures that all but ensured a rise in black disenfranchisement. ""Our country has changed,"" Roberts argued. The Chief Justice maintained that there was no longer a need for southern states to have to seek federal permission to alter their voting laws. Since that decision, we have seen a number of states including Texas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Mississippi enact a bevy of laws clearly aimed at the black community and making it much more difficult to vote.In addition to Bush's picks for the U.S. Supreme Court, the former president's economic policies had devastating effects on the black community. As a result of Bush's refusal to break from trickle-down economics, deregulation, and privatization, we entered the ""Great Recession."" Moreover, Bush never believed in affirmative action, calling it ""the soft bigotry of low expectations."" Throughout his presidency, Bush claimed fighting poverty was at the top of his list, while only putting more African American children under the poverty line. The unemployment rate for African Americans reached over 10 percent during his tenure. And to pay for two wars, a prescription drug program for seniors, and massive tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent, Bush consistently proposed cutting numerous social programs that largely benefitted the black community. Those who defend Bush's record on race often point to his policies in Africa, which even win praise from progressives. However, one can argue that before the man-made Suez Canal, the Middle East was also part of Africa. How many lives were lost in Iraq? How many tortured? Did Bush's polices, not at least in part, create the environment that gave rise to terrorist groups that commit daily atrocities in various parts of Africa today?This August will mark the ten-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Almost ten years has passed since Katrina killed nearly 2,000 mostly poor African Americans. And as much as Bush has tried to explain away his decisions, we still remember that as Katrina blew two giant holes in the Superdome, pouring rain on thousands of individuals, George W. Bush flew to Arizona to have birthday cake with Senator John McCain. While Kanye West has since backtracked, I would argue he was right, when, in 2005 he announced, ""George Bush doesn't care about black people."" So as we get ready to commemorate Dr. King and so many others who marched to Selma, I would argue that George W. Bush has forfeited the right to march. He does not get to partake in such a solemn and sacred time in our history that moved us forward as a nation when all he did was set us back. We must never forget Selma. But we must also never forget Hurricane Katrina and the eight years of the Bush presidency."

I have memories of understanding what people were saying when they were speaking English as early as three years old of age, and understanding that they wouldn't be able to comprehend my words -- Spanish. My assimilation to the English language was quick, and I took off running with its adoption, and have since been involved in a messy love affair. It is because of this, even despite the huge nopal on my forehead, that people are often surprised to discover that Spanish was my first language. More likely, because now when I speak Spanish I can come out sounding like a gringa -- a total ""white girl."" In my defense, I had two battles to overcome to retain the Spanish I still know and am able to speak. With the education system as it still was during my elementary years, speaking Spanish in school was discouraged. I remember early on being reprimanded in class as the English-only speakers felt we were talking about them -- which, most of the time, we were. School quickly became an English-only environment. The second obstacle that I had against me was that I was not raised in a traditional ""Mexican home"" where Spanish was the primary language -- something that undoubtedly had helped and ensured others to keep their Spanish language. I was raised in a bi-racial home where English was our main language. My step father, my adoptive father, is American -- un gringo. I was four years old when my parents married, and I was put on a fast-track course into American culture.I struggled a lot with my identity growing up. I was unsure if I identified myself more as an American or Mexican -- it is still sometimes an issue for me. I had relatives who often told me that I did not have the ""right"" to call myself Mexican, as I was not born in Mexico, but with the nopal en mi frente, how could I also possibly identify with what has been the traditional view of ""American""? This question is made even more difficult to answer when we reside in the epicenter where these two cultures crash, creating an area of ambiguity: by the border -- la frontera. The idea that the region around the border contained its own culture along with its own version of Spanish didn't become a solidified concept to me until I began to feel the backlash for the type of Spanish I spoke when I left our cultural bubble -- this informal, hybridized version of Spanish was not considered ""proper."" It was almost as if I was being rejected by both the American and Mexican cultures because the version that I exhibited as was not ""right.""As I continued my love affair with English and the written word, I couldn't deny the fact that Spanish -- my first language -- was not something that could be ignored or suppressed. There are some words and expressions that cannot be translated into English. They roll off the tongue in Spanish in such an elegant way, that to turn it into English would chop it to bits and take away from its beauty. There is a musical tone and quality that exists in Spanish that is seductive without even trying. Without realizing it, when not being conscious of having and needing to speak English, these words and expressions would come out of their own accord -- they have a life of their own. It is when I am my most comfortable, when I'm not having to think about what I am saying, that I mix the two languages. More importantly, it feels right when they are mixed.The mixture of the two languages is indicative of the mixture of my two cultures. It is inherently who I am. I am Mexican, and I am also American. I am a hybrid. It has taken me a long time to accept that this is ok. I do not have to fall under the pressure of having to choose one over the other, nor do I have to fall under the negative stigmatization that to claim both is wrong. When I first stumbled on Gloria Anzaldúa's book, Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, I felt I had found the words of a kindred spirit who knew and understood the struggle of finding your voice when you have each foot standing in two different worlds. What I had found incredible was that her book was first published in 1987, yet still holds as much relevance as it did then -- maybe even more so today. This book spoke to me on such a spiritual level and brought a voice to the shame I had been feeling of not feeling like I was Mexican enough because my Spanish was ""broken."" But I am not broken; I am evolved, and more importantly, I am not alone. There are more like me who exist. Anzaldúa wrote: Ethnic identity is twin skin to linguistic identity - I am my language. Until I can take pride in my language, I cannot take pride in myself. Until I can accept as legitimate Chicano Texas Spanish, Tex-Mex and all the other languages I speak, I cannot accept the legitimacy of myself. Until I am free to write bilingually and to switch codes without having always to translate, while I still have to speak English or Spanish when I would rather speak Spanglish, and as long as I have to accommodate the English speakers rather than having them accommodate me, my tongue will be illegitimate.I wish I had read Anzaldúa's book sooner so that I could have understood myself sooner. I wish that more of us would read this book so that they can come to the same conclusions I have: I am not wrong or uneducated because I mix two languages. I am not less Mexican because I speak English. I am not less American because I speak Spanish. I am not less. I am more. I am me."

Follow these expert tips for easing your fear of flying. If you become an anxious mess every time you board a plane, you're not alone. ""It's a fear that's particularly difficult to tackle because we need repetition to overcome our fears,"" says Reid Wilson, Ph.D., a Chapel Hill, N.C.-based psychologist who has worked with American Airlines to devise fear-of-flying programs. ""When it comes to flying, repetition is costly. Most people don't fly frequently enough."" That's why therapists often work with patients to dissect what exactly might be bothering them, whether it's the fear of heights, enclosed spaces, or not being in control -- and then zeroing in on those issues. But what if you haven't resolved them yet, and you take off next week? We asked Wilson and other experts for some quick solutions.1. Learn how planes work. According to the National Safety Council, the odds of dying from a car crash in a lifetime is 1 in 112; the odds of dying from ""air and space transport incidents,"" which includes airplane flights, is 1 in 8,357. The problem with these stats, of course, is that it contains the word ""one,"" says Tom Bunn, a former Pan Am pilot who is now a licensed therapist. So it's helpful to understand how an airplane works, says Bunn, who also runs SOAR, a program to help fearful fliers. ""Everything you really need to fly a plane, there are two, three, or four of them, on board,"" says Bunn. ""Anything that can break, you have multiples of it.""2. Understand turbulence. Most airplanes can handle up to five G's of turbulence, and all are built to sustain at least 2.5. In mild turbulence G-forces vary the same as in a moving elevator, from .8 to 1.2 G's. Moderate is from .6 to 1.4 G's; severe is from .4 to 1.6 G's. If you need convincing during a flight, download the SOAR app; among other tools for calming your fears on-board, it contains a G-force meter. The next time you hit bumpy skies, you can whip it out, read how much G-force the turbulence is causing, and confirm there's no reason to worry.3. Train your brain. The amygdala, the emotional region of the brain, is wired to stress out a little when it feels like you're falling. Take the edge off by doing this exercise before you fly: Ask a friend to take one step up on a flight of stairs with you; now turn around so that you're both facing the floor, and put your arms around each other. Now jump down to the floor together. You just experienced free-fall -- exactly what you fear that the plane will do, but less terrifying. Ideally, your brain will associate the sensation of dipping, albeit in small part, with that positive experience.4. Focus on the purpose of your trip. Travel isn't about about sitting in a plane for three hours -- it's usually about exploring a new culture or seeing a loved one. So keep a picture of the destination or person on your smart phone. Notice the details, including the faces, shapes, lights, colors and other vivid features. Notice how these details awaken your intentions for the trip and remind you what the trip is about. ""Focusing on the higher purpose of your trip puts the fear into perspective,"" Jonathan Bricker, Ph.D., affiliate associate professor of psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle.5. Accept your anxiety. ""The more you don't want to feel worried, the more that feeling will come back,"" says Bricker. So instead, be open to it. Notice the sensation in your stomach and other parts of your body. Let it come and go. Don't judge it. Just observe it. ""Now mentally pack it into an imagined carry-on bag, which you can store above and below you -- the idea being that 'the anxiety is with me, but I bring it with me and still travel wherever I want,'"" says Bricker, who uses this concept as part of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, a program with the goal of managing anxiety as opposed to fighting it.6. Try relaxation exercises. Wilson suggests this breathing exercise: Fill your lower lungs, then your upper lungs with air; then exhale slowly while relaxing the muscles in your in your face, jaw, shoulders, and stomach. Turn your attention to the sound of your breath; if worries interrupt your focus, observe them coming and going, then go right back to focusing on your breath and the present. Wilson also suggests the ""10-Second Grip"": Grip the arm rests while contracting your upper and lower arms, stomach, and legs. Hold for ten seconds, then let go as you take in a nice full breath, and then exhale slowly. Repeat. ""If you can loosen the muscles in your body, your anxiety will reduce automatically,"" says Wilson, who is also founder of anxieties.com.7. Avoid alcohol and coffee. What's worse than feeling anxious? Feeling dehydrated, sick, possibly drunk, and anxious. Plus, alcohol is a crutch for avoiding your anxiety as opposed to managing it, says Wilson. If you truly need chemical help to calm down, talk with your doctor about getting an appropriate prescription medication for use before boarding or during your flight. (It takes about 30 to 45 minutes to take effect.) While there's no scientific evidence that natural remedies can treat jet lag, it wouldn't hurt to try a calming herbal tea as opposed to coffee (which can exacerbate jitters).8. Tap into your oxytocin supply. Oxytocin is the hormone produced during breastfeeding, when you see a baby animal, or romantic arousal. When your body is secreting this so-called ""love hormone,"" it has trouble secreting stress hormone at the same time, says Bunn. So try this next time you feel anxious on board: Envision feeding an infant, picking up a kitten, or cuddling with your partner while working a picture of a plane into the scene (OK, it's hard, but perhaps your significant other, or -- in the other scenarios, another person -- is holding the picture nearby); in doing so, you encourage the flow of oxytocin as opposed to cortisol in your bloodstream. Practicing before your flight will slowly nudge your brain toward associating planes with warm feelings.9. Keep track of the flight. When the pilot announces how long the flight will take, write it down. Find a map in your in-flight magazine and draw a line between your departure city and arrival city. Then divide the line up to coincide with the number of hours of your trip. Set your phone alarm to mark every hour. ""In Alcoholics Anonymous, you're told to take one day at a time; here, you can tell yourself to take one hour at a time,"" says Bunn.More from Condé Nast Traveler: These Are The Best Cities in the World 15 Places You Won't Believe Exist The World's Most Dangerous Trips Private Islands That Cost Less Than an NYC Apartment How Not to Look Like a Tourist In Paris 10 Most Underrated American Cities"
12,TASTE,The Trattorias of Milan,"John Mariani, ContributorPublisher of ""Mariani's Virtual Gourmet Newsletter"" and award-...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-trattorias-of-milan_b_6769766.html,"Tomatoes are less important than in the south of Italy, and risotto is proudly preferred over pasta.",2015-03-02,2015-02-27-MILANMATERAQLLEPOELNTAWITHGORGONALS.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-02-27-MILANMATERAQLLEPOELNTAWITHGORGONALS-thumb.jpg," Osso Buco alla Milanese at Al Matarel   A few weeks ago I wrote about staying and dining in some of Milan's finest hotels and restaurants, promising I would report back on the city's trattorias. So, here goes.  First of all, since Milan is Italy's most important business center--this year hosting the 2015 World Expo--it draws to it all the country's regional culinary styles. Thus, if you wish to eat Tuscan food, there is Bice and Alla Collina Pistoiesi; for fusion cuisine, Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia; for Piedmontese, delle Langhe; for Sicilian, Al Merluzzo Felice; for Abruzzese, Da Giannino. Specialty foods from all those regions are readily found at the gorgeous--and very expensive--Gastronomia Peck food halls (with a nice snack bar attached). Milanese (that is, Lombardian) cooking shares affinities with its neighbors to the north and east--Switzerland and Austria--so there is a good deal of butter used. Tomatoes are less important than in the south of Italy, and risotto is proudly preferred over pasta. The cold appetizer vitello tonnato is Lombardian, as are costoletta alla Milanese and osso buco--all featured in profusion in both the city's high-end ristoranti and most humble trattorie.   AL MATAREL Via L.S. Mantegazza 2 02-654-204 I will always admire the longstanding bastion of Milanese tradition and modernity, Alfredo Gran San Bernardo, but except for its grandeur, Savini may be ignored and the dreary Bouecc avoided. But among trattorias, I have a new favorite--al Matarel, a place recommended by my esteemed colleague Fred Plotkin, whose Italy for the Gourmet Traveler (5th edition) is invaluable. He said the food is terrific but warned me the owner, Marco, could be grumpy, especially to out-of-town visitors.  Well, the food was very, very good indeed. And Marco turned out to be one of the sweetest, most generous restaurateurs I've run across in the city. Once you show a sincere interest in food and wine, you've won him over, and you will be ably assisted by the English-speaking waiter who interprets. Al Matarel is just a short walk from the center city, and, grazie dio!, one of few places in Milan open on Sunday night. The interior has the typical look of a northern trattoria, brightly lighted, with red ceiling, pink tablecloths, ferns and flowers, wine shelves, and sturdy chairs, though Al Matarel is distinguished by a sprawling, bustling mural of Milan and, for reasons unexplained, cartoon-like seafood images. The trim patrician Marco, always in sleeveless sweater and ascot, takes pride in being 80 years old with a young wife and chef, Elide, who is 74. They've run Al Matarel for five decades, which has allowed her to perfect every dish, including several you won't find anywhere else.   The dialectically named rustin n'ga (right) is a succulent layering of shards of pink veal and roast potatoes cooked together. She also does a bubbling, sizzling casserole of Gorgonzola, potatoes and polenta with white truffles (above), in season, generously shaved over the top. There's Milanese headcheese, tangy and fatty, and her osso buco with saffron risotto is one of the best of this prototypical Milanese dish in the city. Marco suggested three tortelloni on one plate--with fresh funghi porcini, pumpkin and spinach with braised beef called stracotto--all sheathed inside delicate egg pasta. There was also a plate of tender ribbons of pasta glossed with just butter and parmigiano. For dessert, the dense chocolate cake will bring you to tears after a meal so satisfying, so honest, so perfect. My friend and I were nearly the last people to leave that Sunday evening, happily regaled by Marco with his opinions on Milanese food and Lombardian wines, like the Franciacorta sparkler we began with and the Oltrepò Pavese we had with dinner.  I had such a wonderful evening at Al Matarel, that I doubt very much I'll ever visit Milan again without paying homage to Marco and Elide. Al Matarel is open daily for dinner. A typical meal will cost about 40 euros, without wine, but with tax and service included.  BAGUTTA Via Bagutta, 14 02 7600 2767 bagutta.it After a long absence, I returned to Bagutta, a famous restaurant opened in 1924 by Tuscan Alberto Pepori (his family still runs it), who early on cultivated a clientele of journalists and artists, the latter exchanging paintings and murals for a meal. After the war it drew the international movie crowd and by the mid-1980s, it was, along with Bice, the favored trattoria among the fashionistas who worked and shopped on Via Montenapoleone and Via Bagutta, especially during Milan's twice-yearly Fashion Week. Many a buyer from Bloomingdale's and Saks was courted by a fashion designer here, over plates of tripe alla fiorentina or beans and black cabbage, still on the menu today.  Bagutta is still popular, though I was told the frenetic business people and fashionistas now rarely have time for a big midday meal. You will see American and other foreign women toting huge bags of newly acquired clothes, shoes and accessories from nearby Armani, Missoni, and Ferragamo. You need not dress up to go to Bagutta, but you might wish to preen a bit.   The murals remain in profusion--there was once a di Chirico painting here but no one seems to know where it is--and journalists from Corriere della Serra and Il Giorno still prefer the smaller rooms near the front hall, while the big open rear room (right) is for seeing and being seen, not least for watching the rolling carts of food go by your table, catching the aromas of white truffles and wishing you ordered more. Here the risotto alla Milanese, scented and colored with saffron, is wonderfully creamy, and the costoletta alla Milanese is as crisp and juicy as any in the city.  The menu changes seasonally, even daily, but the array of dishes stays well within tradition, and the wine list has some very good buys on very good wines, including old stocks of Tuscan bottlings.  Bagutta has not only very good food but a strong history to savor as well. Don't miss being a part of it.Open Mon.-Sat. A typical meal will run about 45 euros, without wine, but with tax and service included. PAPER MOON  Via Bagutta, 1 02-7602-2297 papermoonmilano.com Pio Galignani and his wife, Enrica Del Rosso, were the first to bring really good pizza to Milan, back in 1977, when they opened Paper Moon, named after a favorite American movie of 1973. Pizza in those days was far from the ubiquitous dish it now is in Italy--and everywhere else for that matter--and Paper Moon's was particularly thin and crisp crusted, perfect for the models and fashionistas to snack on after a runway show. The restaurant's two-level décor was also quite a bit more modern than most trattorias in Milan at the time, decked out in cool white, black and beige, with reed table mats and wicker chairs, roses everywhere, and an array of movie star photos you'll recognize. It's a style that has traveled well to branches in Istanbul and Qatar. (There was a NYC branch once, since closed.) It's a well dressed crowd that jams Paper Moon day and night, though casual chic is the call. Once you sit down you'll be treated to hot strips of olive oil-coated pizza bread called schiacchiata, which goes well with the beef carpaccio or the bresaola. There are 30 different pizzas available, from one with Gorgonzola, taleggio and parmigiano to tomato, mozzarella and artichokes. Lesser pizzaioli have mimicked Paper Moon's pizzas by making them thin as crackers, but the original has just the right heft and chew.    Pastas are also excellent--one of the best potato gnocchi lavished with Gorgonzola (below) I've ever tasted, as is the risotto, simply cooked with butter and parmigiano. They do a fine baby octopus with polenta, and there's a slew of grilled daily specials, from black cod to calf's liver. For dessert have the light semifreddo with espresso.  It's a great deal of fun to bask in the radiance of Paper Moon. At the next table is a new Russian model with her agent, at another a businessman spoiling his son with a plate of tagliatelle with white truffles. Over there, some obvious regulars, but then everyone is greeted effusively by the Galignani family. Paper Moon is as much fun as it is a trattoria for terrific food.Open Mon.-Sat. A typical meal will run about 45 euros, without wine, but with tax and service included."

Over the past few years, studies have highlighted the profitability of diverse casting and the lack of minority representation both in film and television. But a new study, released by UCLA’s Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies, goes one step further to pinpoint the root of the problem.Overwhelming white and male executives coupled with predominantly white rosters in the industry’s top three talent agencies are mainly to blame for the lack of diversity Hollywood, according to the university’s “2015 Hollywood Diversity Report.”This is the second annual study exploring diversity in Hollywood released by UCLA. This year’s report shows findings after surveying the top 200 films in 2012 and 2013, as well as every broadcast, cable and digital TV series during that same time period. The study was authored by Dr. Darnell Hunt and Dr. Ana-Christina Ramón, both of whom concluded the report by expressing how diversity in the industry is a top-down problem. “Because of the high risk associated with the typical project — most new television shows fail, most films underperform — individual stakeholders in the industry (typically white and male) look to surround themselves with other individuals with whom they feel comfortable, with whom they feel they have the best prospects for producing a successful project,” the authors wrote. “These latter individuals, of course, tend to think and look like the former, thereby reproducing an industry culture that routinely devalues the talent of minorities and women.”When the study looked into film studios’ executive ranks in 2013, 94 percent of CEOs and/or chairs and 92 percent of senior management were white. Television executives didn’t prove significantly more diverse either. The report found that 96 percent of chairs and/or CEOs and 93 percent of senior management were white. The notable power and role of the talent agencies, or “gatekeepers,” when it comes to TV and film diversity was also covered. Looking into the rosters of the industry’s three dominant talent agencies (all unnamed in the report), minority film directors and writers remain largely underrepresented. And only 12.2 percent of minority film leads in 2013 were represented by the these agencies.Minority television show creators are also underrepresented in the leading talent agencies, and only 5.6 percent of minority broadcast scripted leads were represented by the top three talent agencies. The authors noted how the relationship between studio executives and talent agencies prevents more diverse talent from reaching television and film. “The talent agencies tell us they are in the business of selling to the networks and studios the kinds of packaged projects they demand,” the study reads. “Networks and studios — whose executive suites are almost exclusively white and male — ironically suggest that packaged projects could be more inclusive were it not for overly narrow talent rosters.”Guilds, they added, were also partially to blame for not finding ways to increase access and professional development for both minorities and women. Time Warner executive director of diversity and corporate social responsibility Jonathan Bean recently spoke to The Hollywood Reporter and agreed that executive attitudes have a major ripple effects in the industry.  ""I don't believe it's malicious,"" Beane told THR. ""It's just that people have a better eye for talent when it looks like them and has the same background as them.""The Hollywood Reporter also noted that the study was financed by six majors studios and networks, including Time Warner, and the study’s authors are expected to present it to executives from each sponsor. Overall, the report found that representation of both women and minorities is increasing in television and film, but at a highly unsatisfactory pace. Television was significantly more diverse than film, and its future also seems notably brighter since the report did not include the diversity seen in the 2014-2015 TV season, with shows like “How To Get Away With Murder,” “Empire,” “Jane The Virgin” and “Fresh Off The Boat.” Ramón recently told NPR that the success of these series are the best motivators for diversity in Hollywood.  ""Whenever [TV networks] see a formula that works and makes money, they want to also replicate that,"" Ramón told NPR. ""And so right now they do see that certain diverse shows with black female leads, that those are selling. And so you can see that some of the pilots are trying to replicate that."""
