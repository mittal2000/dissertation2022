2,WOMEN,Ever Wonder Where 'Matilda' Is Now?

True Stories of Girlhood and Accidental Fame, </em>out Sept. 13.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d2d8a21800001034bd0609.jpeg?cache=RdqiBmBE1q&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you were a kid in the ‘90s or early 2000s, chances are you’d recognize a young Mara Wilson.Whether she was captivating audiences as the brave bookworm who moved objects with her mind in “Matilda” or charming families during the holiday season with her role in the “Miracle on 34th Street” remake or making people laugh alongside Robin Williams in “Mrs. Doubtfire,” the actress spent much of her childhood playing on-screen characters that bring about a sense of nostalgia today.Wilson has since left acting, but didn’t leave behind her love for stories. She’s a writer and live storyteller with a witty Twitter presence, who has captured her experiences as a former child actress in her new book, Where Am I Now? True Stories of Girlhood and Accidental Fame, out Sept. 13.The Huffington Post spoke with Wilson about her memoir and what it’s like to look back on a childhood that meant so much to so many strangers’ childhoods. Wilson talked about her life as a writer, why she dedicated the book to her mother and why she thinks Matilda is “definitely” a feminist. Why write a book about your childhood experiences?I kind of always wanted to write a book about my life. I wanted to explain the things that happened in between the IMDb entries. “Matilda” was such a cult hit so there were a lot of people who were like, “What happened to her? Where did she go?” I felt compelled to and wanted to explain what had happened to me.But for a long time I was writing other things. I was writing plays, screenplays. I was writing a web series. I was writing not one, but two young adult novels. I was just happy writing, so I was seeing what garnered the most interest. And then I wrote that piece about why so many child actors go off the rails [for Cracked], and it went over incredibly well. That’s when people started saying to me, “Maybe you should write about your life first before you write about anything else. Maybe you should write about child acting and some of the things you went through.” That’s when I started actually getting publishers interested, and I thought, “OK, maybe that’s what I’m going to do first.”When you started writing your memoir, did you find it more difficult than you initially thought?Some things were easier to write. The ones that were basically stories ― you know, beginning, middle, end ― those were easy for me to write because I feel like storytelling comes naturally to me. There were also things that I hadn’t really thought about or talked about before. Writing about OCD was very hard for me, because I kind of looked at myself from the outside in for the first time.I’m familiar with your work with Project UROK, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping teens with mental illnesses. Did you know from the beginning you wanted mental health to be a major focus of your book?Absolutely. I felt like I needed to talk about that. I felt like I’ve always needed to talk about that. There are a lot of people out there who suffer and don’t really know what to do about it, and I didn’t want anybody to go through what I had been through. [Editor’s note: In the book, Wilson describes her experiences with OCD, anxiety and depression.] I was helped by reading a book, and so I felt that was something that I could kind of pay it forward with.While reading the book, I find myself thinking, “Wow, me too.” Considering our childhood experiences were completely different, I didn’t expect that. Were you hoping readers ― even ones who didn’t grow up on film sets ― would relate to your stories?Definitely. The interesting thing that I’ve found about storytelling ― I’m sure I’m not the first person to say this, I think Toni Morrison or some great writer pointed this out before ― but the more specific you get, the more universal it is, which is odd because my life was obviously not something that was shared by a lot of people. There are a lot of things that I’ve felt or noticed about myself that are universal, so I wanted both the idea of “this is definitely not normal,” and also “this is something that everybody goes through that nobody talks about.”In the book, you mentioned initially being hesitant about calling yourself a feminist, which is a label you’ve since embraced. Was there any sort of “a-ha moment” that sparked this?I feel like it was sort of a slow build up over the years. Even 10 years ago, not many people were calling themselves feminists. It wasn’t as cool to be a feminist as it is now. Calling myself one, it felt like this powerful thing. It felt like I was being outspoken. Of course now, everyone calls themselves a feminist, which I think is awesome. It’s definitely a title I still embrace.Looking back, I think Matilda was probably the first feminist character I ever saw on screen.Oh, definitely. And for me as well, which is why I think my mother loved that character so much. I think that the fact that Matilda is such a cult character shows that we were really starved for these awesome feminist characters.Do you think Hollywood has made progress when it comes to showcasing complex, feminist characters?I think they’re trying. It’s odd considering how many women there are in Hollywood, they still don’t really know how to create a strong woman [character]. And a lot of the times [Hollywood] doesn’t seem to understand that you can make a strong woman who still has faults. You can make a strong woman who’s still afraid sometimes. She kind of has to be perfect or...Or a total misfit.Yeah. It feels like so many writers don’t really take the time to consider what a woman’s life would really be like. I think that we are making progress, but there also has definitely been backlash. It’s good that intersectionality is now getting more attention, but I do think you have to fight that backlash, which is hard.In your book, you write about what you call the “Matilda-Whore Complex.”[Laughs] Yeah, that’s a thing.And you wrote about tuning into your sexuality. It’s tough for women because when they embrace their sexuality, they’re labeled a slut. When they don’t, they’re labeled a prude. I feel like you experienced this on a different level because of the roles you played. How did you learn to embrace your sexuality on your own terms?It took a while. It’s something I’m never going to be especially public about. I think it’s definitely been hard because people have this image of me as a child. I’ve had people try to flirt with me by saying, “Oh my god. I had a crush on you when you were a kid” and I’m like, “Well, that’s actually a little creepy. That doesn’t make me want to go out for coffee with you.”Most adults have some kind of sex life, some kind of romantic life. I do see that struggle in a lot of young girls. People are very much prying into their lives. And I think that a lot of young women feel compelled to become more sexual because they think that’s what it is to be an adult.But I’ve also known a lot of people who have expressed their sexuality in other ways. There are people who aren’t very sexual. There’s my best friend from college who does burlesque. I’ve seen that there are a bunch of different ways that you can be a woman and that has resonated with me. Unless you’re hurting somebody, there really isn’t a wrong way [to express your sexuality].Your mother is a huge part of your book. You share that she died when you were 8 years old, and that she kept you grounded as you starred in movies. What was it like dedicating your book to her?I didn’t realize what a tribute to my mother the book was until I was about three-quarters of the way through writing it. I noticed all the things I was writing about my mom, the way that I wrote her into so many of these essays. I really tried my best to capture her essence, and eventually I had to be like, “Wait a minute. This is kind of who this is for, isn’t it? This is for her memory.”My mother always encouraged my writing. She was a wonderful writer herself, so it felt very natural to dedicate it to her memory because it was like this is helping her live again.Who are other women you look up, both as a writer and an actress?I was lucky. I worked with so many wonderful women. Rhea Perlman [who played my mom in “Matilda”] was great. Pam Ferris, who played the Trunchbull in “Matilda,” is one of the most kindhearted people you will ever meet. She’s the loveliest person. She’ll show you pictures of her rescue dog. I loved when you mentioned that in the book, because as a kid, I thought she was terrifying.She’s so great. She had so much fun playing those parts when in real life she’s very gentle and soft-spoken, and she’s funny and warm. She’s the warmest person I’ve ever met. She’s really wonderful.Anyone else?My studio teachers and nannies that I had on “Thomas [and the Magic Railroad]” and people like that, they changed my life. After my mother died, I had this Greek chorus of women in and out of my life taking care of me, eventually including my stepmother.I look back on my life and I think of all of the ways that they changed me. I think of Embeth [Davidtz, Miss Honey in “Matilda”] being like a big sister to me, and Pam Ferris being so kind, and Rhea being so funny and so warm and loving and accepting. I feel very lucky to have had that.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.For more information about “Where Am I Now?

4,POLITICS,Approval Ratings Drop For Vulnerable GOP Senators In Key States,Janie Velencia and Nick Bayer,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/approval-ratings-drop-for-vulnerable-republican-senators-in-key-states_us_57d730e8e4b09d7a687f5cf9,Not good news for Republicans hoping to maintain control of the Senate.,2016-09-13,Some Republican senators seeking re-election are losing favorability among voters in their states. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d731c9180000e000314189.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sens. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) are both at risk of losing their Senate seats in November. And they both have become less popular among voters in their respective states over recent months, according to a 50-state Morning Consult poll on Senate approval rankings released Tuesday.Toomey’s net approval rating has dropped 11 points since April, when Morning Consult last surveyed on Senate approval. Forty-three percent of Pennsylvania voters approve of the job Toomey is doing, while 36 disapprove. Toomey is currently trailing Democratic challenger Katie McGinty by just 1 point, according to the HuffPost Pollster aggregate of polls.Kirk, who faces a tough election against Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), has seen a 9-point drop in net approval since April ― 35 percent of Illinois voters approve of the job he’s doing, and 38 disapprove. Some Republicans criticized Kirk earlier this year when he broke from his party and called on the Senate to hold a vote on Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) are also in vulnerable positions, but have each managed to maintain a relatively high net approval rating since April. The poll finds Johnson with a 45-33 approval/disapproval rating, while Ayotte has a 58-32 margin. Still, both candidates are struggling to hang onto their seats. Johnson is currently losing to Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold by 7 points. Feingold previously held the Senate seat for 3 terms until he lost to Johnson in 2010. And Ayotte, who has received harsh criticism from her GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump for not offering him an endorsement, is currently in a dead heat against Gov. Maggie Hassan. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who are also up for re-election, rank among the senators with the lowest approval ratings in the country. But they both hold comfortable leads over their rivals: Rubio is up by 6 points and McCain is up by 9 points.There’s a lot at stake for all of these candidates. Democrats need to capture just four seats to gain control of the Senate if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, and five if Trump does. There are five Senate seats now held by Republicans that will likely flip to the Democrats, according to the HuffPost Senate prediction model, and three of those races are currently very close. One Senate seat is also likely to flip from Democrats to Republicans. Morning Consult surveyed 71,900 registered voters online May to September 2016. You can see the full poll report of Senate rankings here."

Jones, a lead author of the Senate’s torture report, was referred by the CIA to the Department of Justice for possible criminal prosecution, with the CIA suggesting he effectively stole classified documents before secreting them to a secure facility in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill. The document in question is known as the Panetta Review and is a CIA investigation of itself that came to many of the same conclusions the Senate later did. The document became important because the CIA would go on to dispute the Senate findings. For the Senate, the document proved that the protestations were not genuine. (Here’s some background on the document.)Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who led the panel’s investigation, went to the Senate floor in March 2014 to make the extraordinary charge that the CIA had spied on Senate staffers, setting off a constitutional mini-crisis.The CIA believed Senate staff may have illegally absconded with documents and broken the agreement reached between the agency and the Senate. Meanwhile, the Senate was holding up the CIA’s office of general counsel nominee, using it as leverage to get the agency to hand over the Panetta Review. What the agency suspected, and what Jones confirmed to Ackerman, was that the Senate already had the document. It was in this context that Reid appealed to Obama to rein in the CIA, only to find him defending the agency’s behavior. Ned Price, a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House, declined to comment on what he called a private conversation between Obama and Reid. “But what the President has made abundantly clear is that some of the techniques described in the Senate Intelligence Committee’s report were inconsistent with our values as a nation, which is why one of his first acts in office was to sign an Executive Order that brought an end to the program and prohibited the use of harsh interrogation techniques,” Price said. It wasn’t the last time Reid put his thumb on the scales. In November of that same year, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough came to the Senate for a lunch briefing. Before he arrived, Reid wound up his troops, HuffPost reported at the time, telling them that he was sick of hearing them complain about White House behavior privately, and then act like nothing was wrong when White House officials visited. And so they let McDonough have it.The report was finally released in December 2014, and confirmed the agency had engaged in grotesque acts of torture. The only person ever punished was, ironically, one of the Senate staffers, Alissa Starzak, who worked on the report. Republicans held up her nomination as payback for the probe. "

This has led to Jekyll-and-Hyde transformations ― a flat reading of standard Republican boilerplate, flipping to bizarre Trumpian claims and insults and back again, sometimes in the span of a minute.At a crowded rally in Pensacola’s 10,000-seat arena on Friday, Trump was off-script for longer than he was on it, ad-libbing on a variety of topics.Where the script had him repeat a familiar GOP talking point about increasing the number of ships in the Navy, Trump used that opportunity to issue a warning. “When Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats, and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn’t be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water,” he said.A few minutes later, when the script called for Trump to talk about the Iranian nuclear deal and other foreign policy matters, Trump took a sudden detour and accused President Barack Obama’s administration of protecting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to the point where she could commit cold-blooded murder with impunity. “She is being so protected, she could walk into this arena right now, and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching ― right smack in the middle of the heart ― and she wouldn’t be prosecuted, okay?” Trump said.Ten minutes later, apropos of nothing, Trump decided to weigh in on Clinton’s mental health. “Personally, I think she’s unstable,” he said.“It’s like when King Kong had the chains around him, and it could only last for so long,” Ornstein said, referring to Trump. “He still has to be him.” Nonetheless, Republicans who watched in dismay as Trump spent late July and early August attacking fellow Republicans and the family of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq are now relieved he is doing more reading and less blurting.Michael Caputo, a former campaign staffer who still supports Trump despite a pay dispute, said he was thrilled to see the GOP nominee doing this. “It’s a new tactic for him that’s been working, and I believe he likes the results: a campaign on the rise and hitting on all cylinders,” Caputo said. But successfully force-feeding Trump via his teleprompter to make him a better candidate raises the next question: How might Republican Party leaders transform someone with so little demonstrated knowledge or even interest in public policy into a competent president, should he win?Trump’s transition team, led by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), has been grappling with that question for weeks, according to the RNC member: “There are a hundred people working on this ... I believe there is a very strong team of people who will help him shape policies for this country.”Yet the American Enterprise Institute’s Ornstein does not believe that’s possible. And even worse, he said, he thinks Republicans aren’t really that interested in trying. Too many Republicans have fallen back on tribal instincts to support Trump, are hoping for patronage jobs in a Trump administration or are fixated on preventing Clinton from naming the next Supreme Court justices, Ornstein said.As for the idea that Trump will surround himself with grown-ups, “What if your grown-ups are Rudy Giuliani and Michael Flynn?” he wondered, naming the former New York City mayor and former Defense Department official who have become increasingly shrill in their criticism of Clinton.“I’ve got zero confidence in his ability to administer,” said the New Hampshire GOP’s Cullen. “He can’t manage his own campaign, and that’s a much smaller organization.”Even the RNC member concedes that his support for Trump is not particularly well-founded. “I think you’ll find him to be a much better president than people realize. How do I know that? I don’t know that,” he said.In this instance, he is ready to flip an old truism, and is certain that “the devil you don’t know” ― Trump ― is better than “the devil you know” ― Clinton. “I do know what she’s like, and that’s enough to make me for Trump,” he said.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
7,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Maternity Leave Proposal Gives Conservatives In Congress Some Pause,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-maternity-leave-conservatives-congress_us_57d84be6e4b0aa4b722cfbf0,But not all are automatically opposed to it.,2016-09-13,"From left, Reps. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho) leave a meeting of the House Republican Conference in the Capitol earlier this year. House Republicans are wary of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's new maternity leave proposal.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d85be51800002f00314530.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― With GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump now proposing six weeks of paid maternity leave, conservatives in Congress mostly reserved their judgment as to whether they would support the plan, waiting for the specifics of a proposal that, in broad strokes, appears to be antithetical to their free-market ideas.It wasn’t necessarily a no, most conservatives who talked to The Huffington Post said. It just wasn’t a yes ― not without seeing Trump’s plan.“I got to see what he’s saying,” Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho) said Tuesday. “I’m not even sure that’s his policy. I have to look at what he’s going to say, what he’s basing it on, what funding.”Labrador, like most conservatives, noted that he hasn’t supported paid maternity leave in the past. “And I’m not sure I would support it in the future,” he said.Virginia Republican Rep. Dave Brat took a similar position, telling HuffPost that he would wait to hear the “who, what, why, where, when, how long, how much.”Other Republicans seemed totally new to the paid maternity leave issue. Rep. Rod Blum (Iowa) said he had no opinion on the matter, though he warned that there’s “a difference between what a presidential candidate proposes and legislation.”And Republican Study Committee Chairman Bill Flores (Texas) suggested that six weeks of paid maternity leave wasn’t “terribly far” from what’s mandated in the Family and Medical Leave Act, even though that’s not quite accurate.The FMLA provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, but it doesn’t provide any paid time for maternity or paternity leave. Some states are beginning to require paid time, but the United States overall is the only highly developed economy that doesn’t provide any mandated paid leave for mothers who just had a child. Republicans have traditionally been resistant to the idea ― as Flores said, “There’s no free lunch in this country” ― and conservatives particularly believe forcing small businesses to provide paid maternity leave would hurt the economy, thus their persistent opposition. That they’re suddenly willing to hear out Trump’s proposal, then, might mark a sizable shift, though it could also be more political gamesmanship. (It’s much easier to refuse to comment on a plan because you haven’t seen it than it is to address a policy rift between you and the presidential nominee of your party.)Still, some Republicans did express reservations about Trump’s plan, despite not having seen it.Rep. Thomas Massie (Ky.) said he would like to see Trump’s plan, but that he wouldn’t vote for paid maternity leave. “I’m not for compelling private companies to do that, no,” he said.Rep. Tim Huelskamp’s answer to whether he would support paid maternity leave was to ask a question: “Who’s paying for it?” The Kansas Republican then answered his own question with a laugh, “It’s the other guy! It’s not me, it’s the guy behind the tree, as the old saying goes.”When he got a little more serious, Huelskamp said somebody had to pay for it, and “small businesses can’t afford another Washington regulation.”Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) also said he’d like to see Trump’s plan, but that he is generally opposed to mandated paid maternity leave. “I worry when government mandates these things,” he said. “That begins to create more and more problems and ultimately kills jobs.”For many conservatives, the devil is in the details. Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) brought up that Republicans had once proposed a sort of investment account so that women could take maternity leave ― and he suggested that Trump could maybe draw on those types of ideas to come up with a sort-of-paid maternity leave. “So is that what’s being talked about or is it just the left’s version of ‘get it’?” Schweikert asked. Although Trump’s plan is short on details, he seems to want to simply provide maternity leave and pay for it by “eliminating fraud” in unemployment insurance. That wouldn’t entirely cover the cost of the maternity leave, but it appears to be an attempt to not force small businesses to simply pay for the six weeks out of their pockets.Excusing for a moment that Trump hasn’t offered real specifics on the plan ― and may never ― conservatives in Congress still seemed wary of embracing the idea, even though it’s clearly an issue that is bending to popular opinion.But many Republicans nevertheless see this as a business issue. “If all of our focus is supposed to be how to grow the economy, so we have jobs and opportunity and some way to pay for our promises, you can’t be pushing proposals and ideas that don’t go that direction,” Schweikert said.All the same, Schweikert noted that Trump’s proclivity for stealing ideas from Democrats wasn’t just frustrating Republicans.“It has to be driving the left insane,” he said. “Take a step backward and just sort of enjoy the theater portion of it. When you’re able to grab some of the top lines of the left, the number of temper tantrums I see from some of my Democratic colleagues has been actually rather amusing.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

But when it comes to what the candidates have said concerning hunger, nutrition, GMO labeling or sustainable agriculture, little has changed.Celebrity chef Tom Colicchio says he thinks the candidates’ virtual silence on these issues is unacceptable, but it’s not surprising given the tone of the race. “What’s going on right now [in the election] is not about policy at all. It’s only about optics at this point, which is really depressing,” Colicchio told HuffPost.Nevertheless, Colicchio is pushing for food policy discussion to enter the fray. In his role as co-founder of the advocacy group Food Policy Action, the “Top Chef” judge spoke at rallies held in conjunction with both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions this summer.The rallies are part of the “Plate of the Union” food truck tour Colicchio’s group is sponsoring this summer alongside two other organizations. The tour continues with a stop in Washington, D.C., this week before making a series of additional stops concentrated largely in the Midwest region through the end of October.At those rallies, Colicchio has called for political leadership on food issues. The chef said that based on the crowds at their events and the responses to their petition, the message appears to be resonating. “I think the conversation is starting to change,” Colicchio said. “It’s not sensational like ISIS or national security, but people are starting to understand these issues and pay attention to them.”Two weeks out from the first presidential debate, however, that momentum has yet to translate into much conversation.For Trump, much has been made of his dietary preferences, which would prove alarming to most nutrition experts. The New York Times described him as aiming to be “the nation’s fast food president” thanks to his penchant for dining on buckets of KFC fried chicken and Big Macs aboard his jet. But neither Trump nor his team have communicated much in the way of food policy positions.In November, the billionaire alluded to rolling back the number of participants in the SNAP food-stamp assistance program and mocked a protester who appeared to be angered by that comment, calling him “seriously overweight.” Campaign positions on his website do not include policies related directly to food or agriculture. On the other side of the aisle, Clinton’s platform references increased support for family farms and local food systems and acknowledges the role immigrants and migrant workers play in supplying the nation’s food, but doesn’t touch on other related issues such as equitable food access or the state of the government’s dietary guidelines.

FPA is looking for more detailed answers to its food-related questions.The organization created its own food policy questionnaire in partnership with researchers at Johns Hopkins University and expects to release any responses it receives in October. The continued silence from the candidates on these issues has come as a disappointment to other activists in the burgeoning food movement. One of them is Michael Dimock, president of Roots of Change, a San Francisco-based food advocacy group. Dimock said he’s “concerned and disappointed” the candidates lack stances on most food issues. But he still hopes that, in lieu of attention on the national stage, food policy concerns are gaining increasing momentum at the state and local levels.Dimock’s group is a big part of that progress. Founded in 2002, the organization helped create a statewide network of food policy advocates that ultimately morphed into the California Food Policy Council. In partnership with its colleagues on the council, the group has successfully fought for new statewide sustainability programs like a healthy soils initiative that provides resources to help farmers and ranchers reduce their farms’ greenhouse gas emissions and increase their ability to “farm” or store carbon in their soil. Dimock called it the nation’s first program of its kind. Wins like these could serve as examples to inspire copycats elsewhere, perhaps even on the national stage, Dimock hopes.“We’re trying to generate a politically active and effective food movement in the state of California, and we’re trying to make some changes that could be models for the rest of the country to follow,” Dimock told HuffPost.There’s significant progress happening on the municipal level, too. In recent years, more than 20 cities across the country have hired food systems experts to help them address food-related issues, including obesity and equal access to healthy foods.Among those cities is Minneapolis, where City Councilman Cam Gordon, of the Green Party, has helped encourage more food growing and small-scale production within the city.In recent years, Gordon fought to require corner stores to sell at least a small selection of fresh fruits and vegetables to increase access to fresh produce in low-income neighborhoods. He’s also authored legislation that set new standards for farmers markets that protected local growers and also helped reform previous zoning laws that inhibited urban farming operations in the city.These efforts have been among the most attention-grabbing of any of the legislation he’s worked on, Gordon, who serves on the city’s Homegrown Minneapolis Food Council, told HuffPost. He thinks that’s with good reason, and he hopes it’s a sign of what’s to come.“There seems to be a shift happening,” Gordon said. “People want to be healthy and want to know where their food’s coming from.”―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

According to the new report, the NEJM review was sponsored by the Sugar Research Foundation (SRF), which is today the Sugar Association, although its role was not disclosed at the time. In the report, Laura A. Schmidt of the University of California, San Francisco and colleagues point out that Harvard professor of nutrition Dr. Mark Hegsted co-directed the SRF’s first heart disease research project from 1965 to 1966. Schmidt and colleagues say communications between the SRF, Hegsted and another professor, Roger Adams, uncovered from the University of Illinois archives and the Harvard Medical Library reveal that the foundation set the objective for the literature review, funded it and reviewed drafts of the manuscript.“I thought I had seen everything but this one floored me,” said Marion Nestle of New York University, who wrote an editorial on the new findings. “It was so blatant. And the ‘bribe’ was so big.”“Funding research is ethical,” Nestle told Reuters Health by email. “Bribing researchers to produce the evidence you want is not.”The researchers also reviewed symposium proceedings and historical reports. In 1954, they say, foundation president Henry Haas gave a speech highlighting the potential of reducing American fat intake and recapturing those calories as carbohydrates that would increase the per capita consumption of sugar more than a third.In 1962, an American Medical Association nutrition report indicated that low-fat high-sugar diets may actually encourage the development of cholesterol. Two years later, according to the new report, SRF vice president John Hickson proposed that the SRF embark on a major program to counter “negative attitudes toward sugar.”Increasingly, epidemiological reports suggested that blood sugar, rather than blood cholesterol or high blood pressure, was a better predictor of plaque buildup in the arteries. Two days after The New York Herald Tribune ran a full page story on the link to sugar in July 1965, the SRF approved “Project 226,” a literature review on cholesterol metabolism to be led by Hegsted and, among others, Fredrick Stare, another Harvard nutritionist with industry financial ties. Project 226 authors eventually received $6500, or $48,900 in 2016 dollars, from SRF, the report said.Nine months later, Schmidt and colleagues write, Hegsted explained that the project was delayed to continually rewrite rebuttals to new evidence linking sugar to heart disease that had been published in the interim.By September of 1966, according to the report, Hickson was requesting additional drafts of the literature review from the Harvard researchers, though there is no direct evidence that the Foundation commented on or edited the drafts. By November 2, Hickson had approved the latest draft as “quite what we had in mind.” The two-part review, concluding that the only change necessary to prevent heart disease was to reduce dietary fat intake, was published in the NEJM the following year, with no mention of the SRF’s participation or funding.The journal did not require conflict of interest disclosure until 1984. “The sugar association paid very prestigious Harvard scientists to publish a review focusing on saturated fat and cholesterol as the main causes of heart disease at the time when studies were starting to accumulate indicating that sugar is a risk factor for heart disease,” Schmidt told Reuters Health by phone. “That has an impact on the whole research community and where it’s going to go.”“For example a lot of the messaging during this period around how to prevent heart disease focused on, why don’t you use margarine rather than butter, which has less saturated fat,” Schmidt said. Now we know that margarine is full of trans fat, which causes heart disease and has been nearly eradicated from the U.S. food supply.In the U.S., about 610,000 people die of heart disease every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, making heart disease the leading cause of death for both men and women. Risk factors include being overweight or obesity as well as diabetes - all of which are worsened by excess sugar intake. “When manufacturers took out fat they added sugar,” Schmidt said. “We’ve really lost a lot of time in evaluating how sugar impacts coronary heart disease,” but the actual impact on public health over the last five decades is impossible to measure.Large amounts of sugar and saturated fats are both detrimental to health and their effects are hard to separate, Nestle said, but it seems reasonable to keep sugar intake to about 10 percent of daily calories.Today, industry money still funds plenty of scientific research, but increasingly journals and scientists disclose these funding sources, Schmidt said.“We acknowledge that the Sugar Research Foundation should have exercised greater transparency in all of its research activities, however, when the studies in question were published funding disclosures and transparency standards were not the norm they are today,” the Sugar Association told Reuters Health in a statement. “Beyond this, it is challenging for us to comment on events that allegedly occurred 60 years ago, and on documents we have never seen.” “The Sugar Association is always seeking to further understand the role of sugar and health, but we rely on quality science and facts to drive our assertions,” the statement said.

Included are interviews with the cast and creative team, as well as costume and set design sketches and dozens of full-color, behind-the-scenes photographs. The Huffington Post got a first look at the book, which will be published in October and is currently available for pre-order in both standard and special editions. Interestingly, the tome doesn’t shy away from the fact that “Looking” divided audiences during its HBO run, with some viewers arguing that its slice-of-life tone was “too boring.” Despite critical acclaim, the show was canceled after two seasons in 2015, and finally wrapped with this summer’s “Looking: The Movie.” In fact, Tales of the City author Armistead Maupin addresses the show’s skeptics head-on in his forward to the book. “The miracle of ‘Looking’ is that it takes its time,” he writes, noting that the show didn’t resort to “cheap melodrama” and avoided “the parade of ‘types’ that so often corrupt gay-themed dramas.”For series star Jonathan Groff, the role of Patrick had personal significance. “Working on a set where it’s not only okay to be gay, but it’s part of the job was amazing,” he writes in the book. “When I came out I never imagined I would be doing this—to pour my heart and soul into a piece of art that was about being gay.” In addition to giving fans a glimpse into the artistic process, series creator Michael Lannan told The Huffington Post that the Looking book perfectly captures the camaraderie that developed between the show’s cast, writers and crew. “You’ll get some nice portraits of actors giving you serious, emotional ‘Looking’ moments,” he said, “but it’s also lots of us just being stupid and laughing.”Not to mention that it’ll be great to re-live memorable moments like this: And this: And, last but not least, this: Head here for more information on the Looking book, due out in October.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d8371c1300002a0039bbbb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The beloved boys of “Looking” may have skipped off into the California sunset for good with a finale film in July, but fans of the HBO series will soon be able to console themselves with a new book.Published by First Third Books and HBO Global Licensing, the Looking book documents the two seasons of the series and the wrap-up film, which focused on the lives and loves of three gay men in San Francisco, in exquisite detail. Included are interviews with the cast and creative team, as well as costume and set design sketches and dozens of full-color, behind-the-scenes photographs. The Huffington Post got a first look at the book, which will be published in October and is currently available for pre-order in both standard and special editions. Interestingly, the tome doesn’t shy away from the fact that “Looking” divided audiences during its HBO run, with some viewers arguing that its slice-of-life tone was “too boring.” Despite critical acclaim, the show was canceled after two seasons in 2015, and finally wrapped with this summer’s “Looking: The Movie.” In fact, Tales of the City author Armistead Maupin addresses the show’s skeptics head-on in his forward to the book. “The miracle of ‘Looking’ is that it takes its time,” he writes, noting that the show didn’t resort to “cheap melodrama” and avoided “the parade of ‘types’ that so often corrupt gay-themed dramas.”For series star Jonathan Groff, the role of Patrick had personal significance. “Working on a set where it’s not only okay to be gay, but it’s part of the job was amazing,” he writes in the book. “When I came out I never imagined I would be doing this—to pour my heart and soul into a piece of art that was about being gay.” In addition to giving fans a glimpse into the artistic process, series creator Michael Lannan told The Huffington Post that the Looking book perfectly captures the camaraderie that developed between the show’s cast, writers and crew. “You’ll get some nice portraits of actors giving you serious, emotional ‘Looking’ moments,” he said, “but it’s also lots of us just being stupid and laughing.”Not to mention that it’ll be great to re-live memorable moments like this: And this: And, last but not least, this: Head here for more information on the Looking book, due out in October.

13,WOMEN,UNC Student Accuses College Of Protecting Football Player Who Allegedly Raped Her,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unc-sexual-assault-accusation_us_57d83eeee4b09d7a6880018c,The accusations are the latest in a recent spate of troubling stories about colleges' mishandling of sexual assault.,2016-09-13,Students congregate on University of North Carolina's Chapel Hill campus.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d83f701800006c32bd129a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill accused the university and local prosecutors in a statement of failing to act against a campus football player who she says raped her this past Valentine’s Day.At a news conference Tuesday, Delaney Robinson, a sophomore, said she “did everything a rape victim is supposed to do,” including immediately seeking treatment at a hospital, taking a rape kit and cooperating with law enforcement.“But six months later the University has done nothing,” Robinson said.Her lawyer, Denise Branch, said in a statement that the university and the local district attorney have thus far refused to press rape charges against the accused, Allen Artis, a linebacker on the school’s football team. “For more than six months we have asked the University and the Orange County District Attorney’s office to hold Delaney’s rapist accountable for his actions,” Branch said. “At every turn we have been met with discouragement and delay.”“I’m taking this public stand not for me,” Robinson said, “but for the other students on campus who are not protected, despite what the University tells us. I love this University. It’s my home. I plan on graduating. But I expect the University to fulfill its promises to me and to all students.”After the Orange County District Attorney declined to press any criminal charges against Artis, Robinson chose to exercise her right under state law to self-swear arrest warrants against Artis on the lesser charges of misdemeanor assault on a female and misdemeanor sexual battery, according to Branch. The office of the Orange County district attorney has issued those warrants.The rape kit Robinson underwent showed “vaginal injuries consistent with blunt force trauma and bruising consistent with a physical assault,” Branch said.Branch added that the Orange County District Attorney’s office declined to prosecute the case as rape because Robinson had not been drunk to the point of unconsciousness when it occurred.Artis did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusations.Jim Woodall, the district attorney of Orange County, said the UNC Chapel Hill Department for Public Safety is “still actively investigating the case.” In late July or early August, Woodall estimates, the department shared its judgment with his office that the case did not have enough evidence for criminal charges. “My office said we don’t disagree with them,” Woodall said.He noted that there are some outstanding lab results relevant to the case.The UNC Chapel Hill did not immediately respond to an email request for comment on the accusations, but put out a statement Tuesday afternoon.“While the University is aware of allegations made today by attorney Denise Branch regarding a student, under federal privacy law we are prohibited from responding to those allegations,” Joel Curan, UNC Chapel Hill vice chancellor for communications and public affairs, said in a statement. “The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is deeply committed to the safety and well-being of our students and takes all allegations about sexual violence or sexual misconduct extremely seriously.”Robinson’s account of how campus police, also known as the Department for Public Safety, treated her rape describes the kind of victim blaming that remains all too common for sexual assault survivors.UNC Chapel Hill police peppered her with questions about her clothing, behavior and sexual history, according to Robinson.“I was treated like a suspect,” she said.By contrast, campus cops spoke to Artis with a “tone of camaraderie,” according to a recording of the conversation Robinson was privy to. “They told him, ‘don’t sweat it, just keep on living your life and playing football,’” Robinson said.Robinson’s charges against UNC and local law enforcement are the latest in a series of high-profile cases of campus sexual assault that have cast serious doubt on universities’ handling of rape allegations, particularly when the allegations are against an athlete.On Sept. 6, C.C. Carreras, a young woman attending the University of Richmond, described in an essay for HuffPost how the university failed to pursue sexual assault charges against a campus athlete she accuses of raping her. Whitney Ralston, a classmate and friend of hers, followed suit with similar claims of university indifference in a Friday essay.Earlier this month, ex-Stanford swimmer Brock Turner was released early from jail after serving three months of a six-month sentence for a sexual assault he committed on campus. Turner’s lenient sentence drew national outrage.Robinson’s accusations also could have serious implications for UNC Chapel Hill in particular.The university announced a new sexual misconduct policy in August 2014 aimed at improving the its response to assault charges. The reforms came after five women filed complaints against the university with the federal government for violating Title IX, the law to ensure gender equity in educational programs that receive any kind of assistance from the federal government.Branch, Robinson’s attorney, suggested Tuesday that her client’s experience was evidence that the new policy has failed.“Delaney feels betrayed by the university she chose,” Branch said. “The very university that promised to protect her and that lauded a new and improved Title IX process that was completely revamped to better protect students.”UPDATE: UNC suspended Artis indefinitely, a university spokesperson told The Daily Tar Heel on Tuesday evening.

17,SCIENCE,Dolphin Conversation Caught On Tape For First Time,Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/study-on-dolphin-language_us_57d6df18e4b06a74c9f5c7d0,Does this mean they have their own human-like language?,2016-09-13,Some scientists have poured cold water over a Russian study that suggests dolphins have their own language in which they can hold conversations with each other.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d6df6b180000e000313f67.jpeg?cache=oSu4NKVfHy&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A study claims to have recorded a previously unknown language between dolphins it describes as akin to human speech ― but not everyone’s convinced.Researchers say they made an audio recording of two black sea bottlenose dolphins named Tasha and Yana emitting unique pulses and whistles that “most likely” formed words and sentences.The dolphins at the Karadag Nature Reserve in Russia were even described as pausing and listening to one another before responding, according to the study, published last month in the St. Petersburg Polytechnical University Journal.“…the dolphins took turns in producing pulse packs and did not interrupt each other, which gives reason to believe that each of the dolphins listened to the other’s [pulses] before producing its own,” the report states. “Essentially, this exchange resembles a conversation between two people.”It goes on to say that the “fundamental difference between the dolphin exchange of information and the human conversation is in the characteristics of the acoustic signals of their spoken language.”The issue of dolphins communicating with each other through sounds has been raised before. Whether they have a secret language, however, has long divided scientists.Dolphin Communication Project director Dr. Kathleen M. Dudzinski, who has studied the behavior and communication of the marine mammals since 1990, argues that more is needed for the verbal exchanges to be deemed a language.“This is an interesting study,” she said of the Russian report in an email to The Huffington Post on Monday, “but the described experiment does not show that dolphins are transmitting complex semantic information to each other like what we see for human language.”Dudzinski said the study instead showed similarities between dolphin communication and human language, which has long been seen.“There are a number examples of this in the scientific literature. However, the current weight of evidence suggests that dolphins do not have a language that functions in the same way as human language,” she continued. “Thus, we feel this recent publication is not really a novel item and is unlikely to gain much traction with scientists/academics.” One such article Dudzinski believes backs her argument is a 2013 piece published in the International Journal of Comparative Psychology, titled “Are Conversations Between Dolphins and Humans Possible?” The article addresses how communication and conversation aren’t always the same thing.Justin Gregg, a senior research associate with the Dolphin Communication Project, similarly examined such a discussion in a 2006 article titled, “Do Dolphins Have A Language?”“…yes, language is a form of communication, but communication can happen in so many different ways ― not just through language,” he stated.Gregg went on to point out physical gestures and vocalizations used among animals, and humans, for communication, which don’t necessarily form a language.Researchers studying dolphin communication in 2007 reported distinguishing nearly 200 different whistles from bottlenose dolphins. Some of the sounds were linked to specific behaviors. That led the lead researcher, Liz Hawkins, to conclude that dolphins do have their own language.“This communication is highly complex, and it is contextual, so in a sense, it could be termed a language,” she told New Scientist at the time."

Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra’ad al Hussein condemned the Syrian government on Tuesday, in a wide-ranging speech cataloguing human rights abuses around the world.In a speech opening a three-week session of the U.N. Human Rights Council, Zeid said Syria was one of five countries that routinely refused to cooperate with human rights investigators.“This is a state led by a medical doctor and yet is believed to have gassed its own people; has attacked hospitals and bombed civilian neighborhoods with indiscriminate explosive weapons; and maintains tens of thousands of detainees in inhuman conditions,” Zeid said.“Words cannot convey how profoundly I condemn this situation.”The other countries are Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, and Iran, but Israel also had a long record of refusing cooperation in terms of access to occupied Palestinian territory, he added.Venezuela had comprehensively denied access to Zeid’s staff, refusing his regional representative a visa for the past two and a half years, he said.“States may shut my office out – but they will not shut us up; neither will they blind us. If access is refused us, we will assume the worst, and yet do our utmost to nonetheless report as accurately as we can on serious allegations.”The council, based in Geneva, is made up of 47 countries and aims to protect human rights around the world. It can mandate investigations into suspected abuses.He cited southeastern Turkey and the Ethiopian regions of Omoria and Amhara, Uzbekistan and both sides of the line of control between India and Pakistan as places that needed immediate investigation, as well as the Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and South Ossetia in the Caucasus.The situation in Yemen should be subjected to a “comprehensive inquiry by an international independent body”, and Bahrain should also pay more attention to human rights, he said.“The past decade has demonstrated repeatedly and with punishing clarity exactly how disastrous the outcomes can be when a government attempts to smash the voices of its people, instead of serving them,” Zeid said in reference to Bahrain.Zeid, who recently attacked populists politicians such as U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump in a speech in the Hague, took another swipe at the dangers of populism in his speech to the council.“A number of elections will be held in well established democracies, with dangerous xenophobes and bigots running for office, and what falls to us then could begin to determine, as never before, the future course of ‘we the peoples’ of this earth,” he said."

The group threatened to release more material, calling Tuesday’s leak “just the tip of the iceberg.”All compromised data related to the Rio Olympic Games.WADA said the security breach was accomplished through a spear-phishing attack, which typically involves duping an employee into opening and acting on an email that appears to come from a legitimate source.The anti-doping agency didn’t mention any athletes by name in its statement, but did acknowledge that the Russian group managed to access information on “therapeutic use exemptions,” which permit athletes with certain underlying health conditions to take what otherwise might be banned substances.Regarding Biles, USA Gymnastics scoffed at the idea that she could be in violation of any anti-doping regulations.“In keeping with official protocols of the U.S. Anti-Doping Association [sic] and WADA, Biles submitted and was approved for a therapeutic-use exemption (TUE), the proper paperwork for any medications that an athlete takes for an illness or condition that requires the use of a medication included on the WADA Prohibited Drug List, for prescribed medication(s) she takes,” a statement from USA Gymnastics read. “Biles has not broken any drug-testing regulations, including at the Olympic Games in Rio.”Biles backed that up with her own statement, noting that she has taken ADHD medication since childhood but has “always followed the rules” and believes “in clean sport.”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied that the Russian government or secret service was involved in the hack, calling it “out of question” in a statement obtained by Reuters.Fancy Bear was also implicated in this summer’s hacking of Democratic National Committee emails, The Verge reports. That attack aligned with what some argue is Russian interest in influencing the U.S. presidential election in favor of Donald Trump.There could be Russian interest in embarrassing WADA as well: 119 Russian athletes were banned from the Rio Olympics, including the entire track and field team, after a state-sponsored doping program was uncovered earlier this year. WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that Tuesday’s hacking revelations, in addition to the country’s covert doping program, lessen Russia’s credibility with its partners.“Let it be known that these criminal acts are greatly compromising the effort by the global anti-doping community to re-establish trust in Russia,” Niggli said. “WADA condemns these ongoing cyber-attacks that are being carried out in an attempt to undermine WADA and the global anti-doping system.”"

A Saudi-led coalition of Gulf Arab states then launched an airstrike campaign against the Houthis.The devastated country has also come under fire from so-called Islamic State militants, who killed 137 people in major suicide bombings targeting mosques in March of last year. The scale of civilian suffering in Yemen is immense. Millions have been displaced by the crisis, and thousands more have been wounded or killed. One year into the deadly conflict, UNICEF statistics revealed that children accounted for one-third of all civilian deaths.Yemenis seeking refuge up in the mountaintops are far from the raging violence, but life in the isolated community is extremely challenging as many basic services are simply inaccessible. As Reuters reports, food is cooked over a fire, there is no electricity or running water, goods are imported uphill on foot and by cable cars, and medical specialists are hours away.“Despite the difficulty of life, we’re still living here, just as our fathers and our ancestors did,” 65-year-old Mohammad Yahya Haidar told the news service. “We grow coffee and grain like they did, and we’ve grown accustomed to this life with all its cruelty and extreme hardship.”Take a look at these extraordinary photos of Yemen’s mountaintop villagers."

Pat McCrory (R) has come under fire for passing several anti-LGBT laws. Most recently, the NCAA pulled all championship events from the state for the 2016-17 year.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d74ca01800006c32bd0fae.jpeg?cache=9ifSp83iEJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The NCAA has withdrawn all championship events from North Carolina for the 2016-17 academic year because the state has passed several laws targeting the LGBT community, the organization announced Monday. The decision will affect seven NCAA championship events, including the first and second rounds of the Division I men’s basketball tournament and the women’s soccer College Cup.“Fairness is about more than the opportunity to participate in college sports, or even compete for championships,” NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement. “We believe in providing a safe and respectful environment at our events and are committed to providing the best experience possible for college athletes, fans and everyone taking part in our championships.”North Carolina became a lightning rod for criticism after adopting several laws directly targeting LGBT residents. By passing H.B. 2 in March, the state became the first in the country to restrict public restroom access for transgender people. And in May, Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed into law a bill that invalidated local protections for the queer community.The NCAA mentioned both laws, as well as another that allows government officials to deny services to LGBT people, as grounds for pulling athletic events. The agency also noted that five states have passed measures in opposition to North Carolina’s laws that prohibit public employees ― which could include coaches and athletes at some universities ― from traveling to the state. “The Board of Governors must advance college sports through policies that resolve core issues affecting student-athletes and administrators,” G.P. “Bud” Peterson, the chair of the NCAA board of governors, said in a statement. “This decision is consistent with the NCAA’s long-standing core values of inclusion, student-athlete well-being and creating a culture of fairness.”The decision has already prompted some to blame McCrory and re-up calls to repeal the anti-LGBT legislation.“It seems that almost every day, we learn of a new consequence of HB 2,” a spokesman for North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper said in a statement. “Now, our ability to host these events at the highest level has been eliminated because of Governor McCrory and HB 2. Enough ― we need to repeal this law and get our state back on track.”The move is the latest smackdown given to the state. Earlier this year, the NBA said it would move its All-Star Game from Charlotte in protest. And dozens of companies have pulled their business from the state, resulting in millions of dollars in canceled investment.“We’re all aware, except for Pat McCrory, that the damage will continue until we take the worst LGBT bill in the nation off the books,” said Chris Sgro, the executive director of Equality NC, an LGBT rights group that has fought against the law. The NCAA noted the decision was consistent with steps it had taken in the past “to ensure its championship environment is consistent with its values,” pointing to bans regarding states that display the Confederate flag and the use of “hostile and abusive Native American imagery.”The group said it would continue to evaluate locations for future events, which will be required to provide information about local anti-discrimination laws.A spokeswoman for the North Carolina GOP called the NCAA’s decision “so absurd it’s almost comical” before launching a blistering attack against the organization.“I genuinely look forward to the NCAA merging all men’s and women’s teams together as singular, unified, unisex teams,” spokeswoman Kami Mueller said in a statement circulating on Twitter. “Perhaps the NCAA should stop with their political peacocking ― and instead focus their energies on making sure our nation’s collegiate athletes are safe, both on and off the field.”In apparent reference to the transgender bathroom bill, Mueller also called the decision “an assault to female athletes across the nation.”“Under the NCAA’s logic, colleges should make cheerleaders and football players share bathrooms, showers and hotel rooms.”Andrew Carter, a reporter for The News & Observer, confirmed the statement was sent out through the official N.C. GOP email address.Travis Waldron contributed reporting. This story was updated to include comment from Mueller."

The pay gap has hovered at around 79 percent since 2007.There was a lot in the data to celebrate: Median incomes rose 5.2 percent from the previous year to $56,000, the first increase since the Great Recession. The poverty rate declined, and the number of Americans going without health insurance fell.Because of this good news, many hailed the report as a nice parting victory for the Obama administration.President Barack Obama has been a big advocate for closing the pay gap ― the first piece of legislation he signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which strengthened equal pay laws. He’s also banned pay discrimination among federal contractors and is asking companies to report more pay data. Still, he’s been stymied by Congress, which has failed to pass other bills ― floated by both Republicans and Democrats ― on equal pay.And, of course, the bigger issue is that equal pay legislation and executive orders alone won’t get the U.S. to equality.There are structural issues ― lack of federal paid leave for parents or quality child care ― that can force women out of the workforce or cause them to ratchet back their career ambitions.There are also other subtle cultural forces at play. Unconscious bias that begins before birth funnels girls and boys into different career tracks, which often mean women take on different majors in college and end up in lower-paying careers.Bias also means that majority-female careers are often undervalued, some research has shown.It should be noted that the gap is even wider for black women and Latinas. The new data released Tuesday also shows that women are more likely than men to live in poverty ― and raise children in poverty. Closing the pay gap would go a long way in alleviating that problem."

At this point, there’s only one man who can prove to your Aunt Gladys that Trump doesn’t have a degenerative brain condition: known product shill and self-proclaimed hack, Dr. Oz.Fox News reports that the TV doc will “surprise” Trump with further analysis of his most recent physical on Thursday’s airing of “The Dr. Oz Show.” Trump promised to release the results of that physical this week.Of course, Dr. Oz plans to do anything but surprise Trump, who will undoubtedly see his own medical records before a show host does. Heck, the presidential candidate may curate the show itself ― reports say Dr. Oz plans to go easy on him, and won’t ask any medical “questions that he doesn’t want to have answered.”UPDATE 9/14: During the episode’s taping on Wednesday, Trump showed Dr. Oz a one-page summary of the physical exam he received last week. CNN Money reports that the physical was conducted by none other than Harold N. Bornstein, the same doctor who needed a mere five minutes and a few paragraphs to declare that Trump would be the healthiest president in history.The content of Bornstein’s latest summary hasn’t yet been released, but one page clearly falls short of a full report. In 2008, John McCain released 1,173 pages of his medical records to the press, and opened up his doctors to interviews.To be fair, Dr. Oz is a real heart surgeon who often gives solid everyday living advice that’s based in scientific literature. But his tendency to rely on discredited reports and inclination to sell “miracle” weight loss products on his show have drawn criticism over the years.In 2014, he sat in front of a skeptical Congress and admitted that some of the supplements he touts on his show don’t pass “scientific muster.”“I actually do personally believe in the items I talk about on the show,” he said. “I passionately study them. I recognize they don’t have the scientific muster to present as fact but nevertheless I would give my audience the advice I give my family all the time, and I have given my family these products.”In any case, if you were looking for a glimpse into Trump’s medical background beyond what he wants you to hear, you’re not getting it on Thursday. You won’t get Hillary Clinton’s bill of health, either, because she declined to be on the show, Mediaite reports. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

So I’m hopeful that this book is going to help parents know they’re not alone, and realize that you can learn as much from your kid as you do for your kid. “Tarney’s son doesn’t easily fit into the categories society traditionally ascribes when it comes to the human experiences of sex and gender. The most accurate language we have to talk about him is “gender non-conforming,” with Harry identifying outside of a male/female binary notion of gender identity.My Son Wears Heels is an evocative and passionate memoir that follows Tarney throughout the course of Harry’s childhood and adolescence, chronicling not only Harry coming to live as his authentic self, but Tarney’s struggles to be her version of the best possible mother to a gender non-conforming child ― with zero blueprint or guidance.The mom takes the reader through powerful and emotional moments in their lives, like Harry being called a “hermaphrodite” by classmates, his desire for nothing but an array of wigs on a particular birthday and his decision to walk across his high school graduation stage wearing heels.She also touches on larger, queer cultural moments in her book like the high-profile murder of Matthew Shepard and her closest friend, after whom Harry is named, dying of AIDS in the early 1990s.“The more I learn about what young LGBTQ kids and teenagers face today, I learn that Harry’s story – his outcome is not as common as it should be,” Tarney continued to HuffPost. “But theres a better language now – gender non-conforming didn’t exist when Harry was a kid. The more it’s talked about the more people learn... We all discover ourselves and part of that is discovering our gender self.”As for Harry, Tarney’s only child is now living a prosperous life in New York City as an artist, creative director and drag performer. Tarney lives in NYC as well, and the pair continue to have a close and special relationship as Harry navigates adulthood.With the release of this book about his own journey and his mother’s role in his life, Harry hopes My Son Wears Heels can serve as a possibility model for other families with gender non-conforming or non-binary children. “It’s so important for kids to know that they can be happy and successful and gender non-conforming, but that’s so much more difficult to achieve when you feel like you don’t know anyone else who’s like you,” Harry told The Huffington Post. “Like all kids, they want to be safe, supported, and understood, but that needs to start with even having the basic vocabulary to talk about their experience. I think My Son Wears Heels can be a model of what is possible when you treat kids with compassion and give them the space to figure out who they are.”My Son Wears Heels is now available for order as of Sept. 12."

Mike Pence (R), Donald Trump’s vice presidential running mate, over a state law that prevents him from changing his name because of his immigration status.“John Doe,” a 31-year-old legal U.S. resident, filed his suit through the Transgender Law Center and Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. It claims that a 2010 Indiana law requiring him to show proof of citizenship to legally change his name is unconstitutional. Pence wasn’t the governor when the bill became law, but because he is now, he has to enforce it.Doe, who has requested anonymity as his case proceeds, said the law causes him humiliation on a regular basis. He was born in Mexico but has lived in Indiana since he was 6. Doe was born female but has lived as male for all of his adult life. He was granted asylum in the U.S. last year, but because he is not a citizen, Indiana’s law means he can’t change his name on official U.S. documents to reflect his gender identity. “Sometimes I face harassment ... especially when I have to show my ID that doesn’t show who I am,” Doe told The Huffington Post. “A couple of weeks ago, I was trying to change some stuff on my health plan … and they didn’t want to talk to me because they said the voice didn’t match the name. I had to go through other means to be able for them to understand that was me.”He recalled another incident two years ago when he was in the emergency room for a neck injury, and his nurse kept asking Doe where her patient “Jane” was (that’s also a fake name). Doe said he was “Jane,” and the nurse left and came back with four more people, who just looked at Doe and then went in the hallway to talk about him. Doe could hear them talking.“That obviously was really embarrassing,” he said. “I was stressed and mad about it. But I really didn’t want nothing, just medication. And I have to go through all that.”One of Doe’s attorneys, Matthew Barragan of MALDEF, said no other state has laws that require a person to have citizenship in order to petition for a court-ordered name change. Then-Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels (R) signed the law in 2010 amid a national wave of anti-immigrant legislation, Barragan said, using the rationale that undocumented immigrants were more likely to commit fraud and identity theft.“The law is targeted at immigrants and it is discriminatory based on alienage, but the harms transgender people face are real,” he said. “That’s why we’re proceeding anonymously. John shouldn’t have to face discrimination, potentially violence, lose his job, because he’s trying to protect his rights.”Barragan said the timing of the lawsuit ― two months before the election and at a time when Pence is on the national stage ― isn’t related to the presidential race.“We’re not suing for political reasons,” he said. “To the extent people are going to pay attention to this because it’s Mike Pence, that’s fine, but we were not motivated to file a case against him because he’s running for vice president.”Kara Brooks, a spokeswoman for Pence, declined to comment.“We do not comment on pending litigation,” she said in a statement.You can read the lawsuit below:"

I felt like if I didn’t wear them, I wouldn’t have felt good about it. So I feel like I had to do that just for myself, to represent the people that were lost and do their jobs every day to protect us. I feel like it was my duty to myself.”The choice violated the NFL’s uniform policy, which clearly states that cleats must be black or white, the Sporting News notes.New York Giants wide receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Victor Cruz, as well as Indianapolis Colts punter Pat McAfee, also wore custom cleats on Sunday paying tribute to victims of the terror attacks."

After Oppong announced on Sunday that he would be suspended for his decision, many people across the country came to his defense, which he attributed with helping him avoid suspension.Oppong told journalist Carl Setterlund that he decided to protest during the national anthem not just because of mistreatment of black people by cops, but by everyone.“[T]his is really something that happens often and no one does a thing about it,” Oppong said."

In June, Armstrong sang on “Color,” a song on Hall’s Beyoncé-style visual album, “Straight Outta Oz.” The video showed Hall and Armstrong canoodling amidst flowers and waterfalls, shifting from black and white to color in a nod to “The Wizard of Oz.” If Armstrong and Hall’s chemistry seems natural, that’s because the men, who both hail from Texas, met as teens while working for Mary Kay Cosmetics Industrial. “To watch a friend reach such heights as a truly multi-faceted artist and business person has been one of my driving inspirational forces,” he said. “He paved the way for a new medium of art with YouTube.” Co-produced with composer Will Van Dyke, “Jay Armstrong Johnson: Live at Feinstein’s/54 Below” is very much a labor of love for the star, who is best known to New York audiences for his Broadway roles in “Hands on a Hardbody” and the 2014 revival of “On The Town.”Armstrong raised money to preserve his Feinstein’s/54 Below concert, which charted his path from bullied gay teen to stage and TV performer through songs by Rascal Flatts, Sam Smith and others, on the new album via an Indiegogo campaign. Having fans from around the world support his endeavor gave the project an extra layer of significance, he said. “I’ve known that I’ve wanted to do a concert of this nature for a while, and I was just waiting for the right time,” he told HuffPost in April. “It feels like my audience has broadened from just the theater world to people who watch network TV from their comfort of their couches in Montana or California.” Here’s to hoping “The Chicken Song” is just one savory morsel in Armstrong’s musical journey.

In June, Armstrong sang on “Color,” a song on Hall’s Beyoncé-style visual album, “Straight Outta Oz.” The video showed Hall and Armstrong canoodling amidst flowers and waterfalls, shifting from black and white to color in a nod to “The Wizard of Oz.” If Armstrong and Hall’s chemistry seems natural, that’s because the men, who both hail from Texas, met as teens while working for Mary Kay Cosmetics Industrial. “To watch a friend reach such heights as a truly multi-faceted artist and business person has been one of my driving inspirational forces,” he said. “He paved the way for a new medium of art with YouTube.” Co-produced with composer Will Van Dyke, “Jay Armstrong Johnson: Live at Feinstein’s/54 Below” is very much a labor of love for the star, who is best known to New York audiences for his Broadway roles in “Hands on a Hardbody” and the 2014 revival of “On The Town.”Armstrong raised money to preserve his Feinstein’s/54 Below concert, which charted his path from bullied gay teen to stage and TV performer through songs by Rascal Flatts, Sam Smith and others, on the new album via an Indiegogo campaign. Having fans from around the world support his endeavor gave the project an extra layer of significance, he said. “I’ve known that I’ve wanted to do a concert of this nature for a while, and I was just waiting for the right time,” he told HuffPost in April. “It feels like my audience has broadened from just the theater world to people who watch network TV from their comfort of their couches in Montana or California.” Here’s to hoping “The Chicken Song” is just one savory morsel in Armstrong’s musical journey.

He said he was unable to stop the vehicle that went off the top of the building and flipped over until it was caught by a wire, police said.“The driver was (miraculously) able to climb out of the sunroof and make his way safely back into the garage,” the Austin Fire Department wrote on its Facebook page.The man was not injured.”I have a strong feeling the driver is going to have a great appreciation of what it means to be alive from this point forward,” said James Davis, 29, a cellphone software developer who was one of about 100 people watching the car dangling.The car was eventually lowered to street level by firefighters who used a wiring system to slowly move it.“From what we understand, the driver accidentally hit the gas instead of the brake,” the department said."
39,POLITICS,Trump Doubles Down On Personal Attack Against The Federal Reserve,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-yellen-should-be-ashamed_us_57d6c12be4b06a74c9f59bd6,"Fed Chair Janet Yellen should be ""ashamed"" for keeping interest rates low, the real estate mogul argued.",2016-09-12,Donald Trump has not been consistent in his position on the Federal Reserve over the course of the campaign.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d6c2261300002a0039b620.jpeg?cache=CW2qYFqO6e&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump sharpened his criticism of the Federal Reserve on Monday, claiming Fed Chair Janet Yellen should be “ashamed” for keeping interest rates low to benefit President Barack Obama.Trump’s assault on the independence of the United States’ central bank and the integrity of its leader had a hostile tone that is rare, if not unprecedented, for a presidential nominee.Yellen is keeping interest rates “artificially low to get Obama retired,” Trump said in a phone interview on CNBC. “Watch what’s gonna happen afterwards. It’s a very serious problem.”“I think she’s very political,” he added. “And to a certain extent, I think she should be ashamed of herself.”Trump appeared to be suggesting that the low federal funds rate ― an interbank interest rate controlled by the Fed that serves as a benchmark for spending throughout the economy ― was keeping the economy afloat to boost support for Obama. Trump made a similar accusation last week, which drew condemnation from Hillary Clinton, who said it was inappropriate for presidents or presidential candidates to comment on Fed interest rate policy.Trump’s comments on Monday were his harshest indictment of Yellen to date.“The words ‘ashamed of’ are not appropriate,” said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former economist at the Fed. “He could question her judgment but he has gone beyond that, questioning her motivations.” Attacking the Fed is not new for presidential candidates, but it is uncommon for a party’s standard-bearer to assault the bank and its chair in such personal terms. During the current election cycle, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), then a Democratic presidential candidate, criticized the Fed’s decision to raise its benchmark rate in December, but did not cast doubt on Yellen’s integrity. There is every reason to believe Trump’s broadside against the central bank is a political maneuver rather than a genuine policy stance. It allows the Republican nominee to dismiss the election results as rigged, since a stronger economy would help Clinton, the incumbent party’s presidential nominee.The reality TV star asserted that the Fed had shed its independence to help Democrats much as the Department of Justice had in declining to prosecute Clinton over her use of a private e-mail server as secretary of state. “I used to think that the Justice Department worked independently also and I used to think that the FBI was independent also, but that’s obviously not possible because Hillary Clinton is guilty as hell and everybody knows it,” Trump said.“I used to hope that the Fed was independent and the Fed is obviously not independent,” he said. “It is obviously not even close to being independent.”Trump’s views on monetary policy have been all over the map since announcing his candidacy in June 2015.In August 2015, Trump said low interest rates were feeding a financial asset bubble and therefore needed to rise.But in May, Trump said rates needed to stay low to keep the value of the dollar from getting too high and hurting U.S. exports. He also said he would replace Yellen as chair because she is “not a Republican.”Regardless of his intentions, Trump’s case that interest rates would be higher if not for political interference is weak on substance.The Fed kept the federal funds rate at or near zero from December 2008 until December 2015, because of the depth of the Great Recession in the wake of the financial crisis. Currently, the benchmark rate is between 0.25 and 0.5 percent.“If that was too low, or artificial, we should have had an overheating economy,” Gagnon said. “We should have runaway inflation, but we have had none of those things.”The Fed even engaged in several rounds of quantitative easing, or massive securities purchases, to stimulate the economy further after the federal funds rate was already at its lowest level.“If anything we should have had easier monetary policy, which we had with quantitative easing,” the former Fed economist concluded. “I argue that there should have been more quantitative easing and it should have been done sooner.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
