It might feel like a big deal to us here on earth, but from an astronomical perspective, it's just a day like any other -- as one planet circles one star, the sun, out of the galaxy's billions. But since we arbitrarily impose a beginning and an end on our equitable distribution of days, let's reflect on some of the cycles that dominate our existence: the big ones over which we have no control, the smaller ones we might hope to influence, and those about which we don't yet know. This way, we can make some resolutions that will outlast the echoes of our song.Patterns and repetition are comforting because they help us remember and understand events. Phenomena that occur on a regular basis generally have an underlying reason. The cosmos provides us with numerous examples. Isaac Newton deduced the law of gravity that allows us to predict elliptical orbits around a central object's gravitational pull. This is how the Milky Way attracts the sun, which takes roughly 240 million years to orbit the galaxy's center. And as we all know, the earth, along with all the other planets in our solar system, orbits the sun. The earth's cycle takes a year -- hence the holiday and festivities before us.The planets in the solar system are joined by objects with lesser celebrity status, such as asteroids and comets. Dwarf planets orbit too. ""Dwarf planet'' is a new category that includes the demoted Pluto, but also other objects of similar size that have been discovered since the 1990s -- objects that are big enough to take notice of (and are spherical) but not quite big enough to orbit alone. Like John Mayer, who formerly headlined on his own but now tours with the Grateful Dead, Pluto is no longer a solo act.The earth's rotation on its axis, creating the 24-hour cycle we know so well, is why Annie who gets her gun (back when that could be considered amusing) has the sun in the morning and the moon at night. It's also why orphan Annie knows the sun will come out tomorrow. (The moon rotates too -- but at a rate commensurate with that of its orbit. This results in a side of the moon we never see, sometimes colloquially, and inaccurately, called ""the dark side of the moon."" Being invisible to us does not make it dark -- the sun still shines on this hidden hemisphere.)Seasons result from the tilt of the earth's axis of rotation, which makes regions subject to differing amounts of the sun's radiation as the earth orbits around it. Long-term climate trends depend on other cyclical patterns too, such as the various Milankovitch cycles of thousands of years, named for the Serbian astronomer-mathematician Milutin Milankovitch, who realized that the periodic changes in the earth's ellipticity -- how far from circular the orbit is -- as well as changes in the earth's tilt, can result in climate changes that lead, about every 100,000 years, to ice ages and to shorter periodic weather patterns, too. However, these many-thousand-year cycles don't explain what is happening on time scales determined by human activity in the last few hundred years.Within the earth, too, patterns repeat themselves. Over a few hundred million years of geological activity, the plates of the earth are regenerated, and, over a shorter time scale, the ocean floor is reconfigured too. Movements of the continental plates are one of the drivers of another important cycle, the carbon cycle, so essential to life on our planet. The cycle of carbon in the atmosphere -- critical to our climate, and to life itself -- results in part from carbon that is released into the atmosphere through volcanoes and hotspots and is absorbed back into the earth.There is weak evidence that large-impact craters on earth -- those that arose from a kilometer-wide asteroid or comet hitting the earth -- also happen periodically. Research by my collaborators and me suggests that it could be the gravitational pull of dark matter in the midplane of the Milky Way that dislodges weakly bound comets at the edge of the solar system so that they are more likely to hit the earth in a 32-million-year cycle. Measurements being done currently will show whether such a dark matter disc exists.Though we are safe from any such hypothesized cataclysmic impact for another 30 million years, there are other cycles, ones over which we can exercise some control, that present much more immediate threats. We are repeatedly alerted to melting glaciers and increasingly dangerous storms. News about the Middle East changes in detail, but the general patterns remain the same. Gun shootings in America happen so regularly that the cycles of outrage and pushback are barely noticeable.Yet despite the recurring carousel of time, we enter each new year with optimism. It will be easier to maintain that belief in a better future if we think a little harder about how and when we can eject ourselves from undesirable patterns. The Paris climate agreement and its ancillary benefits can help us begin to make real progress in slowing down changes to the earth's climate, a cycle we have only a limited time to affect. Maybe we can curb, or at least slow down, other seeming inevitabilities, too. In the universe, cycles won't last forever as the solar system and the galaxy undergo changes. If we can keep in mind that humanity has the potential to change the cycles that we impose on ourselves, then maybe this new year we'll break that most reliable cycle of all -- making resolutions we don't have the fortitude to keep.Lisa Randall is professor of physics at Harvard and author of ""Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe.''This post originally appeared on the Boston Globe."

Absolutely -- far from ""mistaken,"" that narrative is exactly right. Do they win every fight? Nope, and they lost the one that led the capital gains rate to go up in 2013.",2016-01-01,"This photo taken Aug. 19, 2015 shows the The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Building in Washington. No checks, please. If you owe the federal government more than $100 million in taxes, your check is no good at the IRS. Citing technology constraints, the IRS says it will no longer accept checks for more than $100 million. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb92ad5260000580183d2f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Wall Street Journal ran an interesting piece yesterday morning showing how the effective tax rate -- taxes as a share of income -- spiked up significantly in 2013 for the wealthiest taxpayers due to an increase in the tax rate on capital gains. This is important information and the piece appropriately highlights how the higher rate sharply increased the tax liability of the richest 400 taxpayers, whose effective rate went from 16.7 percent in 2012 to 22.9 percent in 2013.That's the highest effective rate paid by this top group since 2002, though it's still a 7 percentage point decline from the 29.9 percent rate that prevailed in 1995. Had these wealthy taxpayers faced that rate, their liability would have been $7.5 billion higher.For readers who also read the recent New York Times piece on the ""income defense industry"" of the wealthy-the extensive anti-tax infrastructure they've built up over the years to reduce their tax liabilities-this WSJ piece may have sown some confusion. For example, the Journal quotes a conservative commentator complaining about ""the mistaken narrative... that... high income Americans have used a combination of aggressive tax planning, loopholes and political influence to lower their tax burdens to unconscionably low levels.""So who's right? Does there really exist an industry of deeply funded anti-tax lobbyists whose sole purpose is to protect the holdings of their clients? Absolutely -- far from ""mistaken,"" that narrative is exactly right. Do they win every fight? Nope, and they lost the one that led the capital gains rate to go up in 2013. But to suggest that this one change alters the fundamental landscape of our tax avoidance problem would be an egregious overstatement.First off, as both the NYT and WSJ pieces stress, pushing for lower rates is but one part of the tax avoidance agenda. It's far more effective to get your income out of the tax base. As Gabriel Zucman, whose recent work on tax havens provides essential data for this debate, puts it in the WSJ piece, ""For billionaires, a lot of income never shows up on tax returns.""-- Zucman finds that the share of U.S. foreign profits booked in tax havens has grown from about 20 percent in the 1980s to 50 percent now.-- As I point out here, a group of tax analysts show in a forthcoming paper that the share of corporate stock held in taxable household accounts has fallen from around 80 percent in the mid-1960s to about 25 percent now, meaning most such stock is now untaxed or held in tax-favored vehicles, like individual retirement accounts.-- Business income ""passed through"" to the individual level is the single largest source of the ""tax gap"" (the difference between what people owe and what they pay; it amounts to over $300 billion/year). Sole proprietors, e.g., have been found to report less than half of their income to the IRS.One reason people pass through business income to the personal side of the code is to take advantage of the differential in top income tax rates, about 40 percent, and capital gains, which are now about 24 percent. That's still a very important form of tax avoidance, but the WSJ is certainly right to point out that the current cap gains rate is a lot higher than the 15 percent rate that previously prevailed.Finally, it should be lost on no one that if the tax suppression lobby can't get everything they want in lower rates or wider loopholes, they've got a new strategy that's proving to be alarmingly effective: defunding the IRS. Since 2010, the agency's budget is down 18 percent in real dollars; enforcement staffing is down by 20 percent. These cuts support the tax gap: Treasury estimates that each additional $1 spent on IRS enforcement yields $6 of additional revenue.Like I said, the Journal makes an important and relevant contribution, revealing that the tax avoiders don't win every fight. But that doesn't make them any less real and, unfortunately, they win a lot more of these fights than they lose. I'm sure it makes them very happy to hear someone argue that they're a figment of liberals' imagination.This post originally appeared at Jared Bernstein's On The Economy blog."
2,TECH,Twitter Reverses Stance On Archiving Politicians’ Deleted Tweets,Alexander Howard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/restoring-politwoops-twitter-flies-back-towards-public-interest_us_568543ece4b014efe0da49d4,Politwoops and more than 30 similar services around the world will once again be able to operate.,2015-12-31,A screenshot from the Politwoops website. Twitter forced the site to stop publishing deleted tweets from elected officials because doing so violated the company's developer agreement.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56854c0e1600000001eb9d00.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Twitter reached an agreement on Thursday with two transparency-focused organizations, Sunlight Foundation and the Open State Foundation, that will allow them to resume publishing the deleted tweets of politicians and government officials in the new year.In August, Twitter cut off access to Politwoops, a Sunlight Foundation initiative that published elected officials' deleted tweets. The technology company said Politwoops violated its developer agreement, which mandates that services with access to Twitter's servers must not display tweets that users have deleted. None of the parties explained how Politwoops will navigate this issue, but the service's restoration is a positive development for anyone hoping to see Twitter used to hold government officials responsible for what they say in public. According to the Open State Foundation, the decision resulted from meetings between the foundation, the digital rights organization Access Now, the Sunlight Foundation and Twitter over the past two months.At the Flight developer conference in October, newly hired Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said Twitter had a responsibility to ""empower organizations that bring more transparency to public dialogue, such as Politwoops."" ""This agreement is great news for those who believe that the world needs more transparency,"" stated Arjan El Fassed, director of Open State Foundation, which has created versions of Politwoops in more than 30 countries since 2010. ""Our next step is now to continue and expand our work to enable the public to hold public officials accountable for their public statements.""It's unclear when the Sunlight Foundation will reboot Politwoops to preserve deleted tweets by U.S. politicians and government officials. Nicko Margolies, who ran Politwoops for the past three years, left Sunlight to join the OpenGov Foundation in September.The Sunlight Foundation declined to say who will run the Politwoops service, or how exactly the agreement with Twitter will work. (The answer could be as simple as securing an exception to the developer rules.) In a statement, the organization said it would ""be working behind the scenes"" to get Politwoops up and running ""in the coming days and weeks.""While Thursday's decision hasn't resolved the question of where Twitter stands at the intersection between politics, privacy and journalism, it suggests that the balance may be tipping toward the public interest. As I wrote in August, many of the tweets archived in the U.S. version of Politwoops aren't very exciting or important. Alongside tweets containing typos, grammar mistakes or bad pictures, however, you can also find partisan statements, endorsements, meetings with foreign leaders and embarrassing errors. This is also true of versions of Politwoops outside the U.S., at least in countries where Twitter isn't blocked.“In many parts of the world, Twitter is a central component of the public record,"" stated Brett Solomon, executive director of Access Now. ""Re-establishing a mechanism to record, store and publish deleted tweets of politicians and public officials further demonstrates Twitter’s commitment to transparency and political accountability,"" Solomon wrote. ""As Twitter becomes a more important platform for political discourse, it is essential that politicians and public officials' tweets remain online and accessible to the general public.""Also on HuffPost:"

I felt it in Baltimore, in that situation, the Freddie Gray situation, and I'm feeling it now with a teammate of mine that’s much closer.""""It's just something that we have to do,"" he continued. ""We've got to figure it out. I don't know how we figure it out. I don't have the answers. I'm pretty sure a lot of people are working on trying to figure that out. But we have to do something.""Anthony has become something of an advocate against police brutality and gun violence this year. In April, he walked alongside demonstrators in Baltimore to protest the death of Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old man who died while in police custody, sparking national outcry. This month, Anthony, along with Stephen Curry, Chris Paul and various survivors of gun violence and their families, participated in an anti-gun violence PSA that aired on Christmas.""The gun should never be an option,"" Anthony said in that video.That same day the announcement aired, 27 people were killed as a result of gun violence, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Altogether, an average of 36 people died in the U.S. every day in 2015 because of gun violence. On Wednesday, Anthony said he was thinking of Early's mother after he heard the Knicks forward had been shot. ""For his mom to have to wake up to that text, that call... no parent should have to go through that,"" he said. This is the second attack on a Knicks player in less than a month. Anthony and Early's teammate Derrick Williams was robbed of $750,000 worth of jewelry after taking two women back to his home from Manhattan's Meatpacking District.“It’s scary, man,"" Anthony said. ""This goes back two years when I was in Denver [with the Nuggets]. I had a teammate, Julius Hodge, that was in a situation when I was out there [Hodge was shot in a drive-by shooting]. I was there when the Broncos player [Darrent Williams] got killed on New Year's [in a drive-by].""“A lot of these things, you really don’t put two and two together until you hear an incident and you start to remember, ‘This happened and that happened and that happened,'"" he continued. ""So as athletes -- anybody, not just athletes, but people with some type of stature or money, who have something going on for themselves -- we just have to figure out a way to be better, be safer, know our surroundings, know where we’re at, know who is with us, know who is not with us.” Also on HuffPost:"

But gun control advocates told the cable news channel they are expecting the actions to be announced ahead of Obama's annual State of the Union address, scheduled for Jan. 12.Obama has repeatedly urged Congress to tighten gun laws, with his calls growing louder following the 2012 massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, and again this fall after mass shootings in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and San Bernardino, California.The day after the San Bernardino attacks, which killed 14 people and injured 21 in December, lawmakers in the U.S. Senate debated gun control but failed to advance any legislation addressing the violence.Frustrated with little action from Congress, Obama has vowed to use ""whatever power this office holds"" to put in place gun control measures via executive action.Obama is currently on vacation with his family in Hawaii.

But while the Aloha State is a known mecca for destination weddings, it has been slow to reach out to gay couples. Now Hawaii's tourism agency wants to change that. The Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau, a nonprofit marketing organization that works closely with the Hawaii Tourism Authority, recently planned and executed a surprise wedding for Christian Alarid and Shayne Barnes, a Hawaii couple who have both served in the military. On Monday, they released the video of the picturesque wedding, including the surprise arrivals of the couple's friends and families who traveled to Honolulu to see the nuptials. And as HVCB Digital Strategist Michael Ni, the creative force behind the video, said, the two men ""just exude love.”The HVCB initially got in touch with the couple last summer after they got engaged. They had been planning a 2016 wedding and had agreed to be models in an August HVCB wedding photo shoot when the marketing folks got a better idea. Christian, 24, was let in on the surprise wedding plan and on Nov. 12, the couple shows up for what Shayne, 27, thinks is just another photoshoot.“This isn’t a shoot,"" Christian tells him. ""It’s the real thing. And today’s the day. Are you willing to marry me?”Over the next seven hours -- condensed into the six minute video -- family members arrive from the mainland, Shayne painstakingly writes his vows, and the couple arrives at the Kahala Resort and Hotel for their beachside ceremony.“I was excited and happy so many emotions went through me at one time,” Shayne said. “There was just one surprise after the other. I didn’t know there could be so many surprises.”When marriage equality became a national reality earlier this year, many cities and states began marketing themselves as same-sex wedding destinations. Industry observers, however, could see opportunity slipping away from Hawaii in a sector -- destination weddings -- where the state enjoys distinct advantages.“It’s true that we’ve been behind the curve in LGBT marketing,"" Daniel Chun, a former HCVB staffer who now works for Alaska Airlines, said.

12,POLITICS,Hawaii Becomes First State To Raise Smoking Age To 21,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hawaii-becomes-first-state-raise-smoking-age-to-21_us_568577d5e4b0b958f65ba00b,America's healthiest state implements new law with fines for retailers and underage consumers.,2015-12-31,Retailer Holy Smokes has signs posted around its entryway to alert customers to Hawaii's new smoking laws.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hawaii will ring in the new year by becoming the first state in the nation to raise the legal smoking age from 18 to 21.In June, Gov. David Ige (D) signed the law aiming to prevent adolescents from smoking, buying and possessing both traditional and electronic cigarettes. It goes into effect on Friday.“We are proud to once again be at the forefront of the nation in tobacco prevention and control,” Virginia Pressler, the state's director of health, said in a statement.And it's a move befitting of a state that consistently finds itself ranked among the healthiest in America.Ninety-five percent of adult smokers in the U.S. begin smoking before the age of 21, according to the Hawaii Department of Health. And while smoking rates have drastically decreased among Hawaii's youth and adults, there has been a ""recent and rapid increase in e-cigarette use."" Only 5 percent of Hawaii public high school students reported in 2011 that they had tried e-cigarettes, compared to 22 percent in 2014 -- a 344 percent increase.Under the new law, stores caught selling cigarettes, e-cigarettes or other tobacco products to anyone under 21 can be fined between $500 and $2,000. Additionally, any minor caught purchasing or possessing such products will face fines between $10 and $50, as well as community service.There will be a three-month educational grace period to allow people to get used to the new laws. Warnings, rather than fines, will be issued during this time.The U.S. Army, the Department of the Navy and the Marine Corps have each announced their support of Hawaii's new law. Some have criticized the military for this, arguing that a person old enough to die for their country should be able to decide for themselves whether to smoke. Bill Doughty, spokesman for the Navy Region Hawaii, told The Associated Press the Navy sees it as a fitness and readiness issue.""When we can prevent sailors from smoking or using tobacco, if we can get them to quit, then that improves their fitness and readiness, and it saves them a ton of money too,"" he said.A second measure, which also goes into effect Jan. 1, incorporates e-cigarettes into Hawaii’s smoke-free laws, meaning such products will be prohibited in areas smoking and tobacco use is already banned.Lola Irvin, administrator for the state's Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Division, said the measures make tobacco products less accessible and less attractive to Hawaii's youth.""Prevention is the best strategy, and youth are especially vulnerable to nicotine addiction,"" she said in a statement. ""By prohibiting their use in public places, the new laws encourage a no-smoking norm.""While Hawaii is the first state to raise the smoking age to 21, more than 100 cities have already done so, including New York City and Boston.Also on HuffPost:"

The men had been convicted of crimes including drug possession, theft, writing bad checks and disorderly conduct, all of which occurred between 15 and 34 years ago. The court said none of them had reoffended since.Some 14 years ago, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had already ruled that the lifetime employment ban violated the state's constitution, but did not strike it from the books -- giving the state's legislature an opportunity to amend it to resolve the constitutional problems. But the legislature never did, prompting this new round of litigation.In April, NPR profiled Tyrone Peake, one of the men challenging the law. Peake's 1981 conviction for riding in a stolen car prevented him from obtaining full-time work as a caregiver.""I've been fired from three jobs because [of] having a criminal record,"" Peake said at the time.

He even quit school because he didn’t want anyone to stare at his face.That was until Dr. Tal Dagan, 44, the associate adjunct surgeon at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, heard about Dallan's case during an August 2014 trip to the Marshall Islands organized by Canvasback Missions, a nonprofit that brings health care and education to the Pacific Islands.Dagan was intrigued by the boy’s case. Once he finally met Dallan, he knew he had to build him a new nose.“He was depressed, just sitting there on a rock and staring at the ground,” Dagan told The New York Daily News last month. “He didn’t want to look up at me.”In June, after a preliminary surgery to expand the remaining skin around where his nose used to be, Dallan arrived in New York City, where Dagan and a team from Oxford Performance Materials created a 3D-printed facial device that would look and function like a real nose.In order to create a natural-looking nose, the team used sample models based on the noses of Dallan's family members. According to the New York Daily News, they then used donor cartilage to build a nose that resembled the family models and used tissue from the teen’s forehead to create the outside of the nose.""This is complete science fiction,"" Dagan told CBS last month. ""You're getting a completely new type of technology.”Dallan's procedure went so well that doctors reportedly hope to use the same technique on soldiers returning from war who need facial reconstruction surgery.Meanwhile, Dallan, now 15, already seems to be thriving.""I like to smell everything,"" he told CBS, adding that his favorite thing to smell is pepperoni pizza.He's finally ready to go back to school, Dagan told the Daily News, and “he even has a girlfriend.""Also on HuffPost:"

It started with TCU players, including Boykin, allegedly scuffling with patrons. Then, he fought with employees who tried ejecting him from the bar. The student ""was very aggressive and was being held back by the group he was with,"" according to a police report obtained by ESPN's Mark Schlabach. Authorities say Boykin punched one cop in the face. Several officers tackled the player, who struggled until an officer threatened to use a stun gun on him.The cop he allegedly punched had bruises, abrasions and swelling. Authorities charged the quarterback with assaulting a public servant in the third degree, a felony. Bond was set at $5,000 and Boykin was released after appearing before a magistrate on Thursday morning, according to Bexar County sheriff's department records. The charge carries a punishment of two to 10 years, USA Today reported. The 11th-ranked Horned Frogs are in Texas to play No. 15 Oregon in the Alamo Bowl on Saturday. But they'll have to do without Boykin and wide receive Preston Miller, who were suspended for a ""violation of team rules,"" coach Gary Patterson said in a statement. ""We are disappointed in their actions and apologize to the TCU Horned Frogs Nation,"" the statement reads. TCU has gone 10-2 this season, with Boykin throwing 31 touchdowns and passing for 3,574 yards. The arrest is sure to hurt Boykin's prospects in the upcoming NFL draft. CBS Sports reported that scouts weren't keen on him because of his ""lack of size, mechanics and accuracy."""

Significant river flooding is expected for the lower Mississippi River into mid-January, the NWS said.The NWS said the flood warning area covered 9.3 million people on Thursday, down from 12.1 million on Wednesday and 17.7 million on Tuesday.Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has declared a state of emergency to prepare for flooding, and levee systems are being monitored daily.“All that water’s coming south and we have to be ready for it,” Lieutenant Governor-Elect Billy Nungesser told CNN. “It’s a serious concern.

Significant river flooding is expected for the lower Mississippi River into mid-January, the NWS said.The NWS said the flood warning area covered 9.3 million people on Thursday, down from 12.1 million on Wednesday and 17.7 million on Tuesday.Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has declared a state of emergency to prepare for flooding, and levee systems are being monitored daily.“All that water’s coming south and we have to be ready for it,” Lieutenant Governor-Elect Billy Nungesser told CNN. “It’s a serious concern.

Once inside the square, spectators were to be funneled by police into one of the dozens of viewing pens where law enforcement officers can closely monitor and control the crowd.The city for the first time will use its new Critical Response Command counterterrorism unit, which includes more heavily armed officers, to patrol Times Square. The unit is trained to detect and respond to attack plots.Backpacks and large bags have been barred from the area. All other bags will be searched, and metal detectors will be used to screen everyone in the crowd.Once attendees pass through police checks, they cannot leave their viewing area without going through the security process again.The famous New Year's Eve ball, which is 12 feet (3.66 meters) in diameter and weighs nearly 6 tons, descends from the top of One Times Square starting at exactly 11:59 p.m. EST.Also on HuffPost:"

Security Council resolution. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5684cf7c160000b300eb9cd9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Barack Obama's administration is preparing new sanctions on international companies and individuals over Iran's ballistic missile program, sources familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that the potential sanctions would target about 12 companies and individuals in Iran, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for their suspected role in developing Iran's ballistic-missile program.U.S. officials have said the Treasury Department retains a right under July's landmark nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers, including Washington, to blacklist Iranian entities suspected of involvement in missile development, the Journal said.Iranian officials have said the country's supreme leader would view such penalties as violating the nuclear accord.""We've been looking for some time‎ at options for additional actions related to Iran's ballistic missile program based on our continued concerns about its activities, including the October 10th launch,"" an Obama administration official said.""We are considering various aspects related to additional designations, as well as evolving diplomatic work that is consistent with our national security interests,"" the official said, on condition of anonymity.Diplomats have said it was possible for the sanctions committee to blacklist additional Iranian individuals or entities over the missile launch. But they said Russia and China, which have opposed the sanctions on Iran's missile program, might block any such actions.Tehran has disputed the Western assessment that the Emad missile was capable of delivering a nuclear warhead.The Journal said the planned Treasury Department sanctions concerned two Iran-linked networks involved in developing the country’s missile program and include many of the people involved.The sanctions would prohibit U.S. or foreign nationals from conducting business with the companies. U.S. banks would also be required to freeze any assets the companies or individuals hold inside the American financial system.Among those targeted would be UAE-based Mabrooka Trading Co LLC and its founder, Hossein Pournaghshband, for aiding Iranian state companies in acquiring carbon fiber for Iran’s missile program, the newspaper said, citing a Treasury statement.The Treasury is also preparing to sanction five Iranian officials at the country’s defense ministry and its subsidiaries for work on the ballistic-missile program, according to the newspaper.The Journal said reasons for the potential sanctions included ties the Treasury is alleging between Iran and North Korea on missile development.Earlier On HuffPost: "

A court on Thursday extended their custody for a month.Both are members of the Kamikaze Riders, a Brussels-based motor bike group whose members are mostly of North African origin and carry out bike stunts which can be seen in online videos.Some Belgian media say the group harbors Islamic State sympathizers and that the search for other group members had led Brussels to cancel Thursday night's planned firework display.Belgium has been on alert level three - which means a possible and probable serious threat - since the Nov. 13 Paris attacks. The capital itself was on the maximum alert level four for almost a week last month.The presumed ringleader of the Paris attackers, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was Belgian and grew up in the poor Brussels district of Molenbeek. Two further Paris attackers had been living in the Belgian capital.Federal prosecutors said on Thursday that a 10th person had been charged with involvement in the attacks after 10 mobile phones were found during a search at a Molenbeek residence on Wednesday.(Reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; Editing by Richard Balmfvorth)"

She said a woman approached her car as she was expressing milk and said ""put your f**king tits away.""""I was shocked,"" Smith told HuffPost. ""I didn't even have time to be indignant or defensive.""But Dallas wasted no time and stepped in for his mom. ""If you don’t want to see it, you don’t have to look,"" he said. According to a pediatric research report from the University of Florida, researchers found that 2 to 5 percent of babies are born with a tongue-tie problem and half of those babies have difficulty with breastfeeding. Since Pilot still has difficulty latching on, Smith said she expresses milk every three hours for 30 minutes a day. ""Exclusively expressing is an exhausting commitment that doesn't have much public awareness,"" she said. ""It can be confronting for people to see a machine attached to someone's chest, and I would be more then open to genuine curiosity. But verbal ridicule or abuse is disgusting behavior.""As for her little guy's reaction, the mom said she's ""proud."" ""I had to laugh when she just walked off and Dallas then said 'that was a bit mean hey mum.'""You tell 'em, Dallas! H/T Daily Mail Also on HuffPost:"

George Pataki (R) announced Tuesday that he is dropping out of the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, bringing the once 17-member GOP field to 12 candidates.Pataki announced his decision Tuesday evening in a TV spot airing on NBC affiliates in the three early caucus and primary states: Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.""While tonight is the end of my journey for the White House as I suspend my campaign for president, I'm confident we can elect the right person, someone who will bring us together,"" he said.On Tuesday afternoon, the Boston Globe first reported that Pataki called his New Hampshire supporters to tell them that he was exiting the race.Pataki, 70, who served as governor of New York from 1995 to 2006, had dismal poll numbers, struggled to raise money and failed to gain traction throughout his campaign. He never made it to the main stage during any of the Republican presidential primary debates. Pataki was a more establishment-minded candidate among the pack of Republican presidential rivals. He supported abortion rights, gay rights and gun control.He also took a somewhat progressive stance on climate change. ""There's no question that human CO2 emissions are contributing, in some way,"" he said during an interview with ABC News in October. ""And to the extent it's consistent with a strong economy and a strong America, we should be taking steps to help the future generation deal with that.""When the former three-term governor announced his White House run in late May, he emphasized his leadership in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.A couple of weeks after declaring his presidential bid, Pataki's son-in-law, David Levy, suffered a serious stroke while on a flight. Pataki suspended his campaign temporarily to be with his family, then returned to the campaign trail.Also on HuffPost:"
