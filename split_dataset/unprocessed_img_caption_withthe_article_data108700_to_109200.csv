The detailed, phantasmagorical paintings suggest an equilibrium upheaval.

Sulkowicz’s work is profoundly simple: a young woman visually manifests the psychological weight of the crime committed on her body and demands recognition of that burden. Carry That Weight is a purely visual performance, one so piercing it resists language.Like most performance art, Sulkowicz’s piece has clearly defined parameters, what she terms “rules of engagement.” They are: the performance will last until her rapist has left campus. The mattress will only be carried on campus. She cannot ask for help, but can accept it once it is offered. Once a person helps her carry the mattress, they enter into “the space of performance.” By quite literally bringing the site of the crime (in this case an ostensibly “safe” domestic space) into public sight, Sulkowicz’s performance relocates its subject in between the shifting grounds of public and private, personal and political.Read more on The Hairpin"

Officials were looking at family members the patient visited, as well as healthcare providers who helped treat him.Dallas city officials on Wednesday said the three ambulance crew members who transported the man tested negative for the virus, although they were quarantined and would be closely monitored for the next 21 days, the amount of time it can take for symptoms to appear.Texas state health officials, in a post on Twitter, said there were no other suspected cases of Ebola at this time.""The team on the ground will review that very intensively to see whether there's any other groups who, out of an abundance of caution, we would want to monitor carefully,"" Frieden told NBC's ""Today"" show from CDC headquarters in Atlanta.Ebola spreads through contact with bodily fluids like blood or saliva, which health experts say limits its potential to infect others, unlike airborne diseases.Still, the long window of time before patients exhibit signs of infection, such as fever, vomiting and diarrhea, means an infected person can travel without detection.The virus can be fatal. While past outbreaks killed as many as 90 percent of victims, the current world outbreak has a fatality rate of about 50 percent.The patient in the U.S., who was not identified for privacy reasons, arrived in Texas on Sept. 20, and sought treatment six days later at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, according to the CDC.He was initially evaluated and sent home with antibiotics, but returned two days later. He was then admitted and isolated, a delay that has been questioned by other health experts.On Wednesday, Frieden and other officials reiterated their call for heathcare workers to be vigilant in screening patients in the United States for possible signs of the virus.""If you have someone who's been in West Africa in the past 21 days and they've got a fever or other symptoms that might be consistent with Ebola, immediately isolate them, get them tested,"" Frieden told NBC.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said on CNN that emergency room personnel should obtain information on patients' travel history when they show possible symptoms, calling ""an enormous red flag.""U.S. health authorities have said every step was being taken to ensure the Ebola virus does not spread widely in the United States and have expressed confidence that it can be contained.Health officials and lawmakers have been prepared for the possibility that a patient would arrive on U.S. shores undetected. Frieden briefed President Barack Obama on the Ebola issue Tuesday and they discussed isolation protocols.""People can be confident here in this country that we have the medical infrastructure in place to prevent the broad spread of Ebola,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told CNN on Wednesday. ""The CDC and the local health officials in north Texas are taking the responsible steps to ensure the safety of the broader public.""Some other health experts have said, given the information from the CDC so far, a widespread outbreak in the United States appears unlikely from this single case.They note that doctors, nurses and other healthcare providers routinely use gloves, masks and gowns when examining patients.Tom Solomon, an emerging infections expert at the University of Liverpool in Britain, said while it was ""worrying"" that Ebola had spread to America, ""the chances of it becoming established in America or other Western Countries is very small.""""While it's not impossible to transmit it, it's not going to breakout and transmit (to) a whole neighborhood or a whole city,"" Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a former White House health adviser, told MSNBC.

The new, preliminary report on the September 14, 2014, elections in Russia, prepared by the independent Russian electoral rights group Golos (""Voice"" in Russian), describes in bewildering detail how vote manipulation is carried out. In St. Petersburg, it says, ""all known illegal techniques were used"" against opposition and even rival pro-government candidates.The Case of the Missing Election CommitteeTake, for example, what it calls ""shimmering"" election committees. In different districts of St. Petersburg, it says, ""many candidates simply could not find the election committee."" Opposition parties -- and even some rival representatives of the government-allied United Russia party -- spent more than a week in search of the committee. When one representative eventually tracked it down, he found that committee members took suspiciously long ""lunch breaks.""Queing UpEven when candidates knew where the committee was working, they often encountered long lines of other ""candidates"" waiting to register. One civic activist was prevented from submitting her registration application in time. Arriving at the offices, papers in hand, she found herself at the end of a long queue and ended up waiting all day. When she went back the next morning, 17 ""unidentified individuals were standing in front of her."" When the office eventually closed, she was told that it was the last day to submit documents.""Checking the Fire Extinguisher""In another district a candidate for municipal council and a journalist were assaulted by the deputy head of the electoral committee, the report says, after they tried to use a photocopy machine. The official hit the journalist and then went after the candidate with a fire extinguisher. He later said he didn't want to hurt the candidate but was just ""checking the fire extinguisher.""FisticuffsThere were other more ""original"" ways of closing registration offices, the Golos report explains. A ""candidate"" from the crowd suddenly rushed into the office of one election committee and allegedly beat up everybody there. The ECME (Election Committee of Municipal Entity) was then closed, just as the ambulance arrived. Plumbing ProblemsYou guessed it: One registration office had to close because of ""sewage incidents.""Timing Is EverythingEven finding out the official date of the election campaign was a challenge. In one district the information allegedly was published on June 16, but the newspaper officially announcing the election date didn't make it to the public library until several days later. In another case officials said the election date was not going to be announced, but roughly 50 candidates with ""insider"" information were able to find it out and register in time. A Good Night's SleepThe ""classical"" tradition of bribing voters was revived, the report says, with a new twist. Giving prospective voters boxes of tea, candy and cookies, it appears, is ""out of fashion."" Now, bed linen sets are the preferred way to remind voters of who is looking out for their welfare. In one district, the report says, the local government purchased 120 satin bedding sets for veterans. Another ordered 2,600 sets of sheets, along with 1,737 towels.Potemkin Villages The result of these election sleights of hand: Half of the independent candidates were not able to register for the election. One party, Civic Platform, nominated 265 candidates, according to Golos. Less than half of the candidates managed to submit their documents, 48 candidates could not get in to the offices of the election committees and 72 were denied registration.Liliya Shabanova, Executive Director of Golos, has seen much of this before. She ruefully describes it as ""Potemkin village"" elections, a campaign rife with deception designed to appear completely above board. Her organization itself is caught in a catch-22, labeled a ""foreign agent"" accused of receiving foreign funding, a decision just overturned by a Moscow city court. Golos, however, still remains on a list of organizations considered foreign agents by the Ministry of Justice. In times past, Shabanova says, vote count fraud was the main problem. Now, she says, ""manipulation has migrated to other parts of the process."""

Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb313cd3c000032000c483f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I was a big fan of the Uber service since I first saw one of the initial prototypes of the product. Yet, over time, I've started to trust the company less and less, causing me to increasingly wonder about the leadership team. The news from August that Uber gave contractors phones and credit cards to create fake Lyft accounts in an attempt to recruit drivers and create false demand (which led to 5,000 lost rides) was the last straw. I'm no longer using Uber, at least until I can trust the brand. Here's why, and my story. I'm curious how others feel.Back in 2009, I was hanging out with a couple of friends in San Francisco at the Sheba Lounge -- a classic, near legendary little jazz club on lower Fillmore Street -- when Garrett Camp showed up to hang out. I had met Garrett previously at an event hosted by the inimitable Tim Ferriss, and got an immediate sense for his creativity and very good product instincts. Sitting there on the couches at Sheba, he demonstrated his latest project, an app for black car pick-up service, and I'll never forget either how crude the prototype looked, nor the two blinking red lights, representing the two black cars in the fleet at that time. (The prototype was so crude, in fact that my friend commented to me that night, ""That'll never work!"" Famous last words.)I guessed that there would be an audience of customers like me, people who lived in metropolitan areas who needed a black car every now and then. But I would never have imagined that the company would one-day be valued at a jaw-dropping $18.2 billion.At the same time, I became a regular user of Uber, often in New York City or San Francisco, and spent hundreds of dollars. Many of my experiences were good, though not all, and the opaque surge pricing was certainly a frustration.Then, a funny thing happened. One night, I was in an Uber SUV in NYC, headed to Penn Station to catch the train to Washington DC when I got a text message from a tech socialite of sorts (I'll spare her name because Gawker has already parodied her enough), but she's someone I hardly know, asking me if I was in an Uber car at 33th and 5th (or, something like that). I replied that I was indeed, thinking that she must be in an adjacent car. Looking around, she continued to text with updates of my car's whereabouts, so much so that I asked the driver if others could see my Uber location profile? ""No,"" he replied, ""that's not possible.""At that point, it all just started to feel weird, until finally she revealed that she was in Chicago at the launch of Uber Chicago, and that the party featured a screen that showed where in NYC certain ""known people"" (whatever that means) were currently riding in Uber cabs. After learning this, I expressed my outrage to her that the company would use my information and identity to promote its services without my permission. She told me to calm down, and that it was all a ""cool"" event and as if I should be honored to have been one of the chosen.What nonsense.As I saw during my time in venture capital, it's the little things that reveal what a company is all about at its core.After that, I began to scale back my Uber rides, and today, much as I am impressed with the product design and many aspects of the user experience, I've given up on being able to trust the company, and am no longer using the service. It's a bit of a bummer, to be honest, and I hope that the board steps up and cleans up the way the company approaches doing business.The irony is that Uber not only can be a great company without resorting to the hyper-competitive tactics that have gotten it into trouble, it risks a massive downfall if consumers lose trust due to less than ethical tactics.  A great, long-lived brand begins and ends with trust.Let's hope that Travis Kalanick and company will learn from these mistakes and take Uber to a new level. I want to come back."
6,POLITICS,Obama's Fantasist Policies Make the World More Dangerous,"Pete Hegseth, ContributorCEO, Concerned Veterans for America",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamas-fantasist-policies_b_5893480.html,"The reality is that the president seems to prefer indulging in wishful thinking about how he would like the world to be. That's the exact opposite of a ""realist"" or a ""pragmatist"" -- when it comes to foreign policy especially, Obama is a ""fantasist.""",2014-09-30,"NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 25: U.S. President Barack Obama speaks at a special high-level meeting regarding the Ebola virus outbreak in west Africa during the 69th United Nations General Assembly on September 25, 2014 in New York City. The UN General Assembly brings together political leaders from around the worldto report on issues and discuss solutions. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d7652000000f0201d33b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Obama, with a 45-minute speech before the United Nations, wants us to think he's ready to get serious about facing down Islamic State (ISIS) militants in the Middle East. After months of minimizing the threat posed by the radical group terrorizing Iraq and Syria, and with his credibility and poll numbers sinking, the president is finally talking tougher.  ""I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are. That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria as well as Iraq,"" Obama said in an earlier address on the threat of ISIS. ""This is a core principle of my presidency: If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven."" To his credit, he has unleashed attacks on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq and continues to articulate the ISIS threat, even calling it ""evil"" before the UN.  While it's difficult to announce ""core principles"" of a presidency in your sixth year, this more forceful -- but regrettably vague -- rhetoric certainly is an improvement upon President Obama's famous ""we don't have a strategy"" admission just a few weeks earlier.  But, tragically for Obama, a presidency cannot be based on rhetoric alone. When his equivocal actions are taken into account, it's still unclear whether he's fully willing or prepared to see this threat for what it is and lead a vigorous, effective coalition and campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIS.The core problem is that President Obama has shown little interest or ability in looking at the world as it really is. Since Obama first appeared on the national political radar, White House watchers have struggled to categorize his foreign policy views. His supporters like to portray him as a tough-minded, decisive, calculating ""realist."" Or maybe he's a ""progressive pragmatist."" Sometimes, he's a ""reluctant realist."" The administration's position seems tied more to naïve wishful thinking than to the recommendations of its military advisors.The president would no doubt have us believe his approach to foreign policy is beyond categorization, because it's so subtle, nuanced and original. In fact, it can't be categorized because it's incoherent. The reality is that the president seems to prefer indulging in wishful thinking about how he would like the world to be. That's the exact opposite of a ""realist"" or a ""pragmatist"" -- when it comes to foreign policy especially, Obama is a ""fantasist.""  Look to the president's own words at the UN, and previous speeches like Cairo, for evidence of this fantasy-based thinking. There should have been audible laughter in the UN chamber when he called on Arab leaders to ""reject sectarian strife"" of the Sunni-Shia conflict -- an intractable sectarian schism that dates back more than 1,300 years. It's as if he believes that simply by calling for a ""truce"" it might magically appear. Obama is also overly fond of invoking the ""international community"" as key to addressing any global problem -- including that of radical Islamists. But any honest assessment of the last several years would find that this ""international community"" is a fiction when it comes to addressing global threats -- substantive consensus simply doesn't exist without U.S. leadership. But this president has systematically pulled the United States back from that leadership role. The current world chaos is the result of that misbegotten approach. If you want evidence of this, I refer you back -- once again -- to the past six years.  The president is also deeply enamored of ""comprehensive"" solutions to problems. We've seen it in the domestic sphere, where Obama's determination to achieve ""comprehensive"" health care reform resulted in the bloated, chaotic Obamacare program, chock full of unintended consequences and unanticipated costs. Likewise, his high-minded insistence on ""comprehensive"" immigration reform has stymied piecemeal progress on border security. Time and again, the president's grandiose demand for ""comprehensive"" approaches to global threats blinds him to the possibility of more basic, fundamental solutions.  At the UN, the president spoke glowingly of a broad, idealistic strategy that includes diplomatic, economic, political, and ideological components, while underplaying the importance of the military action needed to achieve victory. The fight against ISIS merited only a passing mention in a lengthy speech. Without a strong and effective military element -- led strategically by the US but leveraging (and cajoling!) regional allies on the ground--the diplomatic, economic and political pieces are little more than window dressing and doomed to failure.  All too often, the president deploys these empty buzz-phrases -- ""international community"" and ""comprehensive solutions"" -- to either justify inaction or present an overly complex approach that simply won't work in the real world. This is classic ivory-tower, blame-America-first-think that flies in the face of reality.  That's why, as much as I support the fight against ISIS, it's fair to be skeptical of Obama's newfound tough talk toward them. The president's incoherence on key issues related to foreign policy and security in both Iraq and Syria -- for example, his repeated self-defeating declarations about never sending troops to either theater, and his practice of issuing threats without consequences -- telegraph to our allies, as well as our enemies, that he'll have little stomach for the difficult and bloody days that lie ahead.  The president himself has acknowledged that the world is a ""messy place."" But his repeated tendency to lead from behind, avoid hard choices and pursue unrealistic solutions, Obama fails to see how his own fantasy-based foreign policy has made it a much messier and more dangerous place.

Part 2 provides a brief critique of the Obama Administration's climate policies.Climate activists see the President piously jaw-boning about the need for action to protect the climate for our children while his Administration is busily throwing millions of acres of public lands open to oil, gas and coal producers even as the State Department promotes fracking abroad, as if fracking were a solution to climate change and not a part of the problem.We will one day come to regret brashly disseminating this harmful technology just as we should rue the post-World War II Federal program that spread nuclear power technology around the world in the name of commercializing nuclear reactors, only to multiply the risks of nuclear weapons proliferation -- much to our consternation today.While the President has repeatedly called the nation's attention to the need for climate protection, his Administration has simultaneously protected its right flank politically against assault from the powerful fossil fuel lobby by wholeheartedly supporting the industry's drilling, mining, and fracking agenda, whether on Federal land or in the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic.It is not clear, however, how the Administration's efforts to dramatically increase U.S. fossil fuel production can be reconciled with his statements on the urgency of protecting the climate. Maximizing oil and gas and coal production is wholly inconsistent with climate protection, as is export of fossil fuels so others can burn it. But under the Obama Administration, the U.S. has become the world's largest producer of natural gas and the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.President Obama did not make climate change a major priority in his first term, but in his second he did put forward a Climate Action Plan in 2013 and sought to address climate with initiatives on energy efficiency, renewable energy, restrictions on power plant emissions, and an emphasis on the need to adapt to a changing climate. His UN address also included a roster of constructive new albeit mostly small-scale efforts. Notably, he announced he would instruct federal officials to consider climate change when providing international development aid. Earlier this year, his Administration with some fanfare released its Third National Climate Assessment, which underscores the gravity of climate change impacts and prospects in the U.S. The President took to the airwaves to publicize and defend these findings. But the Administration has dragged its feet on international climate negotiations since 2009. The nation deserves more ambitious, not to mention consistent, leadership from the President. His greenhouse gas reduction targets, for example -- 17 percent lower emissions in 2020 than 2005 -- are far less ambitious than the European Union's and its member states' goals.The new Climate Assessment makes clear that even at the level of current global warming -- less than 1˚C -- the impacts are already costly, dangerous and growing worse. Climate and weather disasters cost the U.S. some $100 billion in 2012, and the frequency and intensity of drought, floods and wildfires have all increased. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet has already begun collapsing, which will eventually raise sea level by 2-4 feet, inundating major U.S. cities where millions of Americans and others now live.Nonetheless, global climate negotiations are aimed at keeping the world's fever to 2˚C, which international negotiators are treating as a global climate safety limit, and the Obama Administration appears to be publicly acquiescing in this travesty. In my new book, Climate Peril, I demonstrate that 2˚C is demonstrably unsafe. ""It would be about two and a half times the warming that the Earth has already experienced since pre-industrial times. Rather than a safety limit, it is a nebulous transition zone between highly dangerous and extremely dangerous climate change.""In Climate Peril, I also explain how unlikely it is for us to keep the Earth from exceeding a rise of 2˚C, given current emissions trends and the excess heat already stored in the ocean, which will ultimately drive the Earth's temperature up by at least 1-2˚F, and possibly more.Climate change is already a planetary crisis that, if unchecked, will undermine our health, our economy, our environment, and our food supplies. Now that people are beginning to go into the streets to express their outrage at inaction about it, perhaps politicians will catch on. Even if oblivious to the gathering climate emergency, they cannot long remain indifferent to constituents willing to vote them out of office for condoning climate science denial and the do-nothing climate policies it was crafted to foster.Hopefully the emergence of an empowered citizens climate protection movement will hasten the achievement of an effective, enforceable global climate agreement and tough U.S. climate protection legislation.--  John J.

Although Monday was relatively peaceful, protesters were on edge on Tuesday, fearing a new round of police action.Chan Kin-man, a professor of sociology at the Chinese University who has been on the frontlines of the protests, said he has a stack of envelopes containing death threats scrawled in Chinese characters.""I understood that once I joined this movement, they would attack me and treat me as an enemy,"" Chan told Reuters, his head shaved in protest against Beijing's decision to rule out free elections for the city's next leader in 2017.Chan is a co-founder of the ""Occupy Central"" group that wants to lock down the business district.Another co-founder, Benny Tai, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, said he had also received death threats, some addressed to ""The Devil,"" with one envelope containing a razor blade.Five other academics told Reuters they had suffered intimidation because of their activism.It was not immediately clear who was behind the intimidation or threats. Chinese officials, worried that calls for democracy will spread to cities on the mainland, threatening the Communist Party's grip on power, have said the Occupy movement is illegal. But Tai doesn't believe Beijing sanctioned the letters.""For Beijing, I think it's important to protect me,"" Tai told Reuters. ""If I am in trouble, the blame will be on Beijing.""Neither Chan nor Tai reported the death threats to police. Tai told Reuters he did not believe it would be possible to trace them while Chan said he was advised by Tai not to make it a police case. OCCUPY IMPACTTai said a handful of core Occupy organizers abruptly left the movement and he attributes their departure to intimidation, possibly through their business ties with mainland China.""We know that kind of thing is happening,"" he said, declining to give details or say how many people had left.Another academic and Occupy supporter, Joseph Cheng, a political science professor at City of Hong Kong University, said he has also been targeted.Pro-Beijing newspaper Wen Wei Po has accused him of plagiarism and not reporting extra income, charges he has denied, though complaints were also lodged with his university, which said in an e-mailed statement that it was investigating in accordance with established rules and procedures.Wen Wei Po declined comment and Hong Kong's office of mainland affairs and its liaison office did not respond to phone calls or faxes requesting comment.Cheng told Reuters his computer has been hacked, his access to databases and relationships with mainland academics has deteriorated and he has struggled to obtain research funding.Pro-Beijing groups had stormed his lectures, urged the city's anti-graft agency to investigate him and harassed him outside his home, he said, adding that his wife had also been followed.The anti-graft agency, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, declined comment.""Anyone who speaks up, they can really destroy you, they can exert a lot of pressure on you,"" Cheng said.The intimidation comes at a time when two academics in the nearby former Portuguese colony of Macau, which returned to China two years after Hong Kong, were sacked for expressing their political views.None of the academics in Hong Kong has lost their jobs, suggesting that academic freedom, in its strictest sense, remains intact. In terms of formal, legal protections for academic freedom, Hong Kong is among the toughest in the world.However, Chan, the sociology professor, said there was ""zero chance"" of his returning to mainland China in the near future, fearful of physical harm or attempts to ruin his reputation.""If I go back, my friends warned me that they will use whatever dirty tricks,"" he said. ""You might be hit by a car or they will send a woman to your hotel room.""

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb47df1250000360038f9d7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Martin Scorsese has made 12 documentaries throughout his career, training his lens on such varied subjects as the Vietnam War (""Street Scenes""), Italian cinema (""My Voyage to Italy"") and Bob Dylan (""No Direction Home""). His latest, ""The 50 Year Argument,"" spotlights The New York Review of Books. The documentary chronicles the influential publication's five-decade history and the avenue it took to become a forerunner in thought-provoking journalism. Currently screening at the ongoing New York Film Festival, and having premiered Monday night on HBO, ""The 50 Year Argument"" is constructed from fascinating footage of the Review's many prolific contributors but lacks, at times, a narrative thread that does justice to the magazine's weight. The story of the Review's founding -- an opportunity Robert B. Silvers and Barbara Epstein seized when the 1962-63 newspaper strike angered publishers who could no longer rely on book reviews in The New York Times and other large publications -- creates a fascinating history lesson for anyone interested in media, literature or successful business models. The parade of notable contributors who appear in the film includes James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Joan Didion, Colm Tóibín and Michael Chabon, among others. Most engrossing is vintage footage of the ever-irritated Norman Mailer, seen in one clip arguing about feminism at a press conference and in another sparring with Gore Vidal about their work from the Review on ""The Dick Cavett Show."" ""The 50 Year Argument"" presents a rich portrait of the goings-on within the pages of the semi-monthly magazine, with only a glimpse of its impact in a larger context. The documentary succeeds in exalting the publication while examining its effect on individual writers and on certain high-minded ideas. But it squanders an opportunity to trace the manner in which thoughts put forth in The New York Review of Books -- which houses long-form journalism about science, art and politics as much as it does book reviews -- has trickled into other aspects of society and into today's media culture. The Review is a curation of well-researched, well-reported, well-considered think-pieces. It accomplished that years before the entire Internet could count such a thing as part of its cultural modus operandi. Scorsese and co-director David Tedeschi might find this notion too lowbrow for his documentary, which instead zeroes in on specific articles published in the magazine and specific writers' and editors' roles in shaping it. Lengthy portions of articles are read aloud. Sometimes, as with Baldwin's commentary about race or Didion's prescient (and, ultimately, accurate) suspicions about the guilt of the Central Park Five, the publication's effects outside of its own semi-celebrities become apparent. But, for the most part, there's a discussion missing from the documentary about why a critical mass of today's online writers treat themselves like academics, thrusting their (often also prognostic) ideas into the ether and slapping the now-complicated term ""think-piece"" on it. Instead, the film brings forth a series of vignettes devoted to specifics from the magazine's history. ""The 50 Year Argument"" is rarely uninteresting, save for a brief moment toward the end as the narration of article excerpts seems to grow longer and longer, but the movie doesn't prompt a conversation that extends past a reverence for the publication itself. Watch ""The 50 Year Argument' for its cast of colorful characters and the smart things they have to say, but it's up to you to draw a heftier inference about today's media culture as the offspring of 20th-century influences."

Since then, a persistently high murder rate, the closing of 50 public schools and a sense that Emanuel is out of touch have hurt his position and invited a bid from Karen Lewis, president of Chicago's teachers' union.Any candidate for mayor other than Emanuel, who served at President Barack Obama's first chief of staff, would start with a financial disadvantage. The mayor has taken advantage of his popularity with the city's business community and his national profile to raise more than $8 million in campaign funds.Lewis, who has not yet committed to a run, has less than $60,000, including $40,000 of her own money. A national teachers' union has pledged $1 million if she decides to challenge Emanuel.Support for Emanuel among black Chicagoans, a third of the city's population, has fallen sharply, according to recent polls. About one in four black voters now approves of Emanuel's performance, according to a Chicago Tribune poll released in mid-August. In May 2013, forty percent of black voters approved of the mayor's job performance, the Tribune said.Citywide, 35 percent of voters approve of his job performance.""He came in here with the Obama halo, and it was assumed his policies would reflect those of the president,"" Lewis said in an interview.In the same Tribune poll, 46 percent of black voters considered Lewis favorably, while results showed she would narrowly best Emanuel in a city-wide race.Lewis rose to prominence in Chicago politics in 2012 when she led the city's first teachers' strike in 25 years. During strike, which lasted seven days, she led downtown marches by teachers in red shirts.She then pressed her criticism of Emanuel when the mayor in 2013 moved to cut the schools budget by closing 50 schools - many of them in heavily African American communities. ROUGH, EVEN FOR CHICAGOCritics and political observers say Emanuel has had to make unpopular decisions while grappling with big financial problems, including an unfunded pension liability of $19.2 billion. The administration points to progress - the city's projected 2015 $297 million operating fund deficit is the lowest in seven years.""He came in and inherited a mess, really,"" said Kwame Raoul, who holds Obama's former state senate seat.Emanuel defends his hard work and ""tough decisions.""""For three-and-a-half years, he has worked closely with people in every neighborhood of Chicago,"" said Steve Mayberry, campaign spokesman.Emanuel's manner is tough even for Chicago, where bare-knuckles politics is the norm. His imperious style may have made unpopular decisions, such as school closings, even harder to swallow, said Alderman Roderick Sawyer, son of Chicago's last black mayor, Eugene Sawyer.""The way it was done, the swiftness of how it was done, that ticked off a lot of people,"" said Sawyer.If Lewis does decide to run, she would need to overcome her own vulnerabilities. She is seen by some as divisive. She has called Emanuel ""a liar and a bully"" and dubbed him ""the murder mayor,"" a reference to the city's high crime rate.Where Emanuel is famously disciplined as a campaigner and mayor, Lewis is freewheeling and has made occasional gaffes. She was videotaped mocking U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan's lisp. She later phoned Duncan to apologize.Emanuel already faces a small group of declared candidates. The best known is Alderman Bob Fioretti, who is white. The city election is non-partisan, and a runoff is held only if no candidate wins 50 percent plus 1 vote. Emanuel won in the first round in 2011.Roosevelt University political science professor Paul Green predicts Emanuel will survive the first round, if he does not win outright. Lewis and Fioretti could face difficulties raising campaign funds, because donors to Chicago mayoral campaigns typically are wary of backing opponents of powerful incumbents.""If you're going to be a big player and you're going to give money to a challenger, you better have a fairly good notion that person is going to win,"" Green said.

Ginsburg, 80, the oldest member of the Supreme Court and appointed to the court in 1993 by Democratic President Bill Clinton, has said on several occasions that she wants to match the longevity of Justice Louis Brandeis, who was 82 when he stepped down in 1939.

In an interview with Jeffrey Rosen for New Republic, Ginsburg discussed how her experience as a female Supreme Court Justice has been rewarding, but also trying. Since R.B.G. was appointed in 1993, she's been confused for Justice O'Connor, has dealt with frustration at the Court's approach to reproductive health, and has made a constant effort to approach gender equality with common sense. ""The worst times were the years I was alone,"" she said. ""The image to the public entering the courtroom was eight men, of a certain size, and then this little woman sitting to the side. That was not a good image for the public to see. But now, with the three of us on the bench, I am no longer lonely and my newest colleagues are not shrinking violets.""In the interview, Justice Ginsburg also offered advice to young feminists who view her as a role model: ""Work for the things that you care about."" She elaborated by talking about the Equal Rights Amendment, first introduced to Congress in 1923. It passed both houses of Congress in 1972, but was ultimately never ratified. Ginsburg describes the ERA as one of the most important movements for feminists of her generation, and urges women to find things they feel just as passionately about:I think of the ’70s, when many young women supported an Equal Rights Amendment. I was a proponent of the ERA. The women of my generation and my daughter’s generation, they were very active in moving along the social change that would result in equal citizenship stature for men and women. One thing that concerns me is that today’s young women don’t seem to care that we have a fundamental instrument of government that makes no express statement about the equal citizenship stature of men and women. They know there are no closed doors anymore, and they may take for granted the rights that they have.When it comes to women's equality, things have come a long way -- but there is still a lot left to achieve. Thank goodness for badasses like Ginsburg leading the charge. "

In 13 other states, it was a college basketball coach. For some, this might suggest that the public is devoting too much money to college sports. In fact, one might even argue that these coaches are overpaid.In a recent article in the New York Times, though, a different story was told. According to an unpublished study by two University of Vanderbilt researchers, college coaches are worth the money because of the revenue these coaches bring to the university. In the words of Randall Thomas (the lead author of the study): ""Coaches are running large programs that have tremendous value. They are creating great value, and they are being paid for creating that value.""The Vanderbilt study reaches this conclusion by comparing the salaries paid to college football coaches to the salaries paid to CEOs of public companies. Although the authors acknowledge some differences between the two sets of leaders -- for example, college coaches tend to get fired faster and thus college contracts are more focused on how employment can be terminated -- they find that in general the compensation of college coaches compares favorably to the wages paid to CEOs. In both cases wages are high. However -- as the authors argue -- it appears this compensation is ""structurally aligned with value creation"" for the employer (shareholders of firms or universities). And if you think the level of CEO pay is warranted, you would have to conclude that what college coaches receive is reasonable as well.One could easily argue that CEOs may not be worth their compensation. But I think there is a more significant problem with the argument made in this study. If you read through the 53-page study, you will not find any mention of one very large difference between the labor market a typical CEO faces and the labor market that exists in college sports.A typical CEO must hire labor in a competitive labor market. This means that firms often have to offer higher wages to attract better talent. In college sports, though, this is not allowed. Teams are prohibited from paying their players beyond the cost of attending the institution. We can see the impact of this restriction if we make another -- perhaps more relevant -- comparison. As part of my testimony in the Northwestern University football player's union case, I noted that in 2013 the 32 NFL head coaches were paid an average wage of $4.6 million. That same year, the average wage of the top 32 college football coaches -- according to data from USA Today --was $3.4 million. So top college coaches are paid about 74 percent of what a top NFL coach receives.Now let's turn to a different comparison. The U.S. Department of Education reports how much revenue each college football program earned from 2003 to 2012. If we look at the top 32 programs (ranked in terms of revenue) in 2012, we see that the average program earned $56.9 million. That same year -- according to Forbes.com (data we can find at the website of Rod Fort at the University of Michigan) -- the average NFL team earned $286.5 million in revenue. So a top college program earns less than 20 percent of the revenue earned by a top NFL team. This disparity, though, is not reflected in the wages paid to the coaches.One might argue that a college coach does more than an NFL coach. After all, a college coach has to not only coach the players, he must also recruit these athletes. In other words, a college coach is both coach and general manager. But even when we look at the wages paid to GM/Coaches in the NFL (i.e. Bill Bilichick and Mike Shanahan in 2013), it still appears that college coaches are paid much more than their organization's revenues would suggest. In 2013, Belichick and Shanahan were each paid 1.8 percent of their respective team's revenues. In contrast, the coaches at the top 32 college programs in 2012 were paid 5.5 percent of their respective revenues; or three times more than one might expect when looking at NFL compensation. In sum, it appears college football coaches -- relative to their counterparts in the NFL -- are overpaid. But isn't the success of a college team -- unlike what we might believe about the NFL -- all about the coach? Certainly that seems to be the story told when a college fires a coach and spends significant money on a new leader for the program. A recent study in the Social Science Quarterly, though, cast doubt on this tale. Looking at data from college football from 1997 to 2010, the authors of this study found ""that for particularly poorly performing teams, coach replacements have little effect on team performance as measured against comparable teams that did not replace their coach. However, for teams with middling records -- that is, teams where entry conditions for a new coach appear to be more favorable -- replacing the head coach appears to result in worse performance over subsequent years than comparable teams who retained their coach.""This study is consistent with a number of studies of coaching in sports. Academic research typically fails to find that coaches have a significant impact on outcomes in sports. And this may be why professional teams pay more to their players than they do to their coaches and/or managers. Of course, that is not the case in college sports. Once again, wages in college football are restricted by NCAA rules. To see how much they are restricted, let's think about what professional players are paid. Stefan Szymanski at the University of Michigan recently noted that National Football League players were paid 52 percent of revenues in 2012. A college football program has 85 scholarship players. If these players were paid 52 percent of team revenue in 2012, the average player at a top 32 program would have received $337,284. However, the average Football Bowl Subdivision program -- according to the USA Today -- offered a scholarship worth only $27,293 in 2011. This suggests that because of NCAA restrictions, college football players are dramatically underpaid.And that suggests -- once again -- that college football coaches might be overpaid. Unfortunately, the Vanderbilt study doesn't touch upon the role the players play in this story. In fact, one might conclude from this study that it is the coaches who are primarily responsible for creating the value we see in these programs. And again, that story is inconsistent with other academic studies of coaching.But anyone who watches college football has to notice that there are players on the field. And clearly those players matter. We can see this -- as Rod Fort and Jason Winfree noted -- by looking at the tremendous effort coaches expend to recruit specific players. In fact, the Vanderbilt study notes that prospective coaches are evaluated in terms of their ability to recruit. If those specific players didn't matter, coaches could just collect a few players from local high schools and then employ the coaches wisdom to achieve victory. Instead, coaches at each program search the nation (and in other sports, the world) to find the athletes they need to achieve success.When that success is achieved, the coaches get paid while the players -- relative to what they would be paid in a professional sport -- get paid much less. To offer a study of college coaches that ignores the nature of the college sport player market seems to be -- at a minimum -- incomplete. And certainly not enough to conclude that college coaches are worth -- in the words of one agent for the coaches -- ""every penny"" they are paid. "

The group overran the family farm as part of its offensive that captured vast swathes of territory in northern Iraq. Two weeks later, Paulis, who is a Christian, received a phone call from a man who said he was an Islamic State fighter.""We are in your warehouse. Why are you not here working and taking care of your business?"" the man asked in formal Arabic. ""Come back and we will guarantee your safety. But you must convert and pay $500.""When Paulis refused, the man spelled out the penalty. ""We are taking your wheat,"" he said. ""Just to let you know we are not stealing it because we gave you a choice.""Other fleeing farmers recount similar stories, and point to a little-discussed element of the threat Islamic State poses to Iraq and the region.The group now controls a large chunk of Iraq's wheat supplies. The United Nations estimates land under IS control accounts for as much as 40 percent of Iraq's annual production of wheat, one of the country's most important food staples alongside barley and rice. The militants seem intent not just on grabbing more land but also on managing resources and governing in their self-proclaimed caliphate.Wheat is one tool at their disposal. The group has begun using the grain to fill its pockets, to deprive opponents - especially members of the Christian and Yazidi minorities - of vital food supplies, and to win over fellow Sunni Muslims as it tightens its grip on captured territory. In Iraq's northern breadbasket, much as it did in neighboring Syria, IS has kept state employees and wheat silo operators in place to help run its empire.Such tactics are one reason IS poses a more complex threat than al Qaeda, the Islamist group from which it grew. For most of its existence, al Qaeda has focused on hit-and-run attacks and suicide bombings. But Islamic State sees itself as both army and government.""Wheat is a strategic good. They are doing as much as they can with it,"" said Ali Bind Dian, head of a farmers' union in Makhmur, a town near IS-held territory between Arbil and Mosul.""Definitely they want to show off and pretend they are a government.""The Sunni militants and their allies now occupy more than a third of Iraq and a similar chunk of neighboring Syria. The group generates income not just from wheat but also from ""taxes"" on business owners, looting, ransoming kidnapped Westerners and, most especially, the sale of oil to local traders. Oil brings in millions of dollars every month, according to estimates by Luay Al-Khatteeb, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar. That helps finance IS military operations - and is why IS-held oilfields in Syria are targets in U.S.-led airstrikes.""Islamic State presents itself as exactly that, a state, and in order to be able to sustain that image and that presentation, which is critical for continued recruitment and legitimacy, it depends on a sustainable source of income,"" said Charles Lister, another visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center. SEIZING CROPS AND LIVESTOCKIn early August, Kurdish farmer Saeed Mustafa Hussein watched through binoculars as armed IS militants shoveled wheat onto four trucks, then drove off in the direction of Arab villages. Hussein said he does not know what became of his wheat. But he knows that IS runs flour mills in areas it controls and he believes that his wheat was likely milled and sold.He had 54 tonnes of wheat on his farm in the village of Pungina, northeast of Arbil, wheat he had been unable to sell to a government silo or private traders because of fighting in the area.The militants also took 200 chickens and 36 prized pigeons.""What made it worse was that I was helpless to prevent this, I couldn't do anything. They took two generators from the village that we had recently received from the Kurdish government after a very long process,"" said Hussein.Residents are too scared to return even though Kurdish fighters are now in control. ""We think the Islamic State laid mines to keep us from going back,"" said neighbor Abdullah Namiq Mahmoud.There are scores of similar stories at displacement camps across Kurdistan.""We escaped with our money and gold but left our wheat and furniture and everything else,"" said farmer and primary school teacher Younis Saidullah, 62, a member of the tiny Kakaiya minority.""Everything we built for 20 years using my salary and our farming: It's all gone. We are back to zero,"" he said, sitting on the floor of a tent at a United Nations-run camp on the outskirts of Arbil. MILITARY AND ECONOMIC POWERAfter Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait triggered Western sanctions, the then-Iraqi dictator built a comprehensive subsidized food distribution system in Iraq. That was expanded under the United Nations' Oil-for-Food program. Joy Gordon, a political philosophy professor at Fairfield University in Connecticut and author of the 2010 book ""Invisible War: The United States and the Iraq Sanctions,"" estimates that two-thirds of Iraqis ""were dependent primarily or entirely"" on food subsidies between 1990 and 2003.The system survived the U.S. invasion and years of violence. Now fully run by the Iraqi government, it has been plagued in recent years by ""irregular (food) distributions"" that have cut dependency, according to a June report by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. A former U.S. Department of Agriculture economist estimates that about quarter of Iraqis living in rural areas were dependent on subsidized food before the latest violence, while another quarter used it to top up food they bought.IS is demonstrating that controlling wheat brings power. As its fighters swept through Iraq's north in June, they seized control of silos and grain stockpiles. The offensive coincided with the wheat and barley harvests and, crucially, the delivery of crops to government silos and private traders.IS now controls all nine silos in Nineveh Province, which spans the Tigris river, along with seven other silos in other provinces. In the three months since overrunning Nineveh's provincial capital Mosul, IS fighters have forced out hundreds of thousands of ethnic and religious minorities and seized hundreds of thousands of tonnes of wheat from abandoned fields.A SILO UNDER ATTACKOne target was the wheat silo in Makhmur, a town between the cities of Mosul and Kirkuk. The silo has a capacity of 250,000 tonnes, or approximately 8 percent of Iraq's domestic annual production in 2013.IS attacked Makhmur on August 7. But even in the weeks before that, the group had found a way into the silo and the Iraqi state procurement system.Abdel Rizza Qadr Ahmed, head of the silo, believes that IS forced local farmers to mix wheat produced in other, IS-controlled areas into their own harvest. The farmers then sold it to Makhmur as if it all had been grown locally. In the weeks before the attack, the silo purchased almost 14,000 more tonnes than it had in 2013. That extra wheat is worth approximately $9.5 million at the artificially high price Baghdad pays farmers.Ahmed believes IS was looking to make money from the wheat and ensure there was bread available for Sunnis in the areas it controlled.Ahmed said it was not his job to investigate the source of the grain, just to buy it. ""We just take the wheat from the farmers and we don't ask 'Where did you get this from?'"" he said.Huner Baba, local director general of agriculture, said he too believed that traders and farmers had sold wheat from outside the region.But Baghdad usually pays its wheat farmers around two months after they deposit their produce and so wheat farmers around Makhmur - and therefore IS - had not yet been paid by the time IS militants entered the town on June 7 and, according to Baba, headed for the silo.The militants were met by Iraqi Kurdish fighters, known as Peshmerga, and fighters from the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK). After IS took the silo, Baba said, they installed snipers there. He speculates that the militants believed U.S. warplanes would not strike the facility, which is in the center of town.""They want to get people on their side especially the Arabs. Maybe that's why they didn't do anything to the wheat, not to anger people,"" he said.IS held Makhmur for three days before the Kurdish fighters and U.S. air strikes on IS positions - though not on the silo - drove them out. U.S.-led air strikes did hit grain silos in the northern Syrian town of Manbij on Sept 28. A group monitoring the war said the aircraft may have mistaken the mills and grain silos for an Islamic State base. There was no immediate comment from Washington. SMOOTH TRANSITIONIn many ways, IS is replicating in Iraq strategies it developed in Syria. In the year it has controlled the town of Raqqa in northeastern Syria, for instance, IS militants say they have allowed former employees from Assad's regime to continue to run its mills. The group has set up a wheat ""diwan,"" or bureau, in charge of the supply chain, from harvesting the crop to distributing flour.The same push to keep things running smoothly can be seen in Iraq. IS fighters have regularly avoided destroying government installations they have captured. When IS took over Iraq's largest dam it kept employees in place and even brought in engineers from Mosul to make repairs.Baghdad, too, has tried to minimize upheaval.Hassan Ibrahim, head of Iraq's Grain Board, the Trade Ministry body responsible for procuring Iraq's wheat internationally and from local farmers, said that government employees in IS-held areas keep in regular touch with head office. Some staff in IS areas even come to Baghdad every couple of weeks, he said.In the past few weeks, he said, IS fighters had disappeared from some areas in Mosul and Kirkuk because of the U.S.-led air strikes. ""The situation is stable,"" he said, with IS fighters mostly happy to allow state employees to continue to run the silos.""I give instructions to my people to try to be quiet and smooth with those people because they are very violent people. It is not good to be violent with violent people because they will come to kill you. Our aim is to keep the wheat.""After IS's June offensive, Ibrahim was ordered to suspend salaries for workers in IS areas. ""But this troubled me,"" he said. ""I cannot have the mills stopping. I need people to stay there like guards to convince the Islamic State that wheat is important for everybody.""Ibrahim says he convinced his bosses to keep paying salaries. A Trade Ministry spokesman confirmed that all government employees in Mosul had been paid their salaries ""through state banks in Kirkuk, as it's safer and under government control.""Ibrahim is now worried about farmers who have not been paid for the wheat they delivered in the weeks before the grain was seized by IS.He said the Grain Board and the Trade Ministry were trying to pay farmers either living in IS-held areas or recently displaced from them. ""We would like to help the farmers, but not IS,"" he said.WINNING HEARTS AND STOMACHSIn some places, the IS stranglehold on wheat appears to be winning support among Sunnis.Ahsan Moheree, chairman of the government-affiliated Arab Farmers Union in Hawija, says IS has gained in popularity since its fighters took over. Baghdad's dismissive attitude towards the country's Sunni Arabs had forced people towards IS, he said. But IS's ability to provide food had also helped.""They distribute flour to the Arabs in the area. They get the wheat from the Hawija silo ... And they run the mill and they distribute to people in a very organized way,"" he said.Even those who have fled IS see wheat as one reason for the group's strength.""Nowadays a kilo of wheat is 4,000 or 5,000 dinars ($3.45 - $4.30). It used to be 10,000 to 11,000 dinars,"" said Joumana Zewar, 54, a farmer who now lives in Baharka camp outside Arbil. IS and Sunni Arabs are selling the wheat they stole ""for very cheap. It's cheap because they stole it.""Zewar called a friend in Mosul to check on the latest prices.""The price of foods and bread is very cheap,"" the friend said. Islamic State had taken control, and as in Syria, was dictating prices. ""They are the government here now. They are going to the bakeries and saying, 'Sell at this price.'""THE YEAR AHEADThe big worry now is next season's crop. In Nineveh province, home to the capital of the group's self-declared caliphate, 750,000 hectares (1.8 million acres) should soon be sown with wheat and 835,000 hectares with barley, an Iraqi agriculture ministry official said.The official said that the province normally has 100,000 farmers. But thousands have fled.Iraqi farmers normally get next season's seeds from their current harvest, keeping back some of the wheat for that purpose. IS controls enough wheat so finding seeds should not be a problem. It also controls Ministry of Agriculture offices in Mosul and Tikrit which should have fertilizer supplies.But getting the seeds and fertilizer into the right hands will be a problem. Mohamed Diab, director of the World Food Program's Regional Bureau for the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia and Eastern Europe, said that it is ""highly unlikely"" that displaced farmers would return.""The picture is bleak regarding agriculture production next year,"" he said. ""The place where displacement has happened is the main granary of the country.""That's especially true for non-Sunni Arab farmers. Those who have remained on their land just outside IS-held territory fear the militants will soon take their villages, and their harvested but unsold crops.Even if that does not happen, they say, they will not plant after the first rain, which typically comes at the end of September or in early October.Farmers in the town of Shekhan, nestled among sun-bleached wheat fields, say they have no hope of getting the seeds, fertilizer and fuel needed to plant because the provincial government in Mosul is under IS control.""The real problem is how to get seeds to those inside Mosul and surrounding areas,"" said Nineveh Governor Atheel Nujaifi, who believes production will drop next season.Bashar Jamo, head of a local farmers' cooperative, is also worried. ""The most important thing to us is agriculture, not security. Maybe (IS) will have a state, maybe an army, but all we need is to be able to farm.""

He wasn't talking about a ""living wage."" He was talking about a ""minimum wage"" that was set at a decent level. The difference matters, and will matter more as America confronts its income inequality problem.A ""minimum wage"" is a government-established standard for what a private-sector employer must pay to a private-sector employee. It's been law since the New Deal, varying from state to state. It affects all employers, as defined in law, and is seen as a basic worker protection. The right says it depresses employment; the left says it assures decent compensation and has no long-term effect on jobs.A ""living wage"" is something different, although there's a lot of sloppy verbiage about it and the two are often used interchangeably. A ""living wage"" is considerably higher than a minimum wage and is required only of those employers who receive significant public benefits. In other words, if you get taxpayer money to build your project, then people who are employed there are to be paid a higher wage than the marketplace would offer. If you get a public subsidy, you pay your employees enough to live on. If you don't want to pay a living wage, don't take the subsidy.There's a lot more to living wage proposals than emotional appeals to help working families and reaction to corporate welfare. Increasing wages will increase spendable income, which will increase demand, which will increase economic activity that benefits everyone. It's anti-austerity economics turned into a workable program.Whatever opposition exists to government wage setting, there's little intellectual basis for opposing government setting economic conditions when it gives public money to a private person. Developers and other corporate beneficiaries of taxpayer largesse don't have much of a place to stand when they oppose living wages. Even otherwise sensible developers like New York's Doug Durst fall back on untrue-isms used against the minimum wage: ""If you mandate that people get higher benefits at projects that the city puts money into, you're not going to get tenants."" That's just holdover nonsense from the Bloomberg era.The rise in national concern about income inequality has been a little slow to develop workable remedies. They will come as more thinking is devoted to it and as Americans demand government action to undo the policies that have concentrated wealth and made it hard to live for average working families. Living wage proposals seem to be the fastest and easiest to explain of the current remedies.The left's newest icon, Mayor Bill de Blasio, has just jumped to the front of the line of living wage proponents, deciding to greatly expand the number of workers covered and the amount they will receive. It's a solid proposal, but needs better explaining. The public has generally accepted the idea of minimum wage increases. But support for living wage increases, because they're tied to public subsidies for corporations, will be bigger, faster and more sustained. It should be Number One in de Blasio's ambition to create a progressive model for workable, efficient government.Shifts in public opinion are faster than the development of concrete remedies. So it is with living wage proposals. But the combination of Bill de Blasio and Adam Smith should be enough to kick-start a national upsurge of living wage laws. It's good economics and it's good policy."

You put about $68 billion annually into a maze of 17 major intelligence outfits. You build them glorious headquarters. You create a global surveillance state for the ages. You listen in on your citizenry and gather their communications in staggering quantities. Your employees even morph into avatars and enter video-game landscapes, lest any Americans betray a penchant for evil deeds while in entertainment mode. You collect information on visits to porn sites just in case, one day, blackmail might be useful. You pass around naked photos of them just for... well, the salacious hell of it. Your employees even use aspects of the system you’ve created to stalk former lovers and, within your arcane world, that act of ""spycraft"" gains its own name: LOVEINT.You listen in on foreign leaders and politicians across the planet. You bring on board hundreds of thousands of crony corporate employees, creating the sinews of an intelligence-corporate complex of the first order. You break into the “backdoors” of the data centers of major Internet outfits to collect user accounts. You create new outfits within outfits, including an ever-expanding secret military and intelligence crew embedded inside the military itself (and not counted among those 17 agencies). Your leaders lie to Congress and the American people without, as far as we can tell, a flicker of self-doubt. Your acts are subject to secret courts, which only hear your versions of events and regularly rubberstamp them -- and whose judgments and substantial body of lawmaking are far too secret for Americans to know about.You have put extraordinary effort into ensuring that information about your world and the millions of documents you produce doesn’t make it into our world. You even have the legal ability to gag American organizations and citizens who might speak out on subjects that would displease you (and they can’t say that their mouths have been shut). You undoubtedly spy on Congress. You hack into congressional computer systems. And if whistleblowers inside your world try to tell the American public anything unauthorized about what you’re doing, you prosecute them under the Espionage Act, as if they were spies for a foreign power (which, in a sense, they are, since you treat the American people as if they were a foreign population). You do everything to wreck their lives and -- should one escape your grasp -- you hunt him implacably to the ends of the Earth.As for your top officials, when their moment is past, the revolving door is theirs to spin through into a lucrative mirror life in the intelligence-corporate complex.What They Didn’t KnowThink of the world of the “U.S. Intelligence Community,” or IC, as a near-perfect closed system and rare success story in 21st-century Washington. In a capital riven by fierce political disagreements, just about everyone agrees on the absolute, total, and ultimate importance of that ""community"" and whatever its top officials might decide in order to keep this country safe and secure.Yes, everything you’ve done has been in the name of national security and the safety of Americans. And as we’ve discovered, there is never enough security, not at least when it comes to one thing: the fiendish ability of “terrorists” to threaten this country. Admittedly, terrorist attacks would rank above shark attacks, but not much else on a list of post-9/11 American dangers. And for this, you take profuse credit -- for, that is, the fact that there has never been a “second 9/11.” In addition, you take credit for breaking up all sorts of terror plans and plots aimed at this country, including an amazing 54 of them reportedly foiled using the phone and email “metadata” of Americans gathered by the NSA. As it happens, a distinguished panel appointed by President Obama, with security clearances that allowed them to examine these spectacular claims in detail, found that not a single one had merit.Whatever the case, while taxpayer dollars flowed into your coffers, no one considered it a problem that the country lacked 17 overlapping outfits bent on preventing approximately 400,000 deaths by firearms in the same years; nor 17 interlocked agencies dedicated to safety on our roads, where more than 450,000 Americans have died since 9/11. (An American, it has been calculated, is 1,904 times more likely to die in a car accident than in a terrorist attack.) Almost all the money and effort have instead been focused on the microscopic number of terrorist plots -- some spurred on by FBI plants -- that have occurred on American soil in that period. On the conviction that Americans must be shielded from them above all else and on the fear that 9/11 bred in this country, you’ve built an intelligence structure unlike any other on the planet when it comes to size, reach, and labyrinthine complexity.It’s quite an achievement, especially when you consider its one downside: It has a terrible record of getting anything right in a timely way. Never have so many had access to so much information about our world and yet been so unprepared for whatever happens in it.When it comes to getting ahead of the latest developments on the planet, the ones that might really mean something to the government it theoretically serves, the IC is -- as best we can tell from the record it largely prefers to hide -- almost always behind the 8-ball. It seems to have been caught off guard regularly enough to defy any imaginable odds. Think about it, and think hard. Since 9/11 (which might be considered the intelligence equivalent of original sin when it comes to missing the mark), what exactly are the triumphs of a system the likes of which the world has never seen before? One and only one event is sure to come immediately to mind: the tracking down and killing of Osama bin Laden. (Hey, Hollywood promptly made a movie out of it!) Though he was by then essentially a toothless figurehead, an icon of jihadism and little else, the raid that killed him is the single obvious triumph of these years.Otherwise, globally from the Egyptian spring and the Syrian disaster to the crisis in Ukraine, American intelligence has, as far as we can tell, regularly been one step late and one assessment short, when not simply blindsided by events. As a result, the Obama administration often seems in a state of eternal surprise at developments across the globe. Leaving aside the issue of intelligence failures in the death of an American ambassador in Benghazi, for instance, is there any indication that the IC offered President Obama a warning on Libya before he decided to intervene and topple that country’s autocrat, Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011? What we know is that he was told, incorrectly it seems, that there would be a “bloodbath,” possibly amounting to a genocidal act, if Gaddafi's troops reached the city of Benghazi.Might an agency briefer have suggested what any reading of the results of America's 21st-century military actions across the Greater Middle East would have taught an observant analyst with no access to inside information: that the fragmentation of Libyan society, the growth of Islamic militancy (as elsewhere in the region), and chaos would likely follow? We have to assume not, though today the catastrophe of Libya and the destabilization of a far wider region of Africa is obvious.Let’s focus for a moment, however, on a case where more is known. I’m thinking of the development that only recently riveted the Obama administration and sent it tumbling into America’s third Iraq war, causing literal hysteria in Washington. Since June, the most successful terror group in history has emerged full blown in Syria and Iraq, amid a surge in jihadi recruitment across the Greater Middle East and Africa. The Islamic State (IS), an offshoot of al-Qaeda in Iraq, which sprang to life during the U.S. occupation of that country, has set up a mini-state, a “caliphate,” in the heart of the Middle East. Part of the territory it captured was, of course, in the very country the U.S. garrisoned and occupied for eight years, in which it had assumedly developed countless sources of information and recruited agents of all sorts. And yet, by all accounts, when IS’s militants suddenly swept across northern Iraq, the CIA in particular found itself high and dry.The IC seems not to have predicted the group’s rapid growth or spread; nor, though there was at least some prior knowledge of the decline of the Iraqi army, did anyone imagine that such an American created, trained, and armed force would so summarily collapse. Unforeseen was the way its officers would desert their troops who would, in turn, shed their uniforms and flee Iraq’s major northern cities, abandoning all their American equipment to Islamic State militants.Nor could the intelligence community even settle on a basic figure for how many of those militants there were. In fact, in part because IS assiduously uses couriers for its messaging instead of cell phones and emails, until a chance arrest of a key militant in June, the CIA and the rest of the IC evidently knew next to nothing about the group or its leadership, had no serious assessment of its strength and goals, nor any expectation that it would sweep through and take most of Sunni Iraq. And that should be passing strange. After all, it now turns out that much of the future leadership of IS had spent time together in the U.S. military’s Camp Bucca prison just years earlier.All you have to do is follow the surprised comments of various top administration officials, including the president, as ISIS made its mark and declared its caliphate, to grasp just how ill-prepared 17 agencies and $68 billion can leave you when your world turns upside down. Producing Subprime Intelligence as a Way of LifeIn some way, the remarkable NSA revelations of Edward Snowden may have skewed our view of American intelligence. The question, after all, isn’t simply: Who did they listen in on or surveil or gather communications from? It’s also: What did they find out? What did they draw from the mountains of information, the billions of bits of intelligence data that they were collecting from individual countries monthly (Iran, 14 billion; Pakistan, 13.5 billion; Jordan, 12.7 billion, etc.)? What was their “intelligence”? And the answer seems to be that, thanks to the mind-boggling number of outfits doing America’s intelligence work and the yottabytes of data they sweep up, the IC is a morass of information overload, data flooding, and collective blindness as to how our world works.You might say that the American intelligence services encourage the idea that the world is only knowable in an atmosphere of big data and a penumbra of secrecy. As it happens, an open and open-minded assessment of the planet and its dangers would undoubtedly tell any government so much more. In that sense, the system bolstered and elaborated since 9/11 seems as close to worthless in terms of bang for the buck as any you could imagine. Which means, in turn, that we outsiders should view with a jaundiced eye the latest fear-filled estimates and overblown ""predictions"" from the IC that, as now with the tiny (possibly fictional) terror group Khorasan, regularly fill our media with nightmarish images of American destruction.If the IC’s post-9/11 effectiveness were being assessed on a corporate model, it’s hard not to believe that at least 15 of the agencies and outfits in its “community” would simply be axed and the other two downsized. (If the Republicans in Congress came across this kind of institutional tangle and record of failure in domestic civilian agencies, they would go after it with a meat cleaver.) I suspect that the government could learn far more about this planet by anteing up some modest sum to hire a group of savvy observers using only open-source information. For an absolute pittance, they would undoubtedly get a distinctly more actionable vision of how our world functions and its possible dangers to Americans. But of course we’ll never know. Instead, whatever clever analysts, spooks, and operatives exist in the maze of America’s spy and surveillance networks will surely remain buried there, while the overall system produces vast reams of subprime intelligence.Clearly, having a labyrinth of 17 overlapping, paramilitarized, deeply secretive agencies doing versions of the same thing is the definition of counterproductive madness. Not surprisingly, the one thing the U.S. intelligence community has resembled in these years is the U.S. military, which since 9/11 has failed to win a war or accomplish more or less anything it set out to do.On the other hand, all of the above assumes that the purpose of the IC is primarily to produce successful “intelligence” that leaves the White House a step ahead of the rest of the world. What if, however, it's actually a system organized on the basis of failure? What if any work-product disaster is for the IC another kind of win.Perhaps it's worth thinking of those overlapping agencies as a fiendishly clever Rube Goldberg-style machine organized around the principle that failure is the greatest success of all. After all, in the system as it presently exists, every failure of intelligence is just another indication that more security, more secrecy, more surveillance, more spies, more drones are needed; only when you fail, that is, do you get more money for further expansion. Keep in mind that the 21st-century version of intelligence began amid a catastrophic failure: Much crucial information about the 9/11 hijackers and hijackings was ignored or simply lost in the labyrinth. That failure, of course, led to one of the great intelligence expansions, or even explosions, in history. (And mind you, no figure in authority in the national security world was axed, demoted, or penalized in any way for 9/11 and a number of them were later given awards and promoted.) However they may fail, when it comes to their budgets, their power, their reach, their secrecy, their careers, and their staying power, they have succeeded impressively.You could, of course, say that the world is simply a hard place to know and the future, with its eternal surprises, is one territory that no country, no military, no set of intelligence agencies can occupy, no matter how much they invest in doing so. An inability to predict the lay of tomorrow's land may, in a way, be par for the course. If so, however, remind me: Why exactly are we supporting 17 versions of intelligence gathering to the tune of at least $68 billion a year?Tom Engelhardt is a co-founder of the American Empire Project and the author of The United States of Fear as well as a history of the Cold War, The End of Victory Culture.

His facial expression said it all, with a little help from one chuckle. After the Kansas City Chiefs dominated the Patriots for a 41-14 win, Belichick was asked if he plans on evaluating the quarterback position. The 37-year-old Tom Brady completed 14 of 23 passes for just 159 yards and threw two interceptions and one touchdown pass. After Brady's second interception, which was returned for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, Belichick took Brady out of the game and put in backup QB Jimmy Garoppolo. The 22-year-old rookie out of Eastern Illinois threw for 70 yards and a touchdown. This is how Belichick responded to the quarterback evaluation question:It seems clear what Belichick was thinking: ""Are you kidding me? Bench my three-time Super Bowl winning quarterback? No more questions for that reporter."" "

She also highlighted some of these policy choices in her memoir “Hard Choices” and how they contributed to the challenges that Barack Obama’s administration now faces. Read more on Al Jazeera"
22,IMPACT,"For Army Couple Reentering Civilian Life, Food Insecurity Just One of Many Challenges","Kenneth Estelle, ContributorCEO, Feeding America West Michigan Food Bank",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/for-army-couple-reenterin_b_5906464.html,"On the morning of Sept. 3, Jon and Elizabeth Alba waited two hours at the VA Medical Clinic in Iron Mountain, Mich., not for medical care but for a few days' supply of groceries.",2014-09-30,2014-09-30-ElizabethandJonathanAlbaArmyVetsEscanabacroppedhorizontal.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-30-ElizabethandJonathanAlbaArmyVetsEscanabacroppedhorizontal-thumb.JPG,"The Alba family is just one of an estimated 620,000 military households seeking help from the Feeding America network.On the morning of Sept. 3, Jon and Elizabeth Alba waited two hours at the VA Medical Clinic in Iron Mountain, Mich., not for medical care but for a few days' supply of groceries. Feeding America West Michigan Food Bank was distributing more than 40,000 pounds of food in what would be their single largest Mobile Food Pantry. Some 2,700 veterans and their family members were served that day. Jon, an infantryman, completed his contract in January. Elizabeth was released from her contract as a combat medic in February after discovering that the stress fracture in her hip required surgery. Since then, with a mixture of creativity and tenacity, the Albas have managed to scrape together a living, but it hasn't been easy, especially since the couple is now responsible for Elizabeth's 17-year-old brother. They gained custody of him after it became clear that his dad, an Iraq War veteran, was no longer emotionally stable enough to care for him.According to a recent study, Feeding America provides food to 620,000 households with at least one member currently serving in the military, while 20 percent of all Feeding America households include a veteran or current servicemember.The Albas met in Texas, where they were both stationed. It was a broken-down motorcycle and a pickup truck that brought them together.Jon, a native Texan, was an infantryman with the 1-124th Cavalry Squadron in Waco, Texas. Elizabeth, raised in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, enlisted at 17 and was stationed in Wylie. She was driving her truck one day when she spotted a guy standing on the shoulder of the road next to his bike looking forlorn. Something of a motorcycle mechanic herself, she decided to stop and help him out. ""On the way back to his place, we started talking and I found out he had just got back from Fort Bliss for training,"" Elizabeth said. ""I told him I was in the military, I was a combat medic. We were in the same battalion.""The couple got married last year and moved to Escanaba to be near Elizabeth's family. While jobs are scarce in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in general, they've learned that Army training doesn't necessarily translate into civilian work as easily as recruiters claim.""I was a door-kicker. That was my job,"" Jon said. To become a police officer, an occupation often held up as a good option for soldiers, he would need an additional two years of schooling. Like many soldiers his age, Jon saw combat. Unlike most, his unit wasn't sent to Iraq or Afghanistan, but into the turmoil of the drug war along the U.S./Mexico border.""I don't ask him about it because he gets kind of spacey. They lost a couple people over there,"" Elizabeth said.In addition to Elizabeth's stress fracture, for which she's still awaiting treatment, she sustained a head injury at Fort Jackson that causes her to black out, putting many of the jobs she's qualified for out of reach.""No one wants me to work for them with my passing out and my hip, and Jon, no one wants to hire him when there's a loud noise and he's hitting the dirt.""So they got creative. Elizabeth taught herself to read Braille and now transposes books for the visually impaired. Jon is teaching mixed martial arts at a gym in Escanaba, along with a self-defense system he developed himself.While the Albas have managed to find jobs, many of their peers haven't. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 21.4 percent of veterans aged 18-24 are unemployed, while only 46 percent of veterans with a service-connected disability are in the labor force. ""It's hard. It's a hard sacrifice,"" Elizabeth said of their service. ""It's not only a sacrifice for us. It's for our family, for our health.""Asked whether they would enlist again if they had the chance, Elizabeth is confident in her answer: ""Yes, but only for one reason and that's for my country.""With a hopefulness tempered by realism, the Albas are determined to make things work. Jon says they try to live by the same principle he teaches his students: ""If it means something to you, you'll make time. If it means nothing, you'll make an excuse.""""We're doing what we can with what we have."""
