Sounds promising, until you get to the part where it’s the NFL itself that’s designing the program. Will there be sessions on “hiding videos for beginners?” A lunch program on crafting the perfect tweet toblame a player’s battered spouse? How to blame your parents for beating your four-year-old son?I understand that these programs are likely the first of many stops on the NFL apology tour, but I find it difficult to believe the answer to all of this drawn-out wrongdoing will be found in NFL locker rooms, with employees listening to mandatory NFL-designed domestic violence speakers. According to Goodell’s announcement, these compulsory programs are being developed by the NFL Players Association and a “top group of experts” that the NFL hired last week. And the woman in charge of one anti-violence organizations the NFL plans to “partner” with told me Sunday night that, as of right now, the relationship is purely financial.Read more on The Guardian"

For all you post 50s looking for more substantial fare, you're in luck. Here are six films coming out between now and Christmas that should have you thinking, laughing and even crying.""This Is Where I Leave You"" (Sept. 19) First up is this family comedy featuring one of the strongest casts of the season. Jane Fonda, Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Connie Britton, and Adam Driver all star in this movie about dysfunctional relationships. Following the death of their father, Fey and her siblings -- as well as their significant others -- are forced to sit shiva (a week-long Jewish mourning period) by their famous therapist mother, played by Fonda, in this adaptation of Jonathan Tropper’s best-selling novel. This film should prove interesting if for no other reason than the fact Fey will play a woman who doesn't work -- a stretch for the ""30 Rock"" star.""Gone Girl"" (Oct. 3) This hotly anticipated thriller is based on the best-selling novel by Gillian Flynn, which many of you probably read in book club. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike star as Nick and Amy, the seemingly happy couple that actually harbors a lot of secrets. Affleck's character becomes the target of an investigation after his famous wife suddenly disappears. If that doesn't entice you, Neil Patrick Harris also has been cast as Amy's obsessive ex-boyfriend. With only weeks to go until its release, speculation is swirling as to how the end of the movie might differ from the end of the book (as it reportedly does).""Fury"" (Oct. 17) After the disappointing movie ""The Monuments Men"" earlier this year, we're due for a really good, gritty World War II film. We're hoping ""Fury"" might be it. Starring Brad Pitt, the movie takes place during the final months of the war, as the Allies make a final push in Europe. Pitt plays battle-hardened U.S. army sergeant Wardaddy, who leads a five-member crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines in Germany. The film is from writer-director David Ayer, who also wrote and directed the Oscar-winning ""Training Day."" Word has it that ""Fury"" is supposed to offer a disturbingly authentic portrayal of the suffering endured by the Allied troops who entered Germany.""Birdman"" (Limited release Oct. 17) After its debut at the Venice Film Festival, critics everywhere were praising the performance by Michael Keaton -- who played Batman for Tim Burton and who stars in ""Birdman"" as a washed-up superhero star trying to make a comeback on Broadway. Just a few days before opening night, he suffers a meltdown as he seeks to regain his former glory. Alejandro G. Iñárritu's dark comedy also stars Emma Stone and Edward Norton. ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" (Dec. 12) This film has already generated a lot of heat, even months before its release. That's because director Ridley Scott cast white actors such as Christian Bale, Sigourney Weaver and Aaron Paul as Egyptians in the Biblical epic, while non-white members were assigned the roles of slaves and other lower-class members of society. In many ways, this appears to be Scott's biggest project ever. And yet Scott, who turns 77 later this year, has told reporters that the film is at heart a brother vs. brother story, pitting Bale's Moses against his adopted sibling, the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses (Joel Edgerton).  ""Unbroken"" (Dec. 25) Angelina Jolie will once again step behind the camera -- she made her directorial debut with 2011's ""In The Land Of Blood And Honey"" -- to bring the story of Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini to life. Zamperini, also an Air Force captain who survived a plane crash, spent 47 days adrift at sea before being taken prisoner by the Japanese for more than two years in the 1940s. The World War II drama is based on Laura Hillenbrand's non-fiction book of the same name. Hillenbrand is a great storyteller, having also written ""Seabiscuit,"" adapted into a 2003 film starring Tobey Maguire."
2,POLITICS,Senate Democrats Reveal Not-So-Secret Weapon In Campaign To Stay In Control,Michael McAuliff and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-democrats-campaign_n_5853150.html,,2014-09-21,"UNITED STATES Ã FEBRUARY 28: Guy Cecil, executive director of the DSCC (Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee) speaks to Roll Call in his office in Washington on Monday, Feb. 28, 2011. (Photo By Bill Clark/Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d68a2100004502c96584.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- By all rights, Democrats in the U.S. Senate should be measuring drapes for smaller offices as they head home for an election season that many analysts predict will hand control of the upper chamber to Republicans. But the man most directly in charge of salvaging a grim year for Democrats told HuffPost in an interview this week that there are a couple of not-so-secret but underappreciated reasons why there's an even chance the Senate will remain in Democratic hands. ""The reality is, we are dealing probably with the worst map in at least a generation,"" said Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, headed by Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.). But Cecil explained his reasons for optimism, starting with the elements of 2014's unusually fluid political atmosphere that he and his outfit can actually affect: The ground game in key states, along with the ad and infrastructure spending to back it up.""I don’t worry about the things I can control. I worry about the things that you can't -- just the general environment,"" Cecil said. ""Constantly thinking about what we need to do to prepare ourselves for a change in environment, what do we need to do to prepare ourselves for a change in the president’s numbers in these states -– those are the things that we stay more focused on.""That constant thinking has spawned an unprecedented effort in a midterm election year, called the Bannock Street Project after the location of Bennet's 2010 campaign office. It's a $60 million investment in the idea that good data can produce more efficient politics that, in turn, gets complacent Democrats to the polls and inactive voters engaged. For the first time this campaign season, Cecil revealed what this theory means in practical terms. To date, the DSCC has built a political army of 51,000 volunteers who have taken campaign action -- ""people that have actually made phone calls, registered voters, knocked on doors."" That includes 9,966 volunteers in North Carolina, 2,688 in Alaska, 3,965 in Arkansas, 6,218 in Iowa, an estimated 6,000 in Georgia, 5,500 in Colorado, 3,250 in Kentucky, and 3,700 in New Hampshire.The total is likely to reach 61,000 by the election. In addition, the DSCC expects to have 4,000 paid staffers by November, according to Deputy Executive Director Matt Canter.Without seeing the volunteers and staffers in action, it's difficult to tell the tangible effects of such an investment. But the magnitude is easy to understand when placed in historical context. ""If you just look at what we invested in 2010, we are spending more money in North Carolina and Alaska [this cycle] than we invested in every single state in 2010 combined,"" Cecil said. ""The Colorado program now makes the Colorado program that we ran in 2010 [a program that earned accolades for its get-out-the-vote prowess] look J.V. They just have more offices, more infrastructure, more staff, more volunteers at this point by far than what we had in 2010."" In an election year where the president's popularity ratings are abysmal and the key races are in Republican-leaning states, a comprehensive ground game may be the one trump card Democrats have. It's not just that the DSCC is unleashing an unprecedented number of volunteers. It's the surgical method they're using. Cecil noted committee workers have leaned on members of the Congressional Black Caucus to help with surrogate operations in predominantly African-American areas, run Native American outreach programs in Alaska and parts of Colorado, used digital advertising to reach minority populations, and buffed up legal resources to help with voter registration and voter ID law efforts. ""We are pretty obsessive about making sure we are doing everything we can,"" said Cecil. ""We send our field staff out to states the minute we see them dropping off of goals or seeing their flight rate increase -- the percentage of volunteers who say they will volunteer and then don’t come. We work on how to reduce those rates.  ""Data is not the decider in the election,"" he added. ""Data just gives us the tools to know if we are doing a good job measuring against the goals we have set.""The National Republican Senatorial Committee's top spokesman, Brad Dayspring, didn't dispute the effort his opponents were putting into the contest. He suggested that Republicans, whose ground game suffered badly in 2012, would be much improved this year.“One rare consistent this cycle is that Guy Cecil’s name is atop every rumored Hillary ’16 staff list, so we are very cognizant of how well regarded he is,"" Dayspring said, referring to rumors that Cecil would be a top choice to run a new presidential bid by Hillary Clinton. ""Guy and his team at the DSCC have their plans, we have ours, and we’ll see who wins on Election Day.”While data may fuel the DSCC's operation, there's another big reason why Cecil said he believes Democrats have a chance to hold the Senate. Even with President Barack Obama's approval ratings in the tank, Cecil has the benefit of running against politicians even more loathed by the public -- Republicans.""We are dealing with red states where the president is unpopular, but the Republican Party is also pretty unpopular,"" Cecil said.And it's not just the GOP generally. The specific candidates who have taken up the party's banner are not exactly covered in glory, Cecil argued.""I think if you look at it, despite the public relations job that they have done about how great their candidates are, the fact of the matter is, when you look at candidates, [there is] Tom Cotton, who has not exactly met expectations, or Terri Lynn Land, who won’t talk to the press, won’t talk to voters, won’t debate, or Monica Wehby in Oregon, who they talk less and less about as time goes on,"" Cecil said.""I think the reality is that as much as we can make it about the two candidates, and as much as we can make it about their respective states … I think the better chance we have at being successful,"" he said.Of course, with just seven weeks until Election Day, the Bannock Street Project has already suffered some losses that temper Democrats' optimism.   For instance, in Montana and West Virginia -- two states that were part of the effort -- Democrats are all but out of the hunt. They lost their candidate in Montana -- Sen. John Walsh -- to a plagiarism scandal, and West Virginia contender Natalie Tennant has failed to gain traction. Even in the project's birth state of Colorado, where Democrats had been confident, Sen. Mark Udall is facing a neck-and-neck challenge from GOP Rep. Cory Gardner. One of the project's marquee contests -- the bid by Alison Lundergan Grimes to knock off Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky -- has faded of late. Cecil is somewhat philosophical about the tough polls in other red states where Democratic incumbents are in difficult spots. Though the DSCC is devoting historic resources to ginning up the vote this year, Cecil, at this juncture, is happy just to be competitive. ""We are dealing with all the challenges of the midterm election that normally are more challenging for us in terms of turnout. We are dealing with Republican states where the president is unpopular,"" Cecil said. ""And yet, despite all of that, people think that at the very worst, we have at least a fighting shot to hold the majority.""CLARIFICATION: This post has been updated to specify the timeline for the DSCC's hiring of 4,000 paid staffers.

Marchers carried pictures of sunflowers and, at the rally's head, a banner reading ""front lines of crisis, forefront of climate change.""The march was due to step off around 11:30 a.m. ET (1530 GMT), covering a 2-mile (3.2-km) route winding past Times Square.Organizers billed the event as the largest gathering focused on climate change since 2009, when tens of thousands gathered in Copenhagen in a sometime raucous demonstration that resulted in the detention of 2,000 protesters.De Blasio on Sunday unveiled a new plan for the city to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2050.All 3,000 major city-owned buildings would be retrofitted with energy saving heating, cooling and light systems by then, he said, though meeting the commitment will also require significant investments by private landlords.""Climate change is an existential threat to New Yorkers and our planet,"" de Blasio said.

The Trump Plaza, which opened on May 14, 1984, shut down September 16, 2014, the fourth casino to shutter its doors this year, and a fifth casino, the Trump Taj Mahal, may close if it cannot cut costs of operation. The massive contraction, following years of customer losses to surrounding states, is eliminating 8,000 jobs, or about a quarter of the industry's employment in Atlantic City. AFP PHOTO/Don Emmert (Photo credit should read DON EMMERT/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31389240000320055bf28.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Thirty years ago, on its opening day in 1984, Donald Trump stood in a dark topcoat on the casino floor at Atlantic City's Trump Plaza, celebrating his new investment as the finest building in Atlantic City and possibly the nation.Last week, the Trump Plaza folded and the Trump Taj Mahal filed for bankruptcy, leaving some 1,000 employees without jobs.Trump, meanwhile, was on Twitter claiming he had ""nothing to do with Atlantic City,"" and praising himself for his ""great timing"" in getting out of the investment.In America, people with lots of money can easily avoid the consequences of bad bets and big losses by cashing out at the first sign of trouble.The laws protect them through limited liability and bankruptcy.But workers who move to a place like Atlantic City for a job, invest in a home there, and build their skills, have no such protection. Jobs vanish, skills are suddenly irrelevant, and home values plummet.They're stuck with the mess.Bankruptcy was designed so people could start over. But these days, the only ones starting over are big corporations, wealthy moguls, and Wall Street.Corporations are even using bankruptcy to break contracts with their employees. When American Airlines went into bankruptcy three years ago, it voided its labor agreements and froze its employee pension plan.After it emerged from bankruptcy last year and merged with U.S. Airways, America's creditors were fully repaid, its shareholders came out richer than they went in, and its CEO got a severance package valued at $19.9 million.But American's former employees got shafted.Wall Street doesn't worry about failure, either. As you recall, the Street almost went belly up six years ago after risking hundreds of billions of dollars on bad bets.A generous bailout from the federal government kept the bankers afloat. And since then, most of the denizens of the Street have come out just fine.Yet more than 4 million American families have so far have lost their homes. They were caught in the downdraft of the Street's gambling excesses.They had no idea the housing bubble would burst, and didn't read the fine print in the mortgages the bankers sold them.But they weren't allowed to declare bankruptcy and try to keep their homes. When some members of Congress tried to amend the law to allow homeowners to use bankruptcy, the financial industry blocked the bill.There's no starting over for millions of people laden with student debt, either.Student loan debt has more than doubled since 2006, from $509 billion to $1.3 trillion. It now accounts for 40 percent of all personal debt -- more than credit card debts and auto loans.But the bankruptcy law doesn't cover student debts. The student loan industry made sure of that.If former students can't meet their payments, lenders can garnish their paychecks. (Some borrowers, still behind by the time they retire, have even found chunks taken out of their Social Security checks.)The only way borrowers can reduce their student debt burdens is to prove in a separate lawsuit that repayment would impose an ""undue hardship"" on them and their dependents.This is a stricter standard than bankruptcy courts apply to gamblers trying to reduce their gambling debts.You might say those who can't repay their student debts shouldn't have borrowed in the first place. But they had no way of knowing just how bad the jobs market would become. Some didn't know the diplomas they received from for-profit colleges weren't worth the paper they were written on.A better alternative would be to allow former students to use bankruptcy where the terms of the loans are clearly unreasonable (including double-digit interest rates, for example), or the loans were made to attend schools whose graduates have very low rates of employment after graduation.Economies are risky. Some industries rise and others implode, like housing. Some places get richer, and others drop, like Atlantic City. Some people get new jobs that pay better, many lose their jobs or their wages.The basic question is who should bear these risks. As long as the laws shield large investors while putting the risks on ordinary people, investors will continue to make big bets that deliver jackpots when they win but create losses for everyone else.Average working people need more fresh starts. Big corporations, banks, and Donald Trump need fewer. ROBERT B. REICH's film ""Inequality for All"" is now available on DVD and blu-ray, and on Netflix. Watch the trailer below:"

It was exhilarating to be part of this historic event. I will never forget the moment I turned the corner at Columbus Circle and saw a sea of people stretching for miles in each direction. More than 310,000 of us came together in the streets of New York City to raise our voices and demand world leaders act on climate.   Marching with NRDC colleagues and membersThe energy of the crowd was electric and the mood upbeat and friendly. People sang, chanted and played instruments. They cheered with their young children, and they applauded each other's signs and banners. They struck up conversations with strangers, because everyone knew we had something in common: a commitment to fight climate change. That commitment is a powerful unifying force. I marched beside my husband, my daughters and many of my NRDC friends and colleagues. We were joined by people of all ages, races, and communities. Marchers came from Newark, New Orleans, Nebraska, and beyond. I spoke to a group of Canadians who had driven all through the night just to be a part of the event. Others flew from Turkey, India, and South Africa. I have long understood that climate change is not only an environmental issue--it is a humanitarian, economic, health, and justice issue as well. Today's march reflected all those concerns. There were Harlem community leaders who know urban neighborhoods pay a steep for dirty energy. There were nurses who remember when Superstorm Sandy closed down Bellevue Hospital and left nearby low-income communities without adequate health care. There were United Auto Workers members who believe climate justice equals labor justice. And there were representatives from the New York City Council, the Iroquois Confederacy, the Cowboy and Indian Alliance, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Climate Change Initiative, and thousands of other groups. At 12:58, we observed two minutes of silence in honor of those most impacted by climate change. Then the crowd erupted--calling out, ringing bells, cranking noise makers--to raise the alarm for climate action. It was extraordinary to hear the sound of hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life joining together in one voice. Our voices will still be echoing when world leaders arrive in New York on Tuesday for the United Nations Climate Summit. The international community knows how to tackle the climate crisis. We have the clean energy resources and the smart policies to do the job. What we need now is political will. The People's March on Climate demonstrated the groundswell of support for bold action. I am so proud I could be a part of this momentous day. Like many others, I walked with my children because I want them to inherit a world without climate chaos. To create a more sustainable future, we must act today. This is our moment.This post is part of a month-long series produced by The Huffington Post in conjunction with a variety of events being held in September recognizing the threats posed by climate change. Those events include the UN's Climate Summit 2014 (to be held Sept. 23, 2014, at UN headquarters in New York) and Climate Week NYC (Sept. 22-28, 2014, throughout New York City).

All of them had been accused of criminal misconduct or wrongdoing stemming from inmate deaths at four different prisons, the report said.Reuters could not immediately verify the report as representatives for the department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Florida's prison system came under increasing scrutiny after the circumstances of the 2012 death of mentally ill prisoner Darren Rainey came to light.In June, the American Civil Liberties Union penned a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder calling for a federal investigation into Rainey's death, saying that the state had attempted to ""cover it up.""The letter said that Rainey was blasted with scalding hot water in a locked closet-sized shower as a punishment at the state's Dade Correctional Institution in Miami.After two hours, Rainey was found dead with his skin separated from his body, the letter stated. The water temperature was later measured at 180 degrees (82 Celsius), according to court records.""These revelations that are coming out are not about incompetence.

I must admit, the sudden passing of this truly wonderful woman personally saddened me. At the age of 81, her work schedule was more demanding than that of people half her age. In fact the night before she went into cardiac and respiratory arrest following a vocal cord procedure at Yorkville Endoscopy, Joan was working on stage in New York. Then came the unthinkable announcement that this active, vibrant woman was on life support. This tragedy serves as a startling reminder of our own frailty and brings to mind an important question: Do you have end-of-life care issues in order?Joan Rivers' recent medical condition required her daughter, Melissa Rivers, to make perhaps the most difficult decision of her life. Joan had previously given Melissa a power of attorney, authorizing her to make medical decisions if and when a time came that Joan could not convey her wishes herself. Melissa took Joan off of life support.   Several years back I was faced with the same sad task of making a life-ending decision. I was engaged at the time, and my fiancé developed a brain tumor. At the time he had been misdiagnosed with Bells Palsy, and unfortunately, by the time we found out that he had a hidden brain tumor, it was already too late. All the radiation and chemo could not help him in the end. He lay in a medical bed for a year without speaking, with the only thing keeping him alive being machines and an IV - not the way he would have wanted to live. I will never forget the guilt that weighed on me as I made the decision to let him go, and I am still haunted by it often. My thoughts are with Melissa.   Prior to my fiancé's passing, I did all the necessary paperwork with an attorney, which constituted the following:  A living will. This tells your doctor how you want to be treated if you are dying or unconscious and cannot make decisions about emergency treatment. You can stipulate which procedures you would want, which ones you don't, and under which conditions each of your choices applies.   A durable power of attorney for health care. This legal document names a health care proxy, which is someone, such as a family member, that you give the authority to make medical decisions for you when you are not able to do so.   A DNR or ""do not resuscitate"" order. This document tells the medical staff in a hospital or nursing facility that you do not want them to try to return your heart to a normal rhythm if it stops or is beating unevenly. You can also execute a non-hospital DNR to keep ambulance personnel from resuscitating you. There are similar forms for CPR and also a DNI (on not intubate) order if you do not want to be put on a breathing machine.   Relieving them of any doubt about your wishes, settling your end-of-life care issues is the best gift you can give to your loved ones.Follow Irene on Facebook, Twitter, & IOnTheScene!"

A Kurdish politician from Turkey said local people had told him the militants were beheading people as they went from village to village.Islamic State has declared a ""caliphate"" in the territories they control and have killed or driven out large numbers of Christians, Shi'ite Muslims and others who do not subscribe to their hardline version of Sunni Islam.Asked specifically about Islamic State last month when returning from a trip to South Korea, Francis endorsed action by the international community to stop ""unjust aggression."" ""PRECIOUS GIFT""In Tirana, Francis lauded the mutual respect and trust between Muslims, Catholics and Orthodox Christians in Albania as a ""precious gift"" and a powerful symbol in today's world.""This is especially the case in these times where an authentic religious spirit is being perverted by extremist groups and where religious differences are being distorted and instrumentalised,"" said Francis.The pope said a Mass before some 250,000 people in a square in central Tirana named after the late Mother Teresa of Calcutta, an ethnic Albanian who is a national heroine.Both the Vatican and Albanian officials dismissed media reports of concern for the pope's safety. Security appeared normal for a papal trip overseas and in some places lighter than in some previous trips.Some 60 percent of all Albanians are Muslim, while Roman Catholics account for just 10 percent of the population.The pope returned to the theme of tolerance during a meeting with leaders of other religions, telling them that ""all those forms which present a distorted use of religion must be firmly refuted as false ...""Earlier, aboard the plane taking him on the short trip across the Adriatic from Rome to Tirana, Francis said he wanted to visit Albania because it had ""suffered very, very much."" He is the first pope to visit Albania in 21 years.The late communist dictator Envier Hoxha banned religion in 1967, driving Albania's Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim faithful alike underground in his drive to create what he boasted was the world's first atheist state.Nearly 2,000 churches, Orthodox and Catholic, were destroyed under Hoxha, whose paranoid rule lasted four decades until his death in 1985. Many were turned into cinemas or dancing halls.More than 100 Catholic priests or bishops were executed or died under torture or in labor camps. Just 30 survived in what Francis referred to in his address as ""a winter of isolation and persecution.""At a vespers service on Sunday night in Tirana's cathedral, the pope wiped a tear from his eye when an 84-year-old priest, Ernest Troshani, described how he had spent nearly 30 years in prison or forced labor in mines, during which he was told by his captors that he was up next for execution as an enemy of the state.The pope was so moved that he kissed the man's hand, put aside his prepared address, and delivered an impromptu sermon.

In comments intended mainly for leaders from the former South Yemen who have been living in exile since 1994 after they failed to break away from the North, Yemeni President Abdrabuh Mansur Hadi said that he is ready for dialogue with militants of Al-Qaeda, but only if they give up their weapons and show repentance. AFP PHOTO/MOHAMMED HUWAIS (Photo credit should read MOHAMMED HUWAIS/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13d9f2400005500e4789a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - Yemen's prime minister submitted his resignation to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi on Sunday amid chaos over reported advances by Shi'ite Muslim Houthi rebels on some military buildings and government offices in the capital.The move by Mohammed Salem Basindwa added to the confusion in Sanaa, where Houthi rebels were due to sign a deal, brokered by U.N. special envoy Jamal Benomar, intended to end the fighting and pave the way for a new government within two weeks.Sanaa residents said the Houthis had taken over several government sites including the prime minister's buildings, an army command center and the state television compound after security forces withdrew - although TV broadcasts continued.The fighting in Sanaa threatens a U.N.-backed transition to democracy that began after veteran President Ali Abdullah Saleh was forced to step down in 2012 after months of protests against his 30 years in office.""I have decided to tender my resignation from the government (of national reconciliation) out of my concern to pave the way for any agreement reached between the brother leaders of Ansarullah (the Houthis) and brother Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the president of the republic,"" Basindwa wrote in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.There was no immediate word from Hadi's office about the resignation. Basindwa took office as head of a national unity government in 2011 under a Gulf-brokered power transfer deal that saw Saleh agree to step down.The Houthis, who stayed out of Basindwa's government, have pressed for a new administration. Last month, they began a wave of demonstrations in Sanaa to protest against a raise in fuel prices, a move that had been taken to curb the rising budget deficit. The protests later escalated into armed clashes.ADVANCEYemeni officials estimate that more than 100 people have died in the fighting, which has largely been concentrated in northern Sanaa near the headquarters of the First Armoured Division, a force loyal to an army general viewed by the Houthis as linked to hardline Sunni Islamists hostile to them.One resident in the area said on Sunday he had counted at least 10 bodies -- six Houthi fighters and four uniformed soldiers -- killed in the fighting.Benomar, who held talks with Houthi leader Abdulmalek al-Houthi in his home province of Saada on Wednesday and Thursday, announced late on Saturday that an agreement had been reached and was to be signed on Sunday.The accord calls for the creation of a new national unity government which will bring in the Houthis and mostly reverse the unpopular decision to increase fuel prices.Yemeni officials said Houthi's representatives flew to Sanaa to sign the deal at a ceremony expected to be attended by Hadi, who continues to support the deal despite the latest fighting.The picture appeared murky but residents said Houthis gained control of some vacant government buildings, including the prime minister's building and a building belonging to the army general command after security forces vacated them.The Interior Ministry's website said the minister has instructed security forces to avoid clashing with the Houthis.One Houthi rebel leader told Reuters late on Saturday his group had stepped up shelling of government forces and had driven soldiers out of the state television headquarters.""We controlled a military unit east of the First Armoured Division .... and we continued heavy shelling of the division headquarters and the nearby Iman university in all directions,"" Ali al-Emad said.CURFEWStudents and security guards at the university run by Abdel-Majeed al-Zindani, a prominent cleric who is on a U.S. terrorism blacklist, were later forced to quit the campus due to the Houthi attacks, a university official told Reuters on Sunday.Fighting raged throughout Saturday on the outskirts of Sanaa and the rebels said they had taken control of the headquarters of state television, though broadcasting continued from a different location.Yemen's Higher Security Committee announced a curfew in four areas of the capital from 9 p.m. until 6 a.m. and schools have been shut until further notice.Insecurity and political turmoil have grown since Saleh was ousted by Arab Spring protests. The Houthi insurrection is only one of several threats to the stability of Yemen, which borders oil exporter Saudi Arabia and is struggling with a secessionist movement in the south and a spreading al Qaeda insurgency.The Houthis have been struggling for a decade against the Sunni-dominated government for more territory and autonomy in the north.(Reporting By Mohammed Ghobari; Writing Sami Aboudi and Maha El Dahan,; Editing by William Maclean and Dominic Evans)"

Almost Home is set specifically during the Vietnam War and sets up a dichotomy between the kid who has returned from 'Nam in pain and needing somehow to talk and his father, a tight-lipped veteran of World War II who has never talked about what he went through. How's that going for him? Not so good. Dad Harry (Joe Lisi) can't get through the day without drinking, might have hit his wife and is addicted to gambling and up to his neck in debt to a crooked cop called Nick Pappas (James McCaffrey). Well, that's not going to happen to Johnny (Jonny Orsini), not if his mom (the great Karen Ziemba) has anything to say about it. She wants Johnny to go to college almost as much as his inspiring school teacher Luisa Jones (Brenda Pressley). Johnny's going to go to college and Harry is going to stop drinking (if only for a day or two) and start opening up. Their lives depend on it. (copyright: Carol Rosegg)That's the heart of Almost Home, a first play by Vietnam veteran Walter Anderson (who was also editor of Parade magazine for many years). This personal drama plays tug of war with the play's other, hard to swallow plot. That cop Nick has his own plans for Johnny, namely a spot on the police force. Why? Well, new Mayor John Lindsay plans to clean up the police, starting with a new chief of police. Nick's plan is to get Johnny into the police academy, have him sail through, get placed into Internal Affairs AND somehow be put in charge of overseeing Nick's area so that Johnny can protect Nick and his fellow bums from corruption probes.That's almost as unlikely as Johnny's sullen father sharing his feelings, but you know before the show's over that we're going to hear sad stories about the horrors of war from both men. Unfortunately, Anderson's play is so blunt in laying all of this out that the actors can do little more than mouth their lines. No subtlety, no hint that these are real people with real problems ever comes through despite the talent present onstage. Director Michael Parva can't really bring the story to life and the other tech elements follow suit: dutiful, fine but uninspired. Perhaps Pressley and McCaffrey come off best with their smaller turns, but that has much to do with them having less wooden dialogue to deliver. Lisi, Ziemba and Orsini do their level best. But good intentions and authentic details are no substitute for inspiration and originality. It is cruel to say we've seen it all before and dismiss someone's attempt to make sense of it all via drama. But all's fair in love and war, which is another way of saying nothing is fair.ROCOCO ROUGE ** out of **** COMPANY XIV (across from The Public)Ah, burlesque. This art form has slowly moved its way into the mainstream in America, though it's never quite held the sway that it has in Europe. Raunchy, naughty fun certainly isn't the issue. Vaudeville -- a distinct but related bit of silliness -- has its share of ribaldry. And across the street from this new venue XIV is Bridget Everett currently receiving raves for her out-there night of cabaret called Rock Bottom.So what to make of Rococo Rouge, the new offering from Company XIV, which makes much of its hedonistic namesake Louis XIV by mixing in snatches of opera amidst its pop songs and circus-like turns? Downtown spaces like The Slipper Room and The Box have hosted far more envelope-pushing nights of burlesque. Acts like La Soiree have featured far more elaborate shows in bigger spaces. And the polished professionalism of Moulin Rouge (echoed in its way by the squeaky clean Rockettes) is family friendly fare with top-notch talent.Rococo Rouge is not quite any of these. It's in an intimate space which is not lavish enough to call upscale and not trashy enough to make you feel edgy. The humor and stunts on display wouldn't offend your grandmother. But it's not up to the precision heights of Moulin Rouge's guys and gals either. Nor are the stunts of the Cirque Du Soleil quality either. The result is neither fish nor fowl and something seemingly designed for an audience that doesn't quite exist.  (Photo by Phillip Van Nostrand)Austin McCormick conceived, choreographed and directed this show, which launches the new bar and performing space for Company XIV. Perhaps the freedom of their own venue will allow him to experiment and become bolder in the future. Here, the tight confines of the stage don't allow much room and the limitations have not inspired him to innovation. The gender switch for a selection from Carmen makes little sense and few other dances even stick in the mind from one moment to the next, despite the game efforts of the folk onstage. Ditto the costumes which as with so much here are neither lavish nor tawdry enough to catch the eye. The saving grace are the singers. Shelly Watson is the host and though her dialogue is tired and obvious, she does her best to whoop it up and delivers when asked to belt it out. It's a shame she and Brett Umlauf aren't allowed to sing their bits of opera without a microphone. The space is so tiny that surely projecting wouldn't be an issue and their vocals would be that more impressive. Best of all was Katrina Cunningham's pop turns on Daughter's ""Youth"" and the Britney Spears tune ""Toxic."" Cunningham's voice is distinctive and her covers solid. There's a lot of show to wade through to get to them but they're enjoyable nonetheless. The low point is a tie. The very tired trotting out of ""Is That All There Is?"" as a finale no less -- which handsome dancer Davon Rainey can't rescue despite lip syncing while Watson sings -- is about as interesting as hearing ""Royals"" given the tiniest of spins. But that couldn't quite top the sight of a pole bar being set up at the lip of the stage and then sitting there while a crew member slid up and down to clean it off. Not even in the skeeziest strip clubs of my youth did I ever see them wipe down the stripper pole. If the performer using it is that germophobic, surely they should just do something else. At the very most, it could be cleaned backstage and then put in place by someone wearing gloves. Having the audience sit and watch this mundane task during what was supposed to be an elegant and risque night of fun was the perfect encapsulation of Rococo Rouge's confused identity crisis.THEATER OF 2014Beautiful: The Carole King Musical *** Rodney King *** Hard Times ** 1/2 Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead ** I Could Say More * The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner ** Machinal *** Outside Mullingar *** A Man's A Man * 1/2 The Tribute Artist ** 1/2 Transport ** Prince Igor at the Met ** The Bridges Of Madison County ** 1/2 Kung Fu (at Signature) ** Stage Kiss *** Satchmo At The Waldorf ***  Antony and Cleopatra at the Public ** All The Way ** 1/2 The Open House (Will Eno at Signature) ** 1/2 Wozzeck (at Met w Deborah Voigt and Thomas Hampson and Simon O'Neill) Hand To God *** Tales From Red Vienna ** Appropriate (at Signature) * Rocky * 1/2 Aladdin *** Mothers And Sons ** Les Miserables *** 1/2 Breathing Time * 1/2 Cirque Du Soleil's Amaluna * 1/2 Heathers The Musical * 1/2 Red Velvet, at St. Ann's Warehouse *** Broadway By The Year 1940-1964 *** 1/2 A Second Chance ** Guys And Dolls *** 1/2 If/Then * 1/2 The Threepenny Opera * 1/2 A Raisin In The Sun *** 1/2 The Heir Apparent *** 1/2 The Realistic Joneses *** Lady Day At Emerson's Bar & Grill *** The Library ** South Pacific ** 1/2 Violet *** Bullets Over Broadway ** Of Mice And Men ** The World Is Round *** Your Mother's Copy Of The Kama Sutra ** Hedwig and the Angry Inch *** The Cripple Of Inishmaan *** The Great Immensity * 1/2 Casa Valentina ** 1/2 Act One ** Inventing Mary Martin ** Cabaret *** An Octoroon *** 1/2 Forbidden Broadway Comes Out Swinging *** Here Lies Love *** 1/2 6th Annual August Wilson Monologue Competition Sea Marks * 1/2 A Time-Traveler's Trip To Niagara * 1/2 Selected Shorts: Neil Gaiman *** Too Much Sun * 1/2 Broadway By The Year 1965-1989 *** In The Park ** The Essential Straight & Narrow ** 1/2 Much Ado About Nothing *** When We Were Young And Unafraid Savion Glover's Om ** Broadway By The Year 1990-2014 *** The Lion *** Holler If Ya Hear Me * 1/2 The Ambassador Revue ** 1/2 Dubliners: A Quartet *** The National High School Musical Theater Awards *** 1/2 Wayra -- Fuerza Bruta * 1/2 Strictly Dishonorable *** 1/2 out of **** Between Riverside And Crazy *** The Wayside Motor Inn *** Bootycandy *** Mighty Real *** This Is Our Youth *** Rock Bottom * 1/2 Almost Home * 1/2 Rococo Rouge **_____________ Thanks for reading.

What he didn't know, he told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview on Friday, is how difficult it would be to work with her. Avati told The Hollywood Reporter that he was thrilled that Stone agreed to act in the low-budget project, until Stone's reps reportedly reached out with a lengthy list of demands. ""It was a negotiation that bordered on ridiculousness, concerning embarrassing details, as if Italy was a third world country. By the way, we do have electricity in Italy,” he said. The director claimed Stone's antics didn't end there, either. According to Avati, when Stone saw a television crew and photographers filming a scene, she allegedly left the set unannounced. ""Then my brother [Antonio Avati] received a phone call from Los Angeles from her manager. She wouldn’t come back on the set until the photographers and especially that damned TV cameramen had gone away. Obviously we did so and she, like nothing happened, shot the scene. The thing that I found most absurd is that she had to call to the States and to close herself in a car, instead of coming to ask us directly,” Avati said. ""None of this is true,"" a representative for Stone told HuffPost Entertainment in an email. ""Ms. Stone is the consummate professional.""This isn't the first time someone has alluded to Stone being difficult to work with. In a scathing 2010 piece for Deadline.com, Nikki Finke, the site's former editor-in-chief, slammed the actress for her on-set behavior.For more on Avati's complaints about Stone, read the full interview with The Hollywood Reporter.
