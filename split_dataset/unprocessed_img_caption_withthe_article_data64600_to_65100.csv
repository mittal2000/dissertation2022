0,COLLEGE,These Startups Want To Create College Media Powerhouses,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/college-media-startups_us_56c1f088e4b0c3c55051eb2b,"Several new websites are challenging  ""dinosaurs"" at campus newspapers, as they overhaul reporting on campus.",2016-02-16,"Jack Rivlin, co-founder of The Tab, at left, stands in their Brooklyn office below pennants representing the campuses where they have writers. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c28d0a1900002a00377bdd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A goalie chugging a beer at a hockey game would not be the top story for a traditional college newspaper, but a website like The Tab knows Internet gold when they see it.The Tab's editor at the University of Virginia obtained a copy of a four-second video of the hockey team's goalie having a beer on ice and posted it to the website's Facebook page. It soon went viral, and sports blogs and major news outlets picked it up. Major outlets like The New York Times, AdWeek and Britain's Daily Mail joined local papers in citing reports by The Tab's writers from other campuses -- including one about a Dartmouth College protest and an interview with the person who made a fake ""White Student Union."" And there are plenty of personal essays on The Tab vying to be the next viral ""dad bod"" column, that appeared in March 2015 in the Odyssey, a similar startup that college writers populated. (The Tab currently has declarations like ""The rise of the dad hat"" and ""Let’s stop calling it 'the walk of shame.'"") This is the new college media world: a trend of quickly growing startups, fueled by investors and seed money, running entirely on content that college students and fans of the provocative create.In the past couple of years, websites like The Tab, the Odyssey, Spoon University and FlockU began to create a foothold in collegiate life and culture, just as student newspapers have scaled back. A small, central staff of professionals runs each outlet, while students write all of the articles. Some sites pay and some don't. But each say they can offer a more unfiltered view of collegiate life and a larger platform for writers, with potential connections to professional media outlets. FlockU president Zanny Oltman said that existing publications were highly filtered. ""The idea behind creating FlockU was to fill a void in the media space for college students,"" she told The Huffington Post. ""We consider ourselves a destination where students can come and really discuss their lives in an unfiltered way."" The Tab's style of reporting is different from most college newspapers; they're like a campus version of Vice Media, a bit more edgy and often written in the first person, mixing opinion with local news and reporters' experiences. ""In the college media landscape, there are a lot of dinosaurs, there's a lot of people who still focus on the print paper, they're way too into styles which are now out of date, and they're a bit elitist,"" The Tab editor-in-chief and co-founder Jack Rivlin told HuffPost.As of February, The Tab had raised $4 million and reached 45 American campuses, 46 British universities and one Canadian school. FlockU rolled out a relaunch last week after spending most of the fall semester touring campuses to recruit students. The Odyssey collected about $3 million in funding last year, while Spoon U raised $2.7 million in summer 2015, both to continue fueling expansions.Only a few years ago, the consensus was that students preferred printed papers over their campus newspaper's website -- even as daily newspaper circulation nationwide declined significantly. That calculous changed for college newspapers largely due to the growth of smartphones, which made social media available at all times, and allowed for the rise for new platforms like Snapchat and Yik Yak. By 2014, even elite student papers like the Columbia Daily Spectator announced they were cutting back their print publication. Smaller papers cut printed editions altogether.These startups won't replace traditional campus newspapers, said Gary Kayye, who teaches at the University of North Carolina journalism school, but that doesn't mean they won't have an impact.""It'd be short-sighted and downright naive to think that these types of publications won't have any effect,"" he told HuffPost. ""The plethora of campus newspapers that are owned by campuses need to seriously join the digital age and certainly the mobile age.""With everyone jockeying for attention in the same space -- social media -- it has offered an opening for outsiders like FlockU or The Tab. Rivlin and George Marangos-Gilks started The Tab as students at Britain's Cambridge University in 2009, trying to cover more of student life than the campus newspapers, which often focused on national and global issues. Rivlin spent a brief time working as a professional reporter in London after leaving Cambridge, before he and Marangos-Gilks, who handles the business side, raised enough money from investors in the U.K. to work on outlet full-time. In 2015, The Tab began working on an American expansion. A handful of its editors came over from England, but the rest of the couple dozen staff members in the Williamsburg, Brooklyn, office are recent graduates from the United States.The Tab's writers on campus are not paid for their work, but Rivlin said they're provided with analytics, editing and guidance on story ideas. They are experimenting with cash bonuses if students' stories do well to ""share in the benefits of our growth,"" he added. ""Fundamentally, this is a talent network of reporters,"" Rivlin said. ""It's a newsroom that's distributed across two countries -- hopefully plenty more countries -- and we are constantly thinking of ways to help our existing reporters and editors publish more, but also to help people who wouldn't write, who wouldn't login to WordPress to write a whole story, but who might send a photo or send a video that could be a news story.""Spoon University doesn't pay either, but Mackenzie Barth, its CEO and co-founder, said writers get more out of training and exposure.""We're very adamant about trying to build value for these students other than money,"" she told HuffPost. ""I think once you introduce money, the incentive changes and we've held that idea pretty strongly over the last couple of years.""Spoon U started similar to The Tab -- Barth and Sarah Adler co-founded it as undergrads, originally as a print magazine about food at Northwestern University. After amassing a staff on campus of more than 100, and receiving interest from students at five other universities to start their own versions, Adler and Barth felt like they should try to continue building Spoon as a website post-graduation. They worked out of an apartment for a few months until they got accepted into Techstars in 2015, which offered them a bootcamp in running a startup and introduced them to potential investors. Now with a Manhattan office and hiring budget for the professional staff, Barth said Spoon is on track to add as many as 60 new campus chapters by April, on top of the 110 existing ones. They're considering expanding outside of food to write about similar topics like health and travel, and are focusing on adding more video content. It's not about churning out an unlimited number of articles, Barth said, because Spoon works from the idea that ""quality is so much more important than quantity."" The Philadelphia-based FlockU pays $50 per article through Venmo to each of its 300 student writers, or ""Flockers."" The Odyssey, based in Indianapolis and New York, pays a small amount to its campus editors. FlockU isn't raising money right now, but it has a revenue model based on marketing partnerships, and Oltman said they're being ""very selective"" about brands they work with. Caroline Weller, the site's managing editor, said they want to make the website feel like a ""members only club for college students,"" more akin to Reddit than a newspaper.""I'm for it, with caution,"" said University of Southern California journalism professor Robert Hernandez, in reference to whether students should write for these sites. Hernandez said that he worries about students being exploited for unpaid content, but ""sometimes you do the ones that don't pay and the trade-off is it's great for exposure.""Another bonus, outlets like The Tab can offer, are that they are financially independent and can't be bullied by university PR offices -- there are no faculty advisers that administrators can pressure. ""We represent students,"" Rivlin declared. ""I have no interest in doing institutions or authorities any favors. I'm happy to have a cordial relationship, but if they do something wrong, we want to be the first to report it.""______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter that covers higher education and millennials.

1,COLLEGE,Purdue University Staffer Quits Amid Furor Over Rape Threat Claim,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/purdue-rape-threats_us_56c24d2de4b08ffac1263087,The employee said an anti-abortion group fabricated the threats and the university took sides against him.,2016-02-16,"10. Johns Hopkins University - Baltimore, Maryland (Tie)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f090a21700009a01569c62.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"A Purdue University staff member abruptly quit Monday amid a controversy over rape threats he was accused of making on social media. Jamie Newman, a part-time accompanist in Purdue's Division of Dance, blasted the school for seeking his apology without attempting to talk to him first about the threats, which he denies making, according to his statement to the university, obtained by the Lafayette Journal & Courier. Newman said allegations he threatened to rape anyone were a ""complete fabrication, for which not one iota of evidence exists."" A university police investigation into the online threats found insufficient evidence to take action. Purdue, however, on Friday accused Newman of making an ""outrageous and vulgar"" statement and demanded an apology. A university spokeswoman on Monday confirmed Newman's resignation and told The Huffington Post via email and said the school ""believes this is the appropriate outcome."" Newman didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The controversy erupted more than two weeks ago, when the anti-abortion group Purdue Students For Life placed fliers around the Purdue Black Cultural Center at the start of Black History Month with slogans like “Hands Up, Don’t Abort” and “Womb = most dangerous place for black kids.”The group apologized, but Newman nevertheless excoriated the group on social media.""You folks are vile, racist idiots, who richly deserve all the opprobrium that will be heaped on you as a result of this unbelievably thoughtless, stupid escapade,"" Newman wrote on Feb. 3. Heated social media exchanges drew the attention of the conservative college site Campus Reform and quickly went viral on conservative and anti-abortion websites.Some of those sites also published screenshots of posts showing threats made by a user purporting to be Newman. The screenshots show someone called ""jamiegnewman"" wondering if another commenter would be in favor of abortion if a female relative was raped.A follow-up post read: “Oh, I’m sorry. So, let me make my intentions quite explicit: I did in fact offer to rape Tom’s wife/daughter/great grandmother. Free of charge, even. I’m generous that way.”The comments were purportedly made on the site LiveActionNews.org, run by the anti-abortion group behind the heavily-edited Planned Parenthood sting videos. In his statement to the university, Newman said the comments were ""an attempt to punish and discredit me -- indeed, to destroy me"" mounted by anti-abortion groups. Students interviewed by local media expressed disbelief that Newman would make such comments. The university, in West Lafayette, Indiana, was less forgiving, calling the comments ""obnoxious rhetoric"" that embarrassed the school.Purdue said in a statement Friday that its free-speech policy protected Newman from being fired. ""It’s fortunate for Mr. Newman that he works at a public university both obligated under the First Amendment and committed by principle to protect free speech -- even speech as abhorrent as his,"" the statement said. ""Had he uttered such an outrageous and vulgar statement while working for a private college or other private employer, he would almost certainly have been fired on the spot.""Also on HuffPost:"
2,POLITICS,Why Obama Should Nominate Barack Obama For The Supreme Court Vacancy,Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-should-nominate-himself-supreme-court_us_56c35b6ee4b0b40245c80061,The solution to this political problem is staring at him in the mirror.,2016-02-16,President Barack Obama could just nominate himself to the Supreme Court vacancy left by the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c366cd1900002a00377cad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans have insisted that no matter who President Barack Obama nominates for the Supreme Court, there will be no hearings, no votes, no nothing. But there may be one potential candidate that Republicans would have a hard time blocking: Obama could appoint constitutional law professor Barack Obama. There's roughly a zero percent chance this'll happen, but here's why it makes sense: Appointing Obama would put the GOP in the position they've desperately wanted to be in since the man was inaugurated. They'd have the chance to vote him out of office. If he's truly as dangerous and illegitimate a president as Republicans say, then this is their opportunity to get him out of the White House by putting him on the court.The move would also give Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell a chance to virtually guarantee that he remains Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (McConnell would have to persuade his colleagues not to filibuster.) Some of the most vulnerable Republicans would have their 2016 chances boosted by voting to confirm Obama. Sens. Pat Toomey (Pa.), Rob Portman (Ohio), Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) and Ron Johnson (Wis.) would be assured re-election if they could peel off a small portion of Democratic voters grateful for the bipartisan move. With those four alone, Democrats would have 50 votes, a tie that could be broken by Vice President Joe Biden -- who would be all too pleased to cast the deciding vote to make himself president, even if he'd become one of the shortest-serving presidents in history. And Biden, of course, would then name his longtime ally and Senate successor Ted Kaufman as vice president. If Biden happened to meet the same sudden fate as Antonin Scalia did, Kaufman could quickly go about the business of breaking up the banks.White House aide Eric Schultz, asked if Obama had considered nominating Obama, noted that the president ""has said he's not interested in being a Supreme Court justice,"" citing a New Yorker article by Jeffrey Toobin and a recent interview on Ellen. Sure, Obama may have said that, but what if the president himself called on him to serve? Wouldn't that change his thinking?""The press corps is officially unhinged,"" Schultz suggested.UPDATE: White House spokesman Josh Earnest, asked at a Wednesday press briefing about Obama nominating Obama, did not rule it out. ""I haven't asked him that direct question, but I think all of the available evidence indicates that that option is highly unlikely,"" he said.

In his latest weekly column, Piketty wrote that the Vermont senator's campaign represents a turning point in the country. ""[W]e are witnessing the end of the politico-ideological cycle opened by the victory of Ronald Reagan at the 1980 elections,"" he wrote in a piece that appeared in French in Le Monde earlier this week and in English in the Guardian on Tuesday.The French rockstar economist is the author of Capital in the Twenty-First Century, which showed that global income inequality has gotten much, much worse in the 36 years since Ronald Reagan was first elected. Piketty's life's work is about showing how low tax rates on the rich, particularly in the United States, exacerbate inequality for those of us below the top 1 percent, or even 0.1 percent, of earners.In that sense, Piketty has a bone to pick with the U.S. government, and anyone who represents its economic policy over the last three decades. It is through this lens that Piketty looks at the current presidential race and sees Sanders as the hope for ""a new political cycle"":Sanders makes clear he wants to restore progressive taxation and a higher minimum wage ($15 an hour). To this he adds free healthcare and higher education in a country where inequality in access to education has reached unprecedented heights, highlighting a gulf standing between the lives of most Americans, and the soothing meritocratic speeches pronounced by the winners of the system. Piketty dislikes the Republicans as a group: The ""party sinks into a hyper-nationalist, anti-immigrant and anti-Islam discourse ... and a limitless glorification of the fortune amassed by rich white people,"" he wrote.But he has almost as much disdain for Clinton based on her connections to the establishment, since even under Democratic presidents (Bill) Clinton and Barack Obama, Reagan's low tax rates continued.""Hillary Clinton, who fought to the left of Barack Obama in 2008 on topics such as health insurance, appears today as if she is defending the status quo, just another heiress of the Reagan-Clinton-Obama political regime,"" Piketty writes.The Clinton of 2016, for the record, may be more moderate than Sanders, but is running substantially to the left of her 2008 campaign.Head over to the Guardian to read Piketty's entire op-ed."
4,POLITICS,How A Police Body Camera Law Gets Chewed Up And Spit Out,Andy Campbell,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kansas-police-body-camera-law_us_56bca6e6e4b0b40245c57776,Body camera footage is quickly going from public to private all over the country.,2016-02-16,Los Angeles Police Officer Jim Stover demonstrates how an officer turns on the new LAPD body camera during a press conference in September 2015. Body camera laws across the country are taking footage from public to private.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c334471900002900377c4e.jpeg?cache=XKBWAdFoWA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"From the public's perspective, passing police body camera laws may seem like a cut-and-dry process: Fund the programs, tell officers they have to wear the equipment, and, in order to ensure transparency and accountability, make the footage obtained by these government employees a matter of public record.But a Kansas body camera bill went from footage being accessible to blocked from public records requests in an instant, making video of police incidents essentially useless to the people, and, in turn, the press.Kansas is not the first state to attempt to pass transparent body camera legislation only to later make footage private, but it’s quickly becoming an example of how body camera laws can be chewed up and spit out.Kansas Senate Bill 18 was introduced early last year by state Sen. David Haley (D-Kansas City) in an attempt to make officer interactions more transparent. It would obligate every state, county and municipal law enforcement officer to be equipped with a body camera while on patrol.Indeed, Haley's district skews high in fatal officer-involved shootings per capita when compared to cities around its size, and there's plenty of public interest in more accountability, according to The Kansas City Star.But within a month of SB-18's filing, the Republican-controlled Senate filed a substitute bill that turned Haley's on its head. The new bill would classify footage and audio recorded on body cameras as ""criminal investigation records"" that would be exempt from the state's open records act.In an instant, body camera footage went from public to private, only available to parties directly involved in the case. The Senate passed the substitute bill, and it goes to the House this week.Haley and local activists are floored over the substitute, which they say takes a practice in transparency and turns it into a ""travesty"" that allows publicly funded police departments to decide when footage should be released.""The original bill, which I was the sole sponsor of, became perverted by the legislative process,"" Haley told The Huffington Post. ""It is an absolute travesty.""The substitute bill also puts the onus back on civilians to record police interactions, and allows departments to release evidence when it supports an officer's case, but keep it sealed when there's wrongdoing on the officer's part, said Djuan Wash, communications director for Sunflower Community Action in Wichita.""Look, we don't even want unequivocal access to all police videos, we just want a public that has access to subpoena power, especially in cases of officer-involved shootings,"" Wash said. ""Instead, the state of Kansas is looking over a substitute bill that would continue to put a chokehold on communities of color.""""The people who are being shot and killed by officers here are African-American and Latino,"" he said. ""We're asking for a little community control and limited access to that type of footage.""This is how body camera laws are treated. HuffPost's Nick Wing has reported previously that states across America are passing laws that make body camera footage essentially useless by exempting it from public records requests. According to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 10 states passed laws last year that will limit access to these videos, and states like South Carolina and Texas have passed laws that make the footage completely exempt from public records requests.How does that happen? Lawmakers all over the country -- including those on both sides of the bill in Kansas -- have acknowledged that the police, public and politicians all want body cameras. But the extent to which the footage is accessible determines who can use its power both in and out of the courtroom.Many legislators say it's a matter of privacy, and Kansas state Sen. Greg Smith (R-Overland Park) agrees. The former cop told HuffPost that ""there are a lot of things that could come out on a video that could be problematic for people who are subjects of that video.""He cited neighbors who aren't involved in an incident, domestic violence victims and possible evidence as reasons why openly accessible video could become an issue. He worried specifically that the footage might show up on YouTube.""You can take it too far both ways -- the tough part for us is finding a balance,"" he said. ""We don’t want them used for the wrong reasons just like people on the other side of the issue don’t want it secret for the wrong reasons.""He also said that Haley's admittedly short bill was a total mess. Initially, the bill demanded that cameras be running almost all the time (an impossibility, Smith said), and gave police departments that may only have one officer a ""tremendous expense to deal with."" Haley said he'll be trying to amend the substitute bill, both to work out the kinks of his original and make body camera footage public again.But does he think he'll get his old bill back?""There's a high probability it will fail, unfortunately,"" he said."
5,QUEER VOICES,Electronic Music Duo Creates New Album Using...Their Washing Machine,Curtis M.

C. Schmidt (left) and Drew Daniel, a real-life couple who have been making experimental music for more than 20 years.

But their new album, “Ultimate Care II,” could very well be the most outlandish effort yet. The men of Matmos, Drew Daniel and M.C. (Martin) Schmidt, are a real-life couple who are best known for collaborating with Björk on 2001's ""Vespertine"" and 2004's ""Medúlla,"" as well as in live performances. For “Ultimate Care II,” which will be released Feb. 19, they've found inspiration in a household appliance -- their washing machine. Recorded in the basement of the couple's Baltimore, Maryland home, the album comprises different arrangements of sounds created by that machine, which happens to be a Whirlpool Ultimate Care II. (You can view the official video for ""Excerpt Three"" from the album above) “I think there’s something very queer about it,” Daniel told The Huffington Post in an interview. “It’s like a perverse desire to elevate something in your everyday life, [something] you’re not supposed to dignify with your attention.”As offbeat as it sounds, “Ultimate Care II” actually represents a modern take on the French tradition of Musique concrète, in which sound fragments are used as raw material for abstract recordings. The album is also in line with Matmos' previous releases like 2001's ""A Chance to Cut is a Chance to Cure,"" which sampled the sounds of liposuction surgery, rat cages and hearing aids. Using the washing machine for their latest, Schmidt said, began as sort of a personal dare amongst the men: “Could we make a compelling, complete work out of such a limited source?”Soon, however, he realized that there’s a “certain freedom in restraint,” and together with Daniel, realized that “once you can exploit any object or system around you, the world is just endlessly generous.”“It’s about the music,” he said. “It doesn’t really matter what the source is.”Don't miss the video for ""Excerpt Five,"" released in December, below. The men said they’ve found Baltimore, their adopted home of nine years, to boast an incredibly vibrant music scene even when compared to San Francisco, where they got their start. Opting for Baltimore instead of a metropolis like San Francisco or New York, they said, has inspired them to take even more chances in their art, too. “Baltimore’s poverty, racism and unemployment [are] obvious factors of life, but there’s also tremendous drive and weird creativity here. People in Baltimore have to be self-sufficient in ways that are really inspiring,” Daniel said. “There’s a strange purity of intent that comes from having no media attention. So when people do things, they do them just because they’re driven to do them.”Stay weird, wacky and wonderful, Matmos! Also on HuffPost: "

8,HEALTHY LIVING,Poorer Neighborhoods Suffer More During Flu Season,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flu-poverty-study_us_56c354a8e4b0c3c55052af78,"Flu-related hospitalization rates are two times higher in poorer neighborhoods than in wealthier ones, a new study finds.",2016-02-16,"This graph shows that as a neighborhood gets poorer, the number of flu-related hospitalizations goes up.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c388901d00002800df6123.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Flu season can be a miserable slog no matter where you stand on the socioeconomic scale, but a new report shows that the virus hits poorer neighborhoods harder than wealthier ones.The rate of flu-related hospitalization is two times higher in poorer neighborhoods than in richer ones, according to a report published last week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The researchers defined poorer neighborhoods as places where more than 20 percent of residents live below the poverty line, and wealthier ones as places where less than 5 percent of residents live in poverty. The CDC looked at 27 million people across 14 different census tracts nationwide during the flu seasons spanning from 2010 to 2012. Researchers found that flu-related hospitalization rates for severe outcomes (which include intensive care, respiratory support and death) were consistently higher in poorer neighborhoods for whites, blacks, Asians and Latinos. James Hadler, a clinical professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health who authored the analysis, said the results were ""not a total surprise"" but nonetheless important. ""People living in poor neighborhoods have a higher risk than people living in wealthy neighborhoods,"" Hadler said. He noted that while his analysis of neighborhood data ""actually correlates fairly well with individual-level socioeconomic status,"" the findings address the collective risk to the neighborhood, not individuals.But neighborhoods, he said, still have significant influence on a person's health. ""For something like influenza, the neighborhood factor could be that people are living in more crowded housing, living more than one person to a room on average, not leaving their neighborhoods much or neighborhood attitudes toward health,"" Halder said.Access to health care is also a bigger challenge in poorer neighborhoods. ""If you’re a single parent, it might not be easy to take a number of children to an emergency room to be seen, or there may not be a health center in your neighborhood,"" Hadler said. ""There might be a copayment you can’t make. Or poverty might prevent people from seeking treatment for chronic conditions like asthma,” which can make someone more susceptible to influenza-related complications. Since the CDC doesn't commonly look at socioeconomic measures as part of its influenza surveillance, Hadler's analysis adds a valuable component to the data the center collects. “It was nice to actually have data to confirm that people living in areas of high poverty experience more severe outcomes of the flu,"" said Joe Bresee, the chief of epidemiology in the CDC's influenza division.Ideally, the data will help the CDC -- and in turn, state and local health agencies -- fine-tune their approach to making flu vaccines more accessible. ""The good thing abut the flu is that we know the best way to prevent it is vaccination. It’s a tool we use, and it’s underused,"" Bresee said.Also on HuffPost:"
9,POLITICS,Kanye West Actually Made Some Pretty Good Points On Twitter For Once,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kanye-west-textbooks_us_56c381fae4b0c3c55052e436,"Yeezy's tweetstorm about the price of textbooks highlights a serious issue, and one that could be fixed.",2016-02-16,"While we don't often take Kanye West seriously on Twitter, his Tuesday tweets about textbooks actually make a lot of sense.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c399931300002b00141599.jpeg?cache=dRXR9uKjDN&ops=crop_24_310_2927_2123%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On Tuesday, rapper and prolific tweeter Kanye West shared some thoughts about the high cost of education, specifically college textbooks. Unlike some of his other tweets, West's comments were about a serious issue that major politicians have already started working on.First, here are the tweets that Kanye offered the world on Tuesday afternoon. OK, hold up, I'm going to let him finish, but let's look at this. The friend that West is referring to makes around $88,000 a year, which is a pretty decent middle-class income. We don't know if the family has other bills, or how they are paying for tuition and room and board. Still, the idea that someone who is employed and in the middle class can't afford one textbook for school with a day's work is nothing to sneeze at. Around a third of college students have to use financial aid to cover the cost of textbooks, a report released this month by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group found. Students spend around $1,200 a year on books and supplies, according to the College Board, regardless of whether they attend a community college or a private four-year university. Anyway, please continue, Yeezy.This is true. In the past 25 years, the median wage for college graduates in their 20s has barely budged, while the median debt at graduation has gone up 163 percent. The average college student in the class of 2014 left school with an average of $28,950 in debt, a recent report showed. Overall, Americans owe $1.3 trillion in student debt -- more than any other kind of consumer debt. Now, back to Kanye.Again, he's right. And legislators are considering one possible solution. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) has pushed a bill to create a grant program to help universities set up open-source textbooks. Open-source textbooks are basically books that are available under an open license, so professors, students and researchers can freely access the materials. Because these books would be online, updates could be issued whenever needed -- so not only would students have the most recent information, there would also be no need to spend hundreds on the latest edition. In other words, instead of having to buy a $200 hard copy of a book, students could access a digital copy for free on any device. If there is a cost, it would be minimal, something like $20 for extra flash cards and other study materials.The fact that Durbin is pushing the bill along with co-sponsors Sens. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Angus King (I-Maine) explains why Senate Democrats tweeted in support of West on Tuesday.Sometimes West says ridiculous things. On Sunday he tweeted, ""Ima fix wolves."" (""Wolves"" is a song he's working on. But since Ye tweeted it right after asking Mark Zuckerberg for $1 billion, it came off a bit random -- like most of the singer's messages.) So let's look at how Yeezy finished up his education tweetstorm.Alright, well, a lot of people would agree that teachers should get paid more and that books should cost less, but there isn't really a correlation there. Judging by the #2020 hashtag, maybe he's laying out the education plank of his platform for his presidential campaign in four years -- ""lower the price of textbooks,"" and ""fix wolves."" At least one of those is something members of Congress are actually addressing.______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter that covers higher education and millennials.

No, Rey's not about to battle any dark Jedi by ""twisting it,"" but the two brands have a common ancestor: Hasbro, the multibillion-dollar toy company behind so many iconic brands. Play-Doh? Yep. Mr. Potato Head and My Little Pony? Oh yeah. Nerf, Disney princess play sets and Monopoly? Check, check, check.But, if you were to walk around the company's showroom at this year's Toy Fair in Midtown Manhattan, you might notice something felt absent. In the haze of foam darts and Elsa dolls, there were few high-tech gadgets.Hasbro continues to emphasize toys over touch screens, in large part because the company wants kids and their parents to put the devices down and focus on play as a pure concept.""We're not trying to avoid technology,"" Hasbro president John Frascotti said in an interview with The Huffington Post on Monday. ""Kids have to be digitally savvy, but we're very cognizant of not wanting to raise a generation of kids that are not socially savvy.""Most of the toys Hasbro chose to showcase this year were the kind of simple pleasures you might recognize from your own childhood. The Nerf guns were more advanced, the Spider-Man figures were a bit more detailed and the Transformers have a new female friend called Victorion.But few of the toys felt distinctly 2016.Sure, there were a few iPads strewn about -- maybe to assure business partners that the kids who watch ""Transformers: Rescue Bots"" can also bug their parents for the related ""Sky Forest Rescue"" app -- but there was nothing like Nintendo's Amiibo, little plastic toys that basically exist to unlock exclusive features in video games.One of the most high-tech toys Hasbro displayed is Love 2 Learn Elmo, an upcoming plush doll that talks to kids and encourages them to develop good habits -- like using the potty, for example. Elmo connects to a parent's smartphone or tablet, which opens up a few features. It can learn a child's name if a parent inputs it, for one. It will also make announcements based on a connected game -- if you tap a hippo in a storybook scene, it tells you something about hippos. And a parent can use Elmo to log their child's behavior and encourage good habits. If your kid has a successful potty break, you can mark that down in the app and have Elmo offer praise. Positive reinforcement is supposed to help children throughout this training process, so you can see the appeal.At first glance, it might seem like Love 2 Learn Elmo creates a sort of shield between child and parent. You're not praising your kid -- a chirpy red muppet is. But Frascotti doesn't see it that way.""If a parent is going to take the time to [use the app], then that's indicative of a parent who's involved in the child's life,"" Frascotti told HuffPost.Frascotti wants Hasbro to use technology to ""augment the experience"" of play rather than being the focus. Obviously the company isn't ignoring gadgets -- it owns a majority stake in mobile game maker Backflip Studios, for example, and its Furbys have connected to apps for years -- but the aim is to keep kids focused on physical toys. That should reassure parents who worry over recent hacking scares on Internet-connected playthings.It might also help adults reconsider their own habits. After all, kids aren't the only ones who can so easily be sucked into screens for hours on end.""With children, they’re over-scheduled or perhaps overly digitally immersed,"" Frascotti said. ""For adults, [they're] connected 24/7.”"

""You make people mad when you're just doing your job.""He wondered if it was part of a wave of attacks on law enforcement officials around the country and pointed to ""everything that’s happened since the Super Bowl.""""You know, Beyonce's video,"" he clarified.

In the video, a person dances in front of police dressed in riot gear, a wall reads ""Stop shooting us"" and she sits on top of a sinking police car. In her Super Bowl halftime show, where she performed the number, she paid tribute to black empowerment and referenced the Black Panthers, Malcolm X, Michael Jackson and Black Lives Matter.

Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) says it's probably not a good idea to rule out every Supreme Court nominee that Obama puts forward.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586d6d141500009506e9e7f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee warned that his party risks looking “obstructionist” if they refuse to even consider a Supreme Court nominee from President Barack Obama.“I think we fall into the trap, if we just simply say [no], sight unseen, we fall into the trap of being obstructionist,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said in a radio interview Tuesday, first reported by ThinkProgress.So far, that’s exactly what Republicans are doing.“The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Saturday, after news broke of Justice Antonin Scalia’s death. “Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.”Republicans did not have to take this route. After all, they have a majority in the Senate and could simply block an Obama nominee on the floor in an up-or-down vote.Tillis said the GOP would be happy to consider a candidate who “has an almost identical resume and capabilities as Justice Scalia” ― a prospect that he admitted was unlikely.“If he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of President Obama’s vision of America, then we’ll use every device available to block that nomination, wait for the American people to voice their vote in November and then move forward with a nomination after the election ― and most likely with the next president,” he added.Tillis’ remarks hardly count as an endorsement for Obama filling the court vacancy, but the fact that he isn’t flat-out rejecting the idea of Senate confirmation proceedings sets him apart from other Republicans. Nearly all have lined up behind McConnell in saying Obama should hold off and let the next president fill the Supreme Court seat. That would leave the nation’s highest court with an empty seat for at least a year, an unprecedented lag time.This all may just be bluster from the GOP. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the judiciary committee, hasn’t ruled out a hearing for Obama’s forthcoming Supreme Court nominee.“I would wait until the nominee is made before I would make any decisions,” Grassley told reporters in a Tuesday morning interview. “In other words, take it a step at a time.”On the campaign trail, the GOP presidential candidates so far agree with McConnell’s approach ― obviously, they’d each like to be the next person in the White House who nominates someone to the court ― but Ben Carson conceded that if a Republican were in Obama’s shoes right now, they’d just go ahead and pick someone.Also on HuffPost:"
16,COLLEGE,Outdated Pell Rules May Discriminate Against Low-Income Students,"Meredith Kolodner, The Hechinger Report",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pell-grant-rules_us_56c34862e4b0b40245c7eb0c,Federal grants cannot be used for many post-secondary courses that lead to good jobs.,2016-02-16,"Students studying to become emergency medical technicians at Norwalk Community College can’t get their tuition covered by a Pell grant, because the course doesn’t require 600 hours of class time.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c34ac11d00002800df60b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"John Davis had been working as a shelf-stocker at his local grocery store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, for more than a decade when he realized there was no way he would be able to help his ailing mother on his salary.Her degenerative spine condition, combined with diabetes and cancer, was making it more and more difficult for her to get to her job as a paralegal.“My mother’s health is declining,” said Davis, 31, “so I knew I needed to find a way to pay the bills for her instead of her having to work.”He could have gotten a federal Pell grant to go to college, but even an associate’s degree takes two years to complete, with no guarantee of a good job waiting at the end. He had done well in science courses in high school, so a certification program at Baton Rouge Community College that would train him to be a plant inspector — a position in high demand — seemed like a good fit.The problem: Davis couldn’t use Pell money to cover the $3,500 tuition, because the certification program doesn’t require the 600 hours of class time needed to qualify for Pell.As President Obama pushes to expand Pell grant coverage for year-round classes to help students complete degrees more quickly, an unusual collection of conservative, liberal, union and business leaders is asking why short-term educational programs that lead to decent-paying jobs aren’t included in the expansion. The Manufacturing Institute recently estimated that there are as many as 600,000 middle-skilled jobs in manufacturing currently unfilled because of a lack of trained workers — with training available from short-term programs.Meanwhile, at the traditional four-year and two-year colleges that the Pell program does cover, enrollment declined and graduation rates dropped last year. It has become clear that by 2020 the majority of jobs will require a post-secondary degree, and these shorter-term education programs could prepare people for some of those jobs.Administrators at Baton Rouge Community College say Pell funding rules have created a somewhat perverse incentive. Some students enroll in two-year general studies programs — for which they can get scholarship help — rather than in unsupported programs more likely to set them on a career path.“It’s a significant problem in Baton Rouge. You have your impoverished communities, rural and urban, trying to get access to career pathways to get themselves out of the situation,” said Girard Melancon, executive director of workforce education at BRCC. “A lot of time they go into general studies because Pell covers it, but it may not be the best fit, or the best use of time.”In John Davis’ case, his younger brother scraped together the tuition money, and Davis enrolled last September in the inspector/nondestructive testing program, going to class from 7:30 a.m. until 2:30 p.m. every day, then running to his grocery job where he worked from 3 p.m. until 7 p.m., plus full days on the weekends. On February 4, he graduated from the program; on February 15, he started working at a nearby Exxon Mobil plant. His pay jumped from $10.75 an hour to about $19 an hour.“On my [old] salary, with the bills I have to pay, there would have been no way to save up for the course,” said Davis. “It’s an opportunity people should have, if they’re willing to put in the effort.”When Pell was established in 1972, it was intended to allow low-income students to go to college, which typically meant getting a bachelor’s degree. Training for ""middle-skilled"" jobs was often done in vocational high schools, at apprenticeships, through unions or simply on the job. Now employers want to hire people who are already trained, and the jobs actually require more learned skills, such as using new technologies.Yet some people caution that providing federal financial aid for such short-term vocational programs could draw low-income students away from four-year degrees, leaving higher education even further stratified.Getting through college is especially difficult for young, low-income students. While 77 percent of upper-income students earn a bachelor’s degree by the time they are 24 years old (up from 40 percent in 1970), the same is true of only 9 percent of young people from low-income families. Nationally, only 39 percent of community college students get any degree within six years of enrolling at a school.In many ways, students with certifications don’t have much stronger academic backgrounds than those who simply graduated from high school, according to a study. But on average, their wages are 20 percent higher than students with only a high school degree, and the jump is even larger for many Latinos and for African-American males.Melancon says the majority of people who show interest in his college’s certification programs are people in their 20s who never went to college. Many have small children and can’t afford it.“They can’t pay for it out of pocket and sometimes they just get lost in the shuffle,” he said.Most of the jobs that students get after they complete the plant inspector/nondestructive testing program that Davis took start at around $20 an hour, Melancon noted. By contrast, the HVAC program, which is Pell-eligible, usually results in a job paying only $15-$17 an hour. And the inspector positions are in high demand and have a career pathway that can lead to even better wages.Other education training programs that don’t qualify for Pell at most community colleges include emergency medical technician (average salary of about $35,000) and dental assistant (about $36,000).“I don’t see how we’re doing anybody any favors by encouraging them to go into four-year programs where they take remedial classes and leave with debt and regret,” said Michael Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a center-right education policy think tank.Petrilli, like the (usually) federal-funding-wary Heritage Foundation, supports extending Pell to short-term educational programs that link to in-demand jobs.The federal government is not unaware of the problems. In 2011, officials launched a pilot program allowing colleges to use Pell money for some short-term programs linked to jobs that local employers were having trouble filling. Currently more than 40 colleges are participating.""We're still gathering information based on what we're seeing in the [pilot program],” said Yuanxia Ding, a senior policy advisor in the U.S. Department of Education. “We're really thinking about student outcomes and what students need coming out of post-secondary education. Many of the goals of short-term training are also reflected in a new experiment” called EQUIP.Launched last fall, EQUIP (Educational Quality through Innovative Partnerships) allows community colleges to use Pell money for training programs administered by nontraditional groups, such as computer coding “boot camps.” But the programs it covers are required to have at least 450 hours of class time, which would still leave many training programs without aid.According to Steve Long, associate vice chancellor at St. Louis Community College, which is applying for one of the EQUIP grants, the coding “boot camps” generally cost between $3,500 and $5,000 and can lead to jobs with starting salaries of $50,000.A 2012 study found that men with certifications in computer and information services earned more than $72,000 a year — a higher salary than 54 percent of men with bachelor’s degrees earned at that time.“Pell was designed in a time when everyone was going to go to a four-year college,” said Long. “There are coding jobs available that don’t need four-year computer science degrees.”Like many community college administrators, Long believes that the simplicity of Pell funding would alleviate stress and red tape. These colleges often spend a significant amount of time scrambling to bring down the costs of the training programs by applying for local, state, federal and private grants, sometimes all at once.One easy solution might be to add the extra 100 or 200 hours that would allow the programs to qualify for Pell grants. But community college administrators say it would be unethical to pad their courses and create more work for students, just to get federal aid.""That’s why some of the for-profit schools got in trouble,"" said Long, referring to schools that have been sued or penalized for taking money from Pell-funded students for courses that, whatever the number of hours, did not teach the skills promised.Even worthy short-term programs and “boot camps,” however, raise thorny questions of whether something will be lost if they replace four-year college degrees and whether they will be disproportionately filled with low-income and first-generation students.“I’m very conscious and concerned about having upwardly mobile career pathways for low-income students,” said David Levinson, president of Norwalk Community College. “We live in a very highly stratified world, especially in higher education.”Still, while Levinson sees the dangers, he believes the tradeoffs of getting Pell eligibility for short-term programs are worth it. The key, he says, is making sure low-income students have a choice of options in practice, and not just rhetorically. He also believes the certifications should not be linked to one brand or company (for example computer coding only for Microsoft), and that certifications should be able to be stacked and lead upward.It isn’t rare to meet students who want to get a workforce certification but “can’t afford to take these classes,” said Kristina Testa-Buzzee, interim associate dean of extended studies and workforce development at Norwalk Community College. She sees programs that lead to certifications as phlebotomists or bookkeepers as both a gateway to further education and also as an “end point” if they fully meet the student’s needs.“People are asking the question, ‘Is college for everyone?’” said Testa-Buzzee. “As long as the question is being asked across the board and not just in our poorer communities, then it can really expand people’s choices.”______This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

The Manufacturing Institute recently estimated that there are as many as 600,000 middle-skilled jobs in manufacturing currently unfilled because of a lack of trained workers — with training available from short-term programs.Meanwhile, at the traditional four-year and two-year colleges that the Pell program does cover, enrollment declined and graduation rates dropped last year. It has become clear that by 2020 the majority of jobs will require a post-secondary degree, and these shorter-term education programs could prepare people for some of those jobs.Administrators at Baton Rouge Community College say Pell funding rules have created a somewhat perverse incentive. Some students enroll in two-year general studies programs — for which they can get scholarship help — rather than in unsupported programs more likely to set them on a career path.“It’s a significant problem in Baton Rouge. You have your impoverished communities, rural and urban, trying to get access to career pathways to get themselves out of the situation,” said Girard Melancon, executive director of workforce education at BRCC. “A lot of time they go into general studies because Pell covers it, but it may not be the best fit, or the best use of time.”In John Davis’ case, his younger brother scraped together the tuition money, and Davis enrolled last September in the inspector/nondestructive testing program, going to class from 7:30 a.m. until 2:30 p.m. every day, then running to his grocery job where he worked from 3 p.m. until 7 p.m., plus full days on the weekends. On February 4, he graduated from the program; on February 15, he started working at a nearby Exxon Mobil plant. His pay jumped from $10.75 an hour to about $19 an hour.“On my [old] salary, with the bills I have to pay, there would have been no way to save up for the course,” said Davis. “It’s an opportunity people should have, if they’re willing to put in the effort.”When Pell was established in 1972, it was intended to allow low-income students to go to college, which typically meant getting a bachelor’s degree. Training for ""middle-skilled"" jobs was often done in vocational high schools, at apprenticeships, through unions or simply on the job. Now employers want to hire people who are already trained, and the jobs actually require more learned skills, such as using new technologies.Yet some people caution that providing federal financial aid for such short-term vocational programs could draw low-income students away from four-year degrees, leaving higher education even further stratified.Getting through college is especially difficult for young, low-income students. While 77 percent of upper-income students earn a bachelor’s degree by the time they are 24 years old (up from 40 percent in 1970), the same is true of only 9 percent of young people from low-income families. Nationally, only 39 percent of community college students get any degree within six years of enrolling at a school.In many ways, students with certifications don’t have much stronger academic backgrounds than those who simply graduated from high school, according to a study. But on average, their wages are 20 percent higher than students with only a high school degree, and the jump is even larger for many Latinos and for African-American males.Melancon says the majority of people who show interest in his college’s certification programs are people in their 20s who never went to college. Many have small children and can’t afford it.“They can’t pay for it out of pocket and sometimes they just get lost in the shuffle,” he said.Most of the jobs that students get after they complete the plant inspector/nondestructive testing program that Davis took start at around $20 an hour, Melancon noted. By contrast, the HVAC program, which is Pell-eligible, usually results in a job paying only $15-$17 an hour. And the inspector positions are in high demand and have a career pathway that can lead to even better wages.Other education training programs that don’t qualify for Pell at most community colleges include emergency medical technician (average salary of about $35,000) and dental assistant (about $36,000).“I don’t see how we’re doing anybody any favors by encouraging them to go into four-year programs where they take remedial classes and leave with debt and regret,” said Michael Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a center-right education policy think tank.Petrilli, like the (usually) federal-funding-wary Heritage Foundation, supports extending Pell to short-term educational programs that link to in-demand jobs.The federal government is not unaware of the problems. In 2011, officials launched a pilot program allowing colleges to use Pell money for some short-term programs linked to jobs that local employers were having trouble filling. Currently more than 40 colleges are participating.""We're still gathering information based on what we're seeing in the [pilot program],” said Yuanxia Ding, a senior policy advisor in the U.S. Department of Education. “We're really thinking about student outcomes and what students need coming out of post-secondary education. Many of the goals of short-term training are also reflected in a new experiment” called EQUIP.Launched last fall, EQUIP (Educational Quality through Innovative Partnerships) allows community colleges to use Pell money for training programs administered by nontraditional groups, such as computer coding “boot camps.” But the programs it covers are required to have at least 450 hours of class time, which would still leave many training programs without aid.According to Steve Long, associate vice chancellor at St. Louis Community College, which is applying for one of the EQUIP grants, the coding “boot camps” generally cost between $3,500 and $5,000 and can lead to jobs with starting salaries of $50,000.A 2012 study found that men with certifications in computer and information services earned more than $72,000 a year — a higher salary than 54 percent of men with bachelor’s degrees earned at that time.“Pell was designed in a time when everyone was going to go to a four-year college,” said Long. “There are coding jobs available that don’t need four-year computer science degrees.”Like many community college administrators, Long believes that the simplicity of Pell funding would alleviate stress and red tape. These colleges often spend a significant amount of time scrambling to bring down the costs of the training programs by applying for local, state, federal and private grants, sometimes all at once.One easy solution might be to add the extra 100 or 200 hours that would allow the programs to qualify for Pell grants. But community college administrators say it would be unethical to pad their courses and create more work for students, just to get federal aid.""That’s why some of the for-profit schools got in trouble,"" said Long, referring to schools that have been sued or penalized for taking money from Pell-funded students for courses that, whatever the number of hours, did not teach the skills promised.Even worthy short-term programs and “boot camps,” however, raise thorny questions of whether something will be lost if they replace four-year college degrees and whether they will be disproportionately filled with low-income and first-generation students.“I’m very conscious and concerned about having upwardly mobile career pathways for low-income students,” said David Levinson, president of Norwalk Community College. “We live in a very highly stratified world, especially in higher education.”Still, while Levinson sees the dangers, he believes the tradeoffs of getting Pell eligibility for short-term programs are worth it. The key, he says, is making sure low-income students have a choice of options in practice, and not just rhetorically. He also believes the certifications should not be linked to one brand or company (for example computer coding only for Microsoft), and that certifications should be able to be stacked and lead upward.It isn’t rare to meet students who want to get a workforce certification but “can’t afford to take these classes,” said Kristina Testa-Buzzee, interim associate dean of extended studies and workforce development at Norwalk Community College. She sees programs that lead to certifications as phlebotomists or bookkeepers as both a gateway to further education and also as an “end point” if they fully meet the student’s needs.“People are asking the question, ‘Is college for everyone?’” said Testa-Buzzee. “As long as the question is being asked across the board and not just in our poorer communities, then it can really expand people’s choices.”______This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

It is chewy and crispy, OK?""Scalia may be subject to some regional bias since he was born in New Jersey and spent most of his youth in New York, but he's clearly issuing a majority opinion in this case. A 2014 survey by Zagat found that New York pizza is far and away the nation's most popular style, with 39 percent of the vote. The closely-related Neapolitan style was second with 17 percent while deep dish ranked a distant third with 9 percent. Chicago's version of a thin-crust pizza was nearly as popular as deep dish with 7 percent while New Haven, Sicilian and California styles rounded out the list. Also on HuffPost:"

What would the Republican candidates do? They didn't say.Perhaps it's not surprising that the GOP candidates refused to explain their views. While the issues of criminal justice and police reform have played a major role in the Democratic campaign, they haven't loomed nearly as large for Republicans. The remaining GOP candidates occasionally claim that President Barack Obama does not offer adequate rhetorical support for police officers. But otherwise, they haven't made clear what actions they would take as president to improve the nation's law enforcement system.In wooing voters in the overwhelmingly white state of New Hampshire -- which has been hit hard by the heroin epidemic -- several Republican candidates spoke compassionately about the struggles of their families and friends with addiction. They didn't suggest that tougher drug policies were the solution. But neither did they explain what the federal government might do about the crisis or how it played into their broader views on criminal justice.Do the GOP contenders agree that incarceration levels are too high, and if so, what is the federal role in reducing the number of people behind bars? Why do they think the U.S. has seen historically low levels of violent crime in recent years? Do they believe that police departments generally hold their officers accountable for misconduct?Was FBI Director James Comey, a Republican who served as deputy attorney general under the George W. Bush administration, right when he said that law enforcement has been ""brutally unfair to disfavored groups"" and that some officers take ""lazy mental shortcuts"" based upon race? Should the billions of dollars the federal government hands out in grants to local law enforcement agencies come with additional strings attached, in an effort to prevent unconstitutional policing practices?And would they give more support to the small section of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division that investigates patterns of constitutional abuses in local police forces -- such as those in Ferguson, Missouri, and Chicago? These were some of the questions that The Huffington Post presented to the 2016 presidential candidates last month. But as was the case with a recent New York Times survey on presidential power, most of the Republican campaigns did not respond or declined to participate. Ben Carson's campaign had planned to take part, but eventually backed out. Marco Rubio's campaign sent over a link to a 2015 essay he wrote that focused mainly on rolling back federal regulations, as well as establishing a standard under federal law that would make it more difficult to prosecute white-collar criminals. The Florida senator has acknowledged elsewhere that the issues raised by the Black Lives Matter movement are ""serious"" and ""legitimate,"" but also said those problems don't all ""have governmental answers."" He has not detailed what his administration would do in the area of criminal justice reform.Ted Cruz, who last year held a hearing on the federal government's supposed ""war"" with law enforcement, has said solutions for people addicted to heroin would come from churches, charities and loved ones. He has said the Black Lives Matter movement ""literally"" celebrates dead cops. The Texas senator has sometimes been on board with federal sentencing reforms, but hasn't presented a clear picture of what his administration would do on other issues of criminal justice.Donald Trump has dubbed law enforcement officers ""the most mistreated people in America"" and spoken about the need to ""give power back to the police."" He recently suggested that those who were subject to excessive force from police officers could simply sue. ""Everybody sues, right?"" he said at the ABC debate on Feb. 6. He's offered little indication that he believes there are any major problems in the criminal justice system to be fixed.Jeb Bush has gone through somewhat of an evolution on criminal justice and signed onto the Right on Crime statement of principles, which emphasizes ""cost-effective approaches that enhance public safety"" and declares that prisons ""are not the solution for every type of offender."" He also spoke frankly about his daughter's struggle with addiction. But when asked about the tension between police and communities last month, the former Florida governor suggested that Justice Department involvement could increase distrust and then pivoted to talking about black-on-black crime. With the two Republican candidates who spoke most frequently on these issues -- former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul -- out of the race, Ohio Gov. John Kasich seems to be the candidate left with the clearest record on criminal justice and the one who offered the most substantive answer to a criminal justice question at a debate. Kasich implemented some law enforcement reforms in his state -- where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot in 2014 and where the Justice Department found shocking brutality and incompetence in the Cleveland police force. But Kasich, who signed a sentencing reform bill back in 2011, hasn't made criminal justice reform a major issue of his campaign or detailed what he would do as president.The next president could have a major impact on the civil rights of thousands of Americans living in cities and towns with troubled police departments. Back in 2009, long before the broken relationships between police and their communities were drawing national attention, the Obama transition team prepared a report concluding that under President George W. Bush, the section of the Civil Rights Division that investigates policing practices had been ""micromanaged in a way that [had] prevented it from formulating or pursuing a meaningful agenda"" and had ""not used its authority to address systemic problems of police misconduct."" Under President Obama, the Civil Rights Division has opened a record number of investigations into local law enforcement agencies, such as the probe that led to a lawsuit against Ferguson this month.Both Democratic candidates have said that as president they would boost funding for the Civil Rights Division section that looks into patterns of abuse by local police. What would a Republican president do about that unit -- or any other criminal justice issue? We can only guess."

Here's some good news for you: It's likely high time you sort through your bathroom beauty and grooming items. Expired makeup and products do more harm than good, so saying goodbye might mean saying hello to clearer skin and healthier habits.HuffPost Style turned to a few experts to get their takes on what products to toss and when -- among them, Dr. Pamela Dalton, a member of Monell Chemical Senses Center, Dr. Amy Wechsler, renowned dermatologist, and makeup artist Kari Bauce. To get motivated, Bauce offered us some pretty wise words. ""You wouldn't feed your family something that came out of a can in 2011, so why would you put something on your face that's been sitting in a cabinet for that long?""A reminder: This isn't some phony attempt to get you to buy more makeup or products, but rather a callout to, as Bauce says, ""use what you buy."" Without further ado, here are the 14 products you will (most likely) need to throw out right now:1. Mascara Expires after: Bauce says six to eight weeks; most say 3 monthsThrow out because: ""When it starts to dry out,"" says Bauce. It's also because you could easily get pink eye from old mascara, or contract a serious infection. Adds Bauce: ""If it is flaking onto your face or your eyes itch, throw it out.""2. Nail polish Expires after: One to two yearsThrow out because: In an interview with Fitness Magazine, Annette Soboleski, a nail technician for OPI Products Inc., said that once nail polish is opened, ""some ingredients will evaporate, causing the nail polish to thicken and separate."" Once it separates and starts to clump, throw it out.3. Face masks Expires after: ""One to two years, or if the consistency, dryness or color has changed,"" says Bauce. Throw out because: Over time, the masks can become irritating to your face as the chemicals and ingredients within them begin to break down.4. Perfume, cologneExpires after: Your nose says it's gone badThrow out because: ""There really isn't any danger in using a perfume that may have changed character, [but] it's best to just let your nose be the judge of when it's time to throw it out!"" says Dr. Dalton.5. Concealer Expires after: One yearThrow out because: While concealer generally expires within the year, it could get dry before that, too, says Bauce.6. Facial wipes or medicated padsExpires after: The expiration date, typically two monthsThrow out because: They've probably dried out anyway.7. Blush Expires after: Two to maybe three years, though Bauce notes that cream blush is more like emollient and you should toss it after about a year.Throw out because: ""It just stops working after a while, which is what you'll find with powder products in time,"" says Bauce. ""They get drier, they get flatter. It if starts to get a film over it, toss it, because that film is mold.""8. EyelinerExpires after: Six months for liquid eyeliner, two years for pencil eyelinerThrow out because: Liquid eyeliner starts to gather bacteria over time, but pencils keep longer because you constantly sharpen it. A white or grey tip is a sign of mold, adds Bauce.9. SunscreenExpires after: Three yearsThrow out because: According to the Mayo Clinic, sunscreen over three years old or past its expiration date is ""no longer effective."" They also recommend throwing out sunscreen that ""has been exposed to high temperatures or has obvious changes in color or consistency.""10. Lipstick, lip glossExpires after: One to two years for lipstick, 18 months for lip glossThrow out because: Celebrity makeup artist Jamie Greenberg told HuffPost's OWN that ""change in color, texture or smell are all big warning signs that your lipstick has expired.""11. Powder shadowsExpires after: Two to three yearsThrow out because: ""If you notice a film or if the color stops working very well, then it's aged out. If the color doesn't blend on in the way that it once did, don't try harder, that it means that it has expired,"" says Bauce.12. Cream or powder foundationExpires after: 12 to 18 months if cream, two years if powderThrow out because: Like other emollient products, toss cream foundation after a year or if it starts to change color before that, says Bauce. Powder foundation is similar to powder blush, as mentioned above, in that if you see a film or if the color stops working, it's expired.13. PrimerExpires after: One yearThrow out because: ""If it's a matte primer then you might be able to get some time,"" says Bauce. ""But again, remember this has been sitting around in a plastic bottle, and it's been separating. The general rule is chuck it after a year.""14. BrushesExpires after: The bristles in your brush start to fray or fall out, or if you haven't cleaned them in a while.Throw out because: Dirty brushes can irritate skin, so it's best to keep them clean or replace them every so often. Try washing or cleaning your brushes every two weeks with shampoo, or household items like bar soap and olive oil.

Thomas Brennan shouts to his comrades to keep out of the line of fire from Taliban insurgents during a firefight in Afghanistan, Nov. 1, 2010.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c1fd4e1d00002700df5f41.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You could say The War Horse -- an ambitious new digital magazine currently raising funds on Kickstarter -- all started with a rocket-propelled grenade.On Nov. 1, 2010, U.S. Marine Sgt. Thomas Brennan, then 25, was in Helmand province, Afghanistan, when that grenade exploded feet away from him.He wrote about it later in The New York Times:Looking up from the ground, it felt surreal. My ears were ringing. The sun was blinding. It felt as if I had been asleep for hours. Looking to my right I saw a silhouette begin to cut through a thinning cloud of smoke. He appeared to be moving in slow motion. Soon, he was standing above me, helping me to my feet. We took turns running back to cover.Brennan, a Massachusetts native who joined the Marines in 2003, suffered a traumatic brain injury that day -- his third. When he got back to the U.S., he found that his brain injuries, compounded by severe post-traumatic stress disorder from over a year serving as an infantry assaultman in Iraq and Afghanistan, were creating for him a constant struggle with paranoia, insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks.In late 2012, after more than 18 months of trying to cope with these conditions, Brennan attempted suicide, like so many veterans have. He swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills, but made himself throw them up when, he later wrote, he imagined his daughter ""crying at my flag-draped coffin.""His brain injuries had also caused him to develop aphasia, a communicative disorder that Brennan describes as always having the word on the tip of his tongue, but “not being able to get it out.” The military sent him to a therapist. “He handed me a notebook and was like, 'Just write -- write so we have something to go off of,'” Brennan told The Huffington Post. “And I just started writing.”One of the first things Brennan wrote was a letter to the war photographer and journalist Finbarr O’Reilly. O’Reilly, who was then with Reuters, had been embedded with Brennan’s platoon, and photographed the moments right after Brennan was injured. Those photos would later appear in The New York Times.“The pictures he took, the story that he wrote, helped me fill in a lot of the blanks, sparked memories I have now, or things I perceive as memories,” Brennan said. “So I wrote a thank-you letter to him.” But Brennan says he “didn’t want to send some crappy-ass letter” to an accomplished journalist like O’Reilly without an edit, so he sent a first draft to David Dunlap, an editor at the Times who had worked with O'Reilly before. When Dunlap read Brennan's letter, he asked if he could print it in the paper.“And who the hell are you to say no to The New York Times?” Brennan remembers thinking. “Especially when you perceive yourself as some dumb grunt who got blowed up in Afghanistan.”Brennan went on to write more than a dozen pieces for the Times. His work has also appeared in the newspaper Stars and Stripes, and on The Huffington Post. After Brennan was medically retired from the military, his passion for journalism grew. He worked for two years at a North Carolina newspaper and earned a master’s degree at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. He found the act of writing and reporting “therapeutic,” he said.Now Brennan is focusing his efforts on The War Horse, an online magazine that bills itself as “the authority” on America’s post-9/11 conflicts and wars, and as the “ONLY digital magazine profiling all men, women, interpreters, and dogs killed since 9/11.” The War Horse plans to devote significant investigative resources into looking at the Department of Defense, the U.S. armed forces and the scandal-plagued Department of Veterans Affairs. But the main goal of the site, Brennan says, will be to humanize the men and women who serve overseas. While he acknowledges that there are already some writers and publications doing a good job of covering the military, Brennan says his experience as a soldier and veteran will make The War Horse an invaluable resource. ""I think the one common thread that I bring to the table is I know the fear that exists [among troops] when it comes to approaching journalists,"" he recently told Military.com. ""Having people who are personally involved in these different worlds is going to open up the possibilities.""Some of the first stories on the site, according to Brennan, will include an article about intimacy after genital mutilation from war and a profile of a recent Medal of Honor recipient. The site will also create a database to keep track of suicides among veterans. One section of The War Horse, called The Echoes Project, seeks to create multimedia profiles for every soldier, interpreter and dog killed in Afghanistan and Iraq -- the two longest-running conflicts in American history. The idea, Brennan said, came to him after watching journalists scramble to interview the few living veterans of World Wars I and II. His hope is that thanks to The War Horse, “journalists of the future, and average people of the future, [won't] have to scramble to get stories from my generation before we die,” he said in a recent radio interview. The Echoes Project will include profiles of military dogs, Brennan says, because “those working dogs were out there on every single patrol.""""They come back with blisters, or bleeding... or they overheat on patrol, get shot, get blown up, just like we did,"" he said. ""I think they’re as much of a team as any of the service members or the interpreters who were killed as well. Everyone involved helps accomplish the mission.”Brennan has a dog of his own, Mr. Luke, that goes everywhere with him and helps him cope with his PTSD. Re-integrating into civilian life, he said, was “very stressful and very scary, especially when you haven’t known it for 10 years.” “Anybody who tells you they weren’t scared in combat is completely full of crap,” he went on. “My guys made it OK for me to go out there and address how scary and real everything was [in Iraq and Afghanistan], and Mr. Luke did the exact same thing for me here.”The War Horse boasts an impressive board of advisers. Besides O’Reilly, there is Bruce Shapiro, director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma at Columbia University, whose bio on the site says he will ensure The War Horse's ""adherence to ethical journalism practices""; Kevin Cullen, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The Boston Globe whose ""extensive newsroom experience,"" per the site, ""will guide The War Horse in creating thoroughly and responsibly reported works of investigative journalism""; and military veterans and journalists Brigette McCoy and Tahlia Burton, who specialize respectively in coverage of female veterans and coverage of human rights issues.The War Horse has gotten an assist from the real estate business CRI Properties, which donated an office space in North Carolina, where Brennan lives. The Institute for Non-Profit News has also been a major help, and various donors have contributed furniture, computers, Web hosting and more.But now Brennan needs an infusion of $50,000 to fund the site’s first series of long-form stories, to start profiling the people and animals killed in action in post-9/11 conflicts, and to assist with grant-writing and further fundraising to help the site grow. With less than 48 hours left on its Kickstarter, as of Monday afternoon The War Horse is still some $16,000 short of its goal. Brennan says the site will officially launch on Sept. 11, 2016, the 15th anniversary of the terror attacks that sent him to war overseas.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said that the Institute for Non-Profit News played a role in helping Brennan secure an office space. In fact, that space was donated by CRI Properties.Also on HuffPost:"

He also revealed how the ""Deadpool"" team discovered that women enjoyed the film in its early stages.""What's weird is that in the early tests of the film that we did women were really crazy about the movie and that was kind of surprising to us,"" he said. Unfortunately, the concept that women actually enjoy and appreciate action-packed movies is still not considered the norm. According to Reynolds, some studios still question whether women only head to the theaters to watch a love story. The ""Deadpool"" star had a spot-on response to this sexist notion:""I think the action and the humor is what appeals to women, you know, the same thing,"" he added.

33,COLLEGE,Mizzou Chancellor Condemns 'Verbal Assault' By Melissa Click During Homecoming Parade,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melissa-click-homecoming-parade_us_56c135c3e4b0b40245c7197e,New footage emerged of the controversial professor clashing briefly with police in October.,2016-02-15,"Mizzou professor Melissa Click stands between police and activists at the university homecoming parade on Oct. 10, 2015. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c13d491a00009c01ab2a39.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The University of Missouri's interim Chancellor Hank Foley said Sunday night that communications professor Melissa Click has engaged in a ""pattern of misconduct"" after new footage emerged from an incident in October. Video posted over the weekend shows Click getting into a confrontation with police a month before her infamous encounter with student journalists during November protests on Mizzou's campus. Click received widespread backlash following a Nov. 10 incident in which she blocked the student journalists from entering an area of the campus where protesters were camping. During that November episode, which was caught on camera, Click directed dozens of students to form a human wall to keep the journalists away. She has since been charged with assault and has agreed to community service in exchange for deferred prosecution. The university also suspended her.On Saturday, the Columbia Missourian published a profile of Click that included footage from police body cameras during the Oct. 10 homecoming parade for the university.The video shows Click joining student activists who had stopped the vehicle carrying then-MU system president Tim Wolfe. Click hugs the students and then stands between them and the city police trying to keep the activists back from the parade. ""I remember thinking, stupidly, that if as a white person I put myself in front of the students, that maybe they wouldn’t push me,"" Click explained to the Missourian. Click can be heard on the video yelling at the cops, ""Get your hands off the children,"" and after a moment shouts, ""Get your fucking hands off me!""In his statement Sunday night, Foley characterized this as Click ""directing a verbal assault against members of the Columbia Police Department during the homecoming parade.""""Her conduct and behavior are appalling, and I am not only disappointed, I am angry, that a member of our faculty acted this way,"" Foley said. ""Her actions caught on camera last October, are just another example of a pattern of misconduct by Dr. Click -- most notably, her assault on one of our students while seeking 'muscle' during a highly volatile situation on Carnahan Quadrangle in November.""Foley did not say whether he'll seek any further sanctions on Click, who is tenure-track, but said he will ""address these new revelations with the Board of Curators,"" the university's governing body.Missouri state lawmakers have pointed to the university's response to Click's actions as a reason for why they are seeking to financially punish Mizzou. Mark Schierbecker, the student who shot the widely seen footage of Click from November, said this weekend, ""I think they are using my video as an excuse for the budget cuts they already wanted to make.""CORRECTION: This article previously said Melissa Click is tenured, when she is actually tenure-track and does not yet have full tenure._______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter covering higher education, based in New York.
