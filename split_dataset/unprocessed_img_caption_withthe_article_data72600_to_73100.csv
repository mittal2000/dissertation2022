3,POLITICS,How The Obama Administration Is Making It Harder To Shed Student Debt,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/student-debt-relief-edmc-settlement_us_564a6006e4b08cda348a47aa,"""This settlement provides zero justice for the people who have been harmed by EDMC.""",2015-11-17,"Education Secretary Arne Duncan, left, said EDMC ""was breaking the law and lying"" to the government, but stopped short of saying the company did the same thing to students.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Education Management Corp., the nation’s second-largest for-profit college company, appears to have a good friend in Education Secretary Arne Duncan.On Monday, it agreed to pay $95.5 million over the next seven years to end a joint federal-state lawsuit that alleged the company, also known as EDMC, ran a “high pressure boiler room” scheme for years that defrauded taxpayers out of at least $11 billion in federal student loans and grants from 2003 to 2011. The Department of Justice and a group of state prosecutors alleged that EDMC lied about its eligibility to receive those funds.EDMC also agreed to forgive $102.8 million in loans it gave to some students who dropped out shortly after enrolling to dispatch a separate lawsuit filed by another, larger group of state attorneys general. Some accused EDMC of advertising false job placement statistics in an effort to lure students into enrolling.Officials referred to the separate deals as a global settlement that resolved whistleblowers' allegations that EDMC’s schools -- The Art Institutes, Argosy University, Brown Mackie College, and South University -- systematically deceived students, states, and the federal government for financial gain.Consumer advocates and higher education experts said the settlements were paltry compared to the total amount of alleged fraud and that they failed to provide meaningful debt relief for allegedly defrauded students. They're also angry that EDMC not only isn’t required to acknowledge wrongdoing, but can expressly deny the allegations.Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the settlement reflected EDMC’s ability to pay. In Tuesday trading, the company’s nearly worthless stock reached its highest price since June.As part of the settlement, EDMC also received two gifts: First, the Department of Education agreed to not use the settlement or any related evidence investigators dug up as the basis for holding the company accountable through in-house means for its alleged years-long crime spree, such as restricting EDMC’s access to federal student aid funds.Second, and perhaps most importantly, Duncan repeatedly declared that EDMC hadn’t misled students. “To be clear, what was found here was not misrepresentation to students,” Duncan said on Monday. “It was breaking the law and lying to us.”That’s important, because if the Education Department found that EDMC misled students into enrolling and taking out federal student loans -- or if EDMC had admitted to it -- those students could then petition Duncan’s department to discharge their debts under a provision in federal law that aims to shield borrowers from having to make payments on fraudulently-originated federal student loans. Duncan, in turn, could then order the company to refund the federal government for those amounts.“It seems that there is an acceptable cost of doing business if caught engaging in illegal acts,” said David Halperin, a Washington attorney critical of the for-profit college industry. “Unless there is better enforcement and stronger penalties, crime will continue to pay.”The threat of having to repay the federal government for loans discharged under the so-called ""defense-against-repayment"" provision was one reason why state and federal prosecutors were unable to persuade EDMC to admit to any wrongdoing, said one state official involved in the settlement negotiations.“No for-profit school would sign a settlement that contained an admission,” the official said.Mark McEachen, EDMC’s chief executive officer, said the lawsuits “were without merit” and that the company settled so it could focus on its students.Yet Duncan’s statement appears to contradict at least one of the whistleblower lawsuits that the Justice Department settled, which alleged that EDMC misled students into enrolling with false statements about its accreditation and success at getting students jobs, as well as a separate lawsuit filed by the state of Iowa. Dorie Nolt, an Education Department spokeswoman, later implied that Duncan was referring to just one of the lawsuits that federal authorities settled.Student advocates and some state prosecutors worry that Duncan has no intention of canceling debts owed by former EDMC students who may have been misled into taking out federal student loans.Duncan’s statement that EDMC didn't lie to students “is flat-out false,” said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. “It’s candidly a nonsensical assertion. I hope it’s not an attempt to curtail victims’ right to get some relief here. I hope that’s not the purpose of the statement.”Piggy-backing off a 2007 whistleblower lawsuit, the Justice Department claimed in 2011 that EDMC paid bonuses to its recruiters solely based on how many students they enrolled -- a violation of federal rules that led “to the enrollment of unqualified and uninformed students” -- and repeatedly lied to the federal government whenever it claimed it wasn’t paying such bonuses, making the company’s schools ineligible to receive taxpayer-backed payments from students who got the funds from the Education Department.Some state officials and consumer advocates contend that EDMC’s allegedly false statements to the Education Department about its bonus practices also constitute fraud against its former students. According to these experts, EDMC allegedly deceived students into enrolling and taking out loans by not telling them that the company was engaged in practices that would render it ineligible to receive federal student aid funds.“At the end of the day, a lot of students were lied to when they were brought into [EDMC’s] schools and they’re not going to see any relief,” said Elizabeth Baylor, director of postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress. “It’s not justice.”Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey urged the federal government to use its share of the EDMC settlement funds to pay down former EDMC students' debt on federal student loans.EDMC collected about $1 billion in federal student aid during the most recent academic year, Baylor said. In past years, it received about double that amount.Instead of taking EDMC to court to recoup those funds, the government instead accepted a relatively small payment. The company’s former students who initially received those loans will likely be forced to repay the money over the course of their lives, thanks to the Education Department’s extraordinary ability to garnish wages and seize tax refunds.“This settlement provides zero justice for the people who have been harmed by EDMC,” said the Debt Collective, a pro-borrower group that has organized a nationwide “debt strike” against the Education Department.But that’s not how the Education Department sees it, according to Nolt.Despite four years of government litigation against EDMC, Education Department officials “do not know of, or have the evidence to support, claims of misrepresentation to students because that was not the focus of the case,” Nolt said.Former EDMC students can still file applications with the Education Department to have their debts canceled, she added. “If there is evidence of misrepresentations to students, we want to hear that and we’re open for business,” Duncan said."

In response to Sterling’s appeal of a 2014 ruling that paved the way for Steve Ballmer to take the reigns of the franchise, the court claimed Monday that Sterling’s legal team “fail[ed] to demonstrate” that there was “any legal error” in last year’s verdict. Mercifully, this decision sets one thing in stone: Donald Sterling will never own the Clippers again.""He has devoted most of his briefs to rearguing the facts and relies on evidence expressly rejected by the probate court [last year],"" Monday’s opinion read.Sterling was removed from ownership in the spring of 2014, after TMZ released a tape of the then 80-year-old making a series of racist comments, including telling girlfriend V. Stiviano that it “bothers” him that she “associat[es] with black people.” Sterling’s remarks sparked outrage around the NBA, leading commissioner Adam Silver to permanently bar him from the league. A legal battle ensued, and after multiple doctors found Sterling to be exhibiting ""signs of Alzheimer's,"" control of the team passed into the hands of his wife, Shelly. Shelly sold the team for a record $2 billion to Steve Ballmer, earning both Sterling’s praise and his ire, and marking the transaction he later went to court to appeal. Per The Associated Press, Monday’s ruling emphasized that Sterling was “properly removed” from the family trust, and that Shelly’s choice to sell the franchise when she did prevented it from experiencing an “‘extraordinary loss.’”This final fissure between team and ex-owner is surely welcomed by a Clippers franchise that has been shadowed for years by his seedy actions and offensive stances. Good riddance, Donald Sterling. Your claims to ownership are now as mistaken and antiquated as your racist remarks. Also on HuffPost:"
5,POLITICS,Planned Parenthood Gears Up For 2016 Amid Mounting Attacks,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/planned-parenthood-2016_us_564b5a05e4b045bf3df0f2dd,"Television ads about Republicans, abortion and birth control are coming to a screen near you.",2015-11-17,"Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, testifies during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing in September.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564b5e881600002e0026d8d7.jpeg?cache=FbN0YvmaLI&ops=crop_0_27_4800_2866%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Planned Parenthood’s political arm launched its 2016 election program on Tuesday, signaling that it will hold accountable candidates who have a record of attacking the organization and reproductive health care access. The launch includes a new website detailing what each of the presidential candidates have said about abortion, birth control and Planned Parenthood funding. The health network will be holding grassroots forums across the country to discuss the organization’s priorities. And a new video featuring Planned Parenthood Action Fund President Cecile Richards warns that the group's supporters will ""organize and mobilize to elect lawmakers who are in our corners."" “Extremists have made the 2016 election about attacking reproductive rights,” Richards says in the video. “Politicians who side with these extremists, you are not my candidate."" The organization's electoral effort comes as it faces intensified defunding efforts in the wake of the release of a series of videos filmed and edited by an anti-abortion group showing Planned Parenthood staff members discussing fetal tissue donations for research. Though various federal and state-level investigations have turned up no evidence of wrongdoing, and federal funds are blocked from going toward most abortions, Republican governors in a number of states have cited the videos to justify canceling the group’s Medicaid contracts and cutting off funding for the cancer screenings, STI tests and contraception the organization provides to low-income women.In 2016, reproductive health care will be an even more charged conversation than usual. Republicans have formed a select investigative panel focused on Planned Parenthood that will scrutinize the organization well into the election year. And the Supreme Court will be ruling this spring on challenges to Texas abortion restrictions and the Affordable Care Act’s accommodation for religious nonprofits that do not want to cover contraception for their employees.“Today we have a clear message for every politician who has threatened access to reproductive health care, who has said having to drive hundreds of miles to safely access a legal abortion wasn’t a ‘burden,’ and who has made offhand comments about eliminating basic health care for millions across the country: You’re about to be in for a very rude awakening,” said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. “You cannot embrace policies that dismiss the lives of women, of the LGBTQ community, of people of color, of low-income families, of young people, and expect to be elected by the American people.”Planned Parenthood is confident that reproductive health care access will be a salient issue in the election despite the attacks on its funding. National polling has shown that the organization remains more popular than the National Rifle Association, the Supreme Court, both political parties, every presidential candidate and President Barack Obama. The group saw a near-perfect return on its millions in election spending in 2012, when the 18-point gender gap between Obama and Mitt Romney, who said he would defund Planned Parenthood, helped re-elect the president. In 2014, however, the organization's election investments came up against a terrible year for Democratic candidates. Though Planned Parenthood appears unlikely to endorse a Democratic presidential candidate this cycle until she or he has the party’s nomination locked up, the group is already educating voters about each of the Republican candidates’ stances on reproductive health care. The election website notes, for instance, that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio supports a ban on abortion with no exceptions for victims of rape and incest; that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush cut state funding for the organization in 2001; and that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz led the effort to shut down the government over Planned Parenthood funding.On the Senate side, Planned Parenthood says it will be focusing on races in New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio, where Democrats hope to defeat relatively vulnerable Republican incumbents, and in Nevada, where they hope to hold the seat of retiring Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.). The organization’s grassroots forums will take place in the above-mentioned Senate battlegrounds, as well as in Iowa and Florida.Rachel Siota, who serves as a volunteer for the organization, told The Huffington Post that she felt “this incredible energy and excitement” at a grassroots action forum she attended in Las Vegas earlier this month.“Everyone was ready to tell their stories and help develop an issue platform around issues that impacted them,” she said. “We talked about issues that matter like access to safe and legal abortion, affordable birth control, and care at Planned Parenthood, and talked about the impacts of these issues on communities of color and the LGBTQ community. I felt like my voice and opinions were heard and I felt empowered because I played a role in developing an issue platform that matters to people.”Also on HuffPost:"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564a464d1600002e0026d79d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Three days after terror attacks hit Paris, top Republicans in Congress threatened to exhaust all legislative tools at their disposal to stop the resettlement of thousands of Syrian refugees into the U.S.Newly elected House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said he would consider attaching a measure to halt the flow of refugees to an omnibus government funding bill that needs to pass Congress by Dec. 11. Doing so would complicate efforts to meet the deadline, and increase chances of a government shutdown just days before Congress plans to recess for the holidays. Citing the Paris attacks as a reason to re-evaluate the administration’s policy on Syrian refugees, Ryan talked about one of the assailants in particular, who appeared to have traveled through Greece in October on his way to France. Reports indicate that the passport of a Syrian refugee was found near the body of the attacker, and the Greek government confirmed it was used by someone to pass through Leros, Greece.“We’ve always been a generous nation taking in refugees, but this is a unique situation. This is a situation where you have single men coming over,” Ryan said in an interview on Bill Bennett’s “Morning in America.”Ryan said he is directing all of the relevant committees in the House to “come up with recommendations” on how they can “immediately” address the situation.“So we are looking at all of our options,” Ryan said, including attaching a measure restricting the administration’s plans to admit Syrian refugees to the year-end government funding bill. “What matters to me is not only do we prevent people from coming in, but we don’t bring them in. We've got to make sure we are protecting ourselves and so that is what we are looking at, what is the best option -- which is making sure that we are not complicit or even facilitating of having someone come in who would come to do us harm from Syria.”Obama stood by his plan despite the increasing pushback from Republicans in the wake of the Paris attacks -- which the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, took credit for -- charging that “slamming the door in [refugees'] faces would be a betrayal of our values.”But in Washington, calls for House leadership to act piled up. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said it’s “critical” the State Department “reconsider its plans to allow thousands of Syrian refugees into the country at this time.”Obama has said the U.S. plans to take in 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year. All would have to undergo security screenings that take 18 to 24 months. “If the State Department fails to halt the program at this time, Congress must take measures to at least temporarily restrict funds to block the refugee program,” Meadows said in an email to The Huffington Post. Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) echoed that sentiment, urging Ryan and the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), to block funding for refugees in the upcoming budget battle. “As you know, the president recently announced that he intends to annually allow 100,000 individuals into America through this program, many of them radical Muslims from the Middle East,” Jones wrote in a letter to Ryan on Monday. (The administration has said it would admit 85,000 refugees total for the fiscal year, 10,000 of which would be Syrian.)Jones added that given the recent “terrible slaughter of innocent civilians” by terrorists in Paris, he “will not vote for any bill that provides funding for the Obama administration’s dangerous” resettlement plan. On the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) is pushing a similar agenda, encouraging his colleagues to make sure the omnibus spending bill includes a provision requiring congressional approval for the president's refugee resettlement program.Sessions also wants to require that the administration fully offset the costs, and identify foreigners admitted into the U.S. as refugees since 2001 who have since been involved in crime or terrorism.“The barbaric attacks in Paris -- an assault on civilization itself -- add immense new urgency,” Sessions wrote in a letter to the Appropriations Committee on Monday.All the senators running for the Republican presidential nomination -- Rand Paul (Ky.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Marco Rubio (Fla.), and Ted Cruz (Texas) -- also called for a stop to admitting Syrian refugees due to the Paris attacks. Leaders on Capitol Hill are facing additional pressure from Republican governors who came out one by one on Monday against admitting refugees to their states. Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) wrote to Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) directly, asking them to take “immediate and aggressive” action to block funding for the refugee program. “It is our understanding that the state does not have the authority to prevent the federal government from funding the relocation of these Syrian refugees to Florida even without state support,” Scott admitted. Piling on, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee called out the new House speaker on Twitter. Matt Fuller contributed reporting."

And Bradley says that while Republicans have been focused on adding different riders to a year-end spending measure -- such as language that would block Planned Parenthood funding or block Syrian refugees from coming to the United States -- it's just as important that conservatives play a part in which programs get extra dollars.""There was a belt-tightening aspect across the government because of sequestration,"" Bradley told The Huffington Post on Monday. ""We shouldn't just say, 'Well, we can untighten a few notches on the belt for everybody.'""Instead, in a blog post, ""The Appropriations Endgame,"" Bradley argues that directing the additional $25 billion to select programs will ensure those sequestration cuts aren't erased across the board.Bradley, who was also a longtime aide to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), makes the case for increased spending to, among other things, pay for a medical research bill that passed the House in July.Many of the offsets proposed in that bill, the 21st Century Cures Act, were already used in other pieces of legislation. And Bradley says it's important that Congress go after deadly and costly diseases.""Such treatments and cures not only will improve the quality of life for millions, but also have the potential to reduce future health care spending,"" Bradley wrote in the blog post.On top of setting aside $4 billion for medical research, Bradley also makes the case for devoting $6 billion of the new funds to help pay for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a bill that mandated that students with disabilities get a free public education, and $5 billion to help tackle a $20 billion backlog of infrastructure projects.""While some conservatives may object to any spending increases, the relevant question is no longer whether to support an increase in domestic spending: that was decided when Congress enacted the [Bipartisan Budget Act],"" Bradley wrote. ""Instead, the question is whether conservatives want to influence where that increase goes. If conservatives engage, they can help ensure that the money does not go to agencies like the [Environmental Protection Agency] and [the Department of Housing and Urban Development] but instead to initiatives which already enjoy conservative support.""Also on HuffPost:"

Police were much more likely to use force in street stops than in vehicle stops, and there was a signifiant racial split in those encounters. About 13.7 percent of blacks reported that police used force against them when they were stopped on the street, while only 6.9 percent of whites reported this.The study was based on surveys of Americans over the age of 16, and it widely defined use of force and threats of force to include ""shouting, cursing, threatening, pushing or grabbing, hitting or kicking, using pepper spray, using an electroshock weapon, pointing a gun or using other force.""Three out of four individuals who reported that police used force against them believed it was excessive, according to the report. While those who reported being hit or kicked were the most likely to think the force was excessive, the vast majority of people who were subject to force -- 87 percent -- believed police didn't behave properly. Alternatively, 90 percent of those who did not have force used against them believed the police behaved properly.While there's been a significant focus on the lack of national data about fatal police encounters and officers' use of deadly force, there's also a lack of data about police encounters that involve nonlethal force.There has also been surprisingly little study of U.S. law enforcement agencies' internal disciplinary processes, The Huffington Post reported this year. A federal survey of data from 2002 found that just 8 percent of use-of-force complaints that large state and local law enforcement agencies received in 2002 were ""sustained,"" meaning the officer involved was found to be guilty of misconduct. Federal investigations into troubled police departments typically reveal that officers are found to be in the wrong in just a very small percentage of cases. But Reuters reported this week that federal authorities -- who have stepped up efforts to collect data on police shootings -- will again begin collecting data on formal citizen complaints about use of force.Also on HuffPost:"

Ted Cruz (Texas) and former Sen. Rick Santorum (Pa.) are coming to the aid of their colleague Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) in the final week of his Louisi­ana gubernat­ori­al run­off cam­paign.On Sunday, National Journal reported the two presidential hopefuls recorded robocalls voicing sup­port for Vitter, who is trailing Democratic Louisiana state Rep. John Bel Edwards in the heated race. The Vitter campaign told National Journal that Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is expected to do the same. Vitter's involvement in the 2007 ""D.C. Madam"" prostitution scandal resurfaced after a tough Edwards attack ad alleged Vitter ""chose prostitutes over patriots” by skipping a vote honoring U.S. troops. The senior senator from Louisiana addressed the controversy in his own ad last week, saying he ""learned that our falls aren’t what define us, but rather how we get up, accept responsibility and earn redemption.”Vitter's campaign has since gone after Edwards for skipping a can­did­ate for­um on Thursday to at­tend a meet-and-greet at a ""risqué adult"" nightclub. In his call on behalf of Vitter, Santorum said he was ""appalled"" by Edwards' decision to attend the event:“I must ad­mit I am ap­palled. Just last week, a group of Chris­ti­an churches, the Fam­ily For­um, hos­ted a gubernat­ori­al for­um and in­vited both can­did­ates. Only Dav­id Vit­ter at­ten­ded. Demo­crat John Bel Ed­wards can­celled an ap­pear­ance at the state’s pro-life de­bate in fa­vor of at­tend­ing a voter drive held at a risqué adult hip-hop nightclub in New Or­leans. You just can’t make this stuff up. Please vis­it Hayride.com to see the video foot­age.”Cruz's call, in contrast, placed more emphasis on early voting.There's nothing unusual about senators recording calls for fellow members of their own party. But as social conservatives who regularly stress the importance of family in private and public life, Cruz and Santorum might not be the best messengers given Vitter's own faults in that area.Also on HuffPost:"

The protest was among numerous campus actions around the country following the racially charged strife at the University of Missouri. (AP Photo/Steven Senne) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If there's one thing University of Missouri senior Alanna Diggs thinks people are getting wrong about campus racism protests, it's the assumption that they're something new.The demonstrations at Mizzou this month resulting in the ouster of two top university leaders, partly over how they handled various racist incidents on campus, Diggs said, ""were not a result of spontaneous combustion.""""It was not an overdramatic reaction by a couple of angry black students, but a moment built up over time,"" Diggs continued. ""Many of us behind the scenes have been suffering and struggling with administration and students while trying to deal with class and work. The movement is not over. This is the beginning.""The demonstrations at Mizzou's campus in Columbia came on the heels of unrest at Yale University, and have been copied -- complete with demands for resignations --at dozens of other colleges, including Ithaca College in New York, the University of Kansas and Claremont McKenna College near Los Angeles. Protests staged on college campuses last week are the culmination of years of activism around inequality and everyday racism, and incidents pushing racial divisions to the surface. The demands activists are making are reminiscent of similar protests decades earlier. And scholars caution there's no single switch colleges can flip to fix things -- improving racial tensions on campuses will likely take years. ""What we are seeing is the beginning of a movement where students and student groups across campuses are finding the courage to speak up about what they have been experiencing,"" said Yolanda Sealey-Ruiz, a scholar of Latino and black male students, at Columbia University. ""I think Mizzou is a catalyst, an inspiration perhaps, but not a one-off event. I think we are also witnessing a reprise to history -- college campuses have historically been places where protest to inequality has taken place.""Students are arriving on campus believing racism remains persistent in America today. According to an annual survey of more than 150,000 incoming freshmen by UCLA, the percentage of students who believe racism is no longer an issue has risen slowly over 25 years, from 19 percent in 1990 to 24 percent in 2015.Students of color who've spoken with HuffPost say that does not surprise them, given that students are growing up witnessing high-profile deaths of unarmed black men and teens, like Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner. Those experiences are coupled multiple examples of fraternity and sorority parties featuring black face and caricatures of various ethnic groups, while Muslim students at some campuses have been subjected to spying by law enforcement. ""We're not that much that different than the people being killed,"" said Taylor Lemmons, a junior at Claremont McKenna College. ""Just because we're going to get a degree from these shiny institutions doesn't mean we're that much different.""Read Student Activists' Demands:In some cases, students who say racism is still a prevalent issue have been proven right. The University of Alabama's sororities didn't begin accepting black women as members until 2013. In March, fraternity brothers in Oklahoma were caught on video singing and laughing about lynching black men -- racial slurs included.""We're living in a time where issues that haven't been appropriately attended to for a number of years are getting much more attention,"" said Benjamin Reese Jr., Duke University's chief diversity officer. ""I don't think students suddenly woke up to things. I think they're reacting not only to the events on campus and incidents around the country.""Brown University senior Armani Madison said part of his discontent with his school is fueled by demands made by black students in 1968, 1975 and 1985 that ""have yet to be fulfilled, despite university promises."" Activists at Occidental College noted their demand for a black studies major has existed since 1968. Students of color have organized campaigns at Colgate University, the University of Michigan, UCLA, and Harvard, among other schools, to highlight inequities. Some of these demands at Brown, Mizzou and elsewhere are for an increase in the percentage of minority students and faculty.

20,TASTE,Taco Bell To Use Cage-Free Eggs In All Of Its Restaurants,James Cave and Arin Greenwood,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/taco-bell-cage-free-eggs_us_56496d9fe4b060377349b6eb,They're not clucking around.,2015-11-16,"Taco Bell announced today that the chain is committed to using cage-free eggs in the menu items at all of its 6,000-plus restaurants by this time next year.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56497414180000f000304c79.jpeg?cache=bR9Nq2SbZS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hear that? Taco Bell's ringing a song for chickens' rights with today's announcement that the chain is committed to using cage-free eggs in all of its 6,000-plus U.S. corporate- and franchise-owned restaurants by December, 2016.Every A.M. Crunchwrap, breakfast burrito and biscuit taco will be made with cage-free eggs, benefitting 500,000 hens each year, Taco Bell said in a statement.Taco Bell's announcement comes after some of its competitors have made similar promises -- with less speedy timeframes. McDonalds, Starbucks and most recently Panera are have all committed to end the use of battery cages -- considered to be one of the farm industry's cruelest practices. These other chains have set their target dates between five and 10 years from now.Taco Bell spokesperson Alec Boyle told The Huffington Post that his company has been quietly working behind the scenes with its egg supplier, Michael Foods, to ""accelerate the timeline for implementation to nimbly meet consumer demand.""In cage-free environments, hens are able to nest, stretch their wings and move in flocks, which are natural behaviors not afforded to hens raised in battery cages.So this announcement has animal advocates crowing.""This is enormous news,"" said Leah Garces, the U.S. director of Compassion in World Farming, told The Washington Post. ""Especially given the timeline, which will be the fastest yet.""Josh Balk, director of food policy for the Humane Society of the United States, said he sees Taco Bell's announcement as a signal that more good things will be happening for animals, at a quick clip.""We’re seeing an arms race now -- or perhaps, ‘wings raise’ -- where companies are one-upping their competition by showing they care more about animals,"" Balk said to HuffPost in an email. ""Demonstrating that animal welfare is a core component to a company has become a competitive advantage. That’s a great position for the animals to be in!"" Taco Bell said it is the first restaurant of its kind to implement this change, and the Humane Society said Taco Bell has ""catapulted itself ahead of other restaurant chains.""""Switching to 100-percent cage-free eggs by the end of 2016 is a tremendous commitment that will quickly improve the lives of countless animals and further cement the future of egg production as being one without cages,” Josh Balk, senior food policy director of the Humane Society of the United States, said in Taco Bell's statement.A publicist for Taco Bell told The Huffington Post that the company doesn't plan to pass the cost of this change on to the consumer, adding that ""they want to continue to maintain great value and ensure their food is available to everyone.""Also on HuffPost:"
