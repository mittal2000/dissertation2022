Londell McMillan, is shooting down claims that the 57-year-old singer had a dangerous relationship with drugs. In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, McMillan denied TMZ's reports of a painkiller overdose before his death and said that Prince was ""not on any drugs that would be any cause for concern."" ""Everybody who knows Prince knows he wasn't walking around drugged up,"" McMillan said. ""That's foolish. No one ever saw Prince and said, 'He looks high.' It wasn't what he was about.""The lawyer told the AP he last spoke to Prince the Sunday before he died, after the singer's plane was forced to land because of a medical emergency. Prince told McMillan, whom he'd known for 25 years, afterward that ""he was doing perfect.""Prince was found dead in his Minnesota home on April 21. An autopsy and full toxicology scan took place the next day, though the Midwest Medical Examiner’s Office stressed via Twitter that it ""may take days and weeks"" to process results. According to a press conference held Friday after Prince's autopsy was completed, the singer was last seen alive at 8 p.m. on Wednesday night. Authorities declined to comment on prescription drugs found in the singer's home, but said there was ""no reason to believe this was a suicide."" "

The legendary musician died at his Paisley Park compound in Minnesota on Thursday. According to the documents, Nelson is requesting that Bremer Trust, National Association be named the special administrator to oversee her brother's estate. Under Minnesota law, a special or personal representative is appointed when an executor has not been named in the will. In the filings obtained by TMZ, Nelson claims, “I do not know of the existence of a will and have no reason to believe that the decedent executed testamentary documents in any form.""If the singer did, in fact, die without leaving a will, his estate will be divided equally among his siblings. Nelson lists all the potential beneficiaries of her brother's estate in the filing, as well. She is Prince's full biological sibling, but she also listed half-siblings John, Norrine, Sharon, Alfred and Omarr.As for how much his beneficiaries stand to inherit, crude estimates put his net worth around $300 million, and his song catalog is thought to be worth about $100 million. But there have also been reports that the singer had money problems and tax issues and it is unclear if those problems were resolved at his time of death. UPDATE: On Wednesday, a judge ruled that Prince died without leaving a will and granted his sister's request to appoint Bremer Bank as special administrator of Prince's estate. "
2,POLITICS,State's Anti-Free Speech Bill Is Close To Becoming Law,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/university-of-tennessee-free-speech_us_571e7b98e4b0f309baee388d,Lawmakers want to shut down the University of Tennessee's diversity office and ban it from promoting gender-neutral pronouns.,2016-04-26,Conservative politicians want to ban the University of Tennessee from financially supporting Sex Week events on campus.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571e99a0220000290025478f.png?cache=mMQ1WhqB7C&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"State legislators are close to defunding the University of Tennessee-Knoxville's diversity office and banning administrators from teaching students about gender neutral pronouns. Student activists, student government members and LGBT advocates are now pressing Tennessee's Republican governor to prevent that.Tennessee lawmakers approved a bill last week that would strip $436,000 in state funding for the UT-Knoxville's diversity office. Legislators plan to distribute the money instead to minority student scholarships -- and force the university's School of Art's graphic design program and print shop to create and distribute decals that read, ""In God we trust"" for police vehicles.The bill also bars the flagship university from promoting the use of gender-neutral pronouns for trans individuals or people who identify as queer. And it prevents UT from providing any financial support for ""Sex Week"" events, solely because lawmakers disagree with the content of speech during those programs. Gov. Bill Haslam (R) has not yet decided whether he will sign or veto the measure, a spokeswoman told The Huffington Post on Monday evening, but he ""will review it in its final form before taking any action.""Hundreds of students staged a walkout on the Knoxville campus last week in protest at the bill. A second demonstration was held in Chattanooga on Sunday. More than 1,500 people have signed an online petition in the past five days, which the Tennessee Equality Project started to urge the governor to veto it. No students at the University of Tennessee have protested in favor of closing the diversity office, against gender-neutral pronouns or against Sex Week.""Now, more than ever, we need to come together as a UT community, and ensure our state representatives understand that their actions in taking away such an integral part of our university will only harm us,"" said student government president Carson Hollingsworth at the walkout, ""not only as students, but also as graduates of this institution.""The National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education issued a statement last week, calling the Tennessee effort to defund the office ""misguided"" and sending a signal that the university should teach from a narrower perspective.""Defunding such offices ignores the important role of diversity and inclusion operations across the country in leading change, and addressing the lingering effects of past discrimination in this country, and solving societal problems and evolving challenges in a culturally informed and ethical ways,"" the diversity officers group wrote in its statement. ""To disable the work of diversity and inclusion within modern academia strikes at the very core of the abiding core values of many higher education institutions.""UT officials told HuffPost they are unsure what would happen if the bill is signed into law -- like whether other funds could be used to support the diversity office -- because it would be speculative at this point. The language in the bill forbidding the gender-neutral pronouns harkens back to false reports that the university's diversity office banned the use of ""he"" and ""she,"" though it did nothing of the sort. Conservative politicians in the state have publicly criticized Sex Week on an annual basis. The student-organized event does not use university funding and features programs addressing healthy relationships, alternative sex lives and about abstinence and consent. Civil liberties groups like the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education say legislation like this could chill free speech on campus, because it suggests the legislature will move to restrict funding from anything on campus it disagrees with.The legislation garnered more than two dozen co-sponsors in the Tennessee House, including one who had also argued in recent weeks in favor of ensuring free speech rights to ISIS recruiters on campus. _______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter covering higher education, and is based in New York.

3,POLITICS,This Guy Spent A Record $12.7 Million Running For Congress -- And Lost,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/david-trone-self-funding-maryland_us_571f92d6e4b0f309baeea63c,David Trone spent more than any other House candidate before him.,2016-04-26,David Trone has contributed more money to his own campaign than any previous House candidate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571f939622000036002548f5.jpeg?ops=crop_33_83_2020_1458%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Thanks to the record spending of one candidate, the Democratic primary in Maryland’s 8th congressional district will go down in history. David Trone, the multi-millionaire owner of the retailer Total Wine & More, spent $12.7 million of his own money on the campaign, making him the biggest self-funder in the history of U.S. House elections. On Tuesday night, he lost the race to Jamie Raskin, a Maryland state senator. Trone was a late entrant into the primary race for this safe Democratic seat in Washington’s more affluent Maryland suburbs. He used his wealth to wildly outspend his two main opponents in the race: Raskin and former television anchor and Marriott International executive Kathleen Matthews. As of April 6, Raskin had spent a total of $1.2 million, while Matthews had spent a total of $2.1 million, most of which they raised from donors (Matthews also loaned her campaign $500,000 of her own money). The congressional seat opened up when Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) decided to seek an open U.S. Senate seat.Both Raskin and Matthews are closely tied to Washington’s political and media elite. Raskin, who also works as a constitutional law professor, is married to Sarah Bloom Raskin, the deputy secretary of the Treasury, while Matthews is married to MSNBC host Chris Matthews.Like Republican front-runner and billionaire Donald Trump, who has self-funded his presidential campaign with $35 million in personal loans, Trone argues that self-funding will prevent him from being corrupted by lobbyists and donors.“I certainly could have raised enough money to fund a competitive campaign,” Trone told the The Washington Post. “But the PACs, lobbyists and big dollar donors who give money would expect special attention. No matter how well-intentioned, those contributions and the candidates who take them are part of the reason Washington is broken.”Other candidates who were big spenders on their own campaigns have not had much success in elections, however. The previous record-setting self-funder for a House seat, West Virginia Democratic candidate James F. Humphreys, spent $7.8 million of his own money in 2002 ($10.4 million in 2015 dollars). Humphreys only received 40 percent of the vote, performing worse than he did in 2000, when he spent $6.1 million ($8.5 million in 2015 dollars). Phil Maloof, a Democratic House candidate in New Mexico, spent $10 million in 1998 ($14.7 million in 2015 dollars) across a special election and a separate primary and general election for a congressional seat. He lost both campaigns.The most prolific self-funder for any federal office was independent presidential candidate Ross Perot, who contributed $63.5 million ($108 million in inflation-adjusted dollars) to his 1992 campaign.This post has been updated to reflect that Trone lost in Tuesday night's primary."
4,POLITICS,GOP Wants To Help Federal Contractors Hide Civil Rights Violations,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-federal-contractors-civil-rights-violations_us_571f774fe4b01a5ebde33fa5,There's a sneaky amendment to a must-pass defense bill.,2016-04-26,It's unclear if Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) supports an amendment to his bill that would let defense contractors get out of reporting civil rights violations.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571f78572200002900254884.jpeg?ops=crop_0_384_4928_2896%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A Republican lawmaker is quietly trying to slip language into a defense bill that would block President Barack Obama's executive order requiring federal contractors to disclose civil rights violations.The House Armed Services Committee is set to take up the massive 2017 defense authorization bill on Wednesday, and when it does, there will be an amendment in the mix to make defense contractors immune to the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order. That executive order requires contractors who have committed civil rights or labor violations to disclose that they've done so when they apply for new government contracts.It's unclear who authored the GOP amendment, which you can read here. But it's expected to get a vote during the committee's marathon hearing, which will run from Wednesday morning through early Thursday morning.Rep. Adam Smith (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the committee, said he'll oppose any effort to override the executive order. Obama signed it in July 2014, but it is still being rolled out and is on track to take effect later this year.""We should not be making it easier for companies that violate labor, safety, or gender and racial equity laws to acquire government contracts,"" Smith said in a statement. ""It is common sense that when the Defense Department or Nuclear Security Administration is choosing who it will work with, it should have sufficient information about any violations to know what it is getting into.""Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), the committee chairman and author of the defense bill, did not respond to a request for comment.The defense authorization bill is must-pass legislation that Congress takes up every year, and because of its size (it's 758 pages this year) and necessity, it's prime for amendments that target hot-button social issues. Republicans tucked anti-gay language into it in 2011, 2012 and 2013. There was abortion language in it in 2012. In a last-ditch effort in late 2014, Democrats tried to attach an entire bill to it that would prohibit workplace discrimination against LGBT people. Republicans rejected that effort.UPDATE: 7:20 p.m. -- The mystery is solved: Rep. John Kline (R-Minn.) is behind the amendment. His spokeswoman Bethany Aronhalt said he's offering it because the executive order includes regulations that will ""threaten the resources"" of people who serve in the military. There's also already a suspension and debarment process for employees who violate federal laws, she said.""The federal contracting process is already plagued by delays and inefficiencies,"" Aronhalt said. ""That is why Congressman Kline intends to offer an amendment that would prevent the administration from making these problems worse when it comes to the critical activities of the Department of Defense and the National Nuclear Security Administration.""The National Associations of Manufacturers also came to Kline's defense. They sent Thornberry letter warning that the executive order would ""threaten the ability of the DoD and the NSSA to rapidly award vital contracts.""But that reasoning isn't cutting it with labor and civil rights groups. More than 40 of them, including the AFL-CIO and the America Civil Liberties Union, wrote to Thornberry in strong opposition to Kline's amendment.UPDATE: April 28 -- The committee adopted the amendment early Thursday, 34-28, and passed the bill."

It has 36 co-sponsors, but senators are waiting on the GOP-controlled Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions to bring the bill up for a vote.CASA would allow the Department of Education to fine schools up to 1 percent of their operating budget for violations of Title IX, the gender equity law requiring schools to handle sexual assault and harassment reports. Currently, the Education Department can either reach an agreement with universities outlining reforms a school will make to comply with Title IX, or withhold all federal funding from the school, including student loans. The department has never withheld funding, and activists say the fines are simply a slap on the wrist for schools. CASA would also require a standard, uniform survey of every college and university to gauge students' experiences with assault and harassment, and whether they sought services from any agency. Tuesday's event in support of the legislation featured seven GOP legislators and five Democrats. The ratio was noteworthy given that the bill's two primary sponsors are Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, and some Congressional Republicans have pressed Education Department officials in recent months to validate their authority to prescribe certain campus sexual assault policies. Conservative columnists and bloggers have also regularly disputed decades of research showing around 1 in 5 women experience sexual assault by the time they graduate college.

""The goal of the bill is to take a system that is incentivized to downplay the problem, because they don't want bad publicity, and incentivize people to deal with the problem.""McCaskill told reporters that senators wanted to fold CASA into the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, the nation's main law governing colleges, universities and financial aid for students. But many insiders doubt the HEA will get brought up during the election season, so McCaskill said they now hope to incorporate CASA into a narrower slice of the reauthorization, or move it forward as a standalone bill.""This is really a committee decision at this point,"" McCaskill said. A spokesperson for Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chair of the HELP committee, did not respond to request for comment. If the bill isn't brought up by August, McCaskill said senators may consider trying to pass it in the lame duck session after the November elections.Despite the support from legislators, the advocacy group SurvJustice released a statement Tuesday saying there should be structural changes to CASA on several points, including fines.Title IX does not explicitly state that students can sue over violations, though many students do based on court precedent. SurvJustice worries that because CASA modifies Title IX so the Department of Education can impose fines under it, that could challenge the current court standard allowing students to sue.Instead, SurvJustice wants CASA changed so it adds an amendment to Section 202 of the Department of Education Organization Act, which would give the education secretary to have the power to fine schools for any violation pertaining to sexual violence.Gillibrand was asked at the press conference whether CASA would do more to protect due process rights of students accused of sexual assault. She responded that mandates in CASA requiring basic training for all those who adjudicate sexual assault cases on campus would help address that, because right now ""it's hit or miss depending on what school you're at.""In addition to Ayotte and Graham, Thursday's event featured Republican Sens.

8,ENTERTAINMENT,Former 'Rebel' With A New Cause: How Elvis Went From Liberal Icon To Anti-Drug Activist,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elvis-presley-jerry-schilling_us_571e7247e4b0b49df6a89b89,"Jerry Schilling: ""I think very strongly that I lost my friend at an early age due to creative disappointment.""",2016-04-26,"Michael Shannon and Kevin Spacey share a scene from ""Elvis & Nixon.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570bc175150000ee010b4837.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the most popular photos at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. -- a 1970 snapshot of Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon shaking hands in the Oval Office -- forms the subject of a new movie appropriately titled ""Elvis & Nixon."" Now playing in select theaters, Liza Johnson's film takes a humorous approach to the encounter, casting Michael Shannon as a lonely Elvis who sought permission to go undercover as an anti-drug agent and Kevin Spacey as a haughty Nixon who only took the meeting so he could secure an autograph for his daughter. Presley and Nixon's powwow occurred a few months before the president infamously began recording his conversations, so the movie's details are mostly guesswork. But Jerry Schilling, Presley's longtime friend who traveled with the singer and helped to arrange the parley, produced ""Elvis & Nixon"" and offered insight into what actually happened. The Huffington Post sat down with Schilling during last week's Tribeca Film Festival, where the movie screened ahead of its theatrical release, to reflect on Presley's resistance to the counterculture, why losing a role in ""A Star is Born"" contributed to his death and whether he actually went undercover after meeting Nixon.What was your initial thought when you found out this relatively small episode in Elvis Presley’s life would be made into a feature film?I thought, “Great idea.” I thought drama, but I heard comedy and I got scared.Why?Well, because it was a serious mission on Elvis’ part. He really felt that he wanted to do something for his country, being the ultra liberal and rebel, initially. [By that point, he was] older and more conservative. It was just a beautiful expression from an American citizen who didn't have a lot of opportunities coming up very poor to be able to meet the president of the United States. And Elvis always looked at himself as an undercover agent. He loved that stuff.In what way did he view himself as an undercover agent?Well, we all have to have our hobbies outside of our work, no matter what your work is. He had collected real badges. He had gone and worked at ranges to qualify to carry concealed weapons, and you have to keep in mind that he had death threats. So it wasn’t just a hobby. It was a way to say, “OK, if there’s some idiot out there, I can protect myself.” And the right wing who had not understood him was accepting him. Elvis morphed from a liberal rebel to a conservative activist as rock 'n' roll became the dominant force in pop culture. When did that transition begin?I think he really started changing when he came back from the Army [in 1960]. I think suddenly people who thought he was this vulgar rock-‘n’-roller started saying, “Hey, man, he did his service.” He comes back and his first appearance is with Frank Sinatra on a TV special. “Hey, he must be OK,” you know? Elvis, who had no prejudices at all, loved the underground, if you will. And the original underground loved him. But he cared about the other half of the world, as well, so he embraced it all. That’s why he was special. That’s why we’re still talking about him, besides, obviously, his creative ability. He was an ultimate human being.I understand why serving in the military might shift a person's moral views, but do you think that service also created some demons within Elvis? The movie makes it seem like he’s haunted by the conflict of what’s going on in the world to the point of shutting down internally a bit, if that makes sense.It does make sense. [Long pause] That’s the deepest question I’ve ever gotten, and I’ve gotten a lot of questions. [Another pause] That’s such a good question, and I don’t know if I have an answer. But I think there’s an element of truth there. I think it may have worked in the opposite way, actually, because I think, as before, that element -- let’s call it the right wing -- did not get who he was. I think it opened them up more because now they’re starting to like him. They’re starting to respect him and to get who he is. They’re getting over the image of the rock-‘n’-roller with the hair down, the wild man. They’re seeing the human being. I miss the rebel.I think it opened him up more. I think he was starting to see that everybody was liking him and respecting him, so there may be other things, but in this regard, I think it gave him the courage to try to get with the president of the United States.As the 1960s moved forward, his albums stopped hitting No. 1 and the sound of rock changed drastically. Do you think he was becoming something of a -- I don’t think “outcast” is the right word, because he’s Elvis, after all, but …Well, he started off as an outcast.Sure, but not by 1970.Right.But the image of rock ‘n’ roll and folk music at the time was all about the counterculture. Or at least that’s the perception we have now. No, it was.Do you think Elvis lost a certain credibility, or at least a certain coolness, among the Mick Jaggers and Bob Dylans of the world?There’s no doubt about it. To be an original is unusual, and he was the original original. There wouldn’t have been Mick Jagger, there wouldn’t have been Bob Dylan or John Lennon. But you can only sustain that so long, and most rebels start out, I think, as teenagers or young people. He’s maturing now. He’s older, and he’s understanding responsibilities and he’s seeing the counterculture that’s a byproduct of something that maybe he didn’t totally start, but he was certainly a leader. Now it’s starting to promote things that he didn’t like, professionally and publicly. Let’s face it, the music was drug-influenced. He did not like seeing people walk on the stage with torn jeans back then. He thought if you’re doing a show, you should look like a showman. He came from a different time. He was a pioneer. So yes, that played a part, absolutely.At the time, did it surprise you that a sitting president would be resistant to the idea of meeting with the most famous entertainer in the world? Today, politics and pop culture are so intertwined. Obama is supposedly friends with Jay Z and Beyoncé, for example.Obama’s cooler than Nixon, come on.Oh, of course. Nixon might be the least cool president we’ve ever had. I wanted it be Kennedy! But it really surprised me. I tell you what, I was a political science minor and a history major. I was going to be a schoolteacher, and I kept up with politics. I knew that the senators were having a hard time getting with Nixon, so I didn’t think there was a chance in hell when I read the letter that Elvis wrote to Nixon that we would ever get in. I didn’t want to hurt his feelings and say, “This ain’t gonna happen.” I just think it was the political climate and where Nixon was, which nobody knew -- we found out later. Nobody was hardly getting to Nixon at that time, let alone a rock-‘n’-roller. So I was totally surprised when we got in.Had Kennedy been in office, do you think he would have been less reticent to the idea? Or Johnson? In other words, was it a Nixon thing or a presidential thing?I think it was a presidential thing, maybe more so with Nixon, who, to my surprise, got who Elvis was. He said, after the fact, even after Elvis was gone, “I thought he was a fine young man. I enjoyed meeting him.” It’s in the Nixon library. I think it was two guys at the top who were lonely. They kind of got who each other was.That’s the most interesting idea the movie grapples with -- the concept of Elvis as a lonely person. Both of them, really.I love the scene where Elvis talks about all the screaming mobs that don't see him as a real person. You must lose a sense of yourself in such madness, so going undercover offered the opposite of screaming crowds.What else was motivating him was he was bored with his career because he wanted to do more challenging movies. I was at the meeting with him with Barbra Streisand when she offered him “A Star is Born,” and Hollywood didn’t want that. They had a formula: 12 songs, just pay for Elvis. He was a race car driver in one movie and a motorcycle driver in another. He was a brilliant man, and you don’t give geniuses the same thing, so his hobbies started becoming very important to him because the career wasn’t challenging. He was a guy who needed a challenge, but the machinery had gotten too big.The bottom line is, I think very strongly that I lost my friend at an early age due to creative disappointment. And creative disappointment caused a lot of other problems. He wanted to numb that creative disappointment, and that’s where it started.The movie's postscript says we don't know if Elvis actually ever went undercover. So I have to ask: Did he?You want to know the truth?Of course.Yes.In what capacity?I can’t tell you. It was undercover."

But the ""GoT"" family tree has nothing on the reach of the HBO series' ratings, which earned a record high for the Season 6 premiere this past Sunday, according to The Hollywood Reporter.The episode ""The Red Woman"" marks a series best for the fantasy epic, drawing 10.7 million viewers, including numbers from the on-air premiere, repeats and early returns from HBO's streaming services. But ""GoT"" drew a considerably smaller audience when measured by traditional ratings metrics. Before HBO Go and HBO Now became popular avenues to consume the network's content, viewership was solely calculated using Nielsen, an audience measurement system that uses statistical samplings to determine TV ratings. By these standards, EW reports that the ""GoT"" premiere was down 1 percent from last year (7.9 million) and 4 percent after the repeats (758,000 and 205,000) were calculated into the total.However, when including traditional and streaming ratings, the premiere easily bested Season 5's opening (9.8 million) by 9 percent, as well as topping the season finale, which previously held the record (10.3 million) for the most-watched ""GoT"" episode to date. Only time will tell how this season's ratings for HBO's prize pony compares to the average 20 million viewers per episode for Season 5. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the total tally will be determined in a few weeks, as HBO does not release ratings before comprehensive Live-plus-7 (viewing that happens within seven days of an episode's first telecast) returns.In the meantime, here's Tyrion Lannister dancing in celebration.

A full 77 percent of American adults surveyed who use Facebook said they would never broadcast live video of their lives on Facebook, while 59 percent said they had ""heard nothing at all"" about the feature to begin with.Moreover, 37 percent said they ""hardly ever"" post personal photos or videos on Facebook while 20 percent said they ""never"" do. Only 3 percent said they post personal media every day. Twenty-eight percent said they use Facebook less now than they did a year ago, though 45 percent said they use it about the same amount.The results come just days after reports indicated a panic at Facebook over a decline in ""personal sharing"" on the platform. While the company still rules the Internet with a far larger and more plugged-in user base than any rivals, its status as an ""intimate"" gathering place for friends is fading.""It has become a personalized portal to the online world,"" Will Oremus wrote in a column on Slate. No longer just a hub for baby pictures, drunken status updates and messages from mom, Facebook has launched a dizzying array of new products geared toward taking over smartphones and, by extension, the Internet.There's Notify, which helps you experience news updates via Facebook. Instant Articles displays posts from a variety of publishers on Facebook's own platform. Messenger now allows you to talk to businesses like 1-800 Flowers via ""bots"" rather than customer service lines. And, of course, there's Live: The new video broadcasting service being hoisted upon users with such aggression that the distribution of other content has suffered as a result.Facebook hopes Live video will lead people to share personal content on the site once again, but it's unclear whether normal, human people will bite.The new poll from HuffPost and YouGov suggests maybe they won't. Of course, it should also be noted that many media organizations -- The Huffington Post included -- have taken to the format and frequently broadcast live video to their audiences. Just because individuals don't want to broadcast their own lives doesn't mean they won't watch other broadcasts.Plus, attitudes change. If you had asked people 15 years ago whether they'd ever upload photos of their brunch to an online network filled with distant acquaintances, they probably would have thought you were crazy.So, a bit of wisdom for the modern age: Just because people say they won't do something doesn't mean Facebook can't make them.

11,SCIENCE,This New Camera Shows You The Glow-In-The-Dark World Sharks See,Jenna Amatulli,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/glow-in-the-dark-sharks_us_571f73d7e4b0b49df6a8ee7b,Biofluorescence could tell us more about how underwater animals and organisms communicate.,2016-04-26,"On the beach at Rannalhi, Maldivian island of the South Male Atoll. Bioluminescence is the production of light by a living organism. During the night, the beach comes alive with shining blue light brought ashore by the waves.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571fca25160000e90031cc02.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sharks are incredibly fascinating creatures. Wouldn't it be cool to see what they see?Well, researchers at the American Museum of Natural History have created a ""shark-eye"" camera that ""simulates how the shark sees underwater."" The impetus for this was the discovery of a group of shy sharks -- catsharks, specifically -- who produce a bright green biofluorescence that does something unique, says a new study published Monday in Scientific Reports.The team noticed the sharks increase the contrast of their biofluorescent glowing pattern the deeper they travel underwater. The contrast makes them brighter, allowing the sharks to make themselves more visible to neighbors of the same species and possibly communicate with each other. “We’ve already shown that catsharks are brightly fluorescent, and this work takes that research a step further, making the case that biofluorescence makes them easier to see by members of the same species,” John Sparks, a curator in the American Museum of Natural History’s Department of Ichthyology and a co-author of the study, said in a statement.Biofluorescence is when molecules in the skin of an organism absorb the blue-hued wavelengths of visible light in the water and re-emit them as other colors. This is not to be confused with bioluminescence, which is where ""the light itself is produced by the organism -- as it is via chemical reaction in fireflies."" Because a lot of what goes on underwater is invisible to the human eye, the goings-on within the biofluorescent universe aren't totally known. Using a technique called microspectrophotometry to determine how sharks’ eyes absorb light, the researchers discovered that sharks have long rod pigments to help them see in environments without a lot of light. They used this information to develop the special camera filter that simulates how light hits a shark’s eyes.As study author David Gruber, an associate professor of biology at Baruch College and a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History, said in a statement: ""What does all this newfound biofluorescence we are finding in the ocean mean?""The short answer is that they're working on it, but Gruber wonders if ""these animals [can] see other animals that are biofluorescing in the deep blue sea"" and, if so, what way they're using it. The researchers recently also made the first observation of biofluorescence in marine turtles. Sparks said in a statement that all of these findings are ""a big step toward a functional explanation for fluorescence in fishes.” So, while we're not totally sure why these animals are glowing and gorgeous, we're certainly enjoying that they are.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571fced61900002d0056c493.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Addiction recovery groups are opening up a full-throated campaign against legislation that House Republicans will propose as the chamber's response to the opioid epidemic. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) have been promising swift action following the March passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act in the Senate by a vote of 94-1.On Wednesday, House Republicans will introduce the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, an advance copy of which was obtained by The Huffington Post. If the House had been hoping its parallel effort would win the support of the drug policy and addiction community, though, a barrage of letters has been unleashed to set them straight. The Harm Reduction Coalition and the group Faces & Voices of Recovery have both weighed in with critical missives, which were also provided to HuffPost. Another letter, signed by 71 separate recovery groups, similarly takes aim at the House bill, as the GOP risks becoming the face of opposition to addressing the heroin epidemic. As the name implies, the House bill reduces the focus on recovery. ""Most notably, the [bill] omits vital provisions in CARA addressing recovery, collateral consequences, and prevention and education,"" reads the note from HRC. The coalition of 71 groups and Faces & Voices of Recovery also cite the House's lack of focus on rehabilitation.""Without recovery provisions, CARA will not only be weaker as a whole, but will prolong the crisis of addiction by not providing the critical support in communities across our nation where it is needed most,"" reads the Faces & Voices letter.Last week, House Republican-run subcommittees approved a slew of a dozen bills aimed at the heroin crisis, a prelude to Wednesday's unveiling of the larger bill. McCarthy on Monday said that the week of May 9 would see significant action on the House floor on the opioid epidemic. But the advocacy groups warn the House's last-minute maneuvering creates the very real possibility that the legislative calendar will end with nothing at all getting done. ""The constraints of the legislative calendar pose a considerable risk that any such bill passed by the House which deviates so significantly from the Senate’s version of CARA will require not only extensive conference, but ultimately another extensive floor debate in the Senate,"" HRC says. ""Under such circumstances, we fear that neither CARA nor the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act will be able to secure final passage and be signed into law during this session.""The Senate bill was crafted over a three-year period and includes input from a wide spectrum of stakeholders, not just recovery groups, but law enforcement, prosecutors and public health organizations as well. Because the House has been working quickly in the wake of the Senate bill, the same deliberative process hasn't been possible, so the negotiations are spilling into the public. The House bill, COARA, runs only 15 pages, and would allow all of the funding authorized to go to a law enforcement-first approach to what is widely acknowledged to be a public health crisis. The bill would allow public health and other groups to compete for grants, but the way it is set up appears to stack the deck in favor of enforcement. CARA, meanwhile, runs 125 pages and requires by law that significant amounts of the funding go toward recovery and other public health-related efforts. McCarthy spokesman Mike Long said he had not yet seen the letters, but expressed confidence that House and Senate differences would be worked out in a conference committee.Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), one of the co-authors of CARA, took the floor for the fourth time in four weeks to go after his House colleagues for their slow pace. He highlighted the quickening pace of the epidemic, which is taking lives at a startling rate. Every day the newspapers are filled with heartbreaking stories of addiction, he said.""Last week, from Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday morning, six people died of overdoses in Elyria, Ohio. This is not a big city,"" Portman said. ""Elyria has a population of about 53,000. But we lost six people in 24 hours, and that doesn’t include the 14 people who were saved by naloxone -- a miracle drug that can actually reverse the effects of an overdose. Those 14 people all overdosed within six hours.""""Last week, in Lebanon, Ohio, where my family has roots going back to the 1920s, a 34-year-old woman who was engaged to be married overdosed and died in front of her children, one age 10, and one a baby girl who is still learning to walk,"" he added. ""That little girl’s father has now been arrested. Within days, because of her mother’s addiction, she has lost both parents from her life."""

And not just any bailout. ""Congress wants to bail out Puerto Rico with Teresa's retirement savings,"" the ad, which has blanketed Washington airwaves, warns. Members of both parties, meanwhile, have been weighed down in the specifics of the bill, arguing over things like the composition of a debt restructuring board and what kind of majority it would take for the board to act. Such delays, not coincidentally, benefit the hedge funds likely behind the CFIF ad that stand to profit.And it's close to paying off. The island already defaulted on some smaller loans in January, but the more than $400 million due on May 1, and the almost $800 million due on July 1, could severely worsen the economic situation in the U.S. territory, and, ironically, increase the chances that Puerto Rico might actually need a bailout.McCarthy said Tuesday he wanted to get the restructuring bill done as soon as possible, but, he continued, the most important thing was to ""get it done right."""

Lawyers for the 78-year-old comedian and the magazine will argue in New York federal court on Tuesday over whether Cosby may obtain unedited interviews from an explosive 2015 cover story to use as evidence in a lawsuit brought by seven women accusing him of defamation. Cosby wants the complete interviews from six of the 35 women who described their alleged encounters with him to New York magazine, according to court records. Cosby has claimed that the interviews are vital to his defense in a Massachusetts defamation lawsuit because they may reveal inconsistencies in the six women's version of events. Though the dispute sets up a confrontation between the fallen entertainment icon and one of the country's most popular general interest magazines, analysts said there's little legal drama, as Cosby's attempt likely will fail. New York State's shield law provides strong and clear protections to journalists' independence with few exceptions. ""He's going to have a really hard time.

""It's a Hail Mary that they're throwing out there.""The legal cases involving Cosby have multiplied since more than 50 women have come forward to accuse him of sexual abuse and other misconduct. This fight with New York magazine is a tangent from a lawsuit brought by seven women who claimed Cosby defamed them by labeling them as liars.

""We look forward to presenting our case to a judge, as we’re scheduled to do,"" a spokeswoman for New York magazine said in a statement.Attorneys for Cosby didn't respond to The Huffington Post's inquiries, but in court filings they wrote that ""Mr. Cosby will be unfairly limited in his ability to challenge plaintiffs on cross-examination"" if his attorney can't review the full magazine interviews.The accusations that Cosby drugged, raped and molested women involve incidents going back to the 1960s. In most cases, with the exception of a criminal case in suburban Philadelphia, he is shielded from prosecution because the statute of limitations has expired. So accusers turned to civil court, where at least 11 women in five lawsuits have claimed Cosby defamed them through his denials that he violated them. Cosby, meanwhile, has brought multiple legal actions himself by filing countersuits against some of the women, claiming that they've defamed him.

""That would be educating youth of the dangers of possessing a real or replica firearm.""Rice died in November 2014 after being gunned down in a park by police officer Timothy Loehmann, who alongside partner Frank Garmback was dispatched to a park where the boy had been playing -- all after a 911 caller reported seeing him brandishing a gun, which turned out to be a toy.A grand jury led by Cuyanoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty -- who recently lost his bid for re-election -- refused to indict either officer for Rice's death, following proceedings and tactics that were largely for show.The amount of Monday's settlement, which was reached between the city and the Rice family to bring to an end a federal lawsuit against Loehmann and Garmback, is on par with other settlements reached in other high-profile cases of police brutality.Under the terms of the Rice settlement, which has yet to be approved by a judge, $5.5 million would go to the boy's estate, $250,000 to his mother Samaria and $250,000 to his sister, according to Reuters.Some of this money, Loomis said, should go to helping ""to educate the youth of Cleveland in the dangers associated with the mishandling"" of guns, no matter if they're real or fake.""We look forward to the possibility of working with the Rice family to achieve this common goal,"" Loomis wrote.This wouldn't be the first time Loomis adds controversy to the case. In an interview with POLITICO Magazine in 2015, he suggested Rice was partly to blame for the way police responded in their fatal encounter with him.""Tamir Rice is in the wrong,"" he said. ""He's menacing. He's 5-feet-7, 191 pounds. He wasn't that little kid you're seeing in pictures. He's a 12-year-old in an adult body."""

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Johnny Manziel has been indicted by a Dallas County grand jury on charges he allegedly assaulted his ex-girlfriend, according to local news reports.Citing sources in the district attorney’s office, KRLD-AM reported Sunday that the former Cleveland Browns quarterback has been indicted on a misdemeanor assault with bodily injury charge. WFAA-TV confirmed the news, saying the indictment will be formally announced on Monday.The embattled football player is accused of hitting his ex-girlfriend Colleen Crowley multiple times during an altercation in January. Crowley claims Manziel threatened to kill her and himself, and slapped her so hard she lost hearing in one ear.“[I feared] for my life,” said Crowley in an affidavit describing the incident. “I thought maybe he was on drugs or having a psychotic break.”In February, a judge signed a restraining order requiring Manziel to stay at least 500 feet from Crowley’s home and workplace for two years. He was also required to pay $12,000 of her legal fees.The past two years have been troubled ones for Manziel, who, in 2012, became the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy.He’s struggled both on and off the field, clashing with Browns management and battling addiction problems. Earlier this month, he allegedly caused over $30,000 in damages while partying in a Los Angeles rental home.In March, Manziel was released by the Browns; and earlier this month, Nike joined the list of several big name sponsors who’ve dropped him.The athlete’s father, Paul Manziel, told the Dallas Morning News in February that he was deeply concerned about his son’s well-being. He said he'd urged the 23-year-old on multiple occasions to seek treatment at a rehab facility.“I truly believe if they can't get him help, he won't live to see his 24th birthday,” the elder Manziel said.UPDATE (April 26, 11:10 a.m. EST): Following last week's report, Fox News' North Texas affiliate reports that Manziel has been officially indicted by the Dallas County grand jury. He'll enter a plea of not guilty, according to his defense attorney.A full copy of the indictment can be viewed below:"
23,POLITICS,Is Trump Damaging The GOP Brand On National Security?,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-gop-brand-national-security_us_571e6884e4b0b49df6a891cf,"Democrats are planning to connect the GOP to Trump’s national security comments, and Republicans are concerned.",2016-04-25,Donald Trump's outlandish comments may be tarnishing the GOP's reputation as the stronger party on defense. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571e69a3160000e40031c9c6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To this point, Donald Trump has made his political career on outlandish comments. But Democrats inside Congress are beginning to wonder whether they can end any Republican careers by connecting members to those Trumpian statements, particularly when it comes to one area of GOP advantage: national security.Voters have traditionally viewed Republicans as the stronger party on defense, and even Democrats acknowledge that Republicans are the ones who want to spend more on the military. House Democrats know they need to make inroads with voters concerned about national security, especially after Democratic leaders recently presented their members with polling showing Republicans ahead by 23 points with those defense-minded voters.But Trump could dramatically eat into that Republican advantage. Comments about the use of torture (“We have to beat the savages”); murdering the children of ISIS fighters (“Take out their families”); and giving nuclear weapons to new countries (“We're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea”) may give voters pause about which party is best equipped to keep the country safe – in this election and in the future.And congressional Republicans know it.“I fear that, if he becomes the nominee and continues to spout nonsense, you know, speak before he thinks, then I think it’s going to be very damaging,” one defense hawk, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), told The Huffington Post last week.Kinzinger noted that national security was an area that’s dramatically benefitted Republicans. And, he said, with the United States fighting “generational wars,” Trump and his outlandish comments could have real lasting effect.“If we’re seen as the party that’s not best to handle national security, which so far is what Trump looks like he’s advocating, I think it could be very detrimental,” Kinzinger said.Some Republicans refrained from speculating too much on Trump’s national security impact, mostly because, they said, they weren’t sure where he really stood on anything.“I don’t know what Trump’s stance is on national security or foreign policy,” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said. “I don’t think anybody else knows either because Trump utters so many nonsensical, false or internally conflicting statements that it is impossible to know what Trump would really do if president.”Brooks, a fierce conservative and a firm opponent of President Barack Obama, continued that “Trump’s foreign policy vacillations make President Obama look like Mr. Reliable and Mr. Consistent.”Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) said he didn’t know where Trump stood on much because he doesn’t listen to Trump. “He just makes no sense,” Huelskamp said, noting that Trump’s general behavior toward women should also be cause for concern among Republicans.“My wife, for one, is really offended by that,” Huelskamp said.Rep. Justin Amash, one of the leading libertarian voices in Congress, mostly shrugged off Trump’s possible damage to the Republican brand on national security. The Michigan Republican said Trump was “right about some things and wrong about a lot of other things.”But Amash didn’t think Trump was really tied to the GOP brand. “A lot of the Republican voters out there who support him are doing that precisely because he’s not very Republican,” Amash said.And other House Republicans thought Trump was immaterial to their actions on defense.“Republicans in Congress will remain strong on national defense, regardless of who the nominee is, of that person’s position,” Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) said.But Republicans shouldn’t be so sure they can avoid the Trump brand.John Lapp, a Democratic strategist and ad maker, told HuffPost that Republicans will have trouble separating themselves from Trump, particularly if he is the GOP nominee.""Eventually, they’re all going to be part of the same party,” he said.Lapp reported that he’s seen plenty of polling to suggest voters believe Trump would be dangerous for the country, and he suggested that Democrats could paint a Republican Party led by Trump as reckless and erratic.""The larger danger and harm is that Republicans are no longer seen as the party of national security,” Lapp said. “They’re seen as a party run by a madman.""For Rep. Scott Peters (Calif.), who represents one of the most Republican-heavy districts held by a Democrat, it’s about connecting his eventual Republican opponent -- whoever emerges from a crowded GOP primary -- to Trump.“To the extent I’m running against ... a slate headed by Mr. Trump that’s irresponsible, dangerous – I’ll call it out,” Peters said.Peters’ San Diego district is tailor-made for an argument against Trump.California voters are, generally, more socially liberal and more hawkish on defense. And while Trump likes to consider himself a hawk, Peters thinks his voters, many of whom have military experience, will see Trump’s comments as reckless and uninformed.“That kind of stuff is a bad impression to give to the world,” Peters said of Trump’s comments on national security, “and I think San Diego understands that.”For Democrat Bryan Caforio, who is running in California to unseat incumbent Republican Rep. Steve Knight, the game plan is simply to connect his Republican opponent to Trump at every turn.On Monday, Caforio laid out all the issues where Trump and Knight are similar, from abortion to deportation to threatening to “drop” a protestor who touched him.“There isn’t much daylight between Steve Knight and Donald Trump,” Caforio said.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee clearly sees an opening with Trump.Some recent DCCC polling conducted in 55 swing districts revealed that voters in those districts have national security concerns about someone like Trump – or even Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who’s said he wants to carpet bomb ISIS into oblivion. “I don’t know if sand can glow in the dark, but we’re going to find out,” Cruz said in December.In a choice between a leader who is “too reckless” or “too passive,” 49 percent said the bigger concern was a leader who was too reckless, compared to the 39 percent who said a passive leader was a bigger concern.And, in this same poll, 59 percent of likely voters in key congressional districts said they have ""fairly major"" or ""very major"" doubts about GOP House candidates connected to the national security views of Trump or Cruz.That could be a real problem for Republicans.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
