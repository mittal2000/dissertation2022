2,SPORTS,We Stand Behind The USWNT As They Boycott 'Horrible' Conditions,Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uswnt-boycott-turf-hawaii_us_56659a04e4b079b2818f203d,Our U.S. Women's National Team deserves better.,2015-12-07,"At the July 7, 2015, World Cup championship celebration rally in Los Angeles, California, a soccer fan holds up a sign calling for equal pay for female athletes.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56659f08210000c9005ac6f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After seeing the ""horrible,"" potentially dangerous field conditions at Aloha Stadium on Saturday, the U.S. Women’s National Team refused to play its Dec. 7 friendly against Trinidad and Tobago, stop No. 7 on its World Cup Victory Tour.The turf on which the team was supposed to play was torn-up, rock-ridden and outdated -- and just the fact that the team was expected to compete there without qualms or complaints throws into focus the undertow of sexism that still lives on in the sport today.Soccer’s gender gap, if you will, was supposed to have shrunk in the half-year since the women’s national team hoisted up its World Cup championship trophy. And maybe, in the fan’s eye, it has. But this incident has made it all too obvious that, from an organizational standpoint, women’s soccer still has a hell of a long way to go before it -- literally and metaphorically -- shares the same field as the men’s sport.The USWNT players made that abundantly clear this weekend. Citing concerns over safety and sexism, striker Alex Morgan, for one, argued on Sunday that the club needs to be “more vocal” when its field conditions aren't up to snuff, especially when compared to the quality of the men's team's fields. ""I think the training grounds that we were given and the playing surface of the stadium were horrible,” Morgan said. “It's hard because no one's really going to protect us but ourselves. So we're put in a very hard position because obviously we want to play in front of these fans and we want to train before the game but injuries happen when you don't protect yourself and when you're not protected from those higher up from you.” In the hopes of further explaining their decision to nix the game, the team published an op-ed on The Players’ Tribune on Sunday, describing “how bad the stadium’s field truly was.”In the article, the team wrote that there were “sharp rocks” all over the field; that the turf was “pull[ed] up out of the ground” at certain spots; and that the turf was so “low-grade and aging” that coach Jill Ellis was forced to clip the squad's practice down to 30 minutes to prevent potential injuries.“This was about field conditions and player safety,” the team wrote. “It’s as simple as that. Soccer is our job. Our bodies are our jobs. And nothing should ever be put in competition with our protection and safety as players. With all that in view, we made our decision: These simply weren’t acceptable conditions for an international match.”We've heard these arguments before, but changes have been slow to come. As Fox Sports pointed out, some of the biggest names in the international game began to take legal action against FIFA over “the use of turf fields in the 2015 Women’s World Cup” prior to the tournament -- and while the suit itself was never put forth, the statement was clear: It’s unfair and blatantly prejudicial for women to receive less money to play on more dangerous fields. ""I think the team needs to be a little more vocal ... about whether this is good for our bodies and whether we should be playing on it if the men wouldn't be playing on it,” Morgan further explained Sunday. ""We've been told by U.S. Soccer that the field's condition and the size of the field are the first two talking points of when they decide on a field, so I'm not sure why eight or nine of our 10 Victory Tour games are on turf whereas the men haven't played on turf this year.""The team had already lost veteran Megan Rapinoe to a knee injury on Friday. There were quite literally sharp objects protruding from the 100-plus yards of turf they were supposed to play on on Sunday. And these 20-odd players had just garnered international fame in July for notching the top spot at the World Cup -- something their counterparts on the men’s squad have never, ever done. So how could they have been expected to play in conditions so potentially harmful to their health and livelihood? How could this field have been deemed acceptable in the first place, when an impromptu, cursory checkup this weekend led the Federation to agree that calling the game was the only feasible solution?As The Players’ Tribune piece and Morgan’s statements make clear, the degree of barefaced sexism that still exists in the sport today is shocking -- just five months after they raised that World Cup trophy, marking just the latest moment when they, not the men, were the unquestioned stars of U.S. soccer in the public eye.“[T]his was about wanting to protect women’s soccer players in general,” the team wrote. “At the end of the day, we expect to be treated equally as our male counterparts. And we hope that, in the future, our fields and our venues will be chosen and inspected at the standard of an international match -- whether it’s men or women playing on the field.”Our U.S. Women's National Team deserves better. Stand behind them. Also on HuffPost:"

Several local politicians and members of Congress publicly criticized UT's Knoxville campus last week for issuing a set of suggestions to employees about how to make workplace holiday parties welcoming to people of all backgrounds. Lawmakers like Rep. John Duncan (R-Tenn.) were upset the university chose inclusivity over promoting religious symbols associated with Christmas. Duncan and other Republicans in Tennessee said UT Knoxville Chancellor Jimmy Cheek should resign because of the memo suggesting that workplace parties on campus be religion-neutral. Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, a Republican, said the flagship university should lose all its state funding over the guidelines. But Tyson House -- which advertises itself as a ministry open to people of all gender identities, sexual orientations, ethnicities and religious backgrounds -- said it doesn't feel threatened by the recommendations.In a letter inviting Duncan and other state lawmakers to a Christmas party held on Sunday, the group wrote: ""Please calm down, have a cookie, and know that Christmas is safe and well at the University of Tennessee.""Here's the full invitation:An Open Letter from Tyson House Episcopal and Lutheran Campus Ministry at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, to the Honorable John Duncan and the State Legislature of TennesseeDuncan's office did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The letter reads, in part:We, the undersigned, as Christian clergy, Tennessee taxpayers, and campus ministers at UTK are disappointed and frustrated by the erroneous claims that diversity at the University of Tennessee, particularly religious diversity, poses any threat to the religious freedom of students, faculty, and staff. By offering university departments suggestions on best practices for ensuring that all their faculty and staff, not just the Christians, feel respected during holiday festivities, the Office of Diversity functioned admirably. To suggest that a publicly funded office remain friendly to all employees is not at all extremist.Students and faculty began circulating their own petitions over the weekend backing the school administration. Tyson House joked on Facebook that students are getting through finals with the motto #‎Calmdownhaveacookie‬.""Want to make it more Christian?"" the group said in one Facebook post.

5,POLITICS,Chicago Case Could Overwhelm Tiny DOJ Unit That Investigates Police Civil Rights Abuses,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chicago-justice-department_us_5665a85ee4b08e945ff005d9,"The Special Litigation Section, which could barely fill a baseball team, conducts civil rights investigations into police departments.",2015-12-07,"The Chicago Police Department is the largest city law enforcement agency that has ever been the subject of a so-called ""pattern or practice"" investigation.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5665ac89210000dd005ac728.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The federal investigation of the Chicago Police Department announced Monday will further stretch the resources of a small unit in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division that, under the Obama administration, is already investigating more local law enforcement agencies than ever before.The Chicago Police Department -- with more than 13,000 sworn full-time officers -- is the largest city law enforcement agency that has ever been the subject of a so-called ""pattern or practice"" investigation that looks at widespread, systemic civil rights violations.The federal government gained powers to investigate the practices of law enforcement agencies and try to implement reforms in the 1990s, in the wake of the beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles. Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department has opened a record 23 pattern and practice investigations in places including New Orleans, Cleveland, Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri. It is currently enforcing 17 agreements with law enforcement agencies and -- as of Monday, with the addition of Chicago -- has eight open investigations.There are more than 12,000 local law enforcement agencies in the United States, with over 600,000 employees working for them full time. But the team of attorneys who work on police matters within the Civil Rights Division's Special Litigation Section could barely field a baseball team: Only about 18 of the few dozen lawyers in the section work on police matters full time.""It's a ridiculously small number of people,"" says Jonathan M. Smith, who until the spring served as head of the Special Litigation Section for over four years. ""These are very large, complicated cases, and it takes thousands of hours to complete the investigations."" DOJ has described pattern or practice investigations as a ""long-term and time-intensive process"" that can last as long as a decade.Smith said the Chicago investigation would be ""enormous"" and require a ""huge amount of work"" in the range of 8,000 to 10,000 total hours. At a press conference announcing the Chicago investigation, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Vanita Gupta, head of the Civil Rights Division, declined to say how long the investigation would take. But Gupta seemed to hint at the resource constraints during a panel at the White House last week, joking ""don't remind me"" when a colleague referred to the small number of lawyers in the Special Litigation Section.The Obama administration's 2016 congressional budget request said the number of ongoing matters combined with the ""increased demand for action on police misconduct"" has ""outstripped the Division’s available resources."" Community groups and public officials were contacting DOJ on ""at least a weekly basis"" to open pattern or practice investigations, and the budget request said preliminary reviews ""identified very serious concerns"" that would benefit from DOJ intervention.""Honestly, it's gonna be a real challenge. The resources for the section have already been limited, and the Obama administration has been much more aggressive,"" says William Yeomans, an American University law professor who spent 26 years at the Justice Department and served as acting head of the Civil Rights Division. ""They are piling up a number of cases, and a number of cases are under investigation. What that means is that Chicago is going to be an enormous challenge. It is an enormous police force, and these investigations by their nature are very labor intensive.""The Obama administration’s renewed focus on pattern or practice cases came after a transition team report found that the Bush administration had “micromanaged” the Special Litigation Section and prevented it from “formulating or pursuing a meaningful agenda” and that under the Bush administration the unit had “not used its authority to address systemic problems of police misconduct.”In the first five years of the Obama administration, the unit opened twice as many police pattern and practice investigations as DOJ had in the prior five years, during the Bush administration. But while the caseload has massively expanded, the number of lawyers working on pattern and practice cases hasn’t expanded.Smith said the Justice Department hasn't had the capacity to look into every police department that may have warranted investigation, and instead has had to focus on cases that could be instructive and have a broader influence in the field of law enforcement. It has required some ""rationing of resources"" in situations where the Justice Department declined to intervene simply because it didn't have the human capital to take on another investigation.""It's important for the division, with limited resources, to make decisions that are strategic and not only just go to where it's bad, because there's a lot of places in this country where policing is bad and where intervention is necessary,"" Smith said.Also on HuffPost:"

8,MEDIA,Why The Country's Largest Minority-Journalism Group May Close,Gabriel Arana,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nabj-minority-journalism-association-crisis_us_564a0118e4b08cda3489ad62,The National Association of Black Journalists is grappling with a massive shortfall -- and none of its leaders will talk about it.,2015-12-07,Then-Sen. Barack Obama at the NABJ's 2007 convention.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564a04161600002d0026d6e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As it prepares to mark its 40th anniversary this week, the National Association of Black Journalists is in trouble.After running a deficit of $227,000 last year, the NABJ -- the country’s oldest and largest minority-journalism group -- told its members in November that it expects to end 2015 even deeper in the red.With an estimated shortfall of $380,000 in a budget of roughly $2.5 million, NABJ has slashed operating expenses, eliminated three staff positions -- including that of Darryl Matthews, its executive director -- and sold off $400,000 worth of its investments. In addition to adopting “zero-based budgeting,” which requires managers to justify all of its expenses, it is considering closing its office in College Park, Maryland, and operating in a virtual capacity. It has hired a consultant to help it weather its funding crisis.“It is not a pretty picture for NABJ,” states an assessment from the group’s finance committee, presented to the board in October. “If NABJ does not increase revenues in 2016, the organization’s financially [sic] viability will threaten the organization’s ability to operate and keep its doors open.”NABJ’s financial woes are worrisome enough. But the secretiveness of the association’s leadership around the shortfall should raise further red flags. NABJ’s board and staff have refused to answer questions about the deficit or provide financial disclosure forms, as required by law. The group is also considering dipping into grant funds earmarked for other purposes to cover the shortfall, according to a report from the organization’s treasurer -- a practice that is widely considered unethical.Despite pledging to “stabilize the association’s financial position with transparency” in a note to members, NABJ Board President Sarah Glover, social media editor for NBC-owned Television Stations, declined multiple requests to elaborate on the source of the shortfall, insisting only that the “2015 convention did not yield the projected revenue as outlined in the budget by the previous board.”The Huffington Post reached out to the former NABJ Board President Bob Butler and half a dozen of the organization’s current board members, including its treasurer, for comment on its finances. None was willing to speak either on or off the record. Multiple calls and emails to the organization’s communications contact went unanswered, as did requests for comment sent individually to all members of NABJ’s current staff.HuffPost requested a copy of NABJ’s most recent 990 filing with the IRS, which the association is required by law to supply, to no avail. Filed annually, the financial disclosure document details, in broad strokes, a nonprofit’s mission, programs and finances. Glover also refused to provide copies of financial reports presented to NABJ’s board in October. While not required to do so, these reports are widely available to NABJ’s 4,100 members. HuffPost was able to obtain both sets of documents independently.This is not the first time the NABJ has run a large deficit. The group faced a shortfall of $612,779 in 2009. But this was followed by several years of substantial surpluses or modest deficits that allowed the group to weather the downturn. The NABJ ended 2010 in the black by $437,727, and by $3,363 in 2011. It faced a modest deficit of $59,633 in 2012, then ran a surplus of $228,831 in 2013 before running into trouble again.Without the input of NABJ’s leadership it is impossible to say with certainty how the organization now finds itself in such a precarious financial position. But its tax filings and committee reports suggest a few reasons.NABJ’s over-reliance on revenue from its annual convention is indeed at least part of the problem. According to an October presentation from the organization’s finance committee, revenue from the event accounts for 50 to 70 percent of its income. “NABJ must reduce its reliance on the convention for revenues,” the organization’s finance committee told the board in October.Diversification is one of the more common funding problems nonprofits face, said Jamie Levine-Daniel, a professor at Indiana University who studies nonprofit management.“If you rely only on one source of revenue and that source of revenue dries up, you find yourself in crisis,” Levine-Daniel says.But it’s no far cry to say the organization has also overspent given its financial position. Denise Clay of All Digitocracy, a blog that reports on technology and communities of color, recently blew the whistle on NABJ’s board for spending nearly $200,000 on travel in three years. Former board president Bob Butler alone spent $41,508 on travel between 2013 and 2014, far outpacing his predecessor Greg Lee, who spent $16,063 during his entire two-year term.The way the organization has proposed to deal with the current shortfall is also ethically questionable.NABJ recently received a $100,000 grant from the Ford Foundation for “strategic planning.” The October treasurer’s report warns that unless the organization finds a way to shore up revenue by year’s end, “the $100,000 Ford Grant funds will need to be used to cover operating expense[s]” with the promise that they will be replaced “once 2016 convention funding support and other revenues are received.”“That’s not ethical,” said Stanley Garstka, a professor at Yale Law School and Yale School of Management who teaches courses about nonprofit management. “If the donor gives them permission, it’s perfectly fine, but if it’s a restricted gift they need to go back to the donor to get permission to change the restriction.”A Ford Foundation spokesman clarified that the NABJ grant money was intended solely to help the organization plan for the future. “While our program team has spoken with NABJ about the financial challenges, there has been no request to un-restrict the funds,” the spokesman said.Financial shortfalls aren’t unusual for nonprofits. According to the Nonprofit Finance Fund’s annual survey, 24 percent of nonprofits reported shortfalls in 2014. But because they don’t have the same access to credit that for-profit companies do, nonprofits must tow close to the financial line. Most nonprofit deficits amount to less that 5 percent of operating expenses in a given year.

Wary of financial and reputational risks, banks often require wealthy board members to backstop nonprofit loans, or require nonprofits to show proof of sustained funding commitments.“A lot of nonprofit boards try to staff themselves with people with deep pockets who really believe in the cause so if they do run into trouble, they can say, ‘Please keep me afloat for a little bit,’” Garstka said.Unfortunately, it seems the pockets of NABJ board members don’t run all that deep. The current board has pledged $7,625 to help address the $380,000 deficit -- a small fraction of what’s needed.NABJ serves an indispensable role in the the journalistic ecosystem -- and its woes come at a time when its leadership is desperately needed.

9,MEDIA,Why The Country's Largest Minority-Journalism Group May Close,Gabriel Arana,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nabj-minority-journalism-association-crisis_us_564a0118e4b08cda3489ad62,The National Association of Black Journalists is grappling with a massive shortfall -- and none of its leaders will talk about it.,2015-12-07,"Former NABJ President Bob Butler spent $41,508 on travel between 2013 and 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56656f3d210000dd005ac6a7.jpeg?ops=crop_302_268_1044_947%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"As it prepares to mark its 40th anniversary this week, the National Association of Black Journalists is in trouble.After running a deficit of $227,000 last year, the NABJ -- the country’s oldest and largest minority-journalism group -- told its members in November that it expects to end 2015 even deeper in the red.With an estimated shortfall of $380,000 in a budget of roughly $2.5 million, NABJ has slashed operating expenses, eliminated three staff positions -- including that of Darryl Matthews, its executive director -- and sold off $400,000 worth of its investments. In addition to adopting “zero-based budgeting,” which requires managers to justify all of its expenses, it is considering closing its office in College Park, Maryland, and operating in a virtual capacity. It has hired a consultant to help it weather its funding crisis.“It is not a pretty picture for NABJ,” states an assessment from the group’s finance committee, presented to the board in October. “If NABJ does not increase revenues in 2016, the organization’s financially [sic] viability will threaten the organization’s ability to operate and keep its doors open.”NABJ’s financial woes are worrisome enough. But the secretiveness of the association’s leadership around the shortfall should raise further red flags. NABJ’s board and staff have refused to answer questions about the deficit or provide financial disclosure forms, as required by law. The group is also considering dipping into grant funds earmarked for other purposes to cover the shortfall, according to a report from the organization’s treasurer -- a practice that is widely considered unethical.Despite pledging to “stabilize the association’s financial position with transparency” in a note to members, NABJ Board President Sarah Glover, social media editor for NBC-owned Television Stations, declined multiple requests to elaborate on the source of the shortfall, insisting only that the “2015 convention did not yield the projected revenue as outlined in the budget by the previous board.”The Huffington Post reached out to the former NABJ Board President Bob Butler and half a dozen of the organization’s current board members, including its treasurer, for comment on its finances. None was willing to speak either on or off the record. Multiple calls and emails to the organization’s communications contact went unanswered, as did requests for comment sent individually to all members of NABJ’s current staff.HuffPost requested a copy of NABJ’s most recent 990 filing with the IRS, which the association is required by law to supply, to no avail. Filed annually, the financial disclosure document details, in broad strokes, a nonprofit’s mission, programs and finances. Glover also refused to provide copies of financial reports presented to NABJ’s board in October. While not required to do so, these reports are widely available to NABJ’s 4,100 members. HuffPost was able to obtain both sets of documents independently.This is not the first time the NABJ has run a large deficit. The group faced a shortfall of $612,779 in 2009. But this was followed by several years of substantial surpluses or modest deficits that allowed the group to weather the downturn. The NABJ ended 2010 in the black by $437,727, and by $3,363 in 2011. It faced a modest deficit of $59,633 in 2012, then ran a surplus of $228,831 in 2013 before running into trouble again.Without the input of NABJ’s leadership it is impossible to say with certainty how the organization now finds itself in such a precarious financial position. But its tax filings and committee reports suggest a few reasons.NABJ’s over-reliance on revenue from its annual convention is indeed at least part of the problem. According to an October presentation from the organization’s finance committee, revenue from the event accounts for 50 to 70 percent of its income. “NABJ must reduce its reliance on the convention for revenues,” the organization’s finance committee told the board in October.Diversification is one of the more common funding problems nonprofits face, said Jamie Levine-Daniel, a professor at Indiana University who studies nonprofit management.“If you rely only on one source of revenue and that source of revenue dries up, you find yourself in crisis,” Levine-Daniel says.But it’s no far cry to say the organization has also overspent given its financial position. Denise Clay of All Digitocracy, a blog that reports on technology and communities of color, recently blew the whistle on NABJ’s board for spending nearly $200,000 on travel in three years. Former board president Bob Butler alone spent $41,508 on travel between 2013 and 2014, far outpacing his predecessor Greg Lee, who spent $16,063 during his entire two-year term.The way the organization has proposed to deal with the current shortfall is also ethically questionable.NABJ recently received a $100,000 grant from the Ford Foundation for “strategic planning.” The October treasurer’s report warns that unless the organization finds a way to shore up revenue by year’s end, “the $100,000 Ford Grant funds will need to be used to cover operating expense[s]” with the promise that they will be replaced “once 2016 convention funding support and other revenues are received.”“That’s not ethical,” said Stanley Garstka, a professor at Yale Law School and Yale School of Management who teaches courses about nonprofit management. “If the donor gives them permission, it’s perfectly fine, but if it’s a restricted gift they need to go back to the donor to get permission to change the restriction.”A Ford Foundation spokesman clarified that the NABJ grant money was intended solely to help the organization plan for the future. “While our program team has spoken with NABJ about the financial challenges, there has been no request to un-restrict the funds,” the spokesman said.Financial shortfalls aren’t unusual for nonprofits. According to the Nonprofit Finance Fund’s annual survey, 24 percent of nonprofits reported shortfalls in 2014. But because they don’t have the same access to credit that for-profit companies do, nonprofits must tow close to the financial line. Most nonprofit deficits amount to less that 5 percent of operating expenses in a given year. NABJ’s deficit this year amounts to just over 15 percent.The fact that NABJ is even considering dipping into grant funds reflects how difficult it is for nonprofits to get access to credit -- whether there’s a crisis or not.Nonprofits don’t accrue debt for a simple reason: Banks don’t like to lend them money. Faced with a sharp deficit, they must deal with the shortfall without resorting to borrowing, which is why a large deficit in a year or two can be so catastrophic.“It’s tougher than heck for a nonprofit to get a loan to fund operations -- it just doesn’t happen,” Garstka said. “Banks just can’t give their money away in very risky situations.”Nonprofits even have trouble getting mortgages, Garstka explains.

Off-duty Pike County officer Joel Jenkins was in his home and allegedly intoxicated when he struck Jason Brady, 40, in the head with a single bullet on Thursday night. The department had not issued Jenkins the weapon used in the shooting, the sheriff's office has said.Instead of calling 911, Jenkins called a line at the sheriff's department to report that his neighbor had been shot, according to the Chillicothe Gazette. Later, the deputy allegedly told state investigators that the gun accidentally discharged while he was showing it to Brady.Jenkins has been charged with involuntary manslaughter. Jenkins was involved in the March 28 fatal shooting of 26-year-old Robert Rooker, who allegedly had driven recklessly and at high speeds while refusing to pull over. Jenkins and two other officers chased Rooker for 10 to 15 minutes before opening fire.During a stint of paid administrative leave after that shooting, Jenkins sought mental health treatment, the Chillicothe Gazette reported. A grand jury is scheduled to meet Thursday to review the March shooting.Jenkins remained in jail on Monday, according to information from the county jail.

Marquez has not been charged with any crime.Four neighbors interviewed on Saturday said that Marquez was a good friend of Farook.Farook, 28, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 29, most recently lived in Redlands, a community about 30 miles (48 km) northeast of Riverside. The couple died in a shootout with police hours after their attack on a party for civil servants in nearby San Bernardino.U.S. authorities are investigating the shootings as an act of terrorism, and on Saturday Islamic State said the couple were followers of the militant group.NBC News reported the house that was searched is home to a man who authorities believe bought the assault rifles Farook and Malik used in the attack.A FRIENDSHIPSandie Emperador, 30, said she saw Marquez and Farook working together on many occasions fixing cars in Farook's garage.Another neighbor, who declined to give her name, said she regularly saw Marquez visit Farook in his home and often saw the two of them laughing together, but that the friendship seemed to end abruptly about three years ago.Around that time, she said, she was surprised to see them both standing on the street one day without acknowledging one another. After that, she said, she did not see them together again.Several neighbors said they noticed about two years ago that Farook had begun wearing traditional Pakistani clothing - a long tunic and an Islamic prayer cap. He also began growing his beard out.Neighbor Phyllis Hoops, 80, said she often saw the Farook family taking a walk together in the evenings. She said they did not associate with other people in the neighborhood except for Marquez, but that he and Farook would often spend entire days working on cars together.According to public records, Farook and Malik moved to a townhouse in Redlands in August.Emperador said she had not seen Marquez around the neighborhood for several months.Maria Gutierrez, 56, who lives next door to the house that was raided, said FBI agents evacuated her and her family from their house at 1:30 a.m. on Saturday in preparation for the raid.The neighbor who did not want to give her name said the search lasted until roughly 9 a.m., and that the agents used a blow torch and had dogs with them. At one point, she said, she saw two people she knew to be living in the house standing on the front lawn in handcuffs. She did not see Marquez.Part of the garage door was torn apart and a window to the garage was broken at the house that neighbors said was searched by federal agents.
