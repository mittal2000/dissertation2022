It almost goes without saying that when you combine alcohol and drugs and raging hormones and the experiences of 18 to 22 years old, it’s probably unrealistic to think that these kinds of things are never going to happen.Let’s make this clear: Alcohol, drugs, “raging hormones,” and the “experiences” a college student face do not cause rape. A perpetrator taking advantage of an intoxicated person causes rape. Putting substance usage and “raging hormones” at the forefront as to why rape occurs leads to victim-blaming, which then serves to diminish the sickening reality of a perpetrator’s crime. To say that “we are very committed as a group of 10 schools to eradicating sexual assault” and immediately follow up by stating that commitment isn’t actually realistic because college kids like to drink, do drugs and party, is highly contradictory. And, from Bowlsby’s position, it’s irresponsible. One would hope that the Big 12 commissioner would attempt to gain an understanding of campus sexual assault dynamics beyond the popular yet misguided and highly contrived “reasons” why campus rape happens. One would hope that, as a man with daughters, he’d know better. One would hope that the Big 12 commissioner, of all people, would educate himself in light of Baylor’s sexual assault scandal, because it’s literally part of his job.In June, Bowlsby demanded Baylor hand over all documents from its independent investigation of its football program’s sexual assault allegations. The May release of the university’s report from the investigation resulted in Baylor President Ken Starr and head football coach Art Briles’ resignations, but was criticized for it’s limited transparency.Bowlsby told Sports Illustrated that he knows more about the scandal than the public does after meeting with the school’s administration. But he hasn’t released any additional information.If the Big 12 chooses to reveal more graphic or disturbing details beyond the cursory Baylor report, Bowlsby must learn why and how campus sexual assault actually happens, or else he’ll simply view and disseminate that information from the same ill-informed lens. When the men at the top don’t understand campus sexual assault, that’s how rape culture perpetuates. Right now, Bowlsby is one of those men. "
1,BUSINESS,Donald Trump Reportedly Wants An Ex-Goldman Exec To Be Treasury Secretary,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-treasury-goldman-sachs_us_578e7005e4b0f180da6321dd,"Take that, establishment!",2016-07-19,Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578e7974190000ac038a70fa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump, the political outsider running a renegade campaign for president, has a fresh idea about who should head the Treasury Department: an ex-Goldman Sachs executive.Fortune’s Dan Primack reports that Anthony Scaramucci, a Trump fundraiser and hedge fund salesman, says Trump has told potential donors that if he is elected he wants to nominate Steve Mnuchin, his campaign’s finance chairman, to be Treasury secretary.Mnuchin is the co-CEO and co-founder of Dune Capital Management, a hedge fund. He worked at Goldman Sachs for 17 years and left in 2002. Mnuchin’s father, Robert, was a partner at Goldman Sachs before retiring to run an art gallery. In 2004, Steve started Dune Capital with funding from George Soros, the progressive trader, philanthropist and boogeyman to conservative conspiracy theorists everywhere.If hiring a former Goldman Sachs executive to run fundraising efforts was an odd choice for Trump, who’d bragged that self-funding his campaign made him immune to special interests, then daydreaming about appointing the same person Treasury secretary ― presumably to woo donors ― only amplifies the absurdity. In truth, Trump was never fully self-funding his presidential bid, and his campaign staff is increasingly stocked with lobbyists.Were Mnuchin appointed secretary of the Treasury, he’d be the third Goldman alum to hold the post. Robert Rubin served as secretary for four years during the Clinton administration, and Hank Paulson spent the last two and a half years of George W. Bush’s presidency in the position.Trump has previously said that activist investor Carl Icahn, a pioneer of the hostile takeover in the 1980s, would be his Treasury secretary. Icahn initially declined Trump’s offer before deciding that actually, he would like to run the Treasury in a Trump administration.Scaramucci did not respond to a request for comment.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
2,IMPACT,Violence Against Homeless People Is On Decline In U.S.: Report,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/attacks-against-homeless-people-are-on-decline-in-us-report_us_5789419ae4b08608d3348cf3,"The report, however, comes amid a recent spate of gruesome attacks against homeless people.",2016-07-19,"Police investigate the scene under a highway overpass where another apparent attack by a serial killer targeting homeless men took place overnight in San Diego, California United States, July 15, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578944b119000026008a67e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Violence against homeless people is on the decline in the U.S., but the nature of such crimes hasn’t changed much, according to a new report.Last year, there were 77 reported attacks against homeless people, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless (NCH). That’s down from 122 victims in 2014.While the drop is bolstering news, advocates say that the crimes are just as heinous as ever.In San Diego, for example, a 36-year-old man was arrested earlier this month in connection to four attacks on homeless people. Two were killed – one burned to death, the other beaten to death ― and two were severely injured, according to CNN. Last month, a high school cheerleader was charged in connection with the murder of a homeless man near San Diego, Fox New reported. In April, two brothers allegedly tied up George Lowery, 50, who lived in a makeshift camp, robbed him and beat him. He died four days later.That these crimes happened in such close proximity to one another isn’t all that surprising, according to the new report.A quarter of all attacks against homeless people in 2014 and 2015 happened in California, the most of any other state. Florida had the second most crimes committed against homeless people. The National Coalition for the Homeless said it continues to analyze and release this data in an effort to demonstrate why homeless people need increased protections and to encourage lawmakers to commit to combatting such hate crimes.The FBI currently doesn’t recognize protected status for people experiencing homelessness.But advocates say the nature of a homeless person’s situation makes him more susceptible to getting attacked.“Without shelter, the homeless population is particularly vulnerable to both the elements of nature and the abuses of society,” the report noted.A number of states, however, including California and Florida, have classified attacks against homeless people as hate crimes. Such categorization is important because it comes with heavier sentencing. NCH says that changing general attitudes toward homeless people is just as critical when it comes to fostering an environment of reduced violence.“Many attacks occur because they are simply dehumanized in the bigoted minds of violent offenders,” the reported noted. “Targeted violence against the homeless further isolates and degrades them individually and communally while diminishing their collective sense of security.”"

4,POLITICS,How Trump's Student Loan Plan Would Impact College Students,"Matt Krupnick, The Hechinger Report",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-student-loans_us_578d1905e4b0c53d5cfa6531,The proposal could increase the cost of liberal arts degrees.,2016-07-19,Cleveland State University President Ronald Berkman.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578e34622400002600b31dfc.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During the Republican and Democratic conventions, The Hechinger Report will publish a new story each day, examining what the party proposals might mean for the future of education. Our staff reporters will provide education coverage from Cleveland and Philadelphia.KENT, Ohio — Kambiz Ghazinour would love to persuade more of his Kent State University computer science students to go on to graduate school, but they’re so in demand that most of them head straight into the job market.“As soon as possible, they join the workforce and pay back their student loans, and I don’t blame them,” said Ghazinour, an assistant professor who teaches data privacy and related topics on this campus less than 40 miles from where the Republicans will hold their national convention this month.The fact that computer science grads are more likely to have jobs waiting could give them advantages over their classmates if presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump is elected president.Echoing bipartisan calls for stricter accountability at colleges whose graduates are not always prepared for the working world, the Trump campaign has proposed tying student loan decisions to borrowers’ job prospects — an assessment that likely would be based on a student’s major.Private banks and colleges would make those decisions together, Sam Clovis, a co-chair of Trump’s campaign and an economics professor at Iowa’s Morningside College, said in an interview.Computer scientists probably would have little trouble borrowing money, but French majors might encounter challenges. Banks would be free to tailor loans based on students’ career paths, Clovis said. He emphasized that the main idea is to give borrowers better information about whether they’ll be able to pay back their loans.“You need to have a very clear picture of the actuaries in your field,” Clovis said of students. “If they choose to borrow the money, they have to pay it back. It’s that simple.”Related: In era of high costs, humanities come under attack The idea comes as Congress, the White House and others try to prod colleges into being more transparent about graduates’ job prospects.In some ways, Trump’s proposal is “a centrist Republican and Democratic position,” said Anthony Carnevale, a Georgetown University economics professor and director of Georgetown’s Center on Education and the Workforce.“If you ask the public what’s most important in higher education, they say two things: ‘What does it cost?’ and ‘Will my kid get a job?’ ”And while the unemployment rate for all new bachelor’s degree recipients dropped from 7.1 percent in March 2011 to 4.2 percent in March 2016, for new arts, law and public policy graduates it was 8.5 percent, according to Carnevale and fellow Georgetown researcher Ban Cheah. Meanwhile, the jobless rate for recent graduates in health fields dropped to 4.6 percent. The figures are from 2014, the most recent available.That last number bodes well for 18-year-old Rachel Dalton, an incoming nursing student at Kent State. But while Trump’s plan would make it easy for Dalton to borrow money, she said her artist friends shouldn’t suffer just because they’re following their dreams.“To me, college is all about becoming an adult,” Dalton said outside a Kent State dining hall as she took a break from summer freshman orientation on the Ohio campus. “There’s a lot more than just getting an education. If people want to do astrophysics or fashion, they should do what they want.”Some advocates for the liberal arts agree that connecting employment and financial aid would unfairly target the humanities, in which graduates’ unemployment numbers tend to be higher and income lower than those of their peers immediately after graduation.But while a history major might have trouble finding a job right out of school, these advocates say, his or her degree may end up paying off years later.By the time they’re at the peak of their careers, in their mid-50s, people who majored as undergraduates in the humanities or social sciences earn about $2,000 a year more than their classmates who majored in professional or pre-professional fields, a report by the Association of American Colleges and Universities found. About 40 percent of humanities undergrads go on to get advanced degrees, the report said, further boosting their incomes.“You really don’t know the value of your degree until 20 to 30 years out,” said Kent State Provost Todd Diacon, noting that his Latin American history degree did not bring in a sizable salary until he became a university administrator. “I’m skeptical of our ability to predict. I try not to pick winners.”Related: While liberal arts decline in U.S., China and other economic rivals add them At Cleveland’s Case Western Reserve University, history associate professor Gillian Weiss routinely invites physicians, CEOs and lawyers who majored in the humanities to visit with current students who she said need to see that a humanities degree opens doors to just about any field.“Part of the purpose of a liberal arts education is to learn to think about the world,” Weiss said, calling the Trump employment-based financial aid proposal “incredibly short-sighted.” Many lower-income students already feel pressure to go into fields with high employment, she said, even though they might want to study history or literature. “There’s already a class differential in who feels the luxury to study what they want to study.”Case Western chemistry professor Alfred Anderson was even more blunt in his disdain for the idea: “I think people should do what they want. It’s a free country.”Just a few blocks from where Republicans will gather to choose a candidate, Cleveland State University has embraced its role in the Ohio economy as the trainer of a skilled workforce by focusing on health fields and other disciplines with high employment demand. The school recently axed low-enrollment departments such as geology in favor of programs like criminal justice, President Ronald Berkman said.Related: Study backs liberal arts, but questions graduates’ competenceBut while Berkman said he sees merit in another Trump proposal to return student lending to private banks rather than leaving it to the federal government, he said he worries about the consequences of going so far as to tie those loans to students’ majors.“No student who is qualified to go to a university should be denied a chance to attend on the basis that they can’t afford to pay,” he said in his office on the urban campus. “Personally, I wouldn’t want my kid, because they’re a history major, to have less opportunity than other students.”Scores of educators, experts and politicians have argued that colleges at least need to do a better job of telling potential students about the likely payoffs of their degrees. If a student and their family are paying tens of thousands of dollars per year to study anthropology, they should have some idea about the job prospects.That information just isn’t available at most schools, said Mamie Voight, director of policy research at the Institute for Higher Education Policy in Washington. But it should be, she said.“It’s important to improve the data we have available for students to know the return on investment so they can make better decisions,” she said. “It’s important for students to go in with their eyes open.”Majors without apparent career payoffs have been a particular target of some Republicans. The Republican governors of Florida, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Kentucky have publicly questioned whether taxpayers should subsidize humanities disciplines. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, during his own campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, said there was a greater need for welders than philosophers.On Ohio campuses as the convention neared, few students seemed worried about their post-graduation outlooks.Related: The surprising institutions that refuse to drop the liberal arts Case Western Reserve senior Evangelina Din, 21, is majoring in cognitive science and psychology with a pre-med focus. Although she’s long wanted to be a doctor, she said she’s not stressing out about jobs.“I’m not worried at all,” she said during a break in a quiet campus lounge. “If medical school doesn’t work out, I know I have other options.”Across town at Cleveland State, 22-year-old senior Shane Shertzer said he became an accounting major mostly because of the job possibilities.“It definitely played a big part,” he said on a campus that had largely cleared out for summer break. “Everybody talked about how accountants make big money.”This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

According to sources, Sizemore was apprehended on Tuesday morning in Los Angeles after the LAPD received multiple calls from a woman in distress. When the police arrived, Sizemore’s girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face and on the head in the midst of a heated argument. In 2003, the 54-year-old actor was convicted for physically abusing his former girlfriend, “Hollywood Madam” Heidi Fleiss. “The whole thing is very ugly to me,” Fleiss reportedly told The Associated Press at the time. “I loved that man and I was very good to him, and what he did to me was wrong.”He was then sentenced to six months in jail after completing a drug treatment program, as Sizemore has struggled to remain sober since his early teen years. The judge later allowed him to cut the sentence in half, on the condition that he enter rehab. “I have permitted my personal demons to take over my life,” Sizemore wrote in a letter at the time. “I do not want to make excuses but I am convinced that if I had not been under the influence of drugs, I would have controlled my behavior.” Sizemore currently remains in police custody.We have reached out to Sizemore’s representatives and will update this post accordingly.

In a statement sent to The Huffington Post Tuesday, Huang’s attorney, Daniel S. Le, said his client has denied abusing the woman and identified her as a former family friend.Le further vowed that Huang “will be vindicated through our system of justice.”Washington County Attorney Pete Orput has meanwhile slammed the incident as “nothing less than slavery in the 21st century.”“We are determined, as part of this office’s Major Prosecution unit, to attack this issue just as we have attacked sex trafficking of juveniles,” he added in a statement.According to a criminal complaint obtained by the Pioneer Press, the victim, who is not being identified because of the nature of the crime, told police that Huang hired her this past spring while living in Shanghai.The nanny flew over to live with Huang and her family in March with the expectation of receiving $890 a month in pay along with room and board.Police say the woman appears not to have received any of the money but was instead savagely beaten and treated like an animal while forced to cook, clean and care for Huang’s children.When the nanny asked to return home to China, Huang allegedly took away her passport and told her “she was ‘not going anywhere,’” prosecutors stated in a release.After a series of violent attacks – including one in which she allegedly was forced to crawl on the ground like a dog ― the woman managed to flee the home after Huang allegedly threatened to stab her to death with a knife after the nanny accidentally spilled food.A later medical examination revealed that she had suffered broken ribs and a broken sternum and was underweight. The woman said she was given rationed crackers and scraps for meals.During a search of Huang’s home, police confirmed finding the nanny’s passport in Huang’s purse. They also found a bag of hair beneath a mattress in the home which the nanny said Huang had ripped out of her head.In a statement Monday, Woodbury authorities thanked the public for their show of support to the nanny.“Both state and county victim advocates have been coordinating the resources needed for immediate care and continued support,” their Facebook post read.Woodbury Police Public Information Officer Michelle Okada told HuffPost that details on the woman’s current conditions are not being released but that she is “by no means in critical condition.”“We do, as an agency, feel comfortable that she is being helped to get back on her feet,” she said.Okada noted that both Huang and the alleged victim in this case came to the U.S. legally.Huang was jailed on $350,000 bail that has conditions including her wearing an ankle monitor and surrendering her passport.Her charges include labor trafficking, false imprisonment, second- and third-degree assault and unlawfully taking another person’s passport."

Harris is running against longtime Rep. Loretta Sanchez, who is also a Democrat. California has a “jungle” primary system, in which the top-two vote getters in the race advance to the general election regardless of their party affiliation. Since the Golden State adopted the system in 2010, many primaries in the heavily blue-leaning state have resulted in contests pitting one Democrat against another. The White House endorsements give Harris, a longtime Obama ally, an important boost over Sanchez as the general election approaches.“Kamala Harris fights for us,” Obama said in a statement released Tuesday. “That’s why I’m so proud to endorse her for United States Senator. And if you send her to the Senate, she’ll be a fearless fighter for the people of California ― all the people of California ― every single day.”Obama previously endorsed Harris in her 2010 bid to become California attorney general.Biden said in his endorsement that he first got to know Harris when his son Beau was serving as Delaware’s Attorney General.“I saw them take on big banks, lift up the voices of working people, and protect women and children from abuse and violence,” he said. “Beau always supported her, and I’m proud to support her candidacy for the United States Senate. I served in the Senate and have worked my entire career with Senators from both parties. Today’s Senate needs people like her ― leaders who will always fight to make a difference and who never forget where they come from.”Prominent Democrats including California Gov. Jerry Brown, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom have also endorsed Harris.Sanchez, meanwhile, is looking to build a coalition of Hispanic and Republican voters. Several well-known Republicans have endorsed her, including conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt and former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.Regardless of the outcome, the election is poised to be historic. If elected, Harris would be the first South Asian-American in the Senate and the first black woman elected to the chamber in over 20 years, while Sanchez would be the Senate’s first Latina. HuffPost Pollster, which tracks all publicly available opinion polls, shows Harris with a significant lead over Sanchez:"
8,COLLEGE,College Presidents In Cleveland Would Rather Not Talk About Donald Trump,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/college-presidents-donald-trump_us_578ceeaee4b0fa896c3f490f,Most have nothing to say about the man being nominated for president in their city.,2016-07-19,"Unlike the candidate himself, Cleveland's academic leaders have very little to say about Donald Trump.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578d001519000026008a6c98.jpeg?cache=xLBr6qKRKx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s hard not to have an opinion about Donald Trump. He has proposed building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border; called for deporting American citizens who are the children of undocumented immigrants; argued for banning all Muslims from entering the country; mocked a physically disabled journalist; praised Kim Jong Un, Saddam Hussein and Vladimir Putin; and claimed U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel couldn’t preside fairly over a Trump University fraud case because of his Mexican heritage. Trump has lied often. He has repeatedly claimed that President Barack Obama was not born in Hawaii, despite the release of Obama’s birth certificate. In short, the Republicans’ chosen man has an unfavorable rating of 60.5 percent for good reason. People in academia might have a special reason to look askance at Trump. He has expressed doubt about the value of experts ― that is, people who really study a subject. And he’s not a big reader, as The Washington Post points out.But that doesn’t mean those leading America’s colleges and universities are willing to step up and offer their opinion on Trump.The Huffington Post reached out to college presidents in Cleveland about the man set to receive the Republican presidential nomination in their city this week. We asked if they would like to comment on Trump’s language and proposals, whether they approve of Trump, or if they think he’s worthy of the U.S. presidency. The answer was mostly silence.Barbara Snyder, president of Case Western Reserve University, which is housing hundreds of security personnel for the Republican National Convention, declined to comment.Staff for Cleveland State University President Ronald Berkman said they did not hear back about his availability. Cleveland Institute of Music President Paul Hogle declined to weigh in on Trump. Cuyahoga Community College President Alex Johnson, John Carroll University President Rev. Robert L. Niehoff and Ursuline College President Sr. Christine De Vinne did not respond to requests to comment. The one exception was Grafton J. Nunes, president and CEO of the Cleveland Institute of Art. “While I sit in open-mouthed amazement at Mr. Trump’s achievement in apparently winning his party’s nomination, I must say I am no fan of the form or substance of his positions,” Nunes said in a statement to HuffPost.“I see his campaign as cynically playing on the fears and anger of working-class Americans economically dislocated by global markets and alienated by changing demographics,” Nunes continued. “But where he would build walls to control and restrict, as an educator and artist I must build bridges of welcome to empower and engage; where he promises security through exclusion, I am obligated to promote people being comfortable with being uncomfortable through understanding multiple viewpoints. Where he mocks the disabled and castigates the different, I see it as my duty to celebrate and embrace them.”Nunes said, “I have spent 45 years informing and moving people in schools, theaters, galleries and print with a commitment to respecting truth in its multiple dimensions with intellectual honesty and emotional responsibility. I have yet to detect those values from Mr. Trump.”Beyond Nunes, there have been a few academic voices speaking out against Trump.Esteemed history professors recently banded together with noted historians to warn against him. During this year’s graduation season, both Republican and Democratic commencement speakers made it a point to denounce Trump and his offensive statements. And some college leaders have made public statements this year condemning Trump’s comments. One example is the president of Dordt College, the Christian school in Iowa where Trump once joked that he could shoot someone and get away with it.“Today’s comment by Mr. Trump regarding the loyalty of his followers, namely that ‘I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters,’ went far beyond a broad-brush promise about his policies or plans for our country,” Dordt College President Erik Hoekstra said in January. “In no way do I, nor does the college, support such an odd and inappropriate comment. I have no concept of why Mr. Trump thought that was an apt example to highlight the loyalty of his followers.”Dr. Everett Piper, the president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, was celebrated by conservatives last year for his statements criticizing students who want “safe spaces” on campus. Trump is often touted as someone who disavows “political correctness.” But that doesn’t mean Piper considers Trump someone who is “on my side.”“Anyone who calls women ‘pigs,’ ‘ugly,’ ‘fat’ and ‘pieces of a–’ is not on my side. Anyone who mocks the handicapped is not on my side,” Piper wrote in a blog post in January. “Anyone who has argued the merits of a government takeover of banks, student loans, the auto industry and healthcare is not on my side. Anyone who has been on the cover of Playboy and proud of it, who brags of his sexual history with multiple women and who owns strip clubs in his casinos is not on my side.”Brian Rosenberg, president of Macalester College in Minnesota, wrote in April that it can feel unnatural for heads of colleges to speak out about politics, but that Trump’s comments and proposed policies are “antithetical to the mission of higher education.”“A higher education president who opposes some of the offensive behavior that Trump engages in or the policies he promotes might run the risk of being too outspoken,” Rosenberg wrote. “But passively observing Trump creates a risk that is in my view much greater: that of failing to speak when the values most important to the institution within one’s care are imperiled.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S.______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter who covers higher education and is based in New York.

During his senior of high school, she, too, was shot to death. Now, Dunn is calling for a focus on family and children as a way to fight gun violence.The former running back released a statement Sunday night just hours after the shootings, expressing his sorrow for the families of victims in Baton Rouge. In his statement, he made it clear that “we can’t just sit around and talk.”Instead, he said, the country must start taking action. For Dunn, that action means supporting his child:“One of the things I am doing is taking the role of fatherhood very seriously so I can raise a son who makes a positive contribution. I am striving to be there for him emotionally, physically and intellectually ... because the statistics proves it makes a difference when a child has an active father in his or her life. And we have to do more to build empathy ... It all starts with kids, so we all have to care about kids. Especially kids at risk for never learning how to socially and emotionally relate.”Dunn’s suggestions were not limited to his own family, however. He called on elected leaders to give meaning to the phrase “crime doesn’t pay” by challenging the status quo to ensure laws are upheld and loopholes or sophisticated lawyering are impeded. In his final request for the people of his hometown, Dunn wrote: “I’d ask the community to stop the violence, to cool down and to come together to figure this out.”These comments come at an emotional time for the former football player. Dunn will be attending a re-sentencing hearing Wednesday for Kevan Brumfield, the man convicted of killing his mother over 20 years ago. "

11,POLITICS,Ohio's Abortion Restrictions Drove This Woman To Desperate Measures. The GOP Wants All States To Be Like Ohio.,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/abortion-ohio-republican-national-convention_us_578e54ebe4b0d3d4c0486889,"A mother of two had to resort to stripping to raise enough money to end her pregnancy in Cleveland, where Republicans are holding their convention.",2016-07-19,"Ohio, the site of the Republican National Convention, has enacted 18 new abortion restrictions since 2011.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578e74e6190000aa038a70dd.jpeg?cache=HEGBDNDr9Q&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― Ariana M. was living in a homeless shelter here with her two children in 2011 when she became pregnant.She was 25 at the time, working part-time at a temp agency to feed her sons, then 4 and 8, and trying to finish school to become a medical assistant phlebotomist. The decision to have an abortion was an easy one for her, but the slew of anti-abortion laws in Ohio made her experience a nightmare. “I had to have an ultrasound, which I did not want,” said Ariana, who asked that her full last name be withheld to protect her privacy. “I had to wait 24 hours after meeting with a doctor to make a decision, and that drove me crazy, because I was 100 percent ready. But I had to take off work and school to see the doctor, go back to the shelter for two days and think about it, and then take off work and school again.” The $390 abortion was both financially and emotionally burdensome for Ariana. In addition to paying for the actual procedure, she gave up work hours to visit the clinic twice and had to pay for transportation both times. She was barely earning enough in her temp job to feed herself and her children, so she had to resort to desperate measures. “I stripped to make $200,” she said. She then showed up at the clinic and asked the woman at the counter if she could help her, even though she only had enough money to cover half the cost of the procedure.Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) has signed 18 abortion and reproductive health restrictions into law since he took office in 2011, more than nearly every other governor during that time period. The state requires women to have ultrasounds, even when they’re medically unnecessary, and to wait 24 hours after meeting with a doctor before getting the procedure. Kasich signed a law prohibiting abortion coverage in private insurance plans purchased through state health exchanges, and the state has enacted so many regulations on abortion clinics that nearly half of them have shut down. Kasich also signed a bill― currently blocked pending a court battle― that would defund Planned Parenthood.As the Republican Party holds its national convention in Cleveland this week and emphasizes an opposition to abortion rights and Planned Parenthood funding in its platform, reproductive rights advocates are warning that the whole country could start to look like Ohio if presumptive nominee Donald Trump wins the presidency in November. “It’s fitting that the Republican Party chose this state as the place to hold the Republican National Convention,” Planned Parenthood’s political advocacy arm wrote in a memo to supporters. “Ohio’s policies are just a preview of what all of America would look like if Donald Trump and the RNC leadership got its way this election. Donald Trump has promised to block access to Planned Parenthood, appoint judges that will overturn Roe v. Wade, and has said that women should be punished for accessing abortion.”While Trump has struggled throughout the election to articulate his position on reproductive rights, his choice of a running mate cleared up any confusion. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) has led the fight against legal abortion in America since he threatened to shut down the federal government over Planned Parenthood funding as a congressman in 2011. With Pence by his side, Trump would likely appoint anti-abortion judges and sign whatever restriction on the procedure that hit his desk.Ariana was ultimately able to have a safe abortion because the Preterm Clinic in Cleveland gave her financial assistance. She is now out of the homeless shelter and working as an advocate for abortion rights at the clinic that helped her.She said it makes her angry to see Republican politicians convening in Cleveland to push for more laws like the ones that made her life more difficult when she was pregnant, poor and desperate. “They don’t know what real people go through,” she said. CORRECTION: An earlier version wrongly stated that Ohio banned all private insurers from covering abortion. The ban only applies to private insurance plans purchased through the state health exchange. "

15,POLITICS,"At Trump's Convention, It's George W. Bush's Legacy That's On Trial",Sam Stein and Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-george-bush-convention_us_578e5814e4b07c722ebc5989,When will the 43rd president return to his party's main stage?,2016-07-19,Trump has made it clear: This is not Bush's Republican Party anymore.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― This is Donald Trump’s convention; that much is certain. But the man not too far from the conversation, whose legacy hangs like a cold fog over the proceedings, is hundreds of miles away, with no plans to show up. For the third time in a row, George W. Bush is skipping his party’s convention ― a remarkable string of absences for the man who once ruled the Republican Party. But what it actually says about the state of the GOP and the former president himself is a topic of sharp disagreement here in Cleveland.This much is certain. At the highest levels of the Trump campaign, the Bush family is viewed with hostility. Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort could barely finish his perfunctory niceties on Monday morning ― “We would have liked to have them [here]” ― before dropping the diplomatic facade: “They do not reflect the broad strokes of the Republican Party.”Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and nearly vice presidential nominee, was more biting. “The reason people nominated Donald Trump is because they weren’t happy and, frankly, I think the Bushes are behaving childishly,” Gingrich said Sunday in an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. “Jeb lost. Get over it.”In the convention halls, the absence of the Bush family has sparked a more nuanced reaction, a mix of disappointment, anger, sympathy and indifference. Some felt that the former president let ego get ahead of his party’s future. “He should be here,” said Soraya Zamora, a delegate from Texas. “He was a president of the United States and he has been a leader of this party. He should be here as well. This is not about Donald Trump. This is about the Republican Party and showing everybody that we can manage ourselves and put things aside for the good of the party. Not just the good of the party. For the good of the country.” Others felt that George W. Bush deserved the scorn. “I think he did everything wrong ― everything wrong from 9/11, when he should have shut the borders down, and he did not. That was the beginning of the end,” said Cathy Reilly, a retired teacher from New York, a state that Trump carried by an overwhelming margin in the Republican primary.But there were also those who saw Bush’s decision to stay away as a virtue ― emblematic of a man who is content, even eager, to be done with politics in his post-presidency.“I’ll be honest with you. Had I gone through what President Bush had gone through, I probably would have my belly full and said, ‘You know what, I don’t need this,’” said Nelson Spear, who served on a Secret Service detail when Bush came to New Mexico in 2004. “If somebody is addicted to peanuts, and they just have to eat peanuts all the time ― if you just have your belly full, sometimes you can have one too many peanuts and say, ‘Man, I’m never going to have a peanut again.’”Even with the GOP primary all but over, Trump himself has shown few signs of letting up his attacks on the former president. He regularly speaks out against the Iraq War (even though he initially supported it) and turned heads earlier this month when he praised Saddam Hussein for being “good” at killing terrorists. Bush’s allies, still smarting from the time Trump faulted the former president for failing to prevent the 9/11 terror attacks, have found this behavior repugnant. His treatment of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush during the primary only crystallized that opinion. Jeb Bush, through a spokesperson, declined comment.Delegates in Cleveland sympathized with George W. Bush for having had to watch his brother get beaten up and his own record attacked during the primary campaign. But they did so even as they echoed some of the criticisms that Trump has leveled at the former president, from the increase in the national debt under his watch, to the decision to invade Iraq, to the government surveillance state that emerged after 9/11.“For the most part, I’m a fan [of Bush],” said Texas delegate Sue Stringer, who nevertheless criticized his record on civil liberties. Asked if Trump had been fair to the 43rd president, she responded, “No. I don’t think Trump has been fair to anybody.” “In a primary situation, all is fair in war. Most of the time, they move on from the primary. I think the day will come when the Bushes and Donald Trump will put this behind them,” said New York delegate Doug Colety, the chair of the Westchester Republican County Committee.Bush certainly isn’t the first former president to deal with a diminished standing after he left office. But his distance from his party’s convention is historically remarkable. Jimmy Carter showed up, although he was given only a brief acknowledgment during the 1984 and 1988 Democratic conventions. In 1992, as Carter’s image slowly began to recover, Democrats invited him to address the gathering. He did not speak again until the 2004 convention, however. Herbert Hoover, having ushered in the Great Depression, still attended his party confabs after he left the White House. He went to the 1936 Republican convention, which was also held in Cleveland. And he just kept on going every four years until 1960.With this year’s absence, there will be at least 16 years between the last time and the next time George W. Bush shows his face at a Republican convention. Should Trump win the presidency, that the absence could extend to 20 or more. When he ultimately does come back, however, the expectation is that the slights, hurt feelings and tensions will be minor footnotes.“If he showed up, he’d be given an overwhelming welcome,” said David Keene, a longtime conservative activist. “I think [Trump and Manafort] would cheer him too.” "
16,THE WORLDPOST,How A Zimbabwean Pastor's Peaceful Resistance Shook Mugabe’s Regime,Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/evan-mawarire-zimbabwe_us_5788023ce4b0867123e082ca,Evan Mawarire's viral video inspired the largest protests against the 92-year-old autocrat in a decade.,2016-07-19,President Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace at his lavish 92nd birthday party in February.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578e75d5190000aa038a70e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: July, 27 ― Evan Mawarire said on July 26 he will not return to Zimbabwe from South Africa out of fears for his and his family’s safety. Amnesty International warned that the pastor’s life is at risk. PREVIOUSLYThe greatest challenge to Zimbabwe’s aging, autocratic President Robert Mugabe in years started with a viral video.Over the years, 92-year-old Mugabe and his henchmen have crushed protests, regime defectors and the political opposition.Yet, the regime is now struggling to counter a social movement ignited by a charismatic pastor who advocates for non-violence and cites India’s Mahatma Gandhi as an inspiration.Evan Mawarire, a 39-year-old pastor in the capital city Harare, was best known for his videos giving marriage and relationship advice until April, when he posted a patriotic rant online that set Zimbabwean social networks on fire.Mawarire, struggling to pay the school fees for his two daughters, says he was fed up with the injustice, corruption and poverty ruining the lives or ordinary Zimbabweans. The country had just celebrated independence day, and the sight of the national flag in his office made Mawarire think about the broken promises it symbolized.“They tell us that the green is for the vegetation and for the crops. I don’t see any crops in my country,” Mawaire said in the cellphone video, which racked up 100,000 views in five days. “They tell me that the black is for the majority, people like me, and yet for some reason I don’t feel like I am a part of it.”“This flag. It’s your flag. It’s my flag.”The video hit a nerve. People began to respond by posting pictures of themselves wrapped in the Zimbabwean flag using the hashtag #This Flag and sharing the slogan “we’ve had enough, we are not afraid” in the local language Shona. In May, Mawarire urged people to carry the national flag with them everywhere they went for a week. Earlier this month, #ThisFlag activists organized the largest national stay-at-home boycott in a decade.As the peaceful civil disobedience continued, supporters on social media made comparisons between Mawarire and Gandhi, whose philosophy of non-violent resistance helped unravel decades of British colonial rule in India.“There is nothing wrong with learning from people like Gandhi, because they achieved a lot of things in pushing the non-violent aspect of things,” Mawarire told the Zimbabwe Independent weekly. “If we use violence we send a message that it’s okay to destroy.” “This government has been using violence over the years and if we fight violence with violence, the result will be more violence,” he added.The protests caught on with Zimbabweans tired of long years of state-sponsored-violence, crippling poverty and high unemployment in the country.After nearly three decades as president, Mugabe is clinging to power, and his 50-year-old wife Grace, tipped as a possible successor, last month warned that Mugabe would continue to rule the country from beyond the grave. Since Mugabe was once again declared the winner of contested elections in 2013, the country has plunged back into economic crisis after a few years of reprieve. His government, facing severe currency shortages, has restricted cash withdrawals, banned imports of many goods and repeatedly delayed payment of civil servants’ salaries, leading to strikes. The economic hardship been exacerbated by the worst drought in decades wiping out crops.The #ThisFlag movement has been propelled by a generation of social media-savvy Zimbabweans who organized protest actions on messaging and web apps, analysts say. Zimbabwean authorities have tried to quash the movement. Police have crushed demonstrations with brutal force. A government official warned that strikers would face “the full wrath of the law.” Messaging apps inexplicably went dark on the day of the largest protest earlier this month. Mawarire, who says he has received threats since the video was released, was arrested and charged with inciting public violence on July 12. His supporters, fearing Mawarire might suddenly disappear like other activists, released a pre-recorded video in which Mawarire urges people to continue without him. “Maybe we shall see each other again. Maybe we shall never see each other again,” Mawarire says in the video. “Maybe we succeeded, or maybe we failed. Whatever the case, you and I have stood to build Zimbabwe.”Mawarire, however, appeared in court on Wednesday, where over 100 lawyers showed up offering to defend him for free. Hundreds of his supporters spent all day praying, singing and dancing outside the Harare courthouse, under the watchful gaze of riot police.By nightfall, Mawarire walked free. A magistrate (whom Zimbabweans on social media described as “brave”) threw out the government’s case because prosecutors changed the charge against Mawarire after his arrest, from inciting violence to attempting to overthrow the government, which carries up to 20 years in jail.“We are not backing down any more,” Mawarire told the cheering crowd outside the court, many of them holding candles and draped with the Zimbabwean flag.“The government intimidates us, they arrest us and they scare us into keeping quiet, and we are saying we are done with that,” he said. “If you touch one of us, you are touching all of us.” On Friday, Mawarire posted a video assuring people he was safe after a truck of unidentified men showed up at his house looking for him. He left for South Africa over the weekend, but insists he is on a pre-planned work trip and hasn’t fled the country. Meanwhile, Mugabe on Tuesday accused Mawarire of supporting violent protests and being sponsored by foreign powers.The pastor remains convinced that non-violent action can change the country’s future prospects. Since his release, he has kept up a steady stream of videos calling for more protests as well as voter registration and education campaigns ahead of planned 2018 elections. “Our voice is our weapon. Never, never keep quiet, because that is how you build a country. No violence, no inciting, just using our voice,” Mawarire said in a video to supporters Saturday.“You make everyone proud to be Zimbabwean,” he said, the national flag draped over his shoulders."

Tens of thousands of teachers, judges and governors have been fired, and at least 6,000 military members detained since the attempted overthrow was foiled early on Saturday.On Friday night, Turkey’s major cities became temporary battlefields, as military tanks took over city streets and fighter jets were spotted flying over government buildings. The official death toll is at least 232, according to Prime Minister Binali Yildirim. Erdogan’s targeting of political opponents, however, is nothing new, though it has now reached a draconian extreme. For years, observers have pointed to the arrests and prosecutions of dissidents and journalists who criticize the government as evidence of the president’s rising authoritarianism.One of the most prominent of these cases was this year’s conviction of Can Dundar, the editor-in-chief of Turkish daily newspaper Cumhuriyet. In May, an Istanbul court sentenced Dundar to nearly six years in jail for publishing a report last year that alleged the government was sending arms to Islamist rebels fighting Syria’s President Bashar Assad. Dundar also narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on his way to the sentencing hearing.HuffPost Germany spoke with Dundar ― who is currently appealing his case and allowed freedom of movement ― about Turkey’s post-coup future, what role the EU and Germany specifically plays in it and why Erdogan has called this coup attempt “a gift from god.”Recently, there have been reports about you having left Turkey for security reasons – what’s your current situation?Unfortunately every opposition journalist experiences a security problem. An issue stemming from an intolerance in government towards criticism. Would you not experience a security problem if a president refers to your verified news report by saying “Whoever wrote this will pay a heavy price”? Wouldn’t someone who has been assaulted by persons who felt inspired by this provocation have a security problem? There are problems and yet we continue to strive for journalism.What do you expect to happen in Turkey in the coming months after the military coup?Erdogan interpreted this attempt as “a gift from god.” He will make good use of this “gift” and start a witch hunt against all opposition by accusing them of being coup perpetrators and thereby increasing his oppression. With arrests and a tip-off campaign, lists for potential criminals have started circulating from the first day. As the arrests of almost 3,000 judges and prosecutors in three days, roughly one-fifth of all lawmen in the country shows, now it’s time for Erdogan’s coup.What’s your message to the EU and especially [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel who still backs Erdogan?This is an anti-democratic coup attempt against an anti-democratic authority. It has to be viewed in this way. You are showing a double standard if when criticizing a military coup, you chose to stay silent to a civil one. ... By speaking loudly of the death penalty Erdogan is displaying an authoritarianism that even Merkel cannot afford to turn a blind eye to. … Yet we cannot forget the part Merkel and those with a similar stance had to play in Turkey building up to this situation. … Now we hope that they won’t place stools under gallows by saying “but the refugee deal is crucial.” Just let them stop selling pepper spray and plastic bullets. We will manage on our own.What’s your prediction for independent journalism in Turkey?I suppose this is increasingly a field that only those who can risk being fired, arrested or at most to be killed. Forty-eight hours after the coup, a list of journalists that must be arrested had started being circulated by pro-government journalists. The president had the opportunity to be on air through FaceTime during the coup, I’m afraid we won’t be treated with the same courtesy.How did Erdogan transform the country during the past years?The transformation from a secular country striving for democracy and Westernization to an anti-democratic, oppressive regime that takes on all Western values and principles has not been completed, yet. However, we can comfortably say that with this last coup attempt he has claimed a significant chance to leap further.Could the failed military coup also have some positive effects on Turkey? (German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier spoke of the coup as a “wake-up call for democracy in Turkey.”)The only positive impact is that military coups, which are a dark stain on Turkish history and the fabric of Turkish society, are over with [after] the reaction of the people. Now it is time to show the same outrage against civil oppressive authorities.Additional reporting by Nick Robins-Early. This interview first appeared on HuffPost Germany.

It was simply proof of how far the presumptive nominee and his team will go to stay on Moscow’s good side.Thwarting the GOP activist who offered the amendment, Trump deputies successfully killed an endorsement of “providing lethal defensive weapons” to Ukraine and swapped in a vague reference to “appropriate assistance.”Obama has also so far refused to provide lethal support to Ukraine. And many Americans have shown this election cycle that they would prefer to be less militarily involved around the world. But the position is in stark contrast to the consensus view of the GOP foreign policy elite.It’s tempting to chalk the reversal up to the popularity of Trump’s pseudo-isolationist foreign policy rhetoric. Trump has exposed that the Republican party’s rank-and-file members are much less interventionist than previously thought. While keen to bomb, torture or take other violent steps that have little chance of claiming American lives, they don’t want to invade or occupy ― the lessons and losses of Iraq are too fresh.Many Republican voters appear to resemble far-right Europeans, with their hatred of globalization and immigrants, more than they do the trade enthusiasts or fiscal hawks who represent the GOP in Congress. The leaders of many such European parties have cultivated deep ties with Putin. They regularly promote Russia’s argument that the leaders of the West are trying to provoke a war for their own shady globalist ends ― for corporations, U.S. defense manufacturers, advocates of open borders and other “traitors” to their nations. So there’s a model for this. Two top European fans of Putin, the Dutch Islamophobia-monger Geert Wilders and Brexit architect Nigel Farage, have actually made it to Cleveland for Trump’s extravaganza, making the parallel even clearer.But there’s something more insidious going on here, too. Since Trump first began to reveal himself as a fan of Putin, scores of media investigations have uncovered a shady web of connections between many of Trump’s top advisers and Putin’s friends. There’s increasing evidence that the pro-Russia bent is about profit at least as much as it is about principle.Take retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn, a Trump booster who was recently floated as a potential vice-presidential pick. Before his prime-time appearance on the convention stage Monday, Flynn sat down with investigative reporter Michael Isikoff of Yahoo News. Isikoff wanted to know about the general’s ties to Russia’s Putin-friendly news outlet RT, and asked about a high-profile appearance Trump’s favorite general made in Moscow in December at a celebration for the channel. By appearing by Putin’s side, Flynn supported Russia’s narrative that right-thinking folks in the West know Putin is justified in constantly blaming Washington for global problems and downplaying his own responsibility.Isikoff asked Flynn if he had been paid. “You’d have to ask my ― the folks that I went over there on behalf of,” Flynn said, during an exchange that starts at around the 22-minute mark in this video.Isikoff pressed. “I’m asking you. You’d know if you were paid,” he said.“Yeah. I went over there as a speaking event,” Flynn confessed. “What difference does that make? Did somebody go, ‘Oh, he’s paid by the Russians?’”Isikoff noted that Trump has routinely slammed Hillary Clinton for her speaking fees from Goldman Sachs and others, claiming they create a conflict of interest.“I didn’t take any money from Russia, if that’s what you’re asking.”“Well, then who paid you?”“My speakers bureau,” Flynn said. “Ask them. I was given an opportunity and I took it.”But of course, a speakers bureau doesn’t pay speakers, it acts as a go-between. Flynn is presumed to be the leading candidate to be director of national intelligence in a Trump administration. His bureau did not respond to a Huffington Post request for more details about the appearance.Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, is less shy about receiving cash from Putin-world. Manafort spent years working for Putin’s preferred leader in Ukraine, former President Viktor Yanukovich. His successful effort to help the Kremlin proxy win a 2010 election set the stage for Yanukovich’s venal, authoritarian rule and the eventual uprising against it that sparked the current Ukraine crisis.Another wealthy buddy of Putin’s, Oleg Deripaska, has business ties to Manafort that have embroiled the GOP operative in an investigation in the Cayman Islands, according to a Yahoo News investigation.This pattern of Trump cronies taking softer positions on Russia for their personal gain extends to a less well-known figure with even more direct influence over Trump’s foreign policy: energy executive Carter Page. A speech he gave this month in Moscow revealed that he’s mastered Putin-speak, with its focus on U.S. hypocrisy abroad, the futility of talking about “human rights” and the way America is faltering at home. From The Washington Post:He generally avoided questions on U.S. foreign policy, but when one attendee asked him whether he really believed the United States was a “liberal, democratic society,” Page told him to “read between the lines.”The Trump adviser has echoed Russian media’s line on the situation in Ukraine: it is a result of State Department meddling rather than Russian saber-rattling.Inevitably, there are other reasons for Page to dislike the U.S. approach. The sanctions that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have had dire financial consequences for him ― and a re-opening to Russia would boost his coffers.These aren’t new revelations. What’s striking is that these are the people Trump has chosen to surround himself with, knowing their positions and their financial ties. Now that he’s succeeded, so will, in a sense, their views and their interests. But that’s likely something he’s comfortable with, given his own long interest in and ties to Russian money.A Washington Post investigation into those connections found that Trump has proven willing to overlook Russian excesses, be it in trampling rights or pushing anti-Americanism abroad, in his pursuit of a buck.If he makes it to the White House, there’s every reason to believe that Trump will shape foreign policy in a way that neatly combines his apparent anti-interventionism with his stated dreams for his business. If he’s really lucky, he’ll get that Trump Tower in Russia that he’s been dreaming of."

22,THE WORLDPOST,Will The 2016 Olympics Deliver On The Promise To Leave A Lasting Legacy For Rio?,"Grasielle Castro, HuffPost Brazil",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-olympics-rio-legacy_us_578d376fe4b0fa896c3f99ad,"""Could they have done more? Yes,"" says one union president. ""But what was done will still improve the quality of life of Rio’s population.""",2016-07-19,Work on the Olympic Athlete Village in Rio de Janeiro is still underway just a few weeks before the games.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578d37c82400002600b31c23.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Olympic Games will kick off in Rio de Janeiro this August, and despite major financial and political obstacles, the International Olympic Committee has declared Brazil ready to receive 15,000 athletes and the 500,000 foreign visitors flying in to attend events at the seaside city.Over the past two years, Brazil’s deepening recession, the political turmoil that resulted in the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, an unfolding corruption scandal and a Zika outbreak have all raised doubts about the country’s ability to host the games, which have already cost Rio billions of dollars, including $11 billion worth of venues and infrastructure.As Brazil faces its worst recession in decades, Francisco Dornelles, acting governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro, declared last month a “state of public calamity in financial administration,” pleading for emergency federal funds. In its Official Gazette, the state said that together with growing payroll costs, Olympics-related expenditures could drive Brazil toward a “total collapse in public security, health, education, transport and environmental management.”Besides the projected budget deficit, Rio authorities are also grappling with growing public violence. In a meeting last month with Michel Temer, the country’s acting president, Dornelles asked for military support to help secure Rio for the duration of the Olympics. With the opening ceremony less than three weeks away, Brazilian officials claim that despite the current calamities, not only will the games be successful, but the promise to contribute a lasting legacy for the city will be upheld.In 2014, the Rio 2016 Olympics organizing committee highlighted its “commitment to ensure the Games leave a lasting legacy for Rio de Janeiro and Brazilian society as a whole.”Despite fears that the facilities will not be ready in time, the Ministry of Sport and the Rio de Janeiro City Hall have announced that the venues are 97 percent complete.However, some of the infrastructure projects are cutting it extremely close. The 10-mile addition to Rio’s subway system, which cost the city $2.77 billion, will not open until Aug. 1, just four days before the games begin.In addition to delays, the city has faced dire Olympics-related setbacks. Earlier this year, a large stretch of a $12 million seaside bike path ― one of the city’s major renovation projects ― collapsed, killing two people.Still, some officials are taking pride in the transformations Rio has seen in the lead-up to the games. José Roberto Bernasconi, president of the country’s architecture and engineering union, told HuffPost Brazil that in preparation for the Olympics, the city has had to reorganize itself and review its infrastructure and urban mobility plans.“Rio went through a transformation after it was decided that it would host the Games,” Bernasconi said. “There was a great change in mobility and urban infrastructure with the recovery of downtown Rio, the demolition of the elevated expressway, and the Museum of Tomorrow. Those are extraordinary, man-made works, combined with the city’s natural beauty. It is a gain.”The projects completed in preparation for the Olympics will be repurposed after the event, Bernasconi said, to continue to serve the city. “The Olympic Park, where the athletes will be lodged and compete, will be occupied in the future by the population of Rio, similar to what happened in London,” he said. London’s athletes village was repurposed as a large-scale residential area after the 2012 Games. Of the 2,818 apartments built, 1,379 served low-income East Londoners. Rio’s residents, however, are worried that after the games, developers will build luxury condos that most people would not be able to access or afford. Developers have said they plan to turn the Olympic Village into a private complex after the games, selling some of the 3,600 luxury apartments for up to $700,000. While optimistic about the future of the Olympics-related development projects, Bernasconi acknowledges that the legacy could have been stronger.“I am personally disappointed that they didn’t manage to clean the Guanabara Bay,” Bernasconi said, referring to the body of water that will host a few of the Olympic yachting events. Despite promises made by the organizers, lack of funds has meant that the bay was not successfully cleared of raw sewage and other waste. “The achievements in the areas of basic sanitation and security fell short of expectations,” he said. “Could they have done more? Yes.

23,THE WORLDPOST,Will The 2016 Olympics Deliver On The Promise To Leave A Lasting Legacy For Rio?,"Grasielle Castro, HuffPost Brazil",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-olympics-rio-legacy_us_578d376fe4b0fa896c3f99ad,"""Could they have done more? Yes,"" says one union president. ""But what was done will still improve the quality of life of Rio’s population.""",2016-07-19,A banner advertising the 2016 Rio Olympics is seen near the Mare slums complex of the Linha Vermelha freeway.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578e5a401300002c0005eb3f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Olympic Games will kick off in Rio de Janeiro this August, and despite major financial and political obstacles, the International Olympic Committee has declared Brazil ready to receive 15,000 athletes and the 500,000 foreign visitors flying in to attend events at the seaside city.Over the past two years, Brazil’s deepening recession, the political turmoil that resulted in the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, an unfolding corruption scandal and a Zika outbreak have all raised doubts about the country’s ability to host the games, which have already cost Rio billions of dollars, including $11 billion worth of venues and infrastructure.As Brazil faces its worst recession in decades, Francisco Dornelles, acting governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro, declared last month a “state of public calamity in financial administration,” pleading for emergency federal funds. In its Official Gazette, the state said that together with growing payroll costs, Olympics-related expenditures could drive Brazil toward a “total collapse in public security, health, education, transport and environmental management.”Besides the projected budget deficit, Rio authorities are also grappling with growing public violence. In a meeting last month with Michel Temer, the country’s acting president, Dornelles asked for military support to help secure Rio for the duration of the Olympics. With the opening ceremony less than three weeks away, Brazilian officials claim that despite the current calamities, not only will the games be successful, but the promise to contribute a lasting legacy for the city will be upheld.In 2014, the Rio 2016 Olympics organizing committee highlighted its “commitment to ensure the Games leave a lasting legacy for Rio de Janeiro and Brazilian society as a whole.”Despite fears that the facilities will not be ready in time, the Ministry of Sport and the Rio de Janeiro City Hall have announced that the venues are 97 percent complete.However, some of the infrastructure projects are cutting it extremely close. The 10-mile addition to Rio’s subway system, which cost the city $2.77 billion, will not open until Aug. 1, just four days before the games begin.In addition to delays, the city has faced dire Olympics-related setbacks. Earlier this year, a large stretch of a $12 million seaside bike path ― one of the city’s major renovation projects ― collapsed, killing two people.Still, some officials are taking pride in the transformations Rio has seen in the lead-up to the games. José Roberto Bernasconi, president of the country’s architecture and engineering union, told HuffPost Brazil that in preparation for the Olympics, the city has had to reorganize itself and review its infrastructure and urban mobility plans.“Rio went through a transformation after it was decided that it would host the Games,” Bernasconi said. “There was a great change in mobility and urban infrastructure with the recovery of downtown Rio, the demolition of the elevated expressway, and the Museum of Tomorrow. Those are extraordinary, man-made works, combined with the city’s natural beauty. It is a gain.”The projects completed in preparation for the Olympics will be repurposed after the event, Bernasconi said, to continue to serve the city. “The Olympic Park, where the athletes will be lodged and compete, will be occupied in the future by the population of Rio, similar to what happened in London,” he said. London’s athletes village was repurposed as a large-scale residential area after the 2012 Games. Of the 2,818 apartments built, 1,379 served low-income East Londoners. Rio’s residents, however, are worried that after the games, developers will build luxury condos that most people would not be able to access or afford. Developers have said they plan to turn the Olympic Village into a private complex after the games, selling some of the 3,600 luxury apartments for up to $700,000. While optimistic about the future of the Olympics-related development projects, Bernasconi acknowledges that the legacy could have been stronger.“I am personally disappointed that they didn’t manage to clean the Guanabara Bay,” Bernasconi said, referring to the body of water that will host a few of the Olympic yachting events. Despite promises made by the organizers, lack of funds has meant that the bay was not successfully cleared of raw sewage and other waste. “The achievements in the areas of basic sanitation and security fell short of expectations,” he said. “Could they have done more? Yes. But what was done will still improve the quality of life of Rio’s population.”Luiz Fernando Janot, a member of the Federal Council of Architecture and Urbanism of the State of Rio de Janeiro, expressed a similar view.“The projects could have been debated more,” he said. “More people could have benefited from the works, but what was done is important.”Janot also argued that the existing achievements are even more significant in light of the economic crisis Brazil is facing. “Whether you like it or not, we must recognize that there is an important legacy, which was accomplished in the right moment,” he said. “Today, for instance, with the current economic crisis, we would have never done anything.

In a video post with Qavi, she appears to sit on his lap.A police source said the government of Punjab, the country’s largest province, has made it impossible for the family to forgive the son who murdered her - a common legal loophole that sees many honor killings go unpunished in Pakistan.“It was done on the instructions of the government. But it happens rarely,” said the Punjab police official.A senior government official in Islamabad confirmed the order came from the Punjab government.More than 500 people, almost all of them women, die in honor killings in Pakistan every year, usually at the hands of relatives acting over a perception shame has been brought on the family.It was not immediately clear if the Punjab government’s decision would lead to any meaningful reforms. An anti-honor killings bill that aims to close the family forgiveness loophole has been bogged down in parliament.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in February promised to speed up the passage of the proposed law but right groups say there has been no progress.“There is no honor in killing in the name of honor,” Sharif said about Baloch’s murder, according to his daughter, Maryam.Baloch’s father, Muhammad Azeem, has filed a police complaint against Waseem and another one of his sons for their role in Baloch’s murder.Police on Monday also said they were widening their investigations to include Qavi, the Muslim cleric who was removed from a prominent Muslim committee after the selfie photos were published. He has denied any wrongdoing.Baloch built a modeling career on the back of her social media fame and was the family breadwinner. Media often described her as Pakistan’s Kim Kardashian and she called herself a modern-day feminist.But her pictures and videos outraged religious conservatives who viewed her as a disgrace to the cultural values of Islam and Pakistan. She often received death threats."

Its overall fine was more than double the previous record for a group operating a cartel in the EU.Daimler received the biggest fine at 1.01 billion euros, while Volkswagen-owned MAN escaped a penalty because it had alerted the cartel to the European Commission.“It is not acceptable that MAN, Volvo/Renault, Daimler, Iveco and DAF, which together account for around 9 out of every 10 medium and heavy trucks produced in Europe, were part of a cartel instead of competing with each other,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.Volvo, Sweden’s biggest company by revenue, received a 670.45 million euro fine and Iveco, which is part of Italian truck and tractor maker CNH  Industrial, was fined 494.61 million euros.DAF Trucks, owned by Paccar, was handed a penalty 752.68 million euros. The four companies admitted wrongdoing in return for a 10 percent cut in the penalties imposed. Scania did not settle and will continue to be investigated.The highest fine prior to the truckmakers’ sanction was 1.4 billion euros levied against a TV and computer monitor tubes cartel in 2012.Campaign group Transport & Environment’s director William Todts said regulators should do more to improve the environment.“Truckmakers have to change, but so do regulators; they need to create competition on environmental performance. Introducing fuel economy standards is one key way of doing that,” he said.Truck makers have invested heavily in recent years to make their engines compliant with so-called Euro VI standards, which focus on reducing health-threatening nitrogen oxides.The Commission has introduced more stringent regulation to curb pollution of health-threatening nitrogen oxides and introduced it in stages. So-called Euro 1 standards were unveiled in 1993 and since the start of 2014 any new vehicle must comply with Euro VI standards.The more stringent emissions standards have forced truck makers to invest in expensive technologies such as exhaust treatment filters.

Over 140,000 people signed it in less than two weeks, surpassing the 100,000-signature benchmark that typically draws an official response.The White House responded to the petition by saying it could not formally address its request because “the U.S. government does not generate a list of domestic terror organizations.”The administration’s response also quotes something President Barack Obama said last week during a televised town hall on race relations in the U.S. During that event, the president explained that saying “black lives matter” does not mean other lives don’t matter. Rather, he said, the movement “simply refers to the notion that there’s a specific vulnerability for African-Americans that needs to be addressed. ... It’s to suggest that other folks aren’t experiencing this particular vulnerability.”Black Lives Matter describes its mission as an “an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise. It is an affirmation of Black folks’ contributions to this society, our humanity, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression.”In its response to the petition, the White House also expressed hope that people would respond with productive dialogue, not divisiveness: “We encourage you to engage with your community in the ongoing discussion of how we can better build trust and safety in our communities.”Two days after the petition launched, a gunman fatally shot five police officers after a Black Lives Matter rally in Dallas. The suspect, Micah Johnson, cited frustration over police officers having recently killed Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, and Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, but reportedly was not an active member of any Black Lives Matter groups.Three officers in Baton Rouge were also killed Sunday in a shootout with a suspect, although the motives for the attack have not been confirmed.
