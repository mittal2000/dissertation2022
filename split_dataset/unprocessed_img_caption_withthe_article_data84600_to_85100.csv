Foreign ministers not in Vienna are expected to rejoin their counterparts in a final push for a deal beginning on Sunday.French officials said Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius planned to come on Sunday, but was unlikely to arrive before the evening. It was not clear when the British, Chinese, German and Russian foreign ministers would arrive.All sides say a deal is within reach. But there are other sticking points in addition to sanctions and future monitoring mechanisms.One is a stalled U.N. investigation into the possible military dimensions of past Iranian nuclear research suspected of being linked to weapons development.Another is Iran's demand to continue research and development work on advanced centrifuges, machines that purify uranium for use as fuel in power plants or weapons.According to the United States, Iran agreed in an April 2 framework agreement not to use its IR-2, IR-4, IR-5, IR-6 or IR-8 model centrifuges to produce enriched uranium for at least 10 years. Iran would, however, engage in limited research and development with its advanced centrifuges according to a plan ""agreed to"" by the major powers.

Hodges establishing nationwide marriage equality will likely go down in history as one of the Court's great landmark rulings. The Court's opinion not only embraces liberty and marriage equality for LGBTQ Americans but reaffirms the fundamental principles of American constitutional democracy. Although the opinion often uses terms such as ""gays and lesbians"" or ""same-sex"" couples and discusses sexual orientation, the Court's holding brings marriage equality to all LGBTQ people and significantly advances the goals of freedom and equality in all aspects of our lives.The opinion begins by articulating the core American value of personal freedom: ""The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty ... to define and express their identity."" The Court then explained how the Constitution is not shipwrecked in the 18th century but lives today to protect Americans' freedom and equality. In the Court's words: ""The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.""The Court implicitly recognized the importance of decades of LGBTQ activism in creating change, explaining that ""new dimensions of freedom become apparent to new generations, often through perspectives that begin in pleas or protests and then are considered in the political sphere and the judicial process.""The Court then held that laws that exclude LGBTQ couples from marriage ""burden the liberty of same-sex couples, and ... abridge central precepts of equality."" Such laws ""are in essence unequal: same-sex couples are denied all the benefits afforded to opposite-sex couples and are barred from exercising a fundamental right.""The Court affirmed that two people ""whatever their sexual orientation"" may form an ""enduring bond"" in marriage and that can lead to greater ""expression, intimacy, and spirituality."" Further, ""gays and lesbians can create loving, supportive families,"" and indeed ""hundreds of thousands of chilÂ¬dren are presently being raised by [same-sex] couples"" in ""loving and nurturing homes ...."" Put simply, the Court stated, ""[t]here is no difference between same- and opposite-sex couples with respect to"" these core matters. Yet same-sex marriage bans undermine the dignity of LGBTQ families, ""harm and humiliate the children of same-sex couples,"" and ""consign[]"" same-sex couples ""to an instability many opposite-sex couples would deem intolerable in their own lives.""In explaining its decision, the Court emphasized the horrible isolation that LGBTQ Americans have had to endure historically. In the Court's words, for long ""[a] truthful declaration by same-sex couples of what was in their hearts had to remain unspoken,"" and for years""[s]ame-sex intimacy"" was criminal in many states. The opinion refers to how historically many LGBTQ people had been ""condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions,"" marriage. The Court further noted that ""[g]ays and lesbians were prohibited from most government employment, barred from military service, excluded under immigration laws, targeted by police, and burdened in their rights to associate.""The Court spoke of the destructive nature of such prejudice and discrimination. ""Especially against a long history of disapproval of [same-sex] relationships, [the] denial ... of the right to marry works a grave and continuing harm. The imposition of this disability on gays and lesbians serves to disrespect and subordinate them.""The tone of the opinion is strikingly vivid, emotionally intelligent, and personal. We and many others have experienced a profound sense of dignity and pride at no longer being second-class citizens when it comes to marriage, but the Court also acknowledged how painful and lasting the human toll of disparagement and isolation is. In the Court's words, ""wounds [to our human dignity] cannot always be healed with the stroke of a pen."" In describing the limited benefit of incremental victories, such as decriminalization of same-sex love, the Court observed: ""Outlaw to outcast may be a step forward, but it does not achieve the full promise of liberty.""The opinion will significantly bolster future cases challenging sexual orientation discrimination because the Court recognized the harmful effect of inequality on all lesbian and gay people, not just those in relationships. The Court held that the ""exclusion"" from marriage ""has the effect of teaching that gays and lesbians are unequal in important respects. It demeans gays and lesbians for the State to lock them out of a central institution of the Nation's society."" Denying LGBTQ people the right to marry ""disparage[s] their choices and diminish[es] their personhood ....""In its opinion, the Court also recognized explicitly for the first time that homosexual orientation is healthy and unalterable, observing how ""psychiatrists and others [have now] recognized that sexual orientation is both a normal expression of human sexuality and immutable."" Although long obvious to millions of Americans and to every professional psychological or medical association, the Court's recognition of these facts is very important to assuring success in future cases challenging unequal treatment based on sexual orientation.The Court's opinion essentially recognized the crime of Proposition 8 and all the other statewide measures that targeted LGBTQ Americans to deprive of them of marriage equality and their basic human dignity. The Court did so by reasserting the central role of the Bill of Rights in our constitutional democracy. The opinion reassures all Americans that ""[t]he Nation's courts are open to injured individuals who come to them to vindicate their own direct, personal stake in our basic charter. An individual can invoke a right to constitutional protection when he or she is harmed, even if the broader public disagrees and even if the legislature refuses to act."" In the words of the Court, ""[t]he idea of the Constitution 'was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials ....' This is why 'fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.'""We could say many other things about the importance of this historic decision, but for now we conclude with the last two lines of the opinion itself. By seeking marriage equality, LGBTQ people ""ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.""John Lewis and Stuart Gaffney, together for nearly three decades, were plaintiffs in the California case for equal marriage rights decided by the California Supreme Court in 2008. They are leaders in the nationwide grassroots organization Marriage Equality USA."

Greek voters headed to the polls today to vote in a historic, tightly fought referendum on whether to accept worsening austerity in exchange for more bailout funds, in a gamble that could see it crash out of the euro. AFP PHOTO / SAKIS MITROLIDIS (Photo credit should read SAKIS MITROLIDIS/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d98b5e280000f6376ff7ec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Greek voters are fed up, angry, and desperate. Their dreams have been shattered, their honor has been compromised. How should they vote in the upcoming referendum?They should vote ""YES.""Our government is depicting this referendum as an expression of democracy. The sad truth is that it is the product of political brinkmanship.Our government argues that a ""no"" vote will not risk the exit of our country from the Euro, that banks will reopen the day after, and that Greece will be further empowered in its negotiations with our European partners. They are either living in a fantasy world or deliberately misleading our people.Others -- including Messrs Krugman and Stiglitz -- argue that Greece should vote ""no"" to reject endless austerity, leave the Euro, and ""grasp its destiny in its own hands."" This argument may be more sincere. It may also sound as music to Mr Varoufakis' ears and add ammunition to Mr Tsipras' domestic rhetoric. But it is incorrect. It confuses a prescription error with the underlying illness: we got an overdose of austerity, but we are still in dire need of deep structural reforms. As importantly, it ignores Greece's political reality.To put this in a historical perspective, consider the '80s or early '90s. Controlling our destiny at the time meant important gains in terms of social cohesion and equality. But it also meant the growth of an inefficient and politically-controlled public sector. It meant raising the burden of public debt from about 20 percent of GDP to about 100 percent in less than a decade. It meant a reduction in competitiveness and exports despite repeated devaluations. It meant a sclerotic labor market, a distorted financial system, and little entrepreneurial activity. It meant a culture that stigmatized hard work and promoted corruption. This path was partially reversed in the late '90s and early 2000s, thanks in part to our participation in the EU and the Euro. Not only did this participation tame inflation, facilitate important reforms, and boost exports; it also helped reorient our economy and our culture.Now, let's fast-forward to the day after the referendum. What will happen if a ""no"" leads to Grexit? There are the likely calamities in the short run: markets will freeze and government revenue will collapse; large losses in bank deposits, wages, and pensions will follow; and any immediate improvement in the exchange rate may be dwarfed by the ongoing economic and political uncertainty. But the gravest consequences could actually be in the longer run -- especially if it is in the hands of those who dream a return to the ""good old days.""When Syriza came to power, it was handed a golden opportunity: it could offer a serious commitment on implementing the needed structural reforms and on fighting tax evasion in exchange for less austerity and more debt relief. They blew it off. They wasted five months either showing sheer incompetence or lecturing our European partners about democracy -- as if they have the monopoly of being the only democratically elected government. Their concrete actions were to undo earlier structural reforms, undermine our legal and political institutions, and attack meritocracy. Our education minister portrays academic excellence as a social stigma; others want a love affair with Putin, presumably because of his unrivaled commitment to peace and democracy. Is this the way to a prosperous future?Greek voters should not give up on their demand for less austerity. But they should also condemn the failed strategies of this government, safeguard their position in Europe, and invest in the future. They should vote ""YES."""

(AP Photo/Giannis Papanikos)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc152a12400003300e485a1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," The victory of ""no"" in the Greek referendum was completely predictable. Its size however, exceeds any prediction. And this is a result which must first be explained and then interpreted as a choice of trajectory. It had been clear that in such a referendum every voter would answer ""yes"" or ""no"" bearing a different version of the question in his or her mind. Some answered the question of ""yes"" or ""no"" to the euro and Europe. Most chose to answer the question of ""yes"" or ""no"" to austerity. For many, there has been one more question that has proven to be decisive. Perhaps ""no"" was in reality ""yes"" to a Tsipras-led government? Perhaps ""yes"" was seen as a sign of approval of a political establishment that was already disapproved of in January's elections and which, six months later, has shown that it has not realized anything, has yet to express regret for anything, has not changed, and seems to regard the referendum as an opportunity for revenge? Last Wednesday was the crucial day. In the morning, (while televisions were flooded with images of pensioners' hardship while waiting in front of closed banks hoping to withdraw part of their small pension), recurring polls showed for the first time ""yes"" marginally in front of ""no.""Nevertheless, at 5:30 p.m., when Alexis Tsipras himself appeared on television screens to deliver his message, the gap started to narrow, and ""no"" took the lead once again. This way it became clear that the referendum's focus slowly started to change. It was the government and the prime minister who put themselves on the chopping board in this referendum. The question was: Do you trust us to continue the negotiations? Or are you going to overthrow us?This is the shape, I believe, that the main question of the referendum has taken. This explains the great, triumphal victory of ""no."" The people of Greece have shown their confidence in this government. The question now is how the government will interpret this and how it will use its victory.Two different negations lie within the referendum's ""no."" A ""no-no"" (no to the proposed bailout deal and no to any deal that Europe might offer Greece today and consequently no to the euro). And a ""no-yes"" (no to an austerity deal, but yes to the euro, through a fairer deal). Everything points to the fact that this second interpretation of ""no"" has probably prevailed. Alexis Tsipras's first reaction in his festive speech seems to also adopt this very interpretation. It's a first sign. The outcome of this Greek drama is not up to the Greeks anymore. It now depends on how European leaders will react. Whether they will view the referendum result as an opportunity for a big deal or a chance to rid themselves of the Greek issue, putting all the blame on the Greeks, remains to be seen.This post originally appeared on HuffPost Greece and was translated into English.

Consider taking these six steps the next time you sense toxicity brewing within a relationship and rediscover the joys of truly positive energy.,2015-07-05,"Friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between two or more people.[1] Friendship is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an association. Friendship has been studied in academic fields such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles. A World Happiness Database study found that people with close friendships are happier.[2] Although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many types of friendship. Such characteristics include affection, sympathy, empathy, honesty, altruism, mutual understanding and compassion, enjoyment of each other's company, trust, and the ability to be oneself, express one's feelings, and make mistakes without fear of judgment from the friend. While there is no practical limit on what types of people can form a friendship, friends tend to share common backgrounds, occupations, or interests, and have similar demographics.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ee41b2000003100fe892f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Your phone rings at midnight. It's your friend, who's made the same mistake again, has broken up with their partner for the fifteenth time this month or is struck with some sudden problem. Like the dutiful pal that you are, you listen quietly and advise soundly. But when you hang up, you realize your own mood has downshifted. You were fine before the phone call but now you feel saddened, worried, tired.The problem isn't that your friend has disrupted your energy once or twice, because we're supposed to extend compassion to others. The problem is that this happens often.You see, every encounter with another person leaves an impression on your field of energy. Those who are rich with good energy make you feel happy, uplifted and reassured. But those who suffer from a dark disposition leave you stressed, fatigued, and down after being around them. And the people who are often harbingers of negativity are -- believe it or not -- friends. So what happens when you go against your better judgment and continue to spend time with friends who have become depressive, angry, or pessimistic? Their energies stain yours.In time, you may find ourselves mimicking the same, heavy mood, though subconsciously. It becomes easier to be a good, loyal friend and not end a friendship prematurely when you've learned how to block out harmful frequencies and nurture healthy energy instead.The following steps to protect yourself from toxic friendships are excerpted from my new book, The Karma Queens' Guide to Relationships:Step one: Identify friends who are chronically anxious, irritable, sarcastic, pessimistic or depressive. These friends might be under a lot of pressure, going through a difficult time, or just have personalities that harbor darker emotions and lower vibrational frequencies. Some people simply see the glass as half empty rather than half full. That's fine for them, but their energy should not spill over onto you. Recognize friends who are ""toxic"" in nature and tread cautiously.Step two: Understand how your friends' moods affect you. Analyze how their negative energy is depriving your own state of being, your emotions your ability to function. Once you acknowledge the impact, you'll understand that their moods might be affecting you more than you think, leaving you physically and mentally depleted. You may not realize it, but you absorb energies around you just as much as you absorb oxygen from the air.Step three: Avoid maintaining relationships with people who give off bad energy. You should not have to ""put up with"" anyone's bad mood on a daily basis, whether the person is your boss, family member, or spouse. If you know someone who is constantly low-spirited due to life circumstances or otherwise, it might be time for you to (politely) create a bit of space between you. Shy away from people who emit chronic negativity and gravitate closer to those who praise a positive mindset. Perhaps you're meant to guide them gently into getting help for depression and pessimism, but don't take on their woes. Tend to your own energetic stability instead.Step four: Retreat to a peaceful place when someone's energy is becoming toxic. In every friendship, there will be times when you'll need to find a place of solitude and spend some time there raising your energy before returning to interact with your friend. This space for retreat might be your private office, your bedroom, a bathroom, even your car. Retreat by not answering calls, texts, and instant messages if you need some space between you and a person whose attitude is too sour for you right now. The important thing is that you withdraw yourself from the unhealthy atmosphere and take a minute to recharge your own energy. When someone else's temperament is making you feel uncomfortable, try affirmations. You can say things like, ""I love myself therefore I protect my energy from the harmful vibes of others.""Step five: Create an energy shield of protection. Your energetic territory is your very own personal space of being, and very few people should have access to this private part of your self. If you're an open person who invites others into your ""energy bubble,"" you grant them the opportunity to modify your mood and mold your wellbeing to their liking. Remember that when someone enters your energy field, their own state of being doesn't trail far behind. If you feel this happens to you often, keep your energetic doors closed to invaders. Visualize a bubble of protection enclosing you safely when you feel your emotional space being invaded. If a friend intrudes your space regularly, you need to confront that person and set a clear boundary.  Step six: Keep your own emotions in check. We often believe we don't have the power to control our emotions, but we do! We can maintain healthy friendships if we manage our feelings of anger, jealousy, sadness, and so on. Otherwise, we will overburden our friends, lower our own energy, and begin to attract people who display similarly dim emotions. Take control of your negative tendencies before they take control of you. The worst mistakes are made in moments of anger, which raises adrenaline levels and causes people not to think straight. The more you enable anger, the more the nerve cells of your brain evoke this emotion. Likewise, the more you practice tranquility, unconditional love, and patience, the more frequently and naturally you will slip into these moods, raising your vibrational frequency and attracting others on the same level of awareness.Friendships should strengthen our peace of mind and contribute to our inner harmony. Consider taking these six steps the next time you sense toxicity brewing within a relationship and rediscover the joys of truly positive energy.To healthy relationships, Alexandra HarraTo learn more about The Karma Queens' Guide to Relationships, click here.For more by Alexandra Harra, click here.

Through directed fishing, by-catch, surging demand for shark and ray products, and misaligned incentives, the world's shark and ray populations have been decimated over the past four decades and now a quarter are at risk of extinction. In the worst cases they have gone locally extinct; in many others, up to 90 percent of populations have been lost. I am spending the beginning of Shark Week viewing the world's largest whale shark aggregation in Isla Mujeres, Mexico, where living sharks contribute millions of dollars annually in ecotourism dollars to the local economy. Photo by Caleb McClennen Â©WCS.Sharks and rays' vulnerability also derives from their specific life cycle. Most shark and ray species take many years to reach sexual maturity, then produce few young -- more akin to marine mammals such as whales and dolphins than fish. Thus, they are especially threatened by overfishing and slow to recover. Fortunately, it has become increasingly unpalatable for people across the globe to watch idly as we lose one of the most fascinating and awe-inspiring assemblages of marine biodiversity the world has to offer.   There is hope. The shark and ray conservation movement has made great headway in tackling this global and highly complex challenge. For the first time ever, commercially fished sharks were listed through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 2013. Thanks to over a decade of concerted effort by shark scientists, advocates and governments, CITES requirements are now beginning to increase the sustainability (and future prospects) of whale sharks, basking sharks, oceanic whitetip sharks, porbeagle sharks, and three species of hammerhead sharks, all sawfishes, and manta rays. Indonesian Ministry of Fisheries personnel display confiscated manta ray gills at their offices in Negara, Jembrana, Bali. Photo by Paul Hilton Â©WCS.In the past year we celebrated the actions by Indonesia to crack down on the now illegal manta trade and countries are coming together to impose catch restrictions in their waters' critical marine habitats for sharks (or in some cases their entire economic zone). In Asia we see reported signs of a reduced demand for shark fin for the traditional culinary delicacy shark fin soup.Back home in the United States, our shark fisheries are some of the best managed in the world -- successfully championing a ban of shark finning on all but one species and other critical measures. On the East Coast, full protection measures for White Sharks in the 1990s have led to a recovering populations and are now back just off the outer beach of Cape Cod, feeding on the result another amazing conservation success story: the dramatic recovery of grey and harbor seals. Nationally, we are seeing the full protection of many species in the U.S. and the successful recovery of shark fisheries in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. It has become increasingly unpalatable for people across the globe to watch idly as we lose one of the most fascinating and awe-inspiring assemblages of marine biodiversity.

A team of dedicated WCS shark conservationists will be out on the water all summer researching these animals to learn more about how to protect them and inspire New Yorkers and others around the world to conserve them.  This Shark Week 2015 -- and on the 40th anniversary of Jaws -- let us reflect upon our growing appreciation for (and willingness to protect) these vulnerable species. Let us then dramatically scale our commitment to reverse the decline of these magnificent species on a global scale.  The re-release of ""Jaws"" this summer on its 40th anniversary is drawing attention to the critical importance of protecting vulnerable shark and ray species globally. Â© Universal Studios.The good news is we know what is necessary: We must leverage our successes to fully protect the most vulnerable species, improve shark and ray fisheries management world-wide, and shift demand away from unsustainable shark and ray products.This coming week should be about celebrating the amazing work of shark conservationists who have committed their lives to saving sharks and rays. Their combined impact is turning the tide. We owe them our most since thanks and our increased commitment to this critical challenge for the ocean and our planet."

When can I expect my first check? And, is direct deposit my only option for receiving my monthly payment?--Almost Eligible Dear Almost,Generally, Social Security retirement benefits (as well as disability and survivor benefits) are paid in the month after the month they are due. So, if you apply for your Social Security benefits in September, you will receive your September benefits in October.   The day of the month you receive your benefit payment, however, will depend on either your birthdate, or the birthdate of the person whose work record you're receiving benefits on.If you're applying for benefits as a retired worker, your benefit payment day will be determined by your own birthdate. But if you're applying for spousal or survivors benefits based on your spouse's or (if you were married at least 10 years) ex-spouse's work record, your benefit payment date will be determined by his or her birthdate. Here's the schedule of when you can expect to receive your monthly check:Birthdate is 1st through 10th of month: Payment day is second Wednesday of each month.Birthdate is 11th through 20th of month: Payment day is third Wednesday of each month.Birthdate is after the 20th of the month: Payment day is fourth Wednesday of each month.There are, however, a few exceptions to this schedule. For example, if the day your Social Security check is supposed to be deposited happens to be a holiday, your check will be deposited the previous day. And, if you are receiving both Social Security benefits and SSI payments, your Social Security check will be deposited on the third day of the month. You should also know that Social Security beneficiaries who started receiving benefits before 1997, their Social Security checks are paid on the third day of the month. To get a complete schedule of 2015 payment dates, visit ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10031-2015.pdf.Direct Deposit DeliveryThere are two ways you can receive your Social Security benefits today. Most beneficiaries choose direct deposit into their bank or credit union account because it's simple, safe and secure. But, if you don't like this option or if you don't have a bank account that your payments can be deposited into, you can get a Direct Express Debit MasterCard and have your benefits deposited into your card's account. This card can then be used to get cash from ATMs, banks or credit union tellers, pay bills online and over the phone, make purchases at stores or locations that accept Debit MasterCard and get cash back when you make those purchases, and purchase money orders at the U.S. Post Office. The money you spend or withdraw is automatically deducted from your account. And you can check your balance any time by phone, online or at ATMs. There's also no cost to sign up for the card, no monthly fees and no overdraft charges. There are, however, a few small fees for optional services you need to be aware of, like multiple ATM withdrawals. Currently, cardholders get one free ATM withdrawal per month, but additional monthly withdrawals cost 85 cents each not including a surcharge if you use a non-network ATM.

13,RELIGION,5 Faith Facts About Chris Christie,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-faith_n_7700634.html,,2015-07-04,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie waves to supporters during an event where he announced he would seek the Republican nomination for president, Tuesday, June 30, 2015, at Livingston High School in Livingston, N.J. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb804333c000032000db51c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, announced his candidacy for the presidency Tuesday (June 30) saying, âI am now ready to fight for the people of the United States of America.âHere are five faith facts about the presidential hopeful from the Garden State.1. He is a cradle Catholic.Christie was born to Catholic parents and baptized in the faith as an infant. As a child, he spent a lot of time with his grandmother, going to Mass with her everyday. Now heâs fond of telling this story: One day, he decided to stop praying because âit didnât work.â He had prayed to God for a good grade on a test and still got a C. Her answer: âNo Chris, youâre wrong. God always answers your prayers. But sometimes the answer is no.âChristie stuck with his faith â he graduated from Seton Hall University, a Catholic school in South Orange, N.J., and has described his faith as âa huge partâ of his life.2. But he sometimes parts from church teaching.Christie differs from official Catholic Church teachings on certain key issues. Asked about homosexuality and gay rights in 2011, Christie said, âMy religion says itâs a sin. But for me, I have always believed that people are born with the predisposition to be homosexual. â¦ I understand that my church says that. But for me personally, I donât look upon someone whoâs homosexual as a sinner.â Two years later, he signed into law a bill banning reparative therapy.On gay marriage, he sounds more churchy. âI believe marriage is an institution between one man and one woman,â he said. He vetoed a bill that would have legalized gay marriage in New Jersey.He has changed his mind on reproductive issues. Early in his career, he described himself as âpro-choice,â but now says he is pro-life. This change of heart, he said, happened when he saw his first daughterâs heartbeat in utero. âIt led to me having a real reflection on my position,â he said in 2011. âAnd when I took time to reflect on it, I just said, you know what, Iâm not comfortable with that anymore.â3. Unlike President Kennedy, heâs more forthcoming about his faith.Pol watchers have remarked that President John F. Kennedy, also a Catholic, is Christieâs role model for how the governor keeps his faith largely private. But unlike Kennedy, Christie has been more outspoken.When a woman called in to a television talk show to ask Christie why he sends his children to private Catholic schools while cutting funding for New Jersey public schools, he responded, âWeâve decided as parents that we believe a religious education should be part of our childrenâs everyday education.âSimilarly, in 2011, he said it should be up to individual school districts to decide whether to teach creationism.4. Christie sometimes gets all God-talky.Political wisdom holds that no candidate can become president unless he or she talks about God. And in the ramp-up to the 2016 election, Christie show signs of heeding that advice. In March, speaking before a group of Republican donors in Florida, he told them, âNo rights are given to you by government. All our rights are given to you by God.â5. Heâs a member of The Church of Bruce.Itâs no secret the governor is a major fan of fellow Jersey boy Bruce Springsteen, with more than 125 Springsteen concert ticket stubs in his collection. But when the New York Post reported Christie fell asleep at a Springsteen concert, the governor pointed out that he was doing something more spiritual.âWhat happened was during âRocky Ground,â which is kind of a really spiritual song, people sat,â Christie said. âSo I sat on my seat, and I put my head back and closed my eyes and listened to the song.ââThe song has exactly the kind of redemptive message that Christie is now so publicly evoking,â Matt Katz, a reporter for New Jersey Public Radio said. âIt speaks not only to those struggling with addiction to drugs, but to a man facing rocky ground ahead: Trying to become president of the United States.â"

Across this nation -- at family cookouts and under ostentatious firework displays -- Americans celebrate the birth of this nation with a holiday regarded as ""Independence Day."" But for many this day remains one of partial, imperfect independence, a bitter reminder of an incomplete experiment.Deeply exclusionary from the onset, American democracy enfranchised neither the enslaved nor women, and it sought to further marginalize the indigenous nations of North America. But if the political reality of a country founded by the very words ""We the People..."" was farcical, it too held revolutionary potential in the language of its articulation. Decrying the hypocrisy of the July 4th celebrations, the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass exclaimed  ""[it is] a day that reveals...more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he [the slave] is the constant victim."" One hundred and sixty three years since Douglass' famous ""What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?"" address, the American idea, the stars and the spangles, and the Fourth of July remain a bundle of contradictions. Savage racial inequality blossomed in a nation whose founding principles articulated the notion that ""all men are created equal"" but cowardly compromised such virtues in the interest of brutal slavery and bloody wars against indigenous people. This paradox gave rise to a sanctimonious toxicity that poisoned America from its very birth. The Civil War sent more than 600,000 men to their deaths, largely because of this national defect. And while most Americans today believe the war to have been about states' rights, it was undoubtedly also a conflict about slavery. For example, Texas' Declaration for Cause of Secession in 1861 was centered on the hatefully exclusionary premise that the governments of various states were established solely for and by a superior white race and that Blacks were naturally inferior and should remain as such. As flawed as the declaration was, and as perverted an account of the ideals of the American government, it laid bare the white supremacist tendency in American cultural and political history.While it is true that, for the monied interests, the war was one of Northern and Southern economies, and for legal scholars, the war may have been about the reach of Federalism, for the overwhelming majority of Americans -- those on the battlefields and those on the plantation fields -- the war was about slavery, a cruel institution undergirded by white supremacy and about a culture suffused with it. These profound fissures in the soul of America were most recently brought to the fore when Dylann Roof, emblazoned in white supremacist paraphernalia, massacred Cynthia Mary Graham Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lee Lance, Depayne Middleton-Doctor, Clementa Pickney, Tywanza Sanders, Daniel Simmons, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton and Myra Thompson in Charleston's historic Emanuel AME Church. Roof acted as an adherent of the rationale that justified slavery, that caused secession, and that remains a part of American society today. The justification for slavery would wed with historical circumstance and have children who later would do their bidding through Jim Crow, the slow genocide of Native communities, Japanese Internment, mass incarceration along racial lines and the school-to-prison-pipeline.And so white supremacy asks us, on the Fourth, to consider ourselves one American people. But this too is an injustice, because it asks many to forget the ways in which the promise of America never applied to them and still remains largely incomplete. Perpetuating the myth of American independence, while it doesn't fully apply to all, cannibalizes the very hope of full emancipation and real equality. As long as the American idea is a contradiction, the Fourth of July will be too. To work our way out of this, we must reflect on and explode these incongruities, not relegate them to the realms of opinion or politics, nor dismiss them as relics of the distant past, but rather recognize them as central to the American condition."

It remains one of the top five patriotic songs that you'll hear on July 4th. This year, it may be sung with special fervor by those who know its back story. The lyrics were written in 1893 by Katharine Lee Bates, who was a professor of English at Wellesley College and a prolific author. She lived for 25 years with her colleague Catherine Coman in what in those days was called a ""Boston marriage"" -- two spinsters sharing a domicile. After Coman died in 1915, Bates published Yellow Clover: A Book of Remembrance that celebrated their love and their involvement in the radical and social reform movements of their day. In light of the recent Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, the poem and the song ""America the Beautiful"" takes on fascinating new dimensions. Were Bates and Coman alive today, they would probably take advantage of the court's decision to publicly seal their marriage.Bates penned the original poem after visiting Pikes Peak in Colorado, from which she saw the Rocky Mountains in one direction and the Great Plains in the other. She was overcome by the beauty of the landscape as well as a sense of patriotism. As a Christian socialist who was part of Boston's progressive circles involved with labor rights, urban slums, and women's suffrage, she was concerned that the United States, in the midst of the Gilded Age's widening inequality, was becoming an overseas empire. When she returned to her hotel room, she wrote a letter to friends, observing that ""countries such as England failed because, while they may have been 'great,' they had not been 'good.'"" She declared, ""Unless we are willing to crown our greatness with goodness, and our bounty with brotherhood, our beloved America may go the same way."" The poem was initially published in 1895 in The Congregationalist to commemorate the Fourth of July. ""America the Beautiful"" is usually heard as an unalloyed paean to American virtue. Bates certainly was writing a paean, but a close reading of her words makes it clear that she had something more in mind. She wrote:America! America! God shed His grace on thee Till selfish gain no longer stain, The banner of the free! She later revised the passage:America! America! May God thy gold refine Till all success be nobleness, And ev'ry gain divine. Bates hoped that a progressive movement, inspired by both religious and secular beliefs, could overcome the Gilded Age's greed. She beseeched God to shed his grace to enable the brotherhood that was possible but not yet realized. Bates' views exemplify an often overlooked current in American culture -- what might be called ""progressive patriotism."" It is the patriotism that cherishes protest and dissent, justice and community, often on behalf of those who have been oppressed or subordinated.President Barack Obama's recent eulogy to those killed in Charleston, delivered on the day after the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage, was another powerful expression of that current in our culture. Echoing Bates, Obama talked about grace in a redemptive context:I'm convinced that by acknowledging the pain and loss of others, even as we respect the traditions, ways of life that make up this beloved country, by making the moral choice to change, we express God's grace. And then he led the audience in singing ""Amazing Grace"" which, in that context, can be heard as patriotic hymn as well as a call for reform. It was a profound choice because, as Obama no doubt knew, it was written by William Newton in 1773 to express his yearning to be redeemed for his life as a slave trader. The president seemed to be saying, we're a society that was built on slavery -- but we can be redeemed. Obama has often expressed sentiments that we call progressive patriotism. For example, in 2008, while running for the president, he spoke to college students in Colorado about national service. Obama, then a Senator from Illinois, said:I have no doubt that, in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it. Loving your country shouldn't just mean watching fireworks on the Fourth of July. Loving your country must mean accepting your responsibility to do your part to change it. If you do, your life will be richer, our country will be stronger. Despite the conventional wisdom that patriotism means ""my country -- right or wrong"" and is best displayed by blind flag-waving, to many Americans patriotism means loyalty to a set of principles, and thus requires dissent and criticism when those in power violate those standards. Progressives understand that people can disagree with their government and still love their country and its ideals. As Martin Luther King said in a speech during the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955, ""the great glory of American democracy is the right to protest for right."" Indeed, throughout U.S. history, many American radicals and progressive reformers have proudly asserted their patriotism. To them, America stood for basic democratic values -- economic and social equality, mass participation in politics, free speech and civil liberties, elimination of the second-class citizenship of women and racial minorities, a welcome mat for the world's oppressed people. The reality of corporate power, right-wing xenophobia and social injustice only fueled progressives' allegiance to these principles and the struggle to achieve them.Most Americans are unaware that much of our patriotic culture -- including many of the leading symbols and songs -- was created by people, like Katherine Lee Bates, with decidedly progressive sympathies.For example, the Pledge of Allegiance was authored and promoted by Francis Bellamy, a leading Christian socialist. Bellamy penned the Pledge of Allegiance in 1892 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' discovery of America by promoting use of the flag in public schools.It was the Gilded Age, an era of major political and social conflict. Reformers were outraged by the widening gap between rich and poor, and the behavior of corporate robber barons who were exploiting workers, gouging consumers and corrupting politics with their money. Workers were organizing unions. Farmers joined forces in the Populist movement to leash the power of banks, railroads and utility companies. Progressive reformers fought for child labor laws, against slum housing, and in favor of women's suffrage. Radicals were gaining new converts.In foreign affairs, Americans were battling over the nation's role in the world. America was beginning to act like an imperial power, justifying its expansion with a combination of white supremacy, manifest destiny, and spreading democracy. At the time, nativist groups in the North and Midwest as well as the South were pushing for restrictions on immigrants -- Catholics, Jews and Asians -- deemed to be polluting Protestant America. In the South, the outcome of the Civil War still inflamed regional passions. Many Southerners, including Civil War veterans, swore allegiance to the Confederate flag.Bellamy (cousin of best-selling radical writer Edward Bellamy) believed that unbridled capitalism, materialism, and individualism betrayed America's promise. He hoped the Pledge of Allegiance would promote a different moral vision to counter the rampant greed he thought was undermining the nation. Bellamy initially intended to use the phrase ""liberty, fraternity and equality,"" but concluded that the radical rhetoric of the French Revolution wouldn't sit well with many Americans. So he coined the phrase, ""one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all,"" intending it to express a more egalitarian vision of America, a secular patriotism to help unite a divided nation.By 1924, the National Flag Conference, led by the American Legion and the Daughters of the American Revolution, changed the Pledge's words, ""my Flag,"" to ""the Flag of the United States of America,"" despite Francis Bellamy's opposition. In 1954, as the Cold War against the Soviet Union (and its atheistic Communism) intensified, the Knights of Columbus led a campaign to add the phrase ""under God"" to the Pledge. Congress agreed and on Flag Day that year, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the law to include those two words. Or consider the lines inscribed on the Statue of Liberty, written by Emma Lazarus: ""Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" Lazarus was a poet of considerable reputation in her day, who was a strong supporter of Henry George and his ""socialistic"" single-tax program, and a friend of William Morris, a leading British socialist. Her welcome to the ""wretched refuse"" of the earth, written in 1883, was an effort to project an inclusive and egalitarian definition of the American Dream.In the Depression years and during World War II, the fusion of populist, egalitarian and anti-racist values with patriotic expression reached full flower.Langston Hughes' poem, ""Let America Be America Again,"" written in 1936, contrasted the nation's promise with its mistreatment of his fellow African-Americans, the poor, Native Americans, workers, farmers and immigrants:O, let my land be a land where Liberty Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath But opportunity is real, and life is free Equality is in the air we breathe. In 1939, composer Earl Robinson teamed with lyricist John La Touche to write ""Ballad for Americans,"" which was performed on the CBS radio network by Paul Robeson, accompanied by chorus and orchestra. This 11-minute cantata provided a musical review of American history, depicted as a struggle between the ""nobody who's everybody"" and an elite that fails to understand the real, democratic essence of America.Robeson, at the time one of the best-known performers on the world stage, became, through this work, a voice of America. Broadcasts and recordings of ""Ballad for Americans"" (by Bing Crosby as well as Robeson) were immensely popular. In the summer of 1940, it was performed at the national conventions of both the Republican and Communist parties. The work soon became a staple in school choral performances, but it was literally ripped out of many public school songbooks after Robinson and Robeson were identified with the radical left and blacklisted during the McCarthy period. Since then, however, ""Ballad for Americans"" has been periodically revived, notably during the bicentennial celebration in 1976, when a number of pop and country singers performed it in concerts and on TV.Aaron Copland's ""Fanfare for the Common Man"" and ""A Lincoln Portrait,"" both written in 1942, are now patriotic musical standards, regularly performed at major civic events. Few Americans know that Copland was a member of a radical composers' group.Many Americans consider Woody Guthrie's song ""This Land Is Your Land,"" penned in 1940, to be our unofficial national anthem. Guthrie, a radical, was inspired to write the song as an answer to Irving Berlin's popular ""God Bless America,"" which he thought failed to recognize that it was the ""people"" to whom America belonged.The words to ""This Land Is Your Land"" reflect Guthrie's assumption that patriotism and support for the underdog were interconnected. In this song, Guthrie celebrated America's natural beauty and bounty, but criticized the country for its failure to share its riches. This is reflected in the song's last and least-known verse, which Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen included when they performed the song in January 2009 at a pre-inaugural concert in front of the Lincoln Memorial, with President-elect Obama in the audience:One bright sunny morning; In the shadow of the steeple; By the relief office; I saw my people. As they stood hungry; I stood there wondering; If this land was made for you and me. During the 1960s, American progressives continued to seek ways to fuse their love of country with their opposition to the government's policies. The March on Washington in 1963 gathered at the Lincoln Memorial, where Martin Luther King Jr. famously quoted the words to ""My Country 'Tis of Thee,"" repeating the phrase ""Let freedom ring"" 11 times.Phil Ochs, then part of a new generation of politically conscious singer-songwriters who emerged during the 1960s, wrote an anthem in the Guthrie vein, ""The Power and the Glory,"" that coupled love of country with a strong plea for justice and equality. The words to the chorus echo the sentiments of the anti-Vietnam War movement:Here is a land full of power and glory; Beauty that words cannot recall; Oh her power shall rest on the strength of her freedom; Her glory shall rest on us all. One of its stanzas updated Guthrie's combination of outrage and patriotism:Yet she's only as rich as the poorest of her poor; Only as free as the padlocked prison door; Only as strong as our love for this land; Only as tall as we stand. This song later became part of the repertoire of the U.S. Army band.And in 1968, in a famous anti-war speech, Norman Thomas, the aging leader of the Socialist Party, proclaimed, ""I come to cleanse the American flag, not burn it.""In recent decades, Bruce Springsteen has most closely followed in the Guthrie tradition. From ""Born in the U.S.A.,"" to his songs about Tom Joad (the militant protagonist in John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath), to his anthem about the 9/11 tragedy (""Empty Sky""), to his album Wrecking Ball (including its opening song, ""We Take Care of Our Own""), Springsteen has championed the downtrodden while challenging America to live up to its ideals.Steve (""Little Stevie"") Van Zandt is best known as the guitarist with Springsteen's E Street Band and for his role as Silvio Dante, Tony Soprano's sidekick on the TV show, ""The Sopranos."" But his most enduring legacy should be his love song about America, ""I Am a Patriot,"" including these lyrics:I am a patriot, and I love my country; Because my country is all I know. Wanna be with my family; People who understand me; I got no place else to go. And I ain't no communist, And I ain't no socialist, And I ain't no capitalist, And I ain't no imperialist, And I ain't no Democrat, Sure ain't no Republican either, I only know one party, And that is freedom. Since the American Revolution, each generation of progressives has expressed an American patriotism rooted in democratic values that challenged jingoism and ""my country -- right or wrong"" thinking. They rejected blind nationalism, militaristic drum beating, and sheep-like conformism. Throughout the United States' history, they have viewed their movements -- abolition of slavery, farmers' populism, women's suffrage, workers' rights, civil rights, environmentalism, gay rights, and others -- as profoundly patriotic. They believed that America's core claims -- fairness, equality, freedom, justice -- were their own.America now confronts a new version of the Gilded Age, brought upon by Wall Street greed and corporate malfeasance. The gap between rich and poor is still widening. Although the economy has improved in recent years, Americans are feeling economically insecure. They are upset by the unbridled selfishness and political influence-peddling demonstrated by banks, oil companies, drug companies, insurance companies, and other large corporations. They are angry at the growing power of American-based global firms that show no loyalty to their country, outsource jobs to low-wage countries, avoid paying taxes, and pollute the environment. Consider Walmart, America's largest corporation. Sam Walton, Walmart's founder, promoted the motto ""Buy American."" But today the retail giant, now owned by his heirs, imports most of its merchandise from Asia, much of it made under sweatshop conditions. We are, once again, battling over immigration and who belongs in America. Some right-wing groups and talk-show pundits, calling themselves patriots, have even challenged the citizenship of our president. These trends have triggered a growing grassroots movement -- reflected by Occupy Wall Street but involving a diverse coalition of community groups, immigrant rights organizations, unions, consumer advocates, and human rights activists -- demanding stronger regulations to protect consumers, workers, and the environment from abusive corporations, living wages, fairer trade, and higher taxes on the very rich to pay for better schools, safer roads, and student loans.This movement, which embodies the idea of ""liberty and justice for all,"" reflects America's tradition of progressive patriotism.So this July 4th, proudly sing Bates' ""America the Beautiful"" and Guthrie's ""This Land is Your Land,"" recite Bellamy's Pledge of Allegiance, and wave the American flag. Remember that conservatives have never had a monopoly on patriotism.Peter Dreier teaches politics at Occidental College.

The article, by Sarah Lyall, is titled ""Bernie Sanders's Revolutionary Roots Were Nurtured in '60s Vermont."" This sketch of the young Sanders is free of obvious malice. It would serve its purpose less effectively if it were malicious. The attitude that Lyall adopts toward Senator Sanders is, instead, mildly and cheerfully disparaging -- affectionate, but at the proper distance of condescension; ironically agreeable, as you are allowed to be in dealing with a second cousin or an eccentric uncle who is a bit of a blowhard. Hers is not the first such article to appear on Sanders in the Times. Is it safe to predict that this will remain the paper's approach to his campaign for as long as he stays in the race?  Though malice is absent, the pejorative shading here begins with the title. Does Sanders today describe himself as a revolutionist? ""Revolutionary roots"" implies that he does. Sanders indeed calls himself a democratic socialist. But it was a pretty steady difference between socialists and communists, throughout the twentieth century, that socialists would choose not to describe themselves as revolutionists. They were radical reformers and tended to reject the violence that revolutionists embrace. ""Radical reformist roots"" would have made a truer but a less eye-catching headline. Symptomatic excerpts from the article follow in boldface, with my comments in italics:[The young Bernie Sanders] came to Vermont in the late 1960s to help plan the upending of the old social order. None of this is likely to change as the contest of ideas in the presidential race grows warmer. ""What contest?"" you may ask. The Republican field has drawn amused contempt from the mainstream media for its array of qualified and unqualified candidates -- the former seeking ever more assiduously to resemble the latter -- and its consensus that climate change is a hoax, and that we should have more wars, less immigration, no unions, and work together to facilitate the extinction of public education. The exception is Rand Paul, with his stand against warrantless mass surveillance and his opposition to the executive policy on drone strikes and the Libya war. The Democrats have been saved from embarrassment by their lack of interest in public discussion. With the exception of Bernie Sanders: his announcement of his candidacy and early speeches in Wisconsin and Iowa have shown no slackening in the force of his criticism of Wall Street and the multinationals. Almost alone, he gives a voice to the widespread disaffection today with American politics generally, and the well-earned suspicion of vested interests that for three decades have set limits on reform. From the viewpoint of the political and corporate establishment, such popular discontents must be controlled, domesticated, shepherded, and the dissatisfactions made somehow laughable. Every amusing and dismissive report on a figure like Sanders or Paul goes to serve that larger purpose."

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called the referendum last Saturday, giving Greece just eight days to organize a national ballot and come to an informed decision about how to vote. Tsipras and his government have urged Greeks to vote ""no,"" arguing that the proposal would increase the burden that years of austerity measures have already put on Greece's struggling economy. Tsipras' political opponents and European leaders have appealed for a 'yes' vote, warning Greece would face economic disaster and a possible exit from the euro currency if a bailout deal is not reached. Opinion polls this week appeared to show the two camps neck-and-neck.The Council of Europe, which monitors human rights in Europe, warned that the vote falls short of international standards because of its rushed organization and the complexity of the question. âBecause of the short notice it is not evident whether the content of the questions and the consequences of the decision are fully clear,â Daniel HÃ¶ltgen, spokesman for the secretary-general of the Council of Europe, Thorbjorn Jagland, told The Wall Street Journal.On Friday, Greeceâs top administrative court rejected a legal appeal by two Greek citizens to suspend the referendum. They had argued the vote was unconstitutional because it asked the populace to decide a question of public finances, used confusing technical terminology and required that voters be able to access and comprehend complex financial documents. The long-winded referendum question refers to two documents that outline international creditors' debt sustainability analysis and proposals for Greek reforms. Besides being fairly inaccessible to a general audience, the documents had to be translated into Greek and contained at least one translation error, Bloomberg News pointed out. To add even more confusion, it's not clear that the proposals they are voting on are still even available to Greece. The nation's creditors have indicated that the bailout offer that is on the ballot has already expired, after the parties failed to reach a deal for a new assistance package by Tuesday's deadline, The New York Times reported. Greece also missed a deadline for a debt payment to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday and the ensuing economic turmoil prompted the government to limit cash withdrawals and shut down banks this week, even as authorities scrambled to assemble a nationwide vote.Meanwhile, commentators and Greek voters remain perplexed about what the consequences of their vote may be, whichever way they go. âNo one is really telling us what it means,â 27-year-old Athens resident Erika Papamichalopoulou told The New York Times. âNo one is saying what will happen to us if we say yes, or what will happen to us if we say no.â "

Cupertino, California, and Anchorage, Alaska's largest city, also canceled firework shows.Nine people suffered minor injuries at Avon, Colorado's ""Salute to the USA"" fireworks show on Friday night after a malfunction sent some of the spectacular explosives into the crowd rather than into the sky, town manager Virginia Egger said in a statement.Revelers on the beaches of North Carolina were warned by the National Park Service to use extra caution after seven shark attacks were recorded in the state by midday Thursday, surpassing the previous high of four in 2014 according to the International Shark Attack File. That won't deter some from the surf, said shark file curator George Burgess.A celebration in Austin, Texas featured country music legend Willie Nelson at an all-day picnic replete with music and drinking. And in Oklahoma, the record to beat at the ""Watermelon Seed Spittin' World Championship"" in Pauls Valley, about 60 miles (100 km) southeast of Oklahoma City, was 66 feet, 11 inches (20.41 meters), set in 1989 by Jack Dietz of Chicago, organizers said.

Regardless of where you are in your professional development -- a student, a recent graduate just starting out, or a seasoned expert desiring to make a change -- this is an optimal time for you to favorably position yourself in the employment market.The following six tips are universal, time-tested strategies that serve as the foundation for a strong job search.Before beginning your job search, it's important for you to change your perspective. Job searching is more than just finding a ""job;"" it's finding the right opportunity to broaden your experience and cultivate the necessary skills to propel you further in your career.Students and professionals I have counseled who have regularly applied these strategies have obtained positive results. Almost without fail, those who were unsuccessful did not. Notice that it is the consistent practice of these strategies that yields results. In addition, this aspect of one's professional development should become second-nature. Even when you obtain a desired job, it isn't the time to relax and become comfortable, but to continue this process in order to stay on top of your career game.Now, without further ado, let us begin:1. Adjust Your AttitudeWe all know that attitude is everything. Unfortunately, there is a huge difference between those who are merely aware of this and those who actually put this into practice.Be the type of person people want to help and be around because of your positive attitude. Being obnoxious or negative will not get you very far. Attitude determines opportunities. Be optimistic, well-mannered and professional to everyone -- no matter what.2. Follow Your PassionI can vividly remember the second half of my first year summer when I interned with Cochran, Neufeld, and Scheck in New York. To be able to work with such brilliant legal minds on civil rights cases was exhilarating! At the end of the internship, we asked Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck for career advice. They said to always follow our passion and not to do things merely for money-the money will come when we follow our passion.I immediately thought that was easy for them to say as famous members of OJ's Dream Team who obtain multimillion dollar verdicts. I was a little disappointed because I wanted specific tips on how to do the same. Little did I know at the time that their simple advice would prove useful and serve me well. I have always excelled at those jobs I was passionate about and which allowed me to grow professionally. The same will hold true for you.3. Be Strategically FlexibleAlthough this may sound contradictory to the prior tip, it isn't. In pursuing your passion, you may find that there a few detours you must take along the way and many routes available for obtaining your goals. This is especially the case as the constant changes in the employment market force you to be strategically flexible.Not being strategically flexible is one of the biggest mistakes many students and professionals make. There is a tendency to doggedly adhere to a particular outcome, despite its disadvantages, and miss out on enriching opportunities that have enormous potential for professional development and satisfaction. Those who are strategically flexible, making the most of their opportunities on the way to obtaining their ultimate goals, will reap tremendous benefits.4. Use Your Career Services OfficeAnother big mistake students and alumni make is the failure to adequately utilize their career services offices. These offices are usually staffed with professionals who have practical experience and can assist you in your job search.The more the advisors know about you and your interests, the better they can assist you. If you are dissatisfied with your assigned advisor, visit another advisor who can help you. Advisors are paid to develop employment networks, as well as keep abreast of the latest employment updates and trends. Additionally, these offices have access to a number of career development resources and programs that are available to students and alumni. It is usually evident to employers which applicants use their career services offices and which do not. In light of this, it would be foolish to disregard such a beneficial resource.5. Research and Stay on Top of Current Market TrendsThe significance of this cannot be overstated. Just as market research is important in the business context, it's equally important for those seeking employment to research current trends. For instance, if you are interested in a particular area, you should research things such as a list of schools with relevant programming/coursework and strong alumni contacts when deciding where to attend, as well as geographic locations, prospective job growth, types of positions (i.e., internships and paid jobs) available, information from professionals in these areas, etc.As you advance professionally, you should continue your research, regularly assessing yourself, your goals and your strategic plan. Remember, if you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.6. NetworkFinally, the rewards of networking, both off and online, are enormous. Although the world seems vast, you will be amazed at how small it really is when your network expands. For introverts who hate networking, simply think of networking in its most basic form: a way of getting to know new people and cultivating relationships. This alleviates the pressure of trying to find a job, and you'll find that things go smoother when you do not appear desperate.Professional social networking sites have made networking even easier. Remember to remain professional online. Additionally, be creative when choosing which events to attend, and try to meet as many people as possible. Turn to volunteering, both inside and outside of your desired field, to develop different skills and expand your network.Bottom LineHigher education is an expensive investment. Choose wisely and make this investment work for you by taking charge of your career with these six simple tips!"

""Greece must say 'no!'""Like so many other Millennials, Georganta feels her life has been stalled by Greece's seven-year financial crisis. She views Sunday's referendum as a chance to challenge the institutions controlling the terms of Greek debt relief -- or, as she put it, ""to take our fate into our own hands."" A line is 20 people long outside a bank in Athens. Capital controls and bank closures mean citizens can only withdraw 60 euros per day. Photo by Tania Karas.Greek voters are sharply divided. Opinion polls published Friday showed a nearly even yes-no split. Younger people, however, are far more in favor of ""no:"" 71 percent of those between ages 18 to 24 support ""no,"" along with 59 percent of those aged 25 to 34, according to polling firm Public Issue.The poll also showed widespread confusion over whether the referendum is about Greece leaving the Eurozone. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who campaigned on a promise to end austerity, has insisted the vote is only about rejecting creditors' bailout terms.Georganta said she thinks voting ""no"" will force the rest of Europe to respect the Greek peoples' mandate in electing Tsipras' radical left-wing Syriza party in January.""Our future is unsure,"" said Georganta, who can't afford to move out of her parents' home despite the long hours she works as a hotel receptionist. ""Everyone I know is taking antidepressant pills. I will vote no, for dignity and democracy.""Others in her generation, however, are just as passionate that voting ""no"" would be reckless and devastating for the country's economy.Philipp Brinkmann, the 34-year-old founder of Greek online travel agency TravelPlanet24, said his business has suffered due to capital controls -- the restrictions Greece has placed on the flow of money. Banks have been closed this week, and citizens can withdraw just 60 euros per day from ATMs. In addition, with bank transfers banned, many Greek companies are unable to pay their suppliers.""Those who want 'no' are tired of the program from the last six years and think we just need to try something else,"" Brinkmann said. ""What we need to understand is that it can get worse."" Dimitris Koutsolioutsos, the 30-year-old founder of Farmers Republic, a startup that brings together customers and Greek farmers, said the economic and political turbulence that comes with a ""no"" vote would force fledging businesses out of the country. ""We have two choices: one bad, and one really chaotic,"" he said. ""So we should choose bad. For me and my business, 'no' comes with no future. We'll have no option but to move abroad.""He also called the referendum a ""fraud,"" because citizens are being asked to vote on a deal that is no longer on the table.""The government created polarization in their own people,"" Koutsolioutsos added.Society's deep divide is evident in the posters and graffiti around Athens this week. Giant blown-up photos of German Finance Minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble declare: ""For five years he's been sucking your blood. Tell him NO now."" But just as many posters read: ""Yes to Europe. Yes to Greece.""This tiny nation of 11 million was hit harder by the financial crisis than any other country in Europe. More than 26 percent of its workforce is out of work. Youth unemployment is more than 50 percent.Twenty-four-year-old Apostolia Gkika, who is unemployed and finished her master's degree last year, said she will cast her ""no"" vote in favor of ""dignity and solidarity.""""I will fight for that,"" she said, adding that austerity created poverty in Greece and other European nations that suffered during the crisis. ""We are part of a wave that is trying to change Europe. It will catch on in Spain and Portugal and other countries.""George Hampsas, a 22-year-old mechanical engineering student at the National Technical University of Athens, said his vote of ""no"" will be a vote of confidence in Greece.Bulletin boards around his campus are filled with advertisements for jobs in Germany, England and Dubai -- but never in Greece, he said. He believes voting ""yes"" for more austerity would do little for Greece's job growth. And he wants to build his career in his home country rather than be part of his generation's brain drain.""'No' is not an easy answer, but with 'yes' we are doomed,"" Hampsas said. ""At least with a strong 'no' there will be a crack of light in the window, a possibility for a future.""Follow The GroundTruth Project on Twitter: www.twitter.com/GroundTruth"

Although the negotiation may have not come to an end yet, the rapid and dramatic developments of the past days, which have already caused significant changes, some of which might not be easily reversible, makes it imperative to take a stand on the current state of affairs. In my view, the decision to hold a referendum is a mistake, maybe the last one, in an overall bad negotiation. The Greek government made three key negotiating mistakes. Someone with basic knowledge of the history and theory of international relations can easily identify them. More specifically: The government delayed for too long the conclusion of the negotiations. It is common knowledge that time always runs in favor of the more powerful party in a negotiation. This is even truer when the position of the weaker party is weakened day by day, thus reducing the prospects of achieving a good deal. Obviously, the weak party in this negotiation is Greece. Given that throughout the negotiation period there has been increased uncertainty as to its outcome, the real economy has stalled, as investment and consumption decisions have been suspended, while Greek citizens began to withdraw their deposits from the banks effectively causing a ""slow"" bank run. Under these circumstances, the Greek banks started to depend on the emergency liquidity assistance mechanism (ELA) for their liquidity and ultimately for their survival, whereas the Greek government became increasingly dependent on the disbursement of funding by the creditors. In other words, with every additional day of delay the Greek government was becoming more dependent on those it was negotiating with! The fact that the first months of negotiations were wasted on purely symbolic issues (such as the new name of the Troika or the place of meeting of the technocrats) resulted in a prolongation of negotiations, which undermined the Greek side's bargaining power, while at the same time increased the cost of any agreement, due to the increasing recession, uncertainty and the resulting decline in government revenue. It seems that this attitude has not been accidental -- after all, since the very beginning of the negotiations the Greek side has conceived the negotiation as a ""game of chicken,"" i.e. a negotiation where both sides appear unyielding until someone succumbs. However, this approach is highly problematic. First, even assuming that this particular game correctly reflects the dynamics of the negotiation, according to what has been said above, it is obvious that the one to succumb first could not be any other than the Greek side. Moreover, it is not at all certain that we should view the negotiation in this way. Negotiations like these, which take place between the Greek government and its European partners, are ""repeated games,"" where ex-ante knowledge that the same parties will have to negotiate again in the future makes the issue of credibility a top priority, as well as a requirement to achieve better results for everyone. The adoption of tactics that reduce credibility inexorably leads to negative results. As a result of these negotiation practices, we have been led to an impasse in the negotiation and hence the decision to hold a referendum. One could reasonably wonder, however: Is it only the Greek side to blame for this conclusion? We ought to remember that the institutions had already demonstrated substantial flexibility, by having accepted a significant reduction of the primary surplus, not only for 2015 but also for the years to come, a success that should be attributed to the government. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the European partners did not demonstrate the necessary adaptability and flexibility during the past week, when the government tabled a substantial proposal with measures approximately worth â¬8 bn. Despite the significant inadequacies of the Greek proposal (some of its provisions were not particularly realistic as to their performance, whereas the proposed mix of measures was highly recessionary), the reaction of the other side was unexpected and did not facilitate a quick and unimpeded agreement. According to available sources, however, until the evening of June 27 the negotiation was continuing and a more favorable proposal was on the table -- the remaining differences were very small. Why, then, was the decision to hold a referendum made? Several government officials have already admitted that this was a move of negotiation tactics, in an attempt to elicit a better agreement from the creditors. The decision to hold a referendum cannot be easily understood. The decision is problematic because it entails all three negotiating mistakes: it is unclear, it came at the wrong time and exhausted completely the credibility of the government. As far as ambiguity is concerned, it is not clear what the referendum would offer the government from a bargaining perspective, given that the problem of the government does not lie in its democratic legitimacy as it has a fresh mandate. In fact, in view of the very problematic referendum question, which relates to a draft proposal (not even the final one), and the government's unwillingness to clarify what each answer (""Yes"" or ""No"") would exactly mean for the day after (thus the citizens are literally asked to vote blindfolded), the response to the referendum would not offer a definite solution to the impasse. Even a ""No"" answer -- which is promoted by the government would have an unclear impact, as it concerns a specific proposal. If the creditors table a slightly better proposal, changing for example two or three paragraphs, will it be accepted? In other words, did we walk into this unprecedented adventure for a few hundred million? If this is the case, the referendum process, which constitutes a quintessential democratic procedure, has been completely abused. Moreover, contrary to the government's intentions, the reactions of the European partners reveal that a ""No"" answer would minimize the chances of a new agreement. In addition, the timing of the referendum is totally incorrect. If it is part of the negotiation tactics, then why did it come at the last moment, when it is known in advance that the program is coming to an end and that the banking system of Greece will have no access to liquidity from the European Central Bank? In other words, why is the referendum held at a time when both the Greek state (which failed to repay the IMF on June 30th) and the banking system are on the verge of collapse? Does this situation enhance the bargaining power of the country? Why did the referendum not take place earlier, without the country being in such a state of vulnerability? Finally, this development has exhausted the remaining ""stock"" of credibility of the government. The complete loss of trust, which is now reflected in the latest statements of foreign officials, was sealed with the decision to hold a referendum, which surprised the creditors as it was announced a few hours before the convening of a Eurogroup programmed to work out at the final agreement. In my opinion, this latest negotiating maneuver can only yield worse results. After the closure of banks, the economy is now in a dramatic situation. Transactions have been frozen de facto, whereas uncertainty hinders both investment and consumption decisions, since everyone wants to hold their euros in cash as a safeguard against unforeseen developments in the near future. The deterioration of the economic situation is bound to further raise the cost of any agreement, which will in turn make a new compromise even more difficult. The more this situation continues, the more the economy will be immersed in uncertainty and a complete standstill, thus resulting in a further increase in unemployment and the collapse of the living standards of Greek citizens. On the other hand, the dangers that stem from a possible discontinuation of ELA funding, given that the country is no longer in a program, are incalculable for the banking system and have extremely unpleasant potential effects -- even more unpleasant than the ones we are faced with today. Moreover, those who respond to all these developments with lightheartedness, saying that our possible return to the drachma would not be a big deal, I would say that such a stance reveals a complete ignorance of history and economics. Greece is not the first country to undergo such a crisis; we have several examples of countries that went through similar crises in the past and thus we know the consequences -- disastrous in the short-term and at best uncertain and risky in the medium-term, since Greece would be deprived of its strategic European orientation with incalculable consequences at both the economic and geopolitical level. Unfortunately, we have reached the point -- admittedly with the responsibility of all governments following the regime change in Greece in 1974 (Metapolitefsi) -- where our options are extremely limited: either a bad agreement that keeps us alive and offers hope for a better future in Europe, or a certain economic disaster in the short-term, combined with an extremely uncertain, dangerous and definitely poorer future for the coming generations.This post originally appeared on HuffPost Greece and was translated into English. _________________ Dimitris Katsikas is a Lecturer in the Department of Political Science and Public Administration, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.

Opinion polls on Friday gave the 'Yes' camp, which favors accepting the bailout terms, a slender lead but all were within the margin of error and pollsters said the vote was too close to call.Only one had the 'No' vote winning, despite a turnout of at least 50,000 opponents of the deal at a rally in central Athens on Friday that appeared significantly bigger than a simultaneous rally by the 'Yes' camp.""What they're asking us to accept is eternal slavery,"" said Ermioni Tenekidou, 54, a teacher.Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble of Germany, Greece's biggest creditor and toughest critic, said any so-called Grexit, Greek exit from the euro zone, might only be temporary.""Greece is a member of the euro zone. There's no doubt about that. Whether with the euro or temporarily without it: only the Greeks can answer this question. And it is clear that we will not leave the people in the lurch,"" he said.But it is far from clear how a temporary exit from the 19-nation euro currency bloc might work. Some economists have raised the idea of a temporary suspension, whereby Greece would revert to a national currency for a number of years until its economy stabilized.  ""TERRORISM""Greece's European partners say the euro zone is better placed to minimize the impact on its vulnerable southern flank from a Greek exit than several years ago when the debt crisis exploded. But Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said Europe stood to lose more than Greece.""If Greece crashes, a trillion euros (the equivalent of Spain's GDP) will be lost. It's too much money and I don't believe Europe could allow it,"" he told Spanish newspaper El Mundo.Varoufakis reiterated he would resign if Greeks vote 'Yes', and accused creditors of trying to terrorize voters by capping a liquidity line to Greek banks.""What they're doing with Greece has a name: terrorism,"" he told El Mundo. ""Why have they forced us to close the banks? To frighten people.""In an article in the Greek daily Kathimerini, Varoufakis wrote: ""The EU will have no legal grounds to throw Greece out of the euro, and then the real negotiation will start with creditors.""Greece accounts for barely 2 percent of the euro zone's economic output, but its exit would represent a massive blow to the prestige of the grand project to bind Europe's nations into an unbreakable union.""Even if we can cope with such a development in terms of financial policy, a Grexit would be a disastrous signal to countries outside the European Union,"" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper.""Europe's reputation and credibility would be damaged in parts of the world.""  It would also spell even greater hardship for Greece, stricken by economic crisis that has left one in four workers without a job, hammered pensions and pay and fueled political instability.The Greek bakery chain Venetis said it had decided to provide free bread to pensioners, the jobless and homeless for as long as banks remain closed. ""It's our turn to support those in need,"" Managing Director Panagiotis Monemvasiotis told Reuters.Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper, citing a ""senior negotiator"" among Greece's creditors, said the Athens government had money ""for perhaps a week, but certainly not much longer.""Critics accuse Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, a 40-year-old former student protest leader, of gambling Greece's future by calling a plebiscite with eight days' notice after negotiations with the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund hit a wall.They point out that the offer Greeks will vote on is no longer on the table and the question is worded in cryptic legalese, leading the Council of Europe, a major European rights watchdog, to say the plebiscite falls short of international standards of fairness.Echoing a defiant Tsipras at Friday's 'No' rally, 60-year-old teacher Giorgos Sarafianos said the referendum was a question of ""dignity.""""The only message that can be sent tomorrow is that if we want to be part of the European community, it should not be with our heads bowed,"" he said.(Additional reporting by Michele Kambas in ATHENS, Paul Day in MADRID and Madeline Chambers in BERLIN; Writing by Matt Robinson; Editing by Janet Lawrence) "
