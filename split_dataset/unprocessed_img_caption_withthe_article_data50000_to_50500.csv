And Uber lost.,2016-08-01,Uber is making peace with its main rival in China.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579f96082a0000fa01fb3f5d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Uber lost its fight to break into the teeming Chinese transportation market on Monday when it agreed to sell its China operations to Didi Chuxing, its primary rival there.And what a fight it was. Uber has handily overtaken competitors in the U.S. like Lyft and Sidecar, forcing some rivals to join forces in hopes that, by creating alliances, they can become formidable challengers to the industry juggernaut. But no competitor seems to have riled the company as much Didi, whose tacticians play by the same scorched-earth strategies Uber has used to win market share around the world. That makes the internal memo sent by Didi President Jean Liu announcing the two companies’ new arrangement so fascinating and bizarre.In the memo, obtained by the Financial Times, she rhapsodizes about the two-year battle:Uber, according to Didi president Jean Liu, “has done better than any Silicon Valley company in China” she said in a flowery internal email announcing the deal: “Uber has been a grand rival and we have had an epic battle … We raged an earth-shaking war, and when we join hands, our love will last till the end of time.”The roughly $35 billion deal gives San Francisco-based Uber Technologies a one-fifth stake in Didi, which won a major coup three months ago when it secured $1 billion funding round from Apple.The agreement also allows Uber ― the world’s most valuable private startup, at $62.5 billion ― to invest in other markets and tie up loose ends as it prepares for an initial public offering that’s expected sometime in the next year. To do well as a publicly-traded company, Uber needs to prove that it’s making money, which it claims to be doing in the U.S. and Canada. Huge losses in China, pegged at about $2 billion over the last two years, hampered that growth. Note: The Huffington Post’s Editor-in-Chief Arianna Huffington is a member of Uber’s board of directors, and has recused herself from any involvement in the site’s coverage of the company."
1,POLITICS,Vets In Congress Urge Paul Ryan To Un-Endorse Trump,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-donald-trump-veterans_us_579f912de4b0e2e15eb6a467,"""The profound disrespect Mr. Trump has shown toward Gold Star parents is a new low.""",2016-08-01,Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is trying to straddle the line between supporting Donald Trump for president while denouncing virtually everything Trump says. Good luck with that!,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579f91942a00000002fb3f45.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The fallout over Donald Trump’s attacks on the family of a Muslim American soldier continued Monday as military vets in Congress urged Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to drop his endorsement for his party’s presidential nominee.“As veterans who previously served on active duty, we are horrified by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s slander of parents whose son died serving our country,” reads a letter to Ryan, signed by Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu (Calif.), Ruben Gallego (Ariz.) and Seth Moulton (Mass.).“Your continued endorsement of Mr. Trump’s hateful, bigoted and sexist vision threatens the integrity of the House of Representatives in which we serve,” they wrote. “We were heartened by your first instinct, which was not to endorse Mr. Trump. We respectfully request that you follow what we believe your heart is telling you and withdraw your endorsement of him now.”Their letter comes after last week’s moving speech at the Democratic National Convention by Khizr Khan, who spoke of the heroism of his son, U.S. Army Capt. Humayun S.M. Khan, who was killed in Iraq while protecting his troops. Khizr Khan denounced Trump and his proposed ban on Muslims, asking if the real estate mogul has even read the Constitution. Trump responded by criticizing Khan for saying he has “sacrificed nothing,” claiming Khan “has no right” to say “inaccurate things” in front of millions of people. He also questioned why Khan’s wife Ghazala, who stood by his side during his speech, didn’t speak, suggesting she wasn’t allowed to talk because Islam oppresses women.That hasn’t gone over well with anyone, including Republicans.Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong declined to say Monday if Ryan would pull his support for Trump over the flap. Instead, she pointed to a statement Ryan issued over the weekend, in which he says Capt. Khan’s sacrifice should be honored but says nothing about Trump himself.“Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Khan was one such brave example,” reads Ryan’s statement. “His sacrifice ― and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan ― should always be honored. Period.”There are dozens of military veterans in Congress, and for those who are Republican, Trump’s latest flap makes it even more difficult for them to stand by their party’s nominee. The Huffington Post reached out to ten GOP lawmakers who served overseas, randomly selected, to see if they still endorse Trump for president ― or if they plan to formally endorse Trump at all. Only a few responded.“The Congressman has yet to endorse,” said Maura Gillespie, a spokeswoman for Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.).“Rep. Coffman has not endorsed Trump,” said Cinamon Watson, a spokeswoman for Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.). “In fact, Rep. Coffman has voiced grave concern about Mr. Trump’s policies and his tone.”That’s not the full story, though. A Coffman aide said in February the congressman would “obviously” support Trump over Clinton.“Of course Hunter is still on board with Trump,” added Joe Kasper, a spokesman for Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.). “But I think this is a real learning lesson for Trump in that he’s got to be more careful when discussing points of such sensitivity. In this case, he should have acknowledged the sacrifice and separated it from the broader policy issue, but he’s still right on the problem related to immigration and I have no doubt that he believes anyone who makes the ultimate sacrifice is the truest of heroes.”Aides to Republican Reps. Doug Collins (Ga.), Brad Wenstrup (Ohio), Joe Heck (Nev.), Martha McSally (Ariz.), Scott Perry (Pa.) and Republican Sens. Joni Ernst (Iowa) and Tom Cotton (Ark.) did not respond to a request for comment."

America’s Army is the best-trained, best-equipped land force on the planet,” Obama said while speaking at the Disabled Veterans Convention in Atlanta, Georgia.The president emphasized that “no one ― no one ― has given more for our freedom and security than our Gold Star families,” referring to those whose loved ones have died fighting in the United States military. That includes Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004.Khan criticized Trump while speaking at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, saying Trump has “sacrificed nothing.” Trump responded by claiming he’s “made a lot of sacrifices” in order to create jobs, tweeting that he was “viciously attacked” by Khan.While many have praised the actions of Humayun Khan, his father has been smeared as a terrorist for speaking out against Trump.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
3,RELIGION,An Absurdly Large Number Of Australians Say Their Religion Is The Force,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/australian-jedi-census-atheist_us_579f7a8ae4b0693164c1ef12,And Australian atheists are not happy about it.,2016-08-01,"In 2011, about <a href=""http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4102.0Main+Features30Nov+2013#returnofthejedi"" target=""_blank"" role=""link"" class="" js-entry-link cet-external-link"" data-vars-item-name=""64,000"" data-vars-item-type=""text"" data-vars-unit-name=""579f7a8ae4b0693164c1ef12"" data-vars-unit-type=""buzz_body"" data-vars-target-content-id=""http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4102.0Main+Features30Nov+2013#returnofthejedi"" data-vars-target-content-type=""url"" data-vars-type=""web_external_link"" data-vars-subunit-name=""article_body"" data-vars-subunit-type=""component"" data-vars-position-in-subunit=""5"">64,000</a> Australians reported that they were Jedi.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579f88b82a00002e004f79dd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Force may be too strong in Australia. Since around 2001, some cheeky Australians have been listing Jedi or a variant as their religion in the country’s census. During Australia’s last census in 2011, the number of Australians who claimed allegiance to The Force rose to about 64,000 ― a little bit less than the number of Sikhs in the country and more than the number of Seventh Day Adventists.But what started as a “post-modernest Star Wars joke” has turned into a headache for the country’s atheists, who claim that it makes Australia seem more religious than it is. Kylie Sturgess, president of the Atheist Foundation of Australia, told the Brisbane Times that the census shouldn’t be treated as a joke. According to the AFA, when Australians use the “other” box in the religion section to write in a religion like Jedi, it gets counted as an undefined religion, rather than “no religion.” The AFA’s Mark No Religion campaign is encouraging people to respond honestly to the 2016 census, which is scheduled to take place on August 9. Jediism is inspired by The Star Wars series and patches together aspects of Taoism, Buddhism, Catholicism, and other faiths. While some see it as a serious religious affiliation, others see the rise of Jediism in Australia as a reflection of the fact that the country is becoming an increasingly secular.Australia’s religious landscape has changed significantly over the past century. In the 1911 census, just .4 percent of Australians chose “no religion” when asked about their religious identity. In 2011, 22 percent of Australians answered “no religion” in response to the census. With a few more percentage points, this group could potentially knock Catholicism, which at 25 percent is currently Australia’s largest religious denomination, out of the top spot. An accurate portrait of Australia’s religious groups matters because, according to AFA, exaggerations in the data may “lead to groups wielding disproportionate influence within government.”“Answering the religion question thoughtfully and honestly matters because it benefits all Australians when decisions on how to spend taxpayer dollars are made on sound data that accurately reflects modern-day Australia,” Sturgess said. In response to recommendations from users, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which is in charge of the census, moved the “no religion” option to the top of list of choices of religious affiliation, making it easier for people to find. Brian Morris, a secular activist in Australia, is hoping that this move encourages people who are “culturally religious” but have drifted away from their faith’s tenets to be honest about where they stand now ― whether they’re atheist, agnostic, or something more undefined.“Having ‘No Religion’ as first option also encourages a more considered response, rather than a reflex action to mark one’s past ‘family religion,’” Morris wrote in a blog for The Huffington Post. “The new ABS format may also encourage those who mark Spaghetti Monster, Jedi and Santa Claus to think more seriously about their religious affiliation, or lack thereof.”"

The LDP instead drafted Masuda, 64, who once served as governor of a rural prefecture.“Taking this result very heavily, as the new governor I would like move forward firmly with the administration of the metropolis,” Koike, an experienced politician fluent in English and Arabic, told supporters.“I would like to move forward with a metropolitan administration such as has never happened, never been seen, together with all of you.”The NHK exit poll showed Masuda was in second place, with Torigoe, a 76-year-old cancer survivor who was backed by several opposition parties, trailed both.The sprawling city of some 13.5 million people faces a plethora of problems such as an aging population, daycare shortage, and the ever-present possibility of a big earthquake.But a big issue in the campaign was the 2020 Olympics, which Japan hopes will spur its economy, struggling to escape decades of deflation.Construction of the main stadium has been delayed and the original logo for the games had to be scrapped after plagiarism accusations.After the resignations of the city’s two previous governors, Koike will be responsible for saving Tokyo’s reputation as host for the games.One of her first duties will be to travel to Rio de Janeiro when the curtain comes down on next month’s games there to accept the Olympic flag as the next host.“The Olympics are right in front of us. I want to use them as a chance to build a new Tokyo for beyond 2020,” Koike said when the campaign began.Though the LDP and its coalition partner backed Masuda, fallout for Abe will likely be minimal despite Masuda’s loss.“This is basically a Tokyo issue,” said Kenji Yumoto, vice chairman of the Japan Research Institute think-tank. “Abe’s prestige probably won’t be damaged and support for the LDP won’t fall.”"

John McCain (R-Ariz.), who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war, praised the late Army Capt. Humayun Khan for being “an example of true American greatness” after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticized his parents, Khizr and Ghazala Khan.Trump criticized Khizr for saying at the Democratic National Convention that the business mogul has “sacrificed nothing,” claiming Khan “has no right” to say “inaccurate things” in front of millions. McCain condemned Trump’s statements, thanking the Khans for immigrating to America and for their son’s sacrifice.“It is time for Donald Trump to set the example for our country and the future of the Republican Party. While our Party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us,” McCain said Monday in a statement.“Lastly, I’d like to say to Mr. and Mrs. Khan: thank you for immigrating to America. We’re a better country because of you,” he added. “And you are certainly right; your son was the best of America, and the memory of his sacrifice will make us a better nation – and he will never be forgotten.”Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) also criticized Trump for his comments on Khan, advising the candidate in a statement to “focus on jobs and national security and stop responding to every criticism whether it’s from a grieving family or Hillary Clinton.”Trump was criticized in July 2015 for questioning whether McCain was a “war hero” and saying he likes “people who weren’t captured.” In May 2016, McCain said it was “foolish” to not embrace Trump as the GOP nominee, calling Republicans who were hesitant to back Trump “out of step” with voters.Not all Republicans are critical of Trump’s comments about the Khans. Roger Stone, a political operative and Trump ally, tweeted Sunday that Khan was a “Muslim Brotherhood agent helping Hillary [Clinton].”Read McCain’s full statement on Trump and Khan below:The Republican Party I know and love is the party of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight D.

The Department of Child Services took custody of him, police said.Mark Clark, a public information officer with the Pinal County Sheriff’s office, told The Huffington Post that this is the first time the agency has responded to a call involving “Pokemon Go.” The department cautioned citizens in a July 11 Facebook post to beware of distracted driving while playing the game, he noted. While most people are having fun playing “Pokemon Go,” the game has led some other players to have encounters with the law. In Las Vegas, one man’s attempt to rob a group of people playing the game ended in a shootout.

He and director Paul Greengrass argued that 2007’s “The Bourne Ultimatum” had brought the character full circle by filling him in on the shadowy bureaucratic maneuvers that transformed him into a killing machine. What was left?Be it creative spark or big paydays, the pair were somehow lured back to the series. That’s good news for Universal, which ran the risk of losing a Tiffany franchise without Damon’s involvement. In the interim, the studio had made an ill-conceived attempt at cinematic universe building with “The Bourne Legacy,” introducing Jeremy Renner as another amnesic ass-kicker dubbed Aaron Cross. The crowds didn’t exactly flock to see this sub-Bourne, and the film grossed about $150 million less than “The Bourne Ultimatum” globally.As a sign of Damon’s appeal, audience surveys reveal that the actor’s presence above-the-title was the second most frequently cited reason that people turned up for “Jason Bourne.”“It’s no secret that people were anticipating a reunion of [Damon and Greengrass],” said Nick Carpou, Universal’s domestic distribution chief, adding “Putting the team back together made smart business sense.”“Jason Bourne” marks the series’ second highest opening, behind “The Bourne Ultimatum’s” $69.3 million debut. When adjusted for inflation, however, it trails all but “The Bourne Legacy’s” opening weekends. Universal spent $120 million to make the latest installment and released it in 4,026 theaters.“It proves that this is a franchise that’s still viable and that it can continue if they want to keep making them,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at ComScore. “’Jason Bourne’ is the perfect title for this film, because that’s who everyone wanted to see return.”Aaron Cross...not so much.Even with Bourne’s resurgence commanding most of the attention, the weekend’s other major new wide release managed to score a respectable debut. STX Entertainment’s “Bad Moms” opened to a healthy $23.4 million and a third place finish. That’s a strong return on the film’s $20 million production budget. It also gives STX Entertainment a much needed win after its other summer release, the Civil War drama “Free State of Jones” collapsed at multiplexes.“Bad Moms” was originally set up at Paramount Pictures and was intended to star Leslie Mann with the actress’ husband and frequent collaborator Judd Apatow producing. But Mann dropped out, as did Apatow, and the project migrated to STX. It stars Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn as women who reject the pressure to be perfect parents, and instead indulge in hard partying and a more relaxed, Chablis-fueled approach to child-rearing.“It is a terrific movie that has a lot of heart and a lot of laughs and it plays great across the board,” said Kevin Grayson, STX’s domestic distribution chief.Grayson believes the film will continue to draw crowds in the coming weeks, because there are no other raunchy comedies with female leads on deck. That could help the picture withstand “Suicide Squad’s” opening next weekend. The comic book movie is tracking to open to as much as $125 million, establishing a new record for an August launch.STX is the brainchild of Robert Simonds, the producer of “Cheaper by the Dozen” and “The Pink Panther” films. Armed with backing from the likes of TPG, Hony Capital and Huayi Brothers, the studio has ambitions to spend as much as $1.1 billion annually on producing, marketing and self-distributing its films by 2017. So far, its early efforts have been mixed. It scored with low-budget horror films such as “The Gift” and “The Boy,” but lost money on the thriller “The Secret in Their Eyes” and the point-of-view action film “Hardcore Henry.”Among newcomers, Lionsgate fielded “Nerve,” a $20 million thriller about a digital truth or dare-style game that takes a deadly turn. The film stars Dave Franco and Emma Roberts. It opened Wednesday in order to get a jumpstart on the competition, earning $15 million over its first five days and $9 million over the weekend.“We felt the best approach was to let the movie do the heavy lifting and let word of mouth carry it,” said David Spitz, co-president of domestic theatrical distribution at Lionsgate. “If you read all the comments whether it’s on Instagram or Facebook or Twitter, the response is amazing. The audience loves the film. “In holdover news, Paramount’s “Star Trek Beyond” slipped roughly 60% in its second weekend to gross $24 million and nab second place. That brings the sci-fi sequel’s domestic haul to $105.7 million. With a hefty $185 million budget, the film needs to resonate overseas if it wants to make a profit, because, as it stands, that kind of a result doesn’t justify sequels or guarantee profits.Illumination and Universal’s “The Secret Life of Pets” continues to be one of the biggest hits of the summer. The animated offering took fourth place with $18.2 million. The look at what pets do when their owners are at work has earned $296.2 million and seems destined to inspire more installments in the furry friend saga. After shattering records in 2015, Universal got off to a more modest start this year, with films like “The Huntsman: Winter’s War” and “Warcraft” failing to catch fire. However, the studio has bounced back in recent weeks, revived by the success of “The Secret Life of Pets” and “Jason Bourne.”“Lights Out,” a horror film from New Line, rounded out the top five, picking up $10.8 million to bring its total to $42.8 million after two weeks.On the art house front, Summit and Roadside Attractions opened “Indignation” to $89,072, for a $22,268 per-screen average. The drama about a precocious college student who clashes with the conservative head of his college marks the directorial debut of former Focus chief James Schamus.This summer has been a mixed bag from a box office perspective. The industry has been in a funk as high-profile films such as “Alice Through the Looking Glass,” “The Legend of Tarzan,” and “The BFG” have flopped. However, this weekend’s receipts are an improvement on the year ago period when “Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation” led the box office. Sales are up roughly 30% thanks to the one-two punch of “Jason Bourne” and “Bad Moms.”“We’re starting to chip away at the summer deficit,” said Dergarabedian. “Maybe with ‘Suicide Squad’ opening, we’ll see the end to all this volatility.”"
15,POLITICS,Retired General Warns Of A Massive Civil Military Crisis Under Trump,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-allen-trump_us_579e0d55e4b08a8e8b5e62b0,"This is, he says, ""a commander in chief who would have us do illegal things.""",2016-07-31,Retired Gen. John Allen warns that military members would object to some illegal Trump policies.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579e0ecc2a00002e004f7748.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Retired Marine Gen. John Allen warned on Sunday that if Donald Trump were elected president, there would be mass unrest among the military rank and file over the policies that he would implement and pursue. “I think we would be facing a civil military crisis, the like of which we’ve not seen in this country before,” he said.The retired four-star general, who served as commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, was a featured speaker at the Democratic National Convention. And for that, Trump derided him as a failure.Appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” Allen was asked about these attacks ― which he brushed off by noting that Trump had never served a day in his life ― and also how the lower ranks would react to Trump’s orders to reinstitute policies like torture, the targeted murdering of the family members of alleged terrorists, and the carpet-bombing of ISIS.“You know, from the moment that those of us who are commissioned ― and of course all of our enlisted troops as well ― assume the mantle of our responsibility in uniform, when we swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution, which is a document and a set of principles and it supports the rule of law, one of those is to ensure that we do not obey illegal orders,” he responded.“It’s an inherent responsibility in who we are. And so what we need to do is ensure that we don’t create an environment that puts us on a track conceivably where the United States military finds itself in a civil military crisis with a commander in chief who would have us do illegal things,” he added. “That’s a major issue that we’re facing here, the potential for a civil military crisis where the military could be ordered to conduct illegal activities.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Yet the prospect of even a partial win evaporated completely when Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced on Wednesday, after three acquittals and a mistrial, that her office would drop all remaining charges against the officers.“As a mother, the decision to not proceed on these trials is agonizing,” Mosby said at a press conference. “As a prosecutor, I must consider the dismal likelihood of conviction.”Gray, who died at 25, now joins the growing list of black citizens killed as a result of police contact ― and whose death, judicially speaking, is considered accidental. Police arrested Gray in a high-crime area of the city when he made eye contact and then ran. Once they apprehended him, police allegedly found an illegal switchblade (Mosby said it was a legal folding knife) and roughly handled Gray before shackling him and putting him in a police wagon without a seatbelt. About 45 minutes later, after Gray allegedly complained that he needed a medic, police found him unconscious. He died in the hospital a week later from severe spinal injuries that the medical examiner said were consistent with those from a high-impact car crash. The examiner ruled Gray’s death a homicide.By the time Mosby’s office dropped the remaining charges, three of the six officers had been acquitted: Edward Nero, Garrett Miller and Ceasar Goodson, who had faced the most severe charge of second-degree “depraved heart” murder. The trial of another officer, William Porter, ended in a mistrial. For Justin Nix, a professor in policing, use of force and procedural fairness at the University of Louisville, Goodson’s acquittal was a tipping point that marked the inevitable end of the prosecutor’s case.“After I saw [Goodson’s] case was thrown out, I was thinking ‘any day,” Nix said.“It’s hard to pinpoint any one spot where it went off the rails,” he added.The parties are now locked in a legal feud. After two officers filed complaints in May, a total of five officers are now suing Mosby for alleged false arrest and defamation, among other claims. Mosby cited the pending litigation as the reason she would not take questions at the press conference. Legal experts have cited a number of ways the case was troubled from the start, including the lack of forensic evidence, the state’s unusual prosecutorial strategies, the hastiness with which the office filed the charges and the possibility that the wrong people were charged. But others simply noted the systemic difficulty of convicting police officers in America.The six officers faced charges ranging from assault and misconduct to manslaughter and second-degree murder.But the state, though it put forth a number of theories, had no comprehensive video footage, confessions or eyewitnesses of Gray’s van ride to tap. Prosecutors’ evidence included a statements from witnesses to his arrest and from an officer ― not facing charges ― who witnessed the transport van stop where Gray was shackled. Prosecutors also called on testimony from a man who was picked up and placed in a separate compartment of the transport van shortly before Gray was found unresponsive. “How do you prove the intent? In these cases, there are two parties involved, and in this case, one is the suspect who is dead. The other is the officer,” Nix said. “Short of the officer confessing, it’s really difficult to prove.”“There’s a code that [police] watch each others’ backs. There’s a culture of ‘us versus them’ — maybe now more than ever,” he added. “Officers are not going to get on the stand against their brothers and sisters. And that hurt the prosecution.” Warren Alperstein, a former prosecutor with the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office who now represents police in civil and criminal matters, said the end result was predictable. Alperstein observed the entire proceedings against the officers, but did not participate. “From the outset of this case, I did not believe that the prosecution was going to be able to convict any of the six officers,” Alperstein said. “The evidence didn’t support the offenses charged.” Mosby announced charges against the officers days after Gray’s funeral last April, while Baltimore was in the midst of protests, riots and arson. The speed of the indictment ― thought it garnered community praise ― may have been an early misstep.“I think many would argue that the state’s attorney’s office rushed to file these charges to quash the civil unrest and rioting that was going on,” Alperstein said.Though the state’s attorney’s office insists it conducted an in-depth, independent investigation and gathered sufficient evidence, Alperstein said the result of three trials suggested otherwise. “The hung jury in the William Porter case coupled with the three acquittals would certainly lend credence that the investigation was lacking,” he said. Michael Woods Jr., a retired Baltimore police sergeant turned whistleblower, took a similarly harsh view of the prosecutors’ strategy, but for different reasons. “They didn’t even go after the right people — this is a supervisory issue,” Woods said, arguing that Lt. Brian Rice ― one of the first officers to come into contact with Gray ― should have borne the responsibility as the ranking supervisor on the scene. “Of course the [other officers] follow the order of the lieutenant. Everything Nero and Miller did should fall on Rice,” Woods said. If the state’s attorney had more aggressively pursued a case against Rice, he suggested, “the department wouldn’t have fought nearly as bad.” For the trial of Nero ― the second to be tried and the first whose trial ended in a ruling ― the state’s attorney’s pursued a strategy Alperstein called “a total disaster.” The state compelled Porter, whose trial ended in a hung jury, and Miller to testify against Nero.Porter, who was facing retrial, and Miller, who had yet to stand trial, would be prosecuted by a second team of prosecutors ― a so-called clean team.That team would later be required to prove to the court that, when it came time for Porter and Miller’s trials, the prosecution wasn’t influenced by the testimony the men gave in Nero’s trial. “It’s a logistical nightmare for the prosecution to prove that,” Alperstein said. “It would have been an extremely awkward hearing for the prosecution — as individuals would be called to testify under oath, in their efforts to prove to the court that no information was being used.” “It’s unprecedented in Maryland,” he added, noting that such a strategy happens more often in federal courts. In announcing the dropped charges, Mosby turned her criticism to the police role in the investigation.“We’ve all bore witness to an inherent bias that’s the result of when police police themselves,” she said. Ivan Bates, an attorney for Officer Alicia White, responded later that day that it was Mosby who rejected an independent investigator. “Despite offers of assistance from state police and other agencies, the state’s attorney’s office declined to have the support and the guidance of some of the best investigators in the country,” Bates said, at a different press event.Woods said Mosby’s decision defied explanation. “If she knew the system meant there was no justice in having the cops investigate cops...then why did she have the cops investigate the cops?” he asked. The state’s attorney’s office, Woods noted, has regularly failed other Baltimore residents who died as a result of contact with police.Men, he said, like Tyrone West.West (whose case predates Mosby’s tenure) died in 2013 after he was pulled over by Baltimore police in a traffic stop. Witnesses say the 44-year-old was beaten to death, though an autopsy found he died of a heart condition exacerbated by his struggle with police in the heat. An independent investigation found that officers failed to follow basic protocols with led to tactical errors that “potentially aggravated the situation,” but it declined to find that they had used excessive force. Prosecutors nationwide have struggled to get convictions of police after civilian deaths ― even in cases where the use of force appears much more clear than it was in Gray’s instance.Since 2005, just 13 members of law enforcement have been convicted of murder or manslaughter in fatal on-duty shootings, according to data previously provided to The Huffington Post by Philip Stinson, an associate professor of criminology at Bowling Green State University. Stinson’s data doesn’t include cases like Gray’s where civilians died in police custody, as a result of police contact, were killed by means other than gunfire, or cases in which officers faced lesser charges.The federal government does not keep comprehensive data on the number of police convictions of murder or manslaughter committed while on duty. Only because of efforts like The Guardian’s “The Counted” project ― which tallies the number of people killed by police in the U.S. ― is some of that information even available at all, Nix noted. For him, a larger question underpins cases like Gray’s or West’s ― or the scores of other black citizens who are killed or injured after contact with police. “Keep in mind Freddie Gray was stopped for a switchblade that turned out to be a pocket knife,” he said. “How many of these deaths started out as something minor that escalated into something that could have been avoided?”“We’re arguing on the back end: was the officer guilty?” Nix added. “Let’s take a step back and prevent these things from happening in the first place.” "

In a conversation about Trump’s nebulous relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin during an interview with ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, the topic shifted to why the Republican Party’s platform was softened on the subject of arming Ukraine to push back against Russian aggression.Trump said he had been unaware of the platform change, though he had heard about it ex post facto. Then, he pledged that he’d be tough on Russia when it came to Ukraine.TRUMP: It’s ― look, you know, I have my own ideas. He’s not going into Ukraine, OK, just so you understand. He’s not gonna go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down. You can take it anywhere you want ―Trump’s ties to Russia have been under a microscope in recent weeks after it appeared that Russian agencies were behind the hacking of DNC emails that were leaked right before the Democratic convention. That he might be the beneficiary of a foreign agent’s meddling in a U.S. election is damaging enough. But the ABC interview showed either an ignorance of a major geopolitical crisis or favoritism to Russia’s incursion. The former will likely raise additional questions about Trump’s readiness for the Oval Office. The latter will spook Putin critics everywhere. Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Three-year-old Jack, dressed in a captain’s outfit and holding a Minecraft toy sword, sat atop his dad’s lap and pointed to the spectators as they drove by. By the look of these photos, both father and son were having a great time. The Seattle parade is the latest adorable outing for the famous family. A couple months ago, the trio enjoyed an outdoor camping adventure ― complete with homemade sand demons ― and we’ll never forget that time Pratt taught their son how to fish. Too cute."

He is being held at the Snohomish County Jail on two murder charges and one charge of aggravated murder, according to online records.Family and friends of the deceased identified them at a vigil as Anna Bui, Jake Long and Jordan Ebner. A fourth victim, Will Kramer, was hospitalized in serious condition, the Seattle Times reported. Kiley McReynolds, a friend of Bui’s through the school choir, told the Times that Bui and Ivanov dated for more than a year.According to the Daily Mail, which spoke with an unnamed friend of Ivanov’s, Ivanov called the friend about two hours after the 12:30 a.m. attack, saying “I just killed my ex-girlfriend.” The person claimed that Ivanov had been depressed over his recent breakup with Bui and bought an AR-15 rifle only last week.A woman who said she was Ivanov’s mother was sobbing when reached by the Times. “I am sorry,” she told the paper, declining further comment.Susan Gemmer told the Times that her 18-year-old granddaughter, Alexis, was at the party and at one point called her while hiding in a closet.“We were texting back and forth, telling her to stay quiet, stay calm, we’re on our way. She kept saying, ‘They’re dead, they’re dead, I saw them, I was right there and I saw them,’” Gemmer said.Gemmer said her granddaughter saw Ivanov enter the party of about 15 to 20 friends and walk through the house and to a fire pit out back. Once there, he shot two people. He then made his way to the roof, where others were gathered.When Alexis tried to escape through the garage with a young man who lived at the house, Gemmer said the shooter began shooting at the man from the roof. That’s when she hid in a closet and called her grandmother.In a chilling premonition to the attack, an Instagram photo posted to an account named @allenivanov Monday shows a rifle and three bullets.Two days before the shooting, two cryptic posts appeared on a Twitter account bearing Ivanov’s name and photo.“First and last tweet. I’ve been through it all,” one tweet read.A second read: “What’s Ruger gonna think?” It’s not clear if the tweet was referencing the firearm company Sturm, Ruger & Co., which is commonly known as Ruger.A LinkedIn page appearing to belong to Ivanov lists him as a computer science and engineering student and software engineer for a startup laser tag system called Skirmos. He described it as “your favorite first-person shooter video game in real life.”In a Facebook post, Skirmos said they are “shocked and disturbed” by the events and voiced support for tighter gun control.“Allen Ivanov has worked with us and been our friend and colleague for a number of years,” they said. “That said, this event is another example of our need for gun reform in this country. No person should have the opportunity to possess a firearm that can discharge a weapon 20 times in short succession.”Mukilteo police could not immediately be reached for comment."

He may be armed. Police believe only one gunman was involved in the shooting. The department released one photo of McCray and asked anyone with information to “call the Homicide Tip Line at 512-477-3588 or Crime Stoppers at 512-472-TIPS or text ‘Tip 103’ + your message to CRIMES.”One woman in her 20s was killed after the gunman opened fire into a crowd of people on the busy East Sixth Street at around 2:15 a.m. Officers found her dead upon arrival at the scene.Two men and another woman were taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge with gunshot wounds. Officials said their condition was serious but not life-threatening. Another man who was injured refused to receive treatment.The police department has not yet released the victims’ identities.Video posted to social media shows people, who were streaming out of the entertainment district’s nightclubs, fleeing in terror as the gunshots rang out, NBC-affiliate TV station KXAN reported:His motive is unclear but it’s believed he opened fire following a “disturbance” with another man. Police initially urged people via social media to stay away from the downtown area, as they believed they were dealing with an active shooter situation.That’s because just eight minutes after receiving calls regarding the downtown shooting, emergency dispatchers were notified of another incident at a nearby Trinity Street parking garage.Watch the press conference here:“Given the fact we had just had multiple shots fired on Sixth Street, then we have another incident occur several blocks away with shots being fired again in that incident, our initial concern was that we had an individual that was engaging in active shooter tactics in the entertainment district,” Manley told the reporters.But he clarified that the two incidents were in fact “isolated.”In the other shooting, Manley said a man in his 20s pulled out a gun and opened fire. No one was injured, however, and witnesses disarmed the man before he was detained by police and transported to a hospital for treatment. His injuries were not life-threatening.Manley played down any possible threats to the community, saying, “The scene is secure and we’ve locked down the street.”And he reiterated an earlier call for footage or information pertaining to the incidents to be emailed to investigators via police3@austintexas.gov.The incidents come less than a week after two people were killed and up to 19 injured during a shooting outside the Club Blu Bar and Grill in Fort Myers, Florida, which had been hosting a teen night.And it’s just six weeks since a lone gunman fatally shot 49 people at Pulse, an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.This is a developing story and will be updated."

Questions like: “How well do you guys know each other?”… “How serious is this bromance?”… and, “Are you actually saying you wouldn’t defend our allies in the Baltic States if Putin sends the tanks in?”Well, let me just say this: Putin is a leader. And I think we’ve all seen that topless picture of him riding a horse. I’ll stop there.I know some people were upset this week when I suggested that the Russians should launch a malicious cyber attack on Hillary Clinton in an effort to help me become President. But I was just being sarcastic! I’m definitely not on Putin’s payroll. OK, maybe the Russians did get my attention when Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev bought a Palm Beach estate from me in 2008. Some haters are asking if this was some kind of secret payoff from Moscow. But really I just made a terrific deal. I paid $41 million for the property at the height of the market and flipped it for $100 million in the midst of the biggest real estate collapse in Florida history. I’m such a great dealmaker! I definitely don’t owe Russia anything in return for that much-needed cash infusion in the middle of the crash! And I most certainly did not strike a secret deal with Putin when I was in Moscow for the Miss Universe contest in 2013.It is, of course, a pure coincidence that my campaign is being run by Paul Manafort, a man whose former clients were referred to by The Guardian as a “who’s who of authoritarian leaders and scandal-plagued businessmen in Ukraine, Russia, the Philippines and more.” Total coincidence, too, that Manafort helped elect the pro-Putin Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych in 2010 with a campaign that featured the chant of “lock her up” directed at former prime minister Yulia Tymochenko. (Fun fact: After she lost the election, Tymochenko was, indeed, locked up.)I would like to reassure the American people as clearly and unsarcastically as I can that I am not working for Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. There are absolutely no secret payments from the Russian government hidden in my tax returns. I just won’t let you see the returns. Stop asking! They’re none of your business!To all those wondering if I can be trusted with the highly classified intelligence information I am now receiving as the Republican Party leader (I know. Pinch me. LOL!), I want to reassure you that my allegiance is solely to myself, my Slovenian-born wife, my half-Czechoslovakian kids, the foreign-born workers I am currently hiring in Florida, and of course, the United States of America, whose Constitution I very much look forward to reading.In case you need more proof, here is a complete list of facts to prove I am not a putting “Russia First” instead of “America First”: 1. My second wife was American.2. My family is from Germany―a country that fought against Russia during World War II!If I can think of anything else, I’ll let you know.So please America, trust me. I’m not in cahoots with the Russians. You can totally believe in me with the same level of confidence I have always placed in Melania!UPDATE: OK, Melania lied about writing her own convention speech. I thought she was going to perform original material, but she went with a Michelle Obama cover.UPDATE 2: OK, Melania also had to take down her entire website. Turns out she’s being lying all this time about having a degree from the University of Ljubljana.

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-ukraine-putin_us_579e5a56e4b0693164c19e09,"The pro-Russia change was the only party platform tweak the Trump camp cared about, sources say.",2016-07-31,"Donald Trump says his campaign was not involved in making the GOP's platform regarding Ukraine more Russia-friendly, but Republican officials said that change was the only one his campaign was interested in.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579e5b961200007404a54611.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Both Donald Trump and his campaign chairman said Sunday they had nothing to do with altering the Republican Party’s position on Ukraine ― which must have been news to GOP leaders who confirmed last week that Trump’s campaign insisted on exactly that change.The modified party platform drops its call to provide arms to Ukraine in response to Russia’s occupation of that country’s Crimea province in 2014. It represents a victory for Russian president Vladimir Putin, who soon after annexed the region.Two Republican National Committee officials acknowledged privately last week that Trump’s campaign pushed for the change, which was made in platform committee meetings in the days prior to the start of the Republican convention in Cleveland two weeks ago.Nevertheless, the celebrity businessman told ABC News on Sunday that he didn’t even know about the change until afterward.“I wasn’t involved in that. Honestly, I was not involved,” Trump said.Meanwhile, his top aide, Paul Manafort ― who for a decade was an adviser to the Russian-backed president of Ukraine until he was removed from office in 2014 ― similarly told NBC News that the new wording was not his idea. “It absolutely did not come from the Trump campaign,” he said.Neither the Trump campaign nor the Republican National Committee responded to requests for comment Sunday. But last week, two RNC officials praised Trump for not pushing the party’s conservative grassroots activists to alter language on gay marriage or abortion. They said that, apart from the Ukraine change, Trump’s campaign seemed generally uninterested in the platform altogether.The platform does not bind Republican candidates who win office and is often seen by political professionals as creating unnecessary vulnerabilities for the party. Still, the RNC officials said it was unusual but not surprising that the Ukraine plank was the only thing of concern to the Trump camp, given Manafort’s business ties to the country’s former president, Victor Yanukovych.In the ABC interview, Trump at first said that Putin would not invade Ukraine: “He’s not going into Ukraine, OK? Just so you understand. He’s not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down and you can put it down, you can take it anywhere you want.”But after “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos pointed out that Putin already had done so, Trump blamed President Barack Obama for it ― but went on to suggest that he might recognize Russia’s claim to the region. “I’m going to take a look at it. But, you know, the people of Crimea, from what I’ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were. And you have to look at that, also,” he said.Trump and his campaign have come under increasing criticism over his statements supporting and praising Putin, particularly after the recent theft and public release of thousands of Democratic National Committee emails. Obama said last week that Russia appeared to be behind the hack, while Trump called on Russia and others to hack into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s emails. He later said he was being sarcastic.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S. "
32,BUSINESS,Farmer Forced To Dump Insane Amount Of Gorgeous Cherries,Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tart-cherries-dumped-santucci_us_579e3689e4b0e2e15eb63527,"""These cherries are beautiful! But we have to dump 14 percent.""",2016-07-31,"Marc Santucci, owner of Santucci Farms, shared a photo on Facebook of the massive amount of tart cherries he is throwing away this year under industry regulations.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579e3b7e2a0000fa01fb3cc3.jpeg?cache=bi6NbOttj2&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A bountiful harvest seems like a good thing. But not for a farmer in Michigan who says a federal regulation forced him to let 40,000 perfectly good tart cherries go to waste. Marc Santucci, who owns Santucci Farm in Traverse City, shared a picture on Facebook this week of tart cherries he dumped. “These cherries are beautiful! But, we have to dump 14 percent of our tart cherry crop on the ground to rot,” Santucci wrote. “Why? So we can allow the import of 200 million pounds of cherries from overseas! It just doesn’t seem right.”The photo was shared over 55,000 times, with many commenters bemoaning piles of fresh food going to waste while so many people go hungry. Tart cherries are a unique fruit. They are only grown in a few states, with most coming from Michigan. Their shelf life is only a couple of days, and therefore they require processing right after harvesting. They’re either frozen or used for products like pie filling, cherry concentrate and jam.Crop yield also varies significantly from year to year. That’s one of the reasons the U.S. Department of Agriculture imposes an order on the industry, which growers and processors regularly agree to, that limits the amount of cherries that can be sold each year to match demand. The goal is to keep prices more stable for farmers. This year, there is a surplus of over 100 million pounds of tart cherries, according to the Detroit Free Press.There are some alternatives to dumping. Processors can choose to hold stock in reserve to release in a future year when there is a shortfall. Santucci told The Huffington Post that his processor took about half of his excess cherries for that purpose.There’s also donating. The Michigan Agricultural Surplus System works with over 70 farms in the state to take surplus crops and produce that is considered too “ugly” for retailers to sell. Farmers get paid a little to cover their costs, and MASS sends hundreds of thousands of pounds of fresh, healthy food to organizations around the state that give it out to needy families. “I’m devastated to see what he did, and what I’m sure others are doing, when I’m sure there are families that would love to be able to have tart cherries,” said Kath Clark, food programs manager for the Food Bank Council of Michigan, which is responsible for MASS. It’s not a problem that only affects cherries, Clark said. She described farmers harvesting potatoes, putting them into storage, and then, after finding out they don’t meet cosmetic standards, having to spread them back on their fields to rot. In the U.S., up to 40 percent of the food that’s produced never gets eaten. Each year, about 7 percent of what’s planted on farms isn’t harvested, according to a 2012 Natural Resources Defense Council report.Donating is trickier for tart cherries, because they require both farmers and processors ― many working at capacity during the harvest ― to be on board and coordinate with the food bank program in a short time period. Clark said she works with one grower who is donating about 40,000 pounds of tart cherries this year. The viral Facebook post inspired Clark to reach out to Santucci, and now that he knows there is a processor who will accept donated cherries, he plans to donate next time there’s a surplus. Santucci believes the bigger problem is the rule restricting how many cherries are allowed to be sold domestically ― though many other farmers say it provides necessary stability.  Santucci said tart cherries imported from Turkey and Eastern Europe have made up increasingly larger portions of the market, and limiting the amount of domestic cherries makes it worse.“In an effort to support the prices of cherries, we’re actually increasing imports,” Santucci said. Santucci’s Facebook photo has received much more attention, and heated reactions, than he was expecting. But he hopes it might help spark change.“We weren’t trying to say we’re poor and we’re getting screwed,” he said. “We’re trying to say the system just doesn’t work.”More stories like this:This Walmart Worker Threw Away Food On The Job, Then Went Home Hungry"

Ringo the baby rhino had died. As I reported on HuffPost in February, our friends and partners at Ol Pejeta Conservancy had found and rescued an orphaned baby white rhino. The Conservancy was facing substantial cost to raise this baby and release him into the wild, and I'd offered to reach out to Ringo Starr and ask if we could name the baby rhino in his honor. Ringo The Beatle has long been a supporter of rhino conservation issues, and we hoped a baby rhino sharing his name would help shine a light on the decimation of rhinos. Illegal poaching over the past 20 years has reduced global rhino populations by over 90%. Without global action, all rhino species may be wiped out. Ringo Starr quickly gave his name to the baby, and also joined The Nobelity Project and many individual donors who joined us as sponsors of Baby Ringo's care. In the months following my HuffPost announcement, stories by BBC, CNN, The Dodo and many others began to turn Baby Ringo into the poster child for saving the rhinos. Raising an orphaned baby rhino is no simple task. I spent time with baby Ringo in June and posted a Father's Day story on the budding father-son relationship between Ringo and 7,000-pound Sudan, the last remaining male Northern White Rhino in the world.TO RINGO WITH LOVE - OUR NEW FILM ON THE CONTINUING WORK OF OL PEJETA CONSERVANCYThe weather was cold when I was with Ringo in June, and perhaps his Masai blanket, his bed of straw and even his caretakers sleeping with him were not the same as huddling with a mother rhino. The giant baby bottles of formula given to the infant rhinos can only be only an approximation of mother's milk. Some rescued babies survive; many do not. Knowing that did not lessen the emotional toll of the news of Baby Ringo's death.So many people loved this little rhino. How could Ol Pejeta and The Nobelity Project respond to those who had reached out to assist in this effort?For the past four years, I've been filming the integrated conservation work at Ol Pejeta. I'd documented the conservancy's efforts to save the Northern White Rhino species. The last three Northern Whites live there under heavy security, and an effort is underway (and currently seeking funding) to use in-vitro fertilization and a surrogate Southern White Rhino mother to save the species.I had assisted and filmed the relocation to Meru National Park of two fence-breaking elephants who'd been invading neighboring communities. Darted from a helicopter and attended by a big team of rangers and veterinarians, the first elephant was lifted by crane onto a transport truck where Dr. Henrik Rasmussen of Savannah Trackers had drilled a hole into his trunk and embedded a tiny electronics package that would secretly track the tusk if the elephant was killed by poachers. ""It's not enough to stop a poor poacher with a rusty rifle,"" Henrik told me as we drilled. ""This could help us track the buyers and sellers, possibly all the way to a final buyer in Asia.""I'd come to know the rescued chimps at Ol Pejeta's Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary, including Poco, who had spent years of his life in a tiny cage suspended from the roof of a petrol station in the Congo. After he was rescued from this imprisonment, Poco was brought to Ol Pejeta, and had been in his tiny cage so long, he was unable to walk on all fours. Though he has since learned normal chimp mobility, he often strolls around upright like a human as he shares this large sanctuary with 38 other rescued chimps.I'd learned that the last two female Northern White Rhinos tolerated my presence, and that the Southern White female who we hope will be a surrogate mother, is not so friendly to me. Trying constantly to do an end-around to get to me while I film, she still responds to verbal communications to stand down from head keeper Zachary Mutai who lives night and day with these rhinos. ""I think like a rhino,"" Zachary told me once as I was filming. ""I love use animals and they teach me about animal behavior.""I met the 39 armed rangers who protect the rhinos and other wildlife in this 110,000-acre conservancy. Following a scent trail, I was unable to keep up with a beautiful bloodhound who'd previously tracked and located a poacher after a 30 kilometer pursuit. There are eight wonderful bloodhounds, brilliant explosive/gunpowder sniffer dogs and ferocious attack dogs at Ol Pejeta. Stopping poachers is serious business, and the jobs of African wildlife rangers - and their dogs - are some of the most dangerous on earth. I'd also come to love the tourist side of Ol Pejeta, having enjoyed the hospitality at Sweetwaters tented lodge, at Ol Pejeta Bush Camp, Pelican House and other visitors accommodations. The more I go, the more I want to go back.Ol Pejeta Conservancy is a nonprofit, with proceeds from tourism and integrated cattle operations generating funds for improving livelihoods in thirty surrounding communities.

For the first time ever, a qualified female politician has a real shot at becoming President of the United States. After watching the DNC, and supplementing my viewing with thinkpieces galore on every possible election-related issue, I get it: You're either excited about Hillary's nom, or you aren't. Cool. No harm, no foul.The country, world, and World Wide Web are currently overrun with moderate and extremist views of every kind on what this nomination means for both the future of women and the future of our country. Trolls are out in full force everywhere from YouTube live-stream comment sections to nothing-but-the-facts Internet articles. What's more, our deepest-held sexist views are rising to the surface of men and women alike, coming out in conversations at home, school and work. I know I likely can't reach people who've swung to the far left or right -- those who want Bernie or Trump at all costs -- but I've heard remarks, and made remarks myself, this week that have led me to question why we're saying certain things about Hillary, and what they can tell us about the current state of sexism in our country. Here are five sexist remarks I've heard multiple times from people of all genders, ages and political parties. If you don't agree that they are sexist, we must at least question, then, why we might be saying these things period.   1. It's not wrong for Hillary Clinton to want to be president. Painting her as nefarious because she wants to be president is sexist. A big to-do was make at the convention regarding whether or not Hillary has always wanted to be president, or if she decided she'd like to run for the job later in life. Hillary had already been on record, in both interviews and her memoirs, saying she never considered a career as a politician until the end of her terms as First Lady, when a young female basketball player, Sofia Totti, shook her hand at a public event and said, ""Dare to compete, Mrs. Clinton. Dare to compete.""What Totti was asking Clinton to do was get in the game the same way she was encouraging women and girls to all over the globe. To enter the competition, not just cheerlead from the bench. It changed Clinton's outlook on the possibilities for her own life, and she went on to run for the Senate. Now that Clinton's inspiration and reasoning for entering the world of politics has been presented to us for our analysis and discussed from every angle, I have a new question to ask: Who cares? Was there even one think piece dedicated to when Bernie Sanders might have first thought to run for president, and if he was evil for imagining himself in the role? Why do we collectively believe that it's wrong for Hillary to want to be president? So many politicians want to be president. It's the job at the top of their ladder. She clearly wants to do it now. Why can't we say, ""Good for her,"" instead of, ""When and why?"" 2. It is sexist, ignorant, and insulting to suggest that the political system was ""rigged"" in favor of a woman succeeding. It is infuriating to me that the most extreme Bernie and Trump supporters are suggesting that the political system was rigged in favor of a woman becoming the democratic nominee. No job in our country, nor perhaps the world, has ever been rigged in favor of a woman securing it. Hillary Clinton is the first woman ever to accomplish what she has, and she didn't do it on her first try. If you truly believe the system was rigged in her favor, please go back to 2008 and stay there.  3. No one told Bernie to smile. Stop telling women to smile. During Hillary's acceptance speech, Bernie Sanders was caught on camera frowning and blowing air out of his cheeks in disgust. I expected to wake up to hundreds of news articles bashing him for his childish behavior. Instead, I didn't find any. Okay, fine. But men and women of the world, the next time you see me frowning on a bad day while walking down the street, or the next time Hillary Clinton is caught on camera frowning during something horrible like the Benghazi hearings, show her the same courtesy that's being shown to Senator Sanders and don't ask me or her to smile. 4. It's great that Hillary will work side-by-side with Sanders to make college more affordable. But don't say she stole his idea -- she didn't.In her DNC speech, Hillary promised to work directly with Senator Sanders to make college affordable, prompting thousands of folks to shout that she's simply using him for his original ideas. But instead of exposing Clinton's lack of originality, they only exposed that they haven't been paying attention. I first started really listening to Hillary and considering her as a viable candidate for president when she was the only Democrat talking about college tuition and loans in 2006 and 2007. She promised that if she were elected president, she would do everything in her power to make college affordable to the middle class, to shut down predatory lenders, and to continue to help non-traditional college students receive an affordable education while working and supporting their families. She called for a Student Borrower's Bill of Rights to give students and families power and leverage when dealing with the private student loan industry, she called for income-based student loan repayment, and an increase of Pell grand funding and funding for AmeriCorps, so that students who gave two years of community service to the country would be written a check toward their higher education. Things have progressed and changed in the past eight years, and Clinton's new college plan has adapted with those changes. It's inspiring and hopeful that Clinton publicly agreed to continue to work with Sanders on these matters, but please stop saying she's stealing his initiative. It has been her initiative as well for quite a long time, predating Sanders. To ignore what Clinton has done and said regarding any political issue is to prove that you simply haven't cared to listen to her seriously. 5. Don't try to make me feel bad or undermine my intelligence because I appreciate the historical significance of Hillary's nomination from a feminist perspective. Just like it's not wrong for Hillary to want to be president, it's not wrong for me to want a female presidential candidate and president because I am a woman. Yes, being a woman has made me more invested in this election. Yes, I can see how Hillary Clinton becoming Commander in Chief will directly impact my life because I am a woman. There's nothing wrong with that. Stop trying to convince me that Hillary being a woman shouldn't matter. That's exactly the line of thinking that keeps women's rights plateaued instead of moving forward."

But her presidency is the singular path forward.,2016-07-31,"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton waives as she walks on stage to accept her nomination during the fourth and final night of the Democratic National Convention at Wells Fargo Center on July 28, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. / AFP / Patrick T. Fallon (Photo credit should read PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb822db1f00002501253873.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Months ago, I wrote here about how Bernie Sanders reflected a sea change in American religiosity. At the time, if it was not explicit, I was a supporter of Sanders and was happy to see him come to the current political debate from the Left. And more importantly, he was providing an alternative to many issues that, for me, placed Hillary Rodham Clinton too closely aligned with neo-conservative, imperialist and interventionist positions I normally associate with the Right. Since that piece was published, Bernie lost the Democratic nomination, and I have seen many of my fellow Bernie supporters shout down at Hillary supporters, both at the convention and on social media. No more than three weeks ago, I too was telling a good friend that there simply was no way I would ever vote for HRC as I proceeded to list our differences on Latin America, the Middle-East, her tardy evolution on LGBT rights, her seeming cozy relationship with big banks, and her insensitivity on matters pertaining to criminality and the prison industrial complex. Her words at a convention won't change my mind about these issues since I see her as having a long history of saying what suits her politically at the moment. These are some of the same reasons that people on the Left, including many of my closest friends, still refuse to vote for her. And on this point, in my opinion, they are not only misguided; they are forgetting one of the most critical pieces written by the Leftist revolutionary, Antonio Gramsci. Gramsci, an Italian Marxist imprisoned by Mussolini in the 1920s, is a commonly assigned theorist in college courses on political theory and social movements. He is mostly known for his concept of an ""organic intellectual,"" those people who exercise their political awareness and critique of governmental power outside of the structures of state sponsored training, including standardized educational paths and technical training. That's an over-simplification of course, as is this short reminder to other liberals and Leftists about Gramsci's concepts of War of Maneuver and War of Position. We might benefit here of thinking about Gramsci's War of Maneuver as direct action: protests, marches, rallying at electoral meetings, and ensuring our voices are heard and bodies are seen by people who would rather we not take space. Bernie supporters have been effective at this type of strategy, as has the #blacklivesmatter movement, just to name a couple examples. Writing from prison, Gramsci offered another mode of achieving political revolution: a War of Position. The long and slow battle for political revolution, for Gramsci, required people to switch from one type of strategy to another, depending on the social context. In the War of Position, people wanting social change would focus on gaining influence in society, in securing a more opportune future for more direct action at a later point, and in mapping out how to shift power relations for the longer, more substantial structural changes. If you care about Bernie Sanders' positions, you now have a decision to make. Of course you could refuse to vote for Hillary because you want to prove a point about the lack of democracy exercised by the Democratic Party. But then you would be hurting your long-term goals, because one viable candidate gets you closer to those goals (while possibly not sharing the goal with you), and the other not only takes you farther away, but also erodes viable paths toward those goals. (If you don't think a Trump presidency would be that bad, simply read the news about Turkey these days, or look at what happens in despotic regimes). Sanders already pivoted to a War of Position with his backing of Hillary Rodham Clinton. He pivoted when he created his ""Our Revolution"" plan. He knows that we need more people to engage politics locally. He knows that we need to consider which senators and representatives need our support. He knows that Supreme Court changes are too valuable to throw to chance. To achieve his goals, Sanders knows he needs a Hillary Clinton presidency. Now if only his supporters would pivot with him. To those of you on the Left: Hillary may not be your candidate of choice. She may even espouse positions you find morally reprehensible. Her nomination may evidence for you all the gross aspects of a two-party political system in the U.S.A. But her presidency is the singular path forward at this point to change the nation to more closely reflect your ideals. Vote begrudgingly if you must. Keep in mind that you have more power in the larger political struggle to not only privately pull the lever for HRC, but convince others to do so as well. Pivoting to Hillary is not an end; her presidency is a means, a temporary position if you will, towards an end."

REUTERS/Scott Audette",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb82308240000310098b9e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bernie Sanders might be the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton. I don't just mean persuading most of his delegates not to walk out. Think about it. Without the Sanders campaign, Clinton would be running mainly on three things: her exceptional experience, her breakthrough status as the first woman president and her embrace of the cultural left that so dominated the Democratic National Convention.All three elements have as many negatives as positives. Clinton may be the most qualified candidate ever to run for president, but her experience includes some awkward baggage. The first potential woman president runs into headwinds of misogyny, personified by Donald Trump. And the cultural left risks alienating as many voters as it mobilizes.What Sanders added was to push Clinton and her allies, sometimes kicking and screaming, to advocate a far more progressive pocketbook program. On economics, Clinton has begun to move well beyond her comfort zone -- to attack Wall Street, to call for breaking up big predatory banks, to tax the rich to pay for needed infrastructure and jobs, even to challenge dubious trade deals. All this is the necessary antidote to the risks. And she needs to do a lot more. With more of that emphasis, Clinton can securely carry swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. Without it, she remains vulnerable.The narrative of cultural mosaic has been contested territory for Democrats, at least since the 1970s. The Democratic Leadership Council was founded in part to push Democrats to the center-right on issues like national defense and social spending, but also to discourage Democrats from campaigning as a rainbow. What emerged in 2008 and 2016 as a splendid tapestry was disparaged by the DLC in the 1980s as a tangle of narrow interest groups that alienated regular Americans.In a famous 1989 paper, DLC theorists William Galston and Elaine Kamarck wrote: ""The real problem is not insufficient liberalism on the part of the Democratic nominees; it is rather the fact that during the last two decades, most Democratic nominees have come to be seen as unacceptably liberal."" The DLC lost that fight, big time. The Democratic base is more liberal than ever, and the party has moved left -- but left on what? Barack Obama's election and re-election, and continued emphasis of such issues as LGBT rights and immigant rights certified that the cultural left had won. Unfortunately, however, the DLC and its progeny won on such pocketbook issues as deficit reduction, alliance with Wall Street, disrespect for unions, support for corporate trade deals and acceptance of lousy jobs and pay. The mosaic of cultural pluralism on display at Philadelphia was nothing short of astonishing. Lesbian, gay, and transgender people at the podium, joined by Americans with disabilities, immigrants without documentation, lots of black, Latino and Asian-American speakers, proud -- even fierce -- feminism. All of this is cause for great celebration.Yet, despite the projections of America as a majority/minority country, despite growing acceptance of same-sex marriage, in the present electorate, that tapestry by itself doesn't quite add up to an automatic election win for Hillary Clinton. If it did, a moral cretin like Donald Trump would not be running even with Clinton in the polls. Being culturally avant garde and economically status quo doesn't do it.Here in the progressive bubble, the Philadelphia parade felt joyous. But for tens of millions of American workers and their families, the embrace of undocumented immigrants and LGBT rights suggests a Democratic Party that is on a different planet. If Clinton can start sounding as emphatic on the pocketbook issues as she did on all the other issues, then Democrats can begin savoring a victory over Trump, maybe even a crushing one.Another stunning thing about the Democratic National Convention was the sheer, glorious feminism of it. All spring and most of the summer, the fact that Bernie Sanders stole the hearts of the young denied Clinton some of the drama and appeal that she deserved.Now, as Sanders both stood aside and vowed to continue to fight for pocketbook issues, the power of electing the first woman president could start to command the excitement that it hasn't quite had until now. Based on a small sample, plenty of young voters, especially young women voters whose first choice was Sanders, are genuinely moved and exhilarated by the Clinton who they saw at the convention.Having doubled down on her feminism -- from the white dress of the suffragists to the somewhat overplayed fight song and the display of strong womanhood at the convention -- Clinton will need the largest turnout of women and the biggest gender gap in history. But she will also need more than a few good men. Her campaign gestured towards the fact that it isn't just blacks and immigrants and LGBT people who are are suffering in America today. There was acknowledgment of general pocketbook distress in her acceptance speech, but not enough. Her three-day post-convention bus tour through the two must-win states of Pennsylvania and Ohio provided more emphasis but did not get enough national press.Trump is vulnerable on several grounds. One is his lack of specifics, another is his hypocrisy. On pocketbook issues, Clinton needs to show up Trump by being both very specific and a lot bolder bolder than her recent predecessors.For too long, the Democratic Party of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama has addressed the calamitous downward slide of America's working people with gestures and with policies too feeble to make enough of a difference. At the same time, that Democratic Party, especially at the presidential level, has gotten into bed with Wall Street. Barack Obama, passing the torch to Hillary Clinton, delivered one of the greatest presidential convention speeches ever, pointing to both ideals and accomplishments. The contrast with Donald Trump could not be greater. Yet by a margin of 73 to 18, most Americans say that the country is going in the wrong direction. Thus Donald Trump.For the liberal elite, life is sweet indeed. The food is better than ever, the cities are more vibrant, the technology cooler. It isn't sweet at all for the broad working class. To win big, Hillary needs to be their champion, too.--Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and professor at Brandeis University's Heller School. In his spare time, he writes musicals.

Assuredly, Kiev is well and distant from all these locations and there's soldiers at the border on the east of the country who will not permit tourists to enter these territories. Life goes on in Kiev.Pedestrians on the street may ask for money to donate to the war effort and there are dozens of sites paying tribute to revolutionaries who died in the 2014 Euromaidan protests. Nonetheless, the urban core still functions as per usual.A developing country at war. It doesn't paint a colourful image. But quite the contrary, Kiev is painted with a golden skyline. Churches, thousands of years old, dominate the cityscape. Their walls painted in vibrant colours and decorated with finely detailed mosaics. The churches of Kiev are as beautiful on the outside as they are on the inside. And they were unlike any I had seen anywhere in Europe.The differences weren't necessarily in the Orthodox architecture, but the people. I had been to the Vatican numerous times and attended a mass with the Pope around New Years'. I'll never forget when Pope Francis was walking down the centre aisle for mass. Hundreds were looking at him, but not with their own eyes. Arms stretched out into the aisle with selfie sticks, phones, and the clunky DSLR cameras. It made me wonder why people really were there.I hadn't seen a single camera inside the Kievan churches. Not only because photography was generally prohibited - but that never stopped people at the Sistine Chapel - but people observed the architecture and prayer in silence. They sang with mass. They made prayers to the soldiers in the war. They paid respect to the beauty that was the churches and entered through their tall doors with authentic intentions. I hadn't seen that on as big as a scale than in Kiev.The air you breathe in Kiev is untouched and clean. The capital of Ukraine has even garnered the international reputation of being the ""Green City."" Trees grow seemingly everywhere. It's hard to differentiate where the city ends and nature begins. It's a natural city. But the genuineness wasn't confined to the churches or the parks.There's one observation I took away with me on my one-way flight to London and that was that people are people. In a country that has dealt with decades of political corruption and mismanagement and an ongoing war, people still go to church. Friends still go to the park. Nightlife is quiet, but the youth still go out for a drink.The Ukrainian capital is welcoming and I saw that firsthand myself. My Airbnb host, Oleksii, and his wife welcome me into their home with open arms. I had food poisoning during the first few days of my trip and he went to the pharmacy himself to get medication and to the supermarket to get tea for me. He sat down and we had long conversations about the situation in his country and even decades before. During the Chernobyl fallout, he had to leave his home city to live in Moscow for a few years.I remember him telling me that despite all this, he loved this city. This was his home.On my flight to London, I remember feeling thankful for the circumstances in my own country of Canada. I couldn't forget the optimism of people like my host, Oleksii, and the love for their country despite the hard times in his country, though. That, to me, is a true appreciation of life."

(Photo by Joe Mahoney/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb822fe250000cf003a1871.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump upped the ante again on arguably the single biggest campaign issue that has Trump and Clinton backers the most anxious about. That is, who gets to appoint someone to the Supreme Court during the next four to eight years. There could be anywhere from two to four vacancies in that time span. Trump upped the ante in three ways. The first was when he again tossed out the name of the late Antonin Scalia during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. This was not simply a double down on his praise of Scalia as the judge who, along with Clarence Thomas, is at the top of his High Court heroes list. It sent the strongest signal that his picks will not just be garden variety strict constructionists, but activists and influencers on the bench. They will be judges who won't just base their rulings on the standard conservative playbook, but will cajole, hector and badger other judges to toe the hard conservative line in their rulings -- and who will have the gall, when it suits their purpose, not even to try and hide it. Scalia was the textbook example of this kind of judge. He didn't even try to make a constitutional cover for his court push to give Florida to Bush in the 2000 election. As he famously and shamelessly said that, ""The only issue was whether we should put an end to it, after three weeks of looking like a fool in the eyes of the world."" Scalia played that part to the max. Nowhere was that on more stunning display than for the two decades that he served as the court schoolmaster for Thomas. Along the way, he ensured that the other justices looked hard over their shoulders at him when they huddled to craft an opinion in a case. It was no accident that with Scalia gone from the court, it looks and even sounds like an almost moderate court on some of its rulings: on abortion rights, affirmative action, voting rights and the feds paying for contraceptives at religious hospitals. The outcome would have almost certainly been different if Scalia had been there.GOP Vice Presidential contender Mike Pence made the Trump-Scalia axis official when he vowed to a campaign crowd in Michigan that Trump's High Court pick would hit the bench with the practically sworn duty to slam down the curtain on Roe v. Wade. This was tantamount to promising to say to heck with law, prior rulings or deliberations, the judge would just knock out abortion rights period. Pence didn't stop there. He repeatedly tossed out the mantra that Trump will appoint strict constructionists in his appointments and not just for a Scalia-type judicial hit on abortion rights. This was a prime advertisement for unapologetic conservative judicial activism in the cookie-cutter mold of a Scalia.Trump didn't publicly drop Scalia's name at the convention solely because he considered him the judge with the right stuff. It was the one person that he knew, above all others, was considered a demigod among party ultra-conservatives, pro-lifers and evangelicals. They have from time to time voiced big doubts about Trump's less-than-stout conservative pronouncements about abortion, planned parenthood, religious values and law and public policy decisions as translated by the courts. With the non-endorsement of him at the convention by their shining knight Ted Cruz, this makes it even more imperative for Trump to send the signal that he will move mountains to find and nominate Scalia type activist judges to the High Court.In decades past, many Democratic and Republican-appointed justices have scrapped party loyalties and based their legal decisions solely on the merit of the law, constitutional principles and the public good. Scalia was a judicial horse of a different color. The tip-off that judges like him would vote their ideology rather than the law came from George W. Bush. On the presidential campaign trail in 2000, Bush was asked if elected what kind of judge he'd look for and nominate. He didn't hesitate. He pledged to appoint ""strict constructionists"" to the court and specifically named Thomas, Scalia and William Rehnquist as the judges that perfectly fit that description. By then the three had already carved out a hard line niche as three of the most reflexive, knee-jerk, reactionary jurists to grace the court in decades. Their votes to torpedo, water down, eviscerate or erode rights on all issues from abortion to civil rights were so predictable they could have been mailed in.A Supreme Court judge can sit on the court for years even decades and watch as legions of Republicans and Democrats come and go in Congress and the White House. Scalia certainly did. All the while, they are shaping and remaking law and public policy for decades to come with their votes, rulings and opinions. Trump may not know much else but he knows that a few more Scalias on the bench will ensure that the High Court does just that, and his way.--Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

She lost to the black guy the first time and now she’s ready for her second shot at the title,” he said.Adam Lowitt disagreed, saying the Clinton campaign is best compared to “Rocky III.”“Hillary is rich and overconfident and she’s going to lose in an upset to an angry bully with weird hair who everyone calls Mr. T,” he said.The correspondents finally decided that “Rocky IV” was the most appropriate film for this year’s presidential race. “Donald Trump is a monster backed by Russia, who is embarrassing the America in front of the entire world,” Minhaj pointed out.See the comparisons in the video above, starting at the 9:04 mark.
