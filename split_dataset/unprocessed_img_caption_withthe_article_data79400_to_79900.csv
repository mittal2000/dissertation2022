NASA's goal is to gather as much data as possible about this Kuiper Belt object (KBO), called 2014 MU69, while using fuel sparingly.""This KBO costs less fuel to reach [than other candidate targets], leaving more fuel for the flyby, for ancillary science, and greater fuel reserves to protect against the unforeseen,"" Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator, said in a press release.Stern said that 2014 MU69, identified as a good candidate with the help of Hubble telescope, is an ideal flyby target because of what it can teach us about the origins of the Kuiper Belt. At 100th of the size of Pluto, just 30 miles across, this KBO is likely similar to the building blocks that are thought to have come together to create the dwarf planet and other larger objects in the Belt.“The detailed images and other data that New Horizons could obtain from a KBO flyby will revolutionize our understanding of the Kuiper Belt and KBOs,”said New Horizons team member John Spencer.  The craft will make four maneuvers toward the small icy object in late October and early November and could reach 2014 MU69 as early as January 1.Previously on HuffPost Science: New Horizons Won't Be The Only Spacecraft At Our Solar System's Edge"

Not only are black men overrepresented in prison compared to their share of the population, they are also disproportionately placed in isolation once they’re behind bars. In Washington, D.C., 97 percent of men in administrative segregation ― one type of solitary confinement ― were black. Because the District lacks its own prison facility, inmates sentenced there are actually held in multiple federal prisons.The report, which is based on a national survey answered by 46 state and federal prison directors, comes at a time when the use of isolation on prisoners is under heavy scrutiny by lawmakers and judges. In June, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy denounced the practice, writing that “years on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible price.” This week, California agreed to move thousands of inmates out of solitary confinement as part of a landmark settlement.The stress of isolation inhibits neuron formation, scientists have found, which can cause permanent changes to the brain. General concerns about the practice prompted the Association of State Correctional Administrators, which includes heads of corrections agencies, to partake in the project with Yale. They acknowledge in their report that prolonged isolation is a “grave” problem and say that they seek to limit or end it, an unprecedented statement.“Having the people who run the prison systems as committed as they are to prison systems running differently, and the reduction or elimination of isolation, is important,” Judith Resnik, a professor at Yale Law School who co-authored the report, told The Huffington Post. She called the report a “statement of their commitment.”Because not every jurisdiction participated in the survey, the researchers estimated that the number of people in solitary confinement could be as high as 100,000. That number does not cover jails or juvenile, military and immigration detention facilities.In the fall of 2014, Arkansas reported placing the highest percentage of male inmates in administrative segregation, which is defined in the report as putting inmates in cells ― either alone or with cellmates ― and holding them there for most hours of the day for 30 days or more. Administrative segregation is often imposed when a prisoner is seen as a potential risk to other inmates or prison staff. Arkansas’ figure does not include other forms of isolation, like that used for punishment or protection. On average, black prisoners made up 47 percent of the administrative segregation population and 39 percent of the total male prison population in 21 jurisdictions that provided demographic data. (Not every respondent answered every question in the report. Twenty-two jurisdictions provided demographic data; of those, 21 had a smaller percentage of white male prisoners in administrative segregation than in the general prison population.)ADX Florence, a supermax prison in Colorado, held more than half of its prisoners in solitary confinement for over three years, according to the report. An inmate at that facility told The New York Times that prisoners on his cellblock ""screamed and banged on their doors for hours.""The researchers also sought to shed light on the duration and conditions of solitary confinement. ""Most participants reported that inmates in solitary spend 23 hours a day in their cells on weekdays; about half of all jurisdictions reported that prisoners spent 23 hours a day in a cell on weekends,"" the report said.Conditions varied widely by location. Virginia, for example, prohibited inmates in administrative segregation from having letters, paper or pens and pencils in their cells. New Hampshire banned magazines. Other states, including Montana and North Dakota, prohibited some segregated inmates from getting visits or social phone calls. Seven jurisdictions provided free televisions. North Dakota and Wyoming allowed video game consoles, Arkansas, MP4 players. But jurisdictions may limit access to activities and personal materials as punishment, and what's reported as policy does not always happen in practice.The researchers are planning to continue the project with 2015 data, focusing on other categories of isolation. ""Hopefully this report is part of several markers of a transformation in the assumptions of what is normal inside prisons,"" Resnik said. ""There should be nothing typical about the kinds of conditions we found."" Clarification:  This post was updated to explain that Washington, D.C., lacks its own prison system and inmates sentenced in the District are held in multiple locations nationwide."

Over the course of his nearly four years here and even with his move a year ago to the West Coast, Dylan has been a must-read at POLITICO, helping to establish what we think is an essential part of POLITICO’s report on politics and power: our reporting on the media. What started as a one-man blog under Dylan and before him Michael Calderone has now evolved into a full-on media desk, combining forces with the old Capital New York six-person media team. The soft launch this summer of POLITICO Media is only the beginning of this effort, about which you'll here a lot more as we expand our reporting on the media industry and its part in the great drama of American politics and power. In the meantime, we wanted to take a moment to wish Dylan well on his new adventure and thank him for his pioneering work on the beat, before we roll up our sleeves and get to work making it the authoritative report on the media we now know it can be.

Such strategies ""had the unintended consequence of escalating rather than diminishing tension,"" the report states.The police response was also hampered by inconsistent leadership, a failure to understand the community, a reactive strategy for handling protests, poor communication, and complications caused by St. Louis County's extraordinarily fractured network of small law enforcement agencies, which a nationally recognized police research organization has criticized as ""dysfunctional and unsustainable.""The ""stress and pressure"" that officers were under at the time -- working long hours as taunts, spit, rocks and bottles of urine were hurled in their direction -- may have resulted in their making ""bad judgments"" and engaging in uncharacteristic behavior, according to the report. Officers on the front lines ""faced unprecedented levels of abuse,"" and minority officers in particular were targeted with ""extreme verbal abuse.""Additionally, law enforcement's response to the unrest ""seemed like a rudderless ship"" to many officers because ""direction for officers on arrests and engaging protesters seemed to change regularly,"" according to the report. Interviews with officers ""consistently, and clearly, indicated there was confusion"" about arrest procedures and guidelines, a situation that St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar acknowledged in federal court last fall.The ""after-action"" assessment conducted at the request of the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) examines the police response to protests in Ferguson over a 17-day period in 2014: from Aug. 9, when then-Ferguson Police Office Darren Wilson killed Brown, through Aug. 25, when the 18-year-old was buried. The study began last September. The assessment team -- led by former Missouri police officer and criminal law professor David L. Carter -- conducted over 160 confidential interviews with law enforcement officials, protesters, clergy, business owners, community members and other stakeholders. The report states that law enforcement agencies who responded to the situation in Ferguson ""encountered an event unprecedented in recent times"" that ""became a defining moment in policing history."" The large number of demonstrators and the widespread use of social media made the event particularly challenging. Ferguson should serve as ""a vivid reminder that law enforcement agencies must continually analyze their policing practices in relation to the communities they serve,"" the report says. While the report's key findings leaked out in late June, federal officials hope that this full, detailed examination will be helpful for other law enforcement agencies when dealing with mass demonstrations.COPS Director Ron Davis -- who writes that the Ferguson demonstrations became ""part of a national movement to reform our criminal justice system and represent a new civil rights movement"" -- suggests that the report may aid law enforcement agencies in protecting the rights of demonstrators and maintaining public safety.""The failure to learn from our experiences -- both our successes and setbacks -- increases the likelihood of repeating mistakes and contributes to loss of public trust,"" Davis writes in introducing the report. ""Law enforcement must be prepared to respond to this new movement and to do so in a manner different from that of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, when law enforcement was often used to disrupt demonstrations, oppress free speech, and deny constitutional rights.""The aggressive tactics used by law enforcement in Ferguson came under heavy criticism in the press and on social media. The assessment team -- which included a watch commander in the Dallas Police Department who graduated from West Point and served in the first Gulf War -- largely agreed with the widespread critique of the militarized police presence. By positioning a sniper on top of an armored tactical vehicle, ""law enforcement helped to further the sentiment that they were reacting in a militaristic manner,"" the report says. Initial police responses ""appeared to galvanize a negative perspective and aggravate community concerns about police and the justice system in general."" Community members, the report notes, ""became angered at what they perceived to be a heavy-handed response by the police rather than the police being there to 'serve and protect.'""One community member said that ""riot gear, tear gas, five-second rule, tanks were all acts of aggression"" that exacerbated the crowd's response. ""Back to Selma all over again,"" the person said.""It was clear the armored vehicles stirred the emotions of demonstrators -- they expressed fear, anger, and intimidation by the vehicles' mere presence,"" the report says. ""Community members stated that the vehicles were 'acts of aggression' by the police.""The pointing of sniper rifles at crowds came under particular scrutiny. The report calls that ""a particularly alarming behavior, especially if the rifle is pointed at the viewer."" Law enforcement officials also did not seem to appreciate the ""profound effect"" that using dogs had, the report states.Police were criticized for taking an ""all or nothing"" approach to their tactical response during the protests. The report notes that tactical equipment could be used in a ""relatively limited manner"" and ramped up if necessary, but ""when an initial response is at a high level, options for gradual and measured escalation are more difficult.""Law enforcement ""must be reasonable and flexible with their choice of tactics ... consider the historical context of the community served, and focus not only on what may be authorized pursuant to policy but also on what is right,"" the report states. ""The assessment team concluded that the use of these military-like tactics, particularly the officers deployed with rifles, was not appropriate for the circumstances.""""While I understand that, we have to keep our people safe. Sometimes policing is not pretty,"" one police commander told investigators.As the report notes, police were at a disadvantage from the beginning of the protests, as the ""relationship between law enforcement and the communities of color in St. Louis County were extremely strained."" Additionally, as there had been no riots there after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in 1968 or after the Rodney King acquittals in 1992, the community ""did not have any prior history with a similar critical incident on which to base the turn of events that resulted after Mr. Brown's death.""The fractured nature of law enforcement in St. Louis County was also problematic. Officers from over 50 different departments reported to the command post from Aug. 9 though Aug. 25. Some of those municipalities had officers who were not even certified, and the report says some of those agencies ""may not have a focus on officers engaged in non-traffic law enforcement efforts"" and may not have the skills to respond to such unrest.While the report notes the successful strategy implemented under Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, it says that because of the time he spent on community engagement and doing media interviews, he was ""less engaged in day-to-day, hour-to-hour incident command responsibilities and instead became the public face for the police response."" The report notes that St. Louis County Police Department officers thought putting the highway patrol in charge ""showed disrespect to them and their capabilities."" St. Louis County Police Chief Belmar and then-Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson were not consulted about the change in command, according to the report.Johnson's decision to walk with the protesters along West Florissant Avenue ""seemed to have a positive impact on community relations,"" according to the report, but his ""perceived support for the demonstrators lowered morale among officers, including Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers.""Officers told the assessment team that ""inconsistent orders and a constant barrage of criticism from the public and the media"" left them with a sense of abandonment and a feeling that ""public image trumped officer safety."" Changes in policies were a constant source of tension.""There was no plan in place for arresting people and no standard way to document arrests,"" one officer said. Another officer stated that fellow officers were ""unclear who they could arrest."" Yet another officer said that their standing orders ""changed every day.""Investigators said problems came up because officers were operating for long periods of time in a stressful environment. The report points to the case of Ray Alberts, a former officer in nearby St. Ann who resigned after he was captured on video threatening Ferguson protesters; yelling, ""I will fucking kill you""; and pointing a semi-automatic assault rifle at a videographer.""Even a casual observer of the video can see that the officer looked flushed, hot, and frustrated,"" the report states. ""The involved officer was excused from Ferguson duty once the incident became known to command, and he later expressed remorse for his actions. His behavior was said to be uncharacteristic of his many years' experience as an officer, yet he not only experienced the stigma of becoming an Internet 'item' but also ultimately resigned from his position. From the videographer's perspective, the fact that the officer was under stress does not excuse the verbal abuse the videographer received or the threat of being shot and having a rifle pointed at him.""

The network will now also look at the top 10 candidates in an average of polls from Aug. 7 to Sept. 10.CNN said in a statement that it is changing its criteria because of a lack of available polling following the Aug. 6 debate, noting there have been only three new polls to help shape the lineup of the debate.""In the event that any candidate is polling in the top 10 in an average of approved national polls released between August 7th and September 10th, we will add those candidates to our top tier debate, even if those candidates did not poll in the top 10 in an average of approved national polls between July 16th and September 10th,"" CNN said in a statement. ""We have discussed these changes with the Republican National Committee and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, and they are fully supportive.""Even though the lineup for the Sept. 10 debate has not been set, Fiorina's campaign said in a statement Tuesday that she expects to be onstage at the Reagan Library in the top-tier debate.""We're so grateful to the thousands of grassroots supporters and conservative activists around the country who weren't afraid to take on the political establishment and challenge the status quo to make this happen,"" the campaign said. ""We look forward to watching Carly Fiorina debate the other front runners at the Reagan Library.""Also on HuffPost:"
8,POLITICS,Kentucky Can't Just Fire The Clerk Who Won't Give Marriage Licenses To Gay Couples,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kentucky-clerk-marriage-licenses_us_55e5c2d5e4b0c818f619224c,The benefits of being an elected official.,2015-09-01,"<p>Rowan County clerk Kim Davis (right) refused to issue marriage licenses again on Sept. 1, 2015.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e5c3cb1d00002f00146761.jpeg?cache=QpPtzvV9Fi&ops=crop_77_89_3081_1808%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The defiant Kentucky clerk who has doubled down in her determination not to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples can't be fired for refusing to do her job.On Tuesday, after the U.S. Supreme Court turned her away, Rowan County clerk Kim Davis again declined to grant those licenses, insisting that she was acting ""under God's authority."" So what happens next?Kentucky law largely shields an elected official like Davis from being forced out of her post. Until the next election, when the voters can boot her, she can be removed only through impeachment by the state legislature.That's a messy, lengthy process that has rarely been pursued in Kentucky. The simpler alternative, as Gov. Steve Beshear (D) told another recalcitrant clerk, would be for Davis to either issue the licenses or resign. But even the governor is legally powerless to make her resign.There are other ways to penalize her for shirking her official responsibilities.Kentucky civil rights attorney Joe Dunman -- who was involved in Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide -- explained in July that the state executive branch could seek charges against Davis. ""It is a crime in Kentucky for a public servant to intentionally refrain from performing a duty imposed upon him or her by the law,"" wrote Dunman in Insider Louisville.The Kentucky attorney general is currently considering the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate whether Davis is breaking the law, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal.Some state lawmakers hope to stymie that legal process. In anticipation of potential criminal repercussions for Davis and other religious objectors, they are weighing bills that would grant religious exemptions to public officials opposed to same-sex marriage.The prospect of such a carveout raises other constitutional issues, Dunman noted. For one, the clerks in question took an oath to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the United States and Kentucky. When ""they're at work, they're not acting as private individuals. They're acting as the government,"" he wrote. That was precisely the reasoning the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit adopted last week when it ruled against Davis and told her she had ""little or no likelihood"" to win her case in her official capacity.Like Davis, the plaintiffs who first sued her in federal court are also not giving up. They're pursuing a contempt action before the judge who effectively ordered her to issue marriage licenses to straight and gay couples alike. On Monday, the Supreme Court refused to intervene and delay the judge's order.The plaintiffs are seeking only financial penalties against the clerk, not incarceration.So Davis could ultimately face consequences in civil or criminal court. Or maybe political consequences before the Kentucky legislature or the electorate.Just don't hold your breath if you hope to see her get fired like anyone else would be."

Apple representatives declined to comment for Variety's piece, but here are a few takeaways you should know:• The company is meeting with Hollywood executives to gauge interest in producing original content that Apple will host. Prospective development and production divisions could be introduced soon, with eyes on a full operation in place by next year. It's unclear how much of the heavy lifting will be done in-house, as opposed to purchasing distribution rights to titles from established studios, as Netflix did with this year's ""Beasts of No Nation"" and ""The Ridiculous Six.""• There's no word on whether the plans will include movies, TV series or both. • Apple made a bid earlier this year to work with the stars of BBC motor show ""Top Gear"" on a new series, which ultimately landed at Amazon. • The Apple TV, which is reportedly due for an upgrade announcement at the company's press event next week, could play a big part in these plans. Regardless, it's unclear whether the programming would take the form of a subscription VOD model akin to Netflix or a network-based buffet like the Sony PlayStation Vue, or whether Apple will stick to the pay-per-download approach it currently employs on iTunes.For more on Apple's initiative, head to Variety.

""We need to seize the opportunity to make Michigan’s energy decisions in Lansing, not leave them in the hands of bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.""The Obama administration last month released final rules for limiting emissions from power plants, setting a national reduction target of 32 percent by 2030, as part of a larger effort to combat global warming. The administration set emission reduction targets for each state, but directed the states to come up with their own compliance plans.A group of Republican attorneys general almost immediately filed suit to block the rules, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been encouraging governors to ignore the EPA's regulations.But Snyder's office said Tuesday that developing its own compliance plan is in the state's best interest. ""Bottom line -- we believe it’s best for Michigan to be driving our energy policy and plans, not the feds,"" Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Snyder, said in an email to The Huffington Post. ""While the multi-agency state review of the utility carbon rule is ongoing, we have determined that with participation from our stakeholders, Michigan can forge a reasonable path to compliance,"" said Dan Wyant, director of the state's department of environmental quality.As MLive reports, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) was among those who filed suit to block the rules. Schuette has said he is ""deeply concerned"" that the plan ""causes the price of electricity to increase, placing jobs at risk and costing Michigan families more.""But Valerie Brader, the director of the Michigan Agency for Energy, said Tuesday that her office believes the final rules improve upon the draft version released in 2014, and that they give the state more time to comply.“While the EPA did not accept all of our suggestions to improve its proposed rule, they did recognize our concerns about competitiveness in energy production,"" said Brader. ""Michigan has made significant progress in recent decades to clean up its power production, and the EPA’s final rule recognizes our progress compared to other states in the region."""

Steve Beshear (D) -- who was a losing party in that case -- ordered state clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to all couples without regard to sexual orientation.But Davis refused time and again, even in the face of a federal lawsuit against her and an order from U.S. District Judge David Bunning telling her to comply. Last week, an appellate court told her that she had ""little or no likelihood"" of winning on her religious-freedom claim.""I hope Ms. Davis will resume issuing marriage licenses tomorrow not just to our clients but to everyone who is eligible under the law,"" tweeted Joe Dunman, a local civil rights attorney who was also involved in the case the Supreme Court decided in June.Despite the Supreme Court's refusal to intervene in Davis' case, her dispute remains alive in the court system: She remains free to challenge the merits of Bunning's decision before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.
