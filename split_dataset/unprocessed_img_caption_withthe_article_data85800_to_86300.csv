It is one of the most visible and recognizable landmarks on the university's River CampusRush Rhees Library is the main academic library of the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York. It is one of the most visible and recognizable landmarks on the university's River Campus. Construction began in 1927 with the other original River Campus buildings and the library was dedicated in 1930. It is named after Benjamin Rush Rhees, the university's third president. A major addition was added in 1970, which now houses the main computer lab, additional stacks and office space. Rush Rhees is the flagship of the River Campus Libraries System, which holds about 2.5 million volumes. The library features an elevator completely original from 1930",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae59bd240000320054e4f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights is investigating the University of Rochester over allegations that the university discriminated against a female student after she reported a sexual assault. The female freshman who filed the complaint spoke to The Huffington Post about her experience, asking to be identified only by her first name, Abigail, for privacy reasons. Abigail filed a complaint in March claiming that campus security physically subdued her and sent her to the hospital over a panic attack she experienced several days after she reported being assaulted. She also claims that the university did not provide enough academic accommodations after she reported the assault and that the mishandling of the case permitted a ""sexually hostile environment."" For all these reasons, Abigail accuses the university of discriminating against her based on her sex, violating the gender equity law Title IX.The Education Department opened the investigation of the university on May 21, according to a letter that Abigail received from the department and shared with HuffPost. As of Wednesday, the University of Rochester, a private school in New York, is one of 118 colleges and universities being investigated by the Education Department for their handling of sexual violence-related matters. UR's case deals with the treatment Abigail received after reporting an assault, but also dives into the way campus security acted during what Abigail described as a ""traumatic"" encounter with security officers who she says falsely accused her of being drunk. Abigail says she was sexually assaulted by a male student on Oct. 5, 2014, while she was heavily intoxicated. Early in the morning on Oct. 18, Abigail says she came upon one of her friends telling a dorm room full of people about the sexual assault Abigail had officially reported several days earlier.""I totally just freaked out, I had a total panic attack, a mental breakdown,"" Abigail recalls. She yelled and started crying, and someone called campus security. A handful of officers arrived, one of whom asked her to go to her room. Abigail says she replied that campus security took ""inebriated"" people more seriously than people who had been raped. They threatened to arrest her and then began to physically subdue her.""I remember the male officer grabbed my arm super hard and put me into the handcuffs,"" Abigail said. ""He pushed me up against the wall and forced me onto the ground with his knee on my back."" After that, she said, he held her on the ground for the next half hour, at one point sitting on her. More officers arrived in the hallway and demanded that she calm down, Abigail recalled, even as she demanded they get off of her. Abigail asked that someone call the public safety investigator on her sexual assault case and her resident adviser, who also knew the circumstances of her sexual assault report, hoping they could validate what Abigail had recently experienced. Witnesses said they were unable to get hold of either.""The only words being exchanged [during the incident],"" one witness, who asked not to be named, told HuffPost, ""were Abbi saying 'I don't want him to touch me.'"" Another witness wrote in a letter to the university's dean that she saw Abigail ""face down on the floor with security handcuffing her. She was crying and screaming don't touch me. A female and a male officer were holding her down even after she said that she was raped. She didn't want them to … There was no mediation or communication between the authorities and Abigail."" That witness also noted that Abigail was not ""drunk or under the influence of any other substances.""After roughly an hour, the officers ""told me that I was 'mentally unstable' and needed to be transported to the hospital,"" Abigail said. Video captured by cell phones and provided to HuffPost shows Abigail being restrained by campus security on a gurney, loaded into an ambulance and then brought into a hospital. Abigail said the doctor told her ""there's nothing wrong with you,"" and quickly let her go.""It was literally worse than being assaulted in the first place,"" Abigail said. ""So much worse -- I mean, absolutely horrific.""Reached for comment, a UR spokeswoman said, ""In order to protect the privacy of students and out of respect for them we will not comment on the details of a student's case.""In a follow-up meeting later that week, a university dean suggested to Abigail that she had been drunk during the incident with campus security, according to an audio recording of the conversation provided by Abigail. ""It is my business if an underage student is drinking, and there are consequences,"" the dean said. ""So if you want to have that kind of conversation, be my guest."" Abigail, who maintains she was not drunk during the encounter with security, pointed out to the dean that even if she had been inebriated, he was unfairly singling her out since most students at the university do drink.""Not all of them get sent to the hospital,"" the dean replied.But there's no evidence Abigail was drunk that night. Abigail and witnesses to the incident say she was not intoxicated -- it was solely a panic attack. There was no blood alcohol test performed on her that night, and hospital paperwork neglects to mention alcohol at all. There was no arrest nor any reading of Miranda rights, and the university's daily crime log contains nothing on the incident. Although Abigail was not drunk during the security incident, she said she was when she was assaulted -- something the dean was keenly aware of in the meeting, threatening possible punishments if Abigail was found to have been drinking underage. She says that during a hearing on the incident in early November, ""the guy admitted to having sexual intercourse with me -- the question was of whether I was incapacitated.""Abigail said she had felt like things would go her way based on the evidence presented, and the fact that a witness for the accused allegedly changed his version of events, ""but I got the notification the next day I apparently wasn't drunk enough."" On Nov. 4, the day after the hearing, the university sent Abigail a letter detailing the results of her hearing, which Abigail shared with HuffPost. The letter said the university had determined she was not ""incapacitated"" at the time of the alleged assault. None of the reasons for filing an appeal applied in her case. UR had recently updated its sexual misconduct policies, defining an incapacitated person as being ""mentally and/or physically helpless due to drug or alcohol consumption."" The criteria for incapacitation are whether an accused individual knew, or ""a sober reasonable person in the same position should have known, that the other party was incapacitated."" The change was supposedly an attempt to clarify that simply having a drink or two did not render someone incapacitated.Lawmakers in New York and higher education groups have pushed for alcohol amnesty policies for students who report sexual violence, due to worries that the threat of getting in trouble could stop victims from coming forward.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is close to signing legislation that would give sexual assault victims who come forward immunity from penalties related to campus alcohol policy. Several private colleges  endorsed Cuomo's proposal. Rochester was not one of them.The Association for Student Conduct Administration, a higher education professionals group, advises schools to make their alcohol amnesty policies clear to potential sexual assault victims. ""We want to encourage reporting of incidents so that students can get help and assistance if they have been assaulted, rather than having students who may have consumed some alcohol or drugs feeling that they are at fault for an incident of violence occurring to them,"" ASCA President Laura Bennett said. Abigail is no longer enrolled at UR. The university disclosed to the campus community that it was being investigated by the Education Department in late May, when it was notified of the inquiry.

Williams has admitted he spread a false story about being on a helicopter that came under enemy fire while he was reporting in Iraq in 2003. Williams said he was in a helicopter following other aircraft, one of which was hit by ground fire. His helicopter was not hit. NBC News was not commenting Thursday about whether its top on-air personality would face disciplinary action. (Photo by Brad Barket/Invision/AP, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c892240000510098040e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I watched Brian Williams' interview with Matt Lauer hoping to hear, once and for all, a contrite admission that Williams lied to us all. Repeatedly. And that he was deeply sorry for losing our trust. After all, it has been five months since the face of NBC News was suspended for embellishing a story on the air about his experiences in a military chopper which he inaccurately said had taken fire from an RPG. Williams sat down with Lauer for the taped and edited interview for Today. Expectations were high to say the least.At the end of the interview I sat in stunned silence. Maybe I missed something. So I listened again and watched even more closely to make sure that I wasn't being too hard on this guy. After all, Williams did admit to making the misleading statements saying, ""I own this. I own up to this."" Then came this doozey about his misstatement of events on NBC NIghtly News back in January that landed him in hot water:""I told the story correctly for years before I told it incorrectly. I was not trying to mislead people. That, to me, is a huge difference here."" WHAT?And as for the apology many had hoped to hear?""After that incident I tried and failed as others have tried and failed and why is it that when we're trying to say, 'I'm sorry' that we can't come out and say I'm sorry?""Wait, did he just say 'I'm sorry' or tell is he failed because he couldn't say he was sorry? The real question or course is why did he lie in the first place?This was when Williams launched into what I call his ""Flip Wilson"" Defense.In the '70s comedian Flip Wilson had a hit variety show on NBC. One of his most popular characters, Geraldine Jones, coined the national catchphrase, ""The Devil made me do it,"" to explain behavior that she knew or should have known was wrong, but she did it anyway. Cue Williams' explanation for telling his false stories:""Looking back, it had to have been ego that made me think I had to be sharper, funnier quicker than anybody else, put myself closer to the action having been at the action in the beginning.""If that didn't make your head spin, he said it again a bit later:""This came from clearly a bad place, a bad urge inside me. This was clearly ego driven, the desire to better my role in a story I was already in. That's what I've been tearing a part and unpacking and analyzing.""Translation: The Devil made me do it. It wasn't Brian. It was his EGO -- manipulating him, confusing him.Lauer: ""Did you know when you went on nightly news that you were telling a story that was not true?""Williams: ""No. It came from a bad place. It came from a sloppy choice of words. I told stories that were not true over the years looking back. it is very clear i never intended to. It got mixed up. it got turned around in my mind."" Does anyone use the word LIE anymore because I don't recall hearing it once in the questions or the answers edited from TWO days of interviewing. Really? TWO days? To get THIS? Let's not forget it took us FIVE months just to hear this much. Another disturbing development is Williams' punishment. The long-time anchor and managing editor of NBC News is banished from that program for good. His admitted ""conflating"" of events cuts to the heart of his veracity. If Williams is not fit to report on NBC Nightly News, why the heck is he going to anchor breaking news on the network's cable outlet, MSNBC? News is news. Whether we get information from the internet, newspapers, radio, cable or broadcast television, viewers have a right to demand honesty and accuracy. At the very least they expect the newscaster is not engaging in puffery. What NBC appears to be saying about its cable audience is an insult to those viewers. I don't know if Williams can be redeemed in the eyes of his viewers and fans That is for them to decide and to voice that decision with their remote control.Rest assured MSNBC viewers, Williams is on the story. As for insuring that his past transgressions will not be repeated, we have this assurance from the newsman:""I would like to take this opportunity to say that what happened in the past has been identified and torn apart by me and has been fixed, has been dealt with."" And to think I was worried."

joy, anger, curiosity, disgust, surprise, sadness, fear, shame or guilt -- all serve a distinctive purpose. Even though we might like to eliminate unfavorable emotions, they serve an important role.",2015-06-21,2015-06-21-1434849227-4515170-EmotionsandBrain.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-21-1434849227-4515170-EmotionsandBrain-thumb.jpg,"Disney Pixar's new ""emotion"" picture, Inside Out is not only another endearing creative masterpiece, it also teaches us some important lessons on the nature of our emotions.It turns out that our unique tapestry of emotional responses -- whether  joy, anger, curiosity, disgust, surprise, sadness, fear, shame or guilt -- all serve a distinctive purpose. Even though we might like to eliminate unfavorable emotions, they serve an important role.The American Psychological Association defines emotion as a ""complex feeling state"", impacting nearly all facets of our lives. Our responses are influenced by what we perceive to be ""personally significant"". We experience emotions in a wide variety of ways, according to what stage of life we are in, our unique temperament, and how we view ourselves- and the situations we find ourselves in. Inside Out, while appealing largely to a younger audience, offers sound wisdom we can apply to make sense of our emotions-both at work and at home:1. Feelings add color to our lives. Life would be boring if our emotions were flat lined. We'd lack passion and zest. The wide range of emotions we are capable of experiencing contribute to our human experience and essence -- our personality, mood, behavior and motivation. Yes, emotions can be raw, messy and visceral -- but they can also be profound, beautiful, and comforting. They all add dimension and flavor. 2. We don't always have to think positive. It's unrealistic to think that we are always going to put an instant positive spin on things. Very often, we may need to buy time to regroup and work through complex emotions. Our tendency to want a quick fix can help us look for solutions, but it can also be a trap that makes us fight ourselves when we think we ""should"" have already gotten past something and instead find ourselves needing time to regroup and put the pieces together.3. Emotional contrasts are important. When we've experienced difficult emotions, it can help us appreciate the good moments all the more. If we never had to endure rainy days and seasons, we'd have less appreciation for sunny ones once they arrive. In a similar way, it's what makes us enjoy a break after a long and intensive work period.4. Emotional states aren't permanent. Even though we might think we're forever stuck -- feeling states, like weather patterns, are temporary. The winds of change are inevitable. Knowing this can help us learn to appreciate and anchor down the positive moments and ride out the ones that clobber us and bring us to our knees. 5. Difficult emotions can protect us. If given the choice to completely squash feelings like sadness, rage and disgust, our first tendency might be to instantly jump at the chance. This could be detrimental, since our emotions provide us with all sorts of important information. Our fears or apprehensions often serve us well and prevent us from living with reckless abandon. 6. Emotions reflect our deeper values and desires. Feelings reflect what we care about. In the film, Riley, the main character, grappled with difficult emotions associated with her family moving across the country. Her happy memories of childhood were hard to let go of, bringing about great sorrow and frustration. When we're immersed in sadness or anger during life's changes, it reflects our desire for closeness, connection, and contentment. 7. All emotions can be catalysts towards growth. When we meet a goal or experience success, the energy propels us to keep striving. When we make a mistake, or have setbacks, even though it can be a tough pill to swallow, the emotions generated can prompt us to take action towards improvement. Inside Out provides a poignant reminder that when our emotional responses are strong in one area-whether joy or sorrow, we can't magically switch gears. We also learn that these emotions are intricately connected, and you can't have one without the other.We are inevitably going to have powerful responses to our life circumstances. It takes time and effort to sort out our complex emotions and come to terms with change, loss and stressors. We can't force ourselves to feel a certain way at a given moment, but knowing this can help us remember to make the joyful moments count and recognize that the more unsettling ones can also be useful."

""Though I don't think that Obama is considering suing me for this book.""Reuters was unable to reach the prosecutor's office or Erdogan's lawyer for comment.In what opponents see as part of a campaign to muzzle dissent, Erdogan has repeatedly berated news outlets including the New York Times and Turkish daily Hurriyet, while a prosecutor last month sought to shut two TV stations, seen as opposed to the government, on terrorism-related charges.Erdogan rejects the notion that Turkey, which languishes near the bottom of international press freedom tables, has anything but a free media, declaring in January that Turkish journalists were freer than any in Europe.Erdogan suffered a rare setback on June 7 when the governing AK Party he founded failed to win enough votes in a parliamentary election to remain in power as a single-party government.He had hoped for a sweeping victory for the AKP, which would have allowed it to change the constitution and give him greater power.

It's a bubble that's hard to escape. That's what makes the people with whom you surround yourself in those rare private moments all the more important. It just so happens that I'm fortunate enough to be surrounded by women. They're the most important people in my life. They're the people who've shaped me the most. And in this job, they are my sanctuary.People often ask me whether being President has made it more difficult to spend time with Michelle and our girls. But the surprising truth is that being in the White House has made our family life more ""normal"" than it's ever been. Photo credit: Official White House photo by Samantha AppletonWhen Malia was born, Michelle and I were fortunate enough to spend a blissful three months mostly at home with our baby girl. But then Michelle went back to work part time, and I returned to my schedule of teaching at the University of Chicago law school and serving in the state legislature. This meant that I would often be away in Springfield for three days at a time. Even when I was home in Chicago, I had papers to grade and briefs to write and evening meetings to attend. As professionals, we were blessed with the resources for things like reliable child care and takeout when we were too exhausted to cook. Our jobs afforded us the kind of flexibility that many working families simply don't have. Still, we each had a truckload of student debt, which meant that when we got married, we got poorer together. So we were counting every penny to manage our household bills, pay our student loans and maintain a full-time babysitter. The combined pressures sometimes put a real strain on our marriage, as they do for many working parents with young kids. After Sasha was born, Michelle was working while juggling our home life. I helped out, and I saw myself as a pretty enlightened guy. But the truth was, I helped on my terms and on my schedule, and the expectations and the burden disproportionately -- and unfairly -- fell on Michelle, as happens to many women. Fortunately, we had the help of my wonderful mother-in-law, Marian, who lived just a few minutes away. Still, Michelle was understandably stressed and frustrated, and I suspect she felt a little like a single mom sometimes. Things didn't get any easier when I was elected to the Senate and had to commute back and forth to Washington every week.

It just so happens that I'm fortunate enough to be surrounded by women. They're the most important people in my life. They're the people who've shaped me the most. And in this job, they are my sanctuary.People often ask me whether being President has made it more difficult to spend time with Michelle and our girls. But the surprising truth is that being in the White House has made our family life more ""normal"" than it's ever been. Photo credit: Official White House photo by Samantha AppletonWhen Malia was born, Michelle and I were fortunate enough to spend a blissful three months mostly at home with our baby girl. But then Michelle went back to work part time, and I returned to my schedule of teaching at the University of Chicago law school and serving in the state legislature. This meant that I would often be away in Springfield for three days at a time. Even when I was home in Chicago, I had papers to grade and briefs to write and evening meetings to attend. As professionals, we were blessed with the resources for things like reliable child care and takeout when we were too exhausted to cook. Our jobs afforded us the kind of flexibility that many working families simply don't have. Still, we each had a truckload of student debt, which meant that when we got married, we got poorer together. So we were counting every penny to manage our household bills, pay our student loans and maintain a full-time babysitter. The combined pressures sometimes put a real strain on our marriage, as they do for many working parents with young kids. After Sasha was born, Michelle was working while juggling our home life. I helped out, and I saw myself as a pretty enlightened guy. But the truth was, I helped on my terms and on my schedule, and the expectations and the burden disproportionately -- and unfairly -- fell on Michelle, as happens to many women. Fortunately, we had the help of my wonderful mother-in-law, Marian, who lived just a few minutes away. Still, Michelle was understandably stressed and frustrated, and I suspect she felt a little like a single mom sometimes. Things didn't get any easier when I was elected to the Senate and had to commute back and forth to Washington every week.

The Supreme Court is set to hear historic arguments in cases that could make same-sex marriage the law of the land. The justices are meeting Tuesday to offer the first public indication of where they stand in the dispute over whether states can continue defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman, or whether the Constitution gives gay and lesbian couples the right to marry. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb9012e220000bb01dd878f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Lawrence HurleyWASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - Tensions are building inside and outside the white marble facade of the U.S. Supreme Court building as the nine justices prepare to issue major rulings on gay marriage and President Barack Obama's healthcare law by the end of the month.Of the 11 cases left to decide, the biggest are a challenge by gay couples to state laws banning same-sex marriage and a conservative challenge to subsidies provided under the Obamacare law to help low- and middle-income people buy health insurance that could lead to millions of people losing medical coverage.Many legal experts predict the court will legalize gay marriage nationwide by finding that the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of equal treatment under the law and due process prohibit states from banning same-sex nuptials.The four liberal justices are expected to support same-sex marriage, and conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, the expected swing vote, has a history of backing gay rights.In three key decisions since 1996, Kennedy has broadened the court's view of equality for gays. The most recent was a 2013 case in which the court struck down a federal law denying benefits to married same-sex couples.During oral arguments in the gay marriage case on April 28, Kennedy posed tough questions to lawyers from both sides but stressed the nobility and dignity of same-sex couples.The healthcare decision is tougher to call. Chief Justice John Roberts, the swing vote when the court upheld Obamacare in 2012, said little during the March 4 oral argument to indicate how he will vote.The court will issue some rulings on Monday, with more likely later in the week.For the justices, the pressure is on to have the rulings ready. That can be difficult as the cases in which they are closely divided are generally the ones left until the end.Outside the court, those with a stake in the outcome of the rulings are left anxiously waiting.James Obergefell, one of the plaintiffs in the gay marriage case, said he will be at the court for all the remaining decision days.Obergefell sued Ohio, challenging its ban on same-sex marriages, after the state refused to acknowledge his marriage to John Arthur on Arthur's death certificate. They were married in Maryland, a state that allows gay marriages, just months before Arthur died in 2013.The Supreme Court does not announce in advance which rulings will be issued on any given day.""It's nerve-racking, it's exciting, but it's also scary,"" Obergefell said while waiting in line to enter the courtroom on Thursday.On the other side of the issue, the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian group that opposes gay marriage, will have at least two attorneys in the courtroom, spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.As for the closed-door deliberations at the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hinted during a June 12 speech at the turmoil to come. ""Sharp divisions, one can confidently predict, will rise in the term's final weeks,"" Ginsburg said.Prior to June 15, the court was split 5-4 in only seven of the 46 cases decided at that point. But last week alone, four of the nine rulings were 5-4 decisions. In the rulings, several justices wrote separate opinions in which they aimed pointed comments at their colleagues.(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)"

In 1999, she founded a dog and cat sanctuary known as the ""Common Home for All."" She has taken in hundreds of animals and has sold her home, relying on rented space to house them, according to a 2013 video about her work.She prepares meals for the animals and calls them her ""children,"" the India Times reported.

Dog meat consumption does have a historical precedent in China, according to Peter Li, a China policy specialist at Humane Society International and associate professor at the University of Houston-Downtown, but the Yulin festival only dates back to 2009.About 10,000 dogs are killed each year for the Yulin festival, which coincides with the summer solstice. Some of the dogs that arrive in the city have collars, reported the Daily Beast, indicating that they may be stolen pets.Actor and animal advocate Ricky Gervais condemned the festival and said footage he saw from past years broke his heart. ""I will never forget the look of bewilderment and fear on the faces of these poor animals -- the dogs and cats await a horrible fate,"" he said in a statement. ""No animal deserves to be treated like this.""Yang reportedly wants to open another dog sanctuary, in Yulin. Check out more photos of Saturday's rescue below.

Elected on a pledge to end austerity, Tsipras has defiantly resisted demands to cut pension spending and is pushing strongly for debt relief in return for any concessions.But Greek officials have said Athens may be willing to consider raising value-added-taxes or other levies to appease the lenders, who want concrete assurances that demanding budget targets will be met.""There is no time to lose. Every day counts. Talks and negotiations must continue so that an agreement is reached,"" Hollande told a joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.Locked out of bond markets and with bailout aid frozen since summer last year, Athens is quickly running out of cash. The deputy finance minister on Sunday confirmed Athens had enough money to pay public sector wages and pensions this month.But Athens also urgently needs access to funds to avoid defaulting on a 1.6 billion euro IMF loan that falls due at the end of the month. As the crisis gets pushed from one meeting to the next, each side has put the responsibility on the other's shoulder for finding a deal.Money has drained out of Greek banks after a breakdown in talks last weekend, and Greece might have to impose capital controls within days if there is no breakthrough.Underlining the pressure to stem the flow of withdrawals, Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras met senior bankers on Friday and told them to brace for a ""difficult day"" on Tuesday if no deal is reached, two bankers at the meeting told Reuters.Sources in Frankfurt and in Brussels said the European Central Bank's board would discuss the liquidity of Greece's banking sector at 0830 GMT on Monday. The sources said Greek pre-orders for deposit withdrawals for Monday had already reached 1 billion euros - after savers pulled over 4 billion euros out of their banks last week.European ministers have played down the prospect of a final agreement on Monday but hope a political understanding can be reached in time for a full deal by the end of June.  NO TO BLACKMAILFor a deal to work, Tsipras will need a solution that is acceptable to his party or else may be pushed to call a snap election or a referendum to secure a mandate for an agreement.Supporters of his Syriza party rallied in Athens on Sunday to send ""a loud message of resistance"" against demands for more cuts and tax hikes in a country battered by years of recession.Under austerity measures imposed by the IMF, the European Union and the European Central Bank in two bailouts, Greece's economic output has fallen by a quarter, wages and pensions have been slashed and unemployment is running at 25 percent.The Greek government has argued the austerity imposed on the southern European country had made the crisis worse. A senior Syriza lawmaker said on Sunday that previous ideas put forward by Juncker would have led to a ""social holocaust.""""Democracy cannot be blackmailed, dignity cannot be bargained,"" the Syriza party said in a statement on Sunday, announcing its planned protest.""Workers, the unemployed, young people, the Greek people and the rest of the peoples of Europe will send a loud message of resistance to the alleged one-way path of austerity, resistance to the blackmail and scaremongering.""But the mood has also hardened in Germany, which has contributed more money than any other country to bailing out Greece. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is under pressure from within her ranks not to give in to Greek demands, even if that means contemplating Greece leaving the euro zone.Merkel's Bavarian allies warned against giving in to Greece, with senior Christian Social Union lawmaker Hans Michelbach saying he saw no realistic chance of an agreement on Monday.""If the EU lets the government in Athens get away with its intransigence, we can bury the euro,"" Michelbach said in a statement on Sunday.""Either Greece declares itself willing for a viable solution or the country must leave the euro. The euro zone could cope with the consequences of a Greek exit,"" he said.

Right now, practically nothing.But it will if California's Santa Cruz County has any say. First, some background.Five giant banks -- including Wall Street behemoths JPMorgan Chase and Citicorp -- recently pleaded guilty to criminal felony charges that they rigged the world's foreign-currency market for their own profit.This wasn't a small heist. We're talking hundreds of billions of dollars worth of transactions every day.The banks altered currency prices long enough for the banks to make winning bets before the prices snapped back to what they should have been. Attorney General Loretta Lynch called it a ""brazen display of collusion"" that harmed ""countless consumers, investors and institutions around the globe -- from pension funds to major corporations, and including the banks' own customers.""The penalty? The banks have agreed to pay $5.5 billion. That may sound like a big chunk of change, but for a giant bank it's the cost of doing business. In fact, the banks are likely to deduct the fines from their taxes as business costs.The banks sound contrite. After all, they can't have the public believe they're outright crooks.It's ""an embarrassment to our firm, and stands in stark contrast to Citi's values,"" says Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat.Values? Citigroup's main value is to make as much money as possible. Corbat himself raked in $13 million last year.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon calls it ""a great disappointment to us,"" and says ""we demand and expect better of our people.""Expect better? If recent history is any guide -- think of the bank's notorious ""London Whale"" a few years ago, and, before that, the wild bets leading to the 2008 bailout -- JPMorgan expects exactly this kind of behavior from its people.Which helped Dimon rake in $20 million last year, as well as a $7.4 million cash bonus.When real people plead guilty to felonies, they go to jail. But big banks aren't people despite what the five Republican appointees to the Supreme Court say.The executives who run these banks aren't going to jail, either. Apologists say it's not fair to jail bank executives because they don't know what their rogue traders are up to.Yet ex-convicts often suffer consequences beyond jail terms. In many states they lose their right to vote. They can't run for office or otherwise participate in the political process.So why not take away the right of these convicted banks to participate in the political process, at least for some years? That would stop JPMorgan's Dimon from lobbying Congress to roll back the Dodd-Frank act, as he's been doing almost non-stop. Why not also take away their right to pour money into politics? Wall Street banks have been among the biggest contributors to political campaigns. If they're convicted of a felony, they should be barred from making any political contributions for at least ten years.Real ex-convicts also have difficulty finding jobs. That's because, rightly or wrongly, many people don't want to hire them. A strong case can be made that employers shouldn't pay attention to criminal convictions of real people who need a fresh start, especially a job.But giant banks that have committed felonies are something different. Why shouldn't depositors and investors consider their past convictions?Which brings us to Santa Cruz County.The county's board of supervisors just voted not to do business for five years with any of the five banks felons.The county won't use the banks' investment services or buy their commercial paper, and will pull its money out of the banks to the extent it can.""We have a sacred obligation to protect the public's tax dollars and these banks can't be trusted. Santa Cruz County should not be involved with those who rigged the world's biggest financial markets,"" says supervisor Ryan Coonerty.The banks will hardly notice. Santa Cruz County's portfolio is valued at about $650 million. But what if every county, city, and state in America followed Santa Cruz County's example, and held the big banks accountable for their felonies?What if all of us taxpayers said, in effect, we're not going to hire these convicted felons to handle our public finances? We don't trust them. That would hit these banks directly. They'd lose our business. Which might even cause them to clean up their acts.There's hope. Supervisor Coonerty says he'll be contacting other local jurisdictions across the country, urging them to do what Santa Cruz County is doing. ROBERT B.

Most of us utter a silent prayer, thankful our families aren't shot and continue on with daily life while blaming it on American gun culture or our broken government or something. A few break their silence as they blame the Charleston church shooting on ""the assault on religious liberty"" (Rick Santorum) or ""an accident caused by drugs"" (Rick Perry) or ""a sickness of not understanding where salvation comes from"" (Rand Paul). Some have even suggested that more guns is the answer, such as ""allowing concealed guns in churches to combat the bad guys with guns"" (Mike Huckabee).Statements like these are designed to garner short lived publicity while most elected officials stay mute. They are silent about our gun violence epidemic, not wanting to upset the gun lobby, who they believe keep them safely ensconced in office. President Obama appears visibly dejected that Congress will remain silent and not act once again after this latest massacre. We are supposed to resign ourselves to inaction and pray our way in silence to some sort of healing.I am sick and tired of silence. I am tired of adding new people to my list of gun violence survivor friends who spend their energy trying to keep the rest of us from joining their club. I am sick of public nonchalance that occurs after each mass shooting, as Americans surrender to the successful marketing of the gun lobby's interpretation of our Constitution. Victims are buried, lengthy trials are endured and we move on until the next tragedy rivets us, hopeful that it doesn't happen to our own family.Silence is killing us. Last year in 2014, Missouri ballots contained a total of nine state constitutional amendments, including a new and improved right to bear arms provision. Urban prosecutors warned legislators that the proposed amendment would result in violent felons keeping firearms, but it advanced to the ballot anyway. Amendment 5 went to the voters in August 2014 but only 28.6% of Missouri registered voters bothered to show up to the polls and the amendment passed. Voter silence has resulted in mass legal confusion regarding the new amendment, which contains the nation's strictest gun rights protections in the country.So who is responsible? We are.  Collective silence and dismal voter turnout throughout the country has elected legislators by default, the ones who are now in charge of advancing policy. Because of redistricting, most state legislators in the 39 GOP-controlled state legislatures are essentially elected in primary elections when the majority of voters stay home in silence. In November 2014, with four serious constitutional amendments but no challenged statewide candidates on the Missouri ballot, a paltry 35.2 percent of voters showed up. Almost 65% of registered Missouri voters stayed away, as legislators endorsed by the NRA were effortlessly swept into office. Who is ultimately responsible for dozens of gun lobby sponsored bills advancing not just in Missouri each year but in other conservative legislatures? We are. Who is responsible for the many legislators who remain silent during floor debate, even though their districts suffer the most gun violence in the state? We are. Who is responsible for a Congress which continually fails to advance policies like universal background checks even though 90 percent of us, including gun owners and NRA members, overwhelmingly support these common sense measures? We are. Who is responsible for re-electing a Congress which ignores majority opinion in favor of standing with the gun lobby? We are. Who is responsible for the myth that one can't get elected if they stand up to the profiteering of gun manufacturers? We are.In our silence, we have forgotten that we hold the power to save lives.Our power is our vote -- the power that the majority of Americans don't utilize unless it's a sexy presidential election year. Most Americans have no clue who represents them in state houses (where most gun laws are being passed) or even in Congress, which is exactly how the NRA wants it. On top of that, the NRA knows exactly who votes and who doesn't because voting records are public and available to anyone. Vote the good guys/gals in, vote the bad guys/gals out. It's simple. Demand that every candidate say exactly where they stand on removing guns from abusers and restricting guns from criminals and the violent unstable. Ask candidates in every single election, including school board races where many candidates get started in the political pipeline. Make it your responsibility to find out if they back the gun lobby platform or not. Or get angry enough at the silence and run yourself. That is what happened to me seven years ago. But sadly I'm one of the loners in my state house who is willing to engage in debate and publicly stand up to decrease the number of gun violence victims. We need more.Our silence on election days is increasing the carnage and suffering. We cannot afford more silence. Please help. Silence is killing us."

""I think foreign policy is a Republican base issue, which is why you see Republicans coming out of the gate talking about it,"" Democratic strategist Stephanie Cutter said on NBC's Meet the Press on June 14. Challenged on that, she said, ""It's a Republican establishment issue, and it always has been.""Tell that to President Obama, Vice President Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, former Maine Democratic Sen. George Mitchell, the Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, all the voters who opposed the Iraq war, all the veterans who support Democrats, the organization known as VoteVets.org, etc. From the rise of ISIS, to Russian President Vladimir Putin's chest-thumping, to Israel's struggles with the Palestinians, to the nuclear negotiations with Iran, to cybersecurity, trade, China's rise and tensions with North Korea, foreign policy has become all-consuming for the executive branch and will take up a huge chunk of the 45th president's time and energy. But one of the most prominent Democratic strategists in the country is ready to cede foreign policy to the Republicans about nine months before each party knows who its nominees will be. And this idea -- that foreign policy and national security are topics that simply fire up the Republican base -- is a theory I've heard repeated by multiple Democratic operatives in the past week, meaning it's a line of spin some of the party is beginning to adopt. The strategy behind that spin is as follows: Hillary Clinton spent four years running the State Department, so foreign policy should be among her greatest strengths. In politics smart, aggressive campaigns drive hard at their opponents' biggest strengths to try to turn them into weaknesses. Given that Clinton presided over the nation's foreign policy during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and as other global hots spots grew more dangerous, Republicans could cast her tenure as a failure with relative ease and therefore find success in making it a weakness for her. On the flip side, she has four years' worth of learning and management experiences in this arena that no other candidate in the race has. Love her or hate her, that's a valuable credential. She's a pretty smart woman, so she probably understands that. And yet, everyone with a pulse noticed she barely touched on global issues during her campaign launch on June 13 on Roosevelt Island and didn't speak much about her experiences as secretary of state. The explanation I've heard is that voters know her well in that role and now she's trying to re-introduce herself in a broader way, get an economic message rolling and appease the Democratic base with her populist approach. Politically that could be reasonable, but she should have given a little time to this resume item that no one else has and that should set her apart from the pack. Since she didn't, the narrative that foreign policy may be a weakness for her could be beginning to crystallize. And since she didn't, this one line was the most interesting part of the entire speech: ""I believe the future holds far more opportunities than threats if we exercise creative and confident leadership that enables us to shape global events rather than be shaped by them.""Parsing that, there may be a bit of a dig at her old boss, the president, in the word ""confident."" His critics say he's conflicted about just how engaged the United States should be in international flare-ups. Her take on that will be interesting. As an American and as a journalist, I'm eager to hear exactly what creative leadership means. She had a fair amount of autonomy in Foggy Bottom, but she still had to answer to President Obama. How will her approach be different? From the statement she made, it sounds as though she's planning to address all that in due time, and she should be afforded that chance. Contextually, Cutter and other Democrats are trying to say those issues may be more important to Republican voters than Democratic voters, and so Republican candidates are trying hard to drive that wedge. But that doesn't change what independent voters heard, and that is a problem. Several months ago, I asked Jeb Bush's chief strategist, David Kochel, if he thought national security would be the driving issue in the election, and his response was that it will factor more prominently into this election than it has in the last several. One month ago, pollsters on both sides of the aisle told me national security could be a driver in the election, but only if some major attack happens between now and then. They all said that's plausible, and it is.In recent weeks Republican campaigns have taken note of what Democrats are pushing and are sensing a potential advantage in trying to get the upper hand on foreign policy.A recent Gallup poll showed 49 percent of Americans are concerned that a member of their family could become a victim of terrorism, which is up nine percentage points in two years and is the highest it's been since 9/11. That's not a number to brush aside. Americans I've spoken to all across the political spectrum are terrified about ISIS and future attacks on American soil. Clinton and the Democrats supporting her most certainly will have something to say about it. Voters deserve a full-fledged debate about this scary new frontier, and Democratic pundits ought to let us hear it."

If you're a child, set on survival, you block it out and move on. My father was killed in a car accident when I was 10 -- 42 years ago, June 9th. I've said those first 12 words countless times in my life. It's been a defining detail of my life, and something I wrestled with in endless scenarios in my head, since the morning we heard -- on a cruelly sunny day. I remember the tiniest details of hearing he was dead, with Technicolor precision. And yet, I forgot some of the most important parts ... until two months ago.Life threw another curve ball 10 weeks ago that brought all those memories back, and has changed everything. Everything -- about who I thought I was, what I thought much of my life was about, how I see the people I've loved, and how I want to live my life from now on. I've spent weeks unscrambling a world of hurt that I've needed to digest and come to terms with -- and accepting that I may never have all the answers I want. When I was 7, my parents separated. The oldest of their three children, I had a 5-year-old brother and a 2-year-old sister then. I remember my parents arguing; I remember them happy as well. I remember that when they separated my brother and I felt like the world was falling in. I remember living with dad and my great-grandmother, Nini, and feeling very loved, surrounded by people -- grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, friends and neighbors, who thought we were the most important people in the world. I felt safe; loved, and important. Times with my mother weren't quite that way, and as young children, we grappled with many of the same things that children of divorce feel as they negotiate two homes and less than ideal circumstances. My mother took us back east when I was nine. My father delivered us to her apartment, planning to pick us up the next evening. As soon as he drove away, a moving truck picked up all of her things and we boarded a 747 the next day for Massachusetts. I remember my mother told us it was a surprise, and that we shouldn't tell our dad. It all seemed so exciting and surreal to my 9-year-old brain. It never occurred to me that she was taking us without my father's permission; it never occurred to me that I would never see him again. Suddenly our world was filled with new grandparents, new aunts and uncles, cousins, and neighbors. They loved us and we loved them, but from that day on there was a hole where my father and his family had been. I wondered why dad never called, why he didn't come get us, how he could just let us go. My mother told us that he was a ""good daddy, but that he didn't take care of us."" She told us that she ""had no choice but to take us, so that she could be with her family for support."" Over the years, she painted a picture of a classic Peter Pan father who didn't pay child support, wasn't there to care for us, but was good when it came to play time and fun. I knew from the way she spoke, that none of this was good, and while it didn't fit with my own memories of the love and safety I'd felt with him, I too began to describe my father as ""a good daddy, but not a good father."" I am sure I said those words 100 times through the years. I said them to friends; I said them to my own children. And over time, I buried anything that didn't fit that picture; I forgot that it wasn't true.  (Taken the year my dad died, I see wariness and loss in these eyes.)Children do not understand the truly devastating things that adults will do when they feel trapped, and my mother spent most of her life feeling trapped. Even the most abused children cling to the parent that abuses them. They try to be perfect and hope that they will be loved and valued. While I wasn't the ""most abused child,"" things were not good, and I knew that I needed to believe whatever my mother told me, to win her approval. I knew that things seemed much less stable with my mom, that my role went from child to co-parent overnight, and that our father didn't want us anymore -- but most of all, I knew that I needed to believe whatever my mother told me. And so I accepted that my father had moved on -- that maybe there were other children he loved now. I came to believe that the magical times I remembered with him and his family were figments of a young and wishful mind. When he was killed in a car accident a year later, I grieved -- inside everything felt black and empty -- but I grew up accepting my mother's version of him.Throughout my life I've struggled with confusing memories, and details that never added up. In describing time, the years didn't fit with the memories; the math was all screwy. This seemed really strange coming from a person who has such vivid memories of so many -- extremely detailed memories of so much of my childhood ... with my father. And that's just it, I've always lacked memories of my mother. Before my father's death, there were none, for long stretches, and that didn't fit with the stories she told me, and that I accepted.Two months ago, my father's sisters set it all straight, and I've been unraveling the shock ever since. My mother abandoned us. She left me and my two small siblings, alone in an apartment, for my father to find, and then she disappeared for 16 months. No calls to check on us, no visits for birthdays, nothing. She simply disappeared, and my father raised us with my great grandmother and his family. They celebrated our birthdays, took us to school, and loved us. They never spoke ill of my mother to us; they circled the wagons and made sure we knew we were safe and loved. Still, I was old enough to know that something horrible had happened. Each night I lay awake, hyper-vigilant and afraid that my dad, my great-grandmother, and maybe even my siblings would vanish too. I checked each one as they slept. I sat by the curb in the day, waiting, but my mom didn't come. We all worked on getting beyond that curve ball. We rubbed our bruises and worked on healing.The day she took us was the first time we'd seen her in at least 16 months. I've always remembered how wary I felt with her when my father drove away that day -- again, viscerally clear in my memory. For most of my life I've felt guilty for that; for being scared when we got on that plane, and when we met all those new family members. I felt guilty for not trusting my mother, most of my life. And yet, I forgot why. The trauma of her abandonment and then my father's death left me clinging to her version of things, completely burying all that had happened in those critical months when she left us behind. When the words came out of my aunt's mouth ""what else would your dad have done -- your mother abandoned you for nearly two years!"" it all came crashing back -- every missing memory, every dark detail; the math suddenly added up again. I had no memories of my mother for so long because she wasn't there. In the two months since all of this came out, I've struggled to come to terms with all of the implications and realities of this shocking truth. My father never abandoned us; my mother did. He wasn't a careless father, or a man who didn't pay child support. He wasn't a Peter Pan caricature who moved on when his wife stole his children; he called and he searched. He was a man who ""was never the same, from the minute he went to pick his children up and found an empty apartment."" He was ""devastated when he couldn't find them for five months,"" because his wife's parents denied knowing where they were. He grieved every single day, and worked to get his children back, at a time when jumping on a plane was a monumental feat. He never forgot them; he mourned their absence each day, and worked to save the money to see his children again. My father was killed two weeks before a scheduled visit back east, to finally see us. Is there a crueler irony? We were so excited that he was coming; now I am haunted by what that probably meant to him. I believed my mother's story that they were going to try and fix their marriage; I've clung to that romantic vision. Now I believe his only intention was to get us back. I've dug in those sad places and asked questions. I'm searching for truths. I've spent these weeks remembering every detail that has been buried for so long, and talking to other people who remember.  (With my great-grandmother)I remember that my father loved us. He took good care of us -- working long hours and living with his grandmother, in order to give his three young children a safe and loving home. We had a garden we played in. We had dinners with my dad and Nini each night, where we were expected to have good manners and eat every bite. There were boundaries and a safe rhythm to our lives. Baths at night, and long bike rides on sunny days. There were strawberries we planted together and picked in the spring. We walked to school with our friends, with lunches packed for us. We were loved, and cared for. This Father's Day I'm missing that father who took such good care of us, who loved us so much, and lost us. I'm missing the father I lost through death and stories. I'm asking forgiveness for believing what I always knew wasn't true. I'm grieving a daddy that was all of the wonderful things I tried to forget, to not feel the pain of losing him. I'm letting go of the stories my mother told me because I don't need to believe lies anymore. I'm not interested in demonizing her. She was a broken person, who struggled all of her life. I've always known that. We did our healing before she died, and I loved her. But, what she did was horrible. She took us from our father geographically, and then filled our heads with stories that took him away from us on a much deeper level. I've spent 42 years trying to add things up that didn't add up, and afraid to trust my own gut and instincts -- because all those years ago I learned that survival depended on believing what I knew wasn't true.  (Safe in my father's lap)This Father's Day I'm reclaiming my own memories and embracing them. There are so many parents who, in doing what they think is right, leave scarred children in their wake. I'm sorry my mother was so lost and scarred, herself, that she didn't think about how her decisions and lies would leave me the same way. She struggled with her own demons. I understand, but it's hard to forgive it. But I am not my mother. I'm living with truth now. I was a child whose father loved her very much; I'm a woman who remembers that.  If words could make wishes come true... Dad, this one's for you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sQ7cuYgjzw  ""I've been afraid of changing, because I built my life around you.

King passed away suddenly March 27 at age 67 from complications of pneumonia.Former President Bill Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, Norman Lear, Elton John, Whoopi Goldberg and Sugar Ray Leonard, among others, remembered King as an ""intellectual"" but ""street-smart"" businessman, an outsized personality, a generous philanthropist and exceptionally kind and devoted friend, brother, husband, father and uncle. Kenny G, Michael Bolton and David Foster performed at the invitation-only event, held by King's wife, Jena and children Ali, Audrey, Teddy and Jesse.As Clinton remarked later in the program, referencing a poem by William Wordsworth, King's ""last best hope of his great good life were the unforgettable acts of kindness, love and laughter. We are all here because we basked in his embrace.""White floral arrangements and candles in tall glass votives set an elegant and peaceful scene as bagpipes welcomed 400-plus guests, including Bobby Kennedy Jr., Sylvester Stallone and Jennifer Flavin, Don Henley and Joe Walsh from The Eagles, Netflix's Ted Sarandos, producer Lawrence Bender and actors Tommy Chong, Paul Reiser and Lorraine Bracco.A bagpipe rendition of ""Amazing Grace"" marked the start of the service, after which Monsignor Lloyd Torgerson from St. Monica's Church in Santa Monica, California, led those gathered in prayer. King's children then came on stage, the oldest three giving emotional, at times tearful, speeches about their love for their dad -- and his love for them. Eldest daughter and singer Ali said King was ""the funniest person I know."" Son Teddy, a student at the University of Southern California, called his father his ""best friend."" Teenage daughter Audrey welcomed guests and spoke on behalf of her mother, who was seated in the audience, then read two searing poems she wrote herself, leaving many attendees in tears. In one, titled ""Poem For My Mom,"" she wrote:A love so intangible, is that much More alluring- That much more passionate. When you feel the cold wind Just know it is him kissing your neck, Teasing your senses, Reminding you He loves you.Teddy introduced the former president with an anecdote of a trip he took with his dad and Clinton to South Africa, where the trio had gone to do charity work and visit Nelson Mandela. A known jokester, King impersonated Clinton, who had fallen asleep in the jeep. The account elicited laughs from the audience.""Teddy, thanks for that wonderful story, I would far rather be impersonated by your father than anyone I can think of,"" Clinton began, to laughter. ""I will say this: We have this vast King clan here, and we had the bagpipers playing, and I thought, 'It is so Michael King, ending with a flourish, an invasion of the Skirball Center by the Irish Catholics.'"" Clinton continued on a serious note in light of the Charleston shooting on June 18.""Everywhere in the world is bedeviled by people who are the opposite of Michael King. People who think all that matters is our differences,"" Clinton said. ""We have more refugees than any time since World War II. It was a terrible, terrible thing that happened in South Carolina yesterday. Michael King is the polar opposite of all that."" Robert, King's brother and partner in King World Productions, followed the former president's remarks, saying his younger brother ""would not want us to mourn his death; he'd want us to celebrate."" Older brother Richie offered a few, heartbroken words about the loss of a national treasure, his business partner and his best friend of 67 years. ""That's all I can say,"" he said, choking back tears.Kenny G performed, dedicating his song, ""Innocence,"" to the family. And tributes, tears and laughter continued.Collaborator and producer Jeff Wald joked, ""I was worried about going on after President Clinton -- then I realized I couldn't do worse than George Bush."" Producer Norman Lear panned, ""There are people all over this town who would die to put a crowd like this together."" Confessing that he had thought King was Jewish throughout their 30-year friendship until just before the memorial service, Lear said, ""Jewish. Irish. It doesn't matter. Michael was the definition of the word 'mensch.'""The speeches were interspersed by video tributes from those unable to attend, including Elton John, Whoopi Goldberg and Sugar Ray Leonard. In hers, Oprah Winfrey offered her condolences and shared photos and memories of King. ""Here was a man who really knew how to live. He didn't just live big -- he lived huge,"" she said. Major philanthropists to many causes, King and his wife donated to friend, lawyer and speaker Robert Shapiro's foundation to combat drug addiction, and to Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen's Oceana foundation, the largest ocean-conservation charity in the world. ""I really felt Michael got to experience the joy of what it means to be human,"" Danson said. ""He got to love and be loved.""The event concluded with musical performances by Michael Bolton and producer David Foster, who sent the crowd off on a buoyant note: ""Let's do this right. Everybody get up, scream, shout, and stomp your feet so wherever he is, he can hear us right now."""

The capital of Anbar province, its population of around 800,000 inhabitants makes it second only to Mosul among the cities controlled by IS. The fall of Ramadi was a sharp reversal for the Iraqi government, coming only weeks after the successful capture of Tikrit from Islamic State militants, and cast new doubts on the effectiveness of the Baghdad government's ability to successfully roll back the Islamic State.Criticism and blame was quick to follow. The governor of Anbar province blamed the central government in Baghdad for the lack of promised reinforcements. Government officials, off the record, blamed the lack of adequate American air support, citing the fact that only about 36 strikes were carried out by U.S. led coalition forces. The Pentagon blamed The Iraqi Army unwillingness to fight noting that ISIS forces were outnumbered 10 to 1. In the United States, pundits, most notably CNN's Fareed Zakaria, were quick to announce that Iraq had ceased to exist and that there was no one there willing to fight to preserve the country. In a remarkable twist, Iran Quds Force commanders and the Shiite militia allies claimed that it was the United States, through its lack of support, which had demonstrated an unwillingness to fight.  Refugees Fleeing Ramada, Photo courtesy U.N. Press OfficeThe truth as usual lies somewhere in the middle. First of all, the Battle for Ramadi has been going on since the winter of 2014. Control of large portions of the city have shifted back and forth between Islamic State militants and Iraqi government forces. Baghdad had managed to regain control of most of the city by May of 2014 only to steadily lose ground to IS forces over the summer and fall of 2014. By October 2014, IS claimed that it was in control of 60 percent of Ramadi and that in addition it controlled the approaches to Ramadi from the south, north and west of the city. Fighting continued over the winter months with IS militant making slow but steady gains. On May 14, IS forces launched a new assault on the area still held by government forces using bulldozers that had been reinforced with steel plating as well as a series of 10 suicide car bombs, many using captured Humvee vehicles, to burst through the defensive ring around the center of the city. Heavy fighting continued till May 17, when the last government controlled neighborhood, Mal'ab, in the south of Ramadi fell. Fighting Around Ramadi's Saddam MosqueWhile it is true that Iraqi forces outnumbered IS militants by a considerable margin, many of the Iraqi army forces were spread out through the region surrounding Ramadi in defensive positions. By the time the attack started, Islamic State already controlled about 80% of Ramadi. Moreover, the claim that the Iraqi Army refused to fight was not entirely fair. Observers on the ground did report that some Iraqi Army units fought tenaciously. In particular, the First Brigade of the Iraqi Special Operations Forces, an American trained Special Forces unit nicknamed ""The Golden Division"" earned high praise from both American military observers and journalists embedded in the unit. Still, there is no question that other Iraqi Army units, in a pattern long since grown familiar, abandoned equipment and supplies and beat a hasty retreat. With the collapse of a defensive perimeter as a result of disorganized retreats even the most tenacious units have little option but to withdraw least they get outflanked and surrounded. ISIS Banners Over Ramadi, May 2015Criticism of the lack of U.S. air support also had some validity. Eric Schmitt, writing in the New York Times on May 26, quoted a number of American and Iraqi military officials expressing their concerns that the rule of engagement imposed on American pilots were so restrictive that important, obvious targets were being ignored for fear of collateral casualties to civilians. Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee claims that only one in four missions actually result in a strike against an Islamic State target. The pace of air operations is also considered inadequate by observers on the ground. Currently air operations average 15 missions over Iraq and Syria combined. In contrast, air operations during the intervention in Libya averaged 50 a day. Over Afghanistan in 2001, air missions averaged 85 daily. During the height of the war in Iraq in 2003, air operations numbered some 800 missions a day. The absence of American forward air controllers on the ground, the result of a deliberate White House decision not to deploy them, has also hampered the effectiveness of the air campaign. The criticism by the government in Baghdad, as well as from some of the Shite militias, that Washington is doing the absolute minimum in deploying air power against Islamic State has some merit.At the moment, the Iraqi government finds itself engaged with Islamic State on two distinct fronts. For convenience's sake we can think of these as the Tigris River Valley Front and the Euphrates River Valley Front. The Tigris Front runs roughly north-south, from Mosul in the north through, Baiji, Tikrit, and Samarra to Baghdad and south to Basra where the Tigris river links up with the Euphrates. The Euphrates Front runs roughly northwest to southeast through Fallujah, Ramadi and the rest of Anbar province to Aleppo in Syria.  U.S. Jet Over IraqThe Baghdad government has the ability to project significant force, to call if overwhelming is a bit charitable, in one front but not simultaneously in both. Advances on one front invariable bring Islamic State counterattacks on the second front. The fall of Tikrit, on the Tigris front, brought simultaneous IS counterattacks on Baiji, north of Tikrit and on Ramadi on the Euphrates front. The simultaneous attacks, characteristic of the nimbleness that IS has demonstrated in the war with Baghdad, resulted in pinning down significant Iraqi forces around Baiji that might otherwise been available to deploy in Ramadi. Currently, Islamic State controls about 80 percent of Anbar province. It is clear that IS has placed a great deal of strategic value in controlling Anbar. This control allows it to maintain the road links between its territories in Syria and those in Iraq. Given the success of Kurdish forces in cutting off most of the road access between Mosul and Syria and their continued success in clearing the adjacent Kurdish zones in northern Syria from IS militants, the loss of Anbar would effectively split the Islamic state into two separate geographic zones. The Iraqi government has recognized the importance of regaining control of Anbar and has prioritized this campaign over retaking Mosul.One of the dilemmas facing the Iraqi government is the fact that currently it has two armies, an American trained and equipped, official Iraqi Army and an Iranian Quds Force led, Shiite militia army. The regular Iraqi Army is currently at about half its designated strength of 14 divisions. The United States has been in the process of retraining and rebuilding the Iraqi Army. To date, the US has lavished some 25 billion dollars in training and equipment on the Iraqi Army and Baghdad has spent even more. As currently constituted it does not appear that the Iraqi army can muster enough strength to defend the country from Islamic State militants much less roll back their territorial gains.  Shiite Militia Fighters, Photo courtesy Iraq News AgencyMoreover, notwithstanding some notable exceptions, the effectiveness of the Iraqi army is in serious doubt. The Baghdad government used the Iraqi military as a giant slush fund to reward its supporters. At the time of the Islamic State's attack on Iraq, roughly a quarter of Iraq's army consisted of phantom soldiers; enlisted personnel drawing a paycheck of a few hundred dollars a month but otherwise permanently AWOL. Senior officer appointments were based on political loyalty to Iraq's leaders rather than military competence. Corruption in the Iraq military is rife and, not surprisingly, moral in the enlisted ranks is poor. Given those conditions, the lack of battlefield effectiveness by the Iraqi army will hardly come as a surprise. The collapse of the Iraqi army over the summer of 2014 led the Iraqi government to mobilize Shiite militias in a desperate attempt to stop Islamic State militants from overrunning Baghdad. Trained and commanded in the field by Iranian Quds Force officers, these ""Popular Mobilization"" militias have proven themselves to be tenacious, though poorly disciplined, fighters. They played as key role in the recapture of Tikrit but were also implicated in a large number of revenge killings of Sunnis in Tikrit as well as widespread looting.  Abandoned Iraqi Army Equipment Following the Retreat From Mosul Photo courtesy Middle East MonitorAt some point the Iraqi government has to determine how these two armies will work together; indeed whether they even can work together. Given the record of Iraqi Army forces, it is unlikely that the Baghdad government will disband the Popular Mobilization Forces or that they even could if they wanted to. The use of these Shiite militias to fight Islamic State militants in predominantly Sunni Anbar province however further aggravates Sunni-Shia sectarian violence. The Iraqi government has urged the remnants of the Sunni militias created during the Awakening Movement to join in the ""liberation of Anbar"", but it has refused to provide the Sunni militias with modern weapons. One military observer described much of the weaponry of the Sunni militias as ""antiques"" that belong in a military museum. In the meantime, Shiite paramilitary groups like Kata'ib Hezbollah, organizations that were implicated in hundreds of attacks against American personnel in Iraq between 2003 and 2008, are using Humvees and, in at least one instance, A1M2 Abrams tanks that were likely bought and paid for by American tax payers. The campaign to retake Tikrit made it clear that American airpower and, in particular, precision munitions would play a critical role in rolling back Islamic State. The dilemma for the White House is that to improve the effectiveness of the air campaign it will have to loosen significantly the rule of engagement as well as deploy American forward air controllers on the ground. It will also have to significantly step up the pace of air operations.Baring a renaissance in the Iraqi military however, an expanded air campaign would require a broader cooperation with Iranian led Shiite militias. Even if the deeply felt distrust between the American military and these militias could be overcome, the idea of becoming the air arm, much less embedding American forward air controllers, to militia groups that were directly responsible for hundreds of American deaths during the Iraqi war will generate a political firestorm in the United States. However you approach the problems of rolling back Islamic State, there are no easy solutions and all of the tradeoffs are difficult ones. Following the fall of Ramadi, the Iraqi government announced confidently that the city would be recaptured within a matter of weeks. So far, a month has passed with little progress evident. Moreover, what currently appears to be a stalemate is in fact deceptive. The Iraqi government has been able to retake about 10 percent of the territory controlled by IS at the height of its expansion however Islamic State militants have more than compensated for that by expansion of their territory in Syria. Moreover, during this period Islamic State has been able to organize ""franchises"" in some two dozen countries around the world. Even if its territorial expansion in Syria and Iraq is contained, no mean feat in its own right, its ability to expand, metastasize would be a more appropriate description, around the world will cause bigger, longer term problems for the United States and its allies. The fact is, Kobani and Tikrit notwithstanding, on a worldwide basis, the United States is losing the war against Islamic State. The only thing worse than losing a war is losing it without even realizing it."

24,HEALTHY LIVING,The Last Father's Day Gift I Gave My Dad -- An Excerpt From the Forthcoming book: Let Me Out (A Practical Guide for Bringing Your Ideas to Life),"Peter Himmelman, ContributorGrammy and Emmy nominated singer-songwriter, author and CEO/Dr...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-fathers-fathers-day-gi_b_7602838.html,,2015-06-21,2015-06-19-1434732975-3462818-youngPeterbabypeterwDad.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-19-1434732975-3462818-youngPeterbabypeterwDad-thumb.jpg,"Love can make you a more creative person. Understand that when I use the term creative, I don't mean that you'll suddenly have mastery of any particular skill. I mean that the more you love, the less attention you will pay to your inner-critic and the freer your thinking will become. Getting space from this inner-critic is what allows a person to be fearlessly responsive to what's taking place around them. This ability to sense and respond is one of the underpinnings of creativity itself, and it is for example, a quality a high-level jazz pianist must have to be able to improvise. Research shows that one of the most effective methods of dampening the voice of the inner-critic is to develop a more profound relationship with the people you love. Professor and author Barbara L. Fredrickson is the director of the Positive Emotions and Psychophysiology Laboratory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Professor Fredrickson is known for her pioneering research on the long-lasting emotional benefits of human interconnection. She writes about an interesting behavioral quirk called ""hedonic adaptation."" Simply put, this means that people who win the lottery, for example, find that after a short while, they're no happier than they were before they struck it rich. That's because they've adapted to the change. According to Professor Fredrickson, our relationships with the people we love (unlike our relationship with fame or material gain) are not subject to hedonic adaptation. From the point of view of neuroscience, the positive emotions that accrue from our healthy, meaningful relationships can last a lifetime. Our brains don't simply adapt to the deep bonds we have with people as they do with a new car or first class plane tickets. Our interactions with loved ones continue to be profound; they uplift us even with the passage of time. When our relationships are strong, we become better able to set aside our self-critical thoughts and make our creative ideas take shape. Here is a story about something I told my dad that changed my entire life: In 1978, I graduated high school, and the romantic ""poetry"" from Prince's song ""Soft and Wet"" off his debut album piqued my imagination. How overt, I wondered, could you possibly get with song lyrics? Inspired by Prince, I wrote several songs, thinking, ""It's so damn simple. I can write like this and get famous too!"" Here are the choruses to some of the songs I wrote:FiremanI'm your fireman show me where you're burning I'm your fireman ooh baby I'm coming I'm your fireman show me where you're burning And I'll be there to hose you down  Torture MeTorture me all night long Love me tough love me strong I'll be your victim till the break of dawn Got to move a little fasterBaby Let Me Be Your CigaretteBaby let me be your cigarette C'mon and puffa puffa puffa till my tip gets wet Light me up and baby don't fret Cause girl I want to be your cigarette...While I was writing these ""works of genius"" -- and supposedly having the time of my life, I was in deep emotional pain. My dad discovered a lump in the back of his neck in the autumn of 1979. It took the doctors a week to determine that he had stage-four lymphoma. They figured he had six months, tops. At the time I'd been an avid practitioner of Transcendental Meditation and one of its stated goals was that it could help to flatten the emotional highs and lows that we normally experience. Because I barely reacted when I'd heard the news, I decided then and there that something that could make me this flat to what should have been devastating couldn't be good and I vowed to quit TM that very night. I understood later that it wasn't the TM that had flattened me, but my own propensity to go inside myself, to stay as far away from my feelings as possible. It was as if I'd been playing a sort of double role for myself. In some instances I was hypersensitive and very connected to the grief I was experiencing. In others, I was completely divorced from my emotions. Years later, toward the end of my dad's life, everything came crashing as the two halves collided.Amery, Wisconsin -- 1983Our band was finishing its last set at a bar called The Country Dam. It was late and the crowd was so drunk they were falling over one another, screaming for one more chorus of ""Fireman"". At four in the morning I pulled up to my parent's house behind my dad's white '83 Chrysler Le Baron, he'd gone all the way to Mankato with my mother to buy this thing. Tired as I was, I couldn't stop looking at that car, wondering how I'd feel about it when he died. It was Father's Day after all, and my Mom had planned a big brunch for him in just a few hours. Cousins, aunts and uncles; everybody wanted to be there to cheer him up. My Mom had asked me to write something funny, some kind of cute ditty to lighten the mood. Even though my dad had outlived the doctor's dire predictions by four years, we knew that the cancer had progressed to the point where this was very likely his last Father's Day. I was pretty wound up from the performance the night before and since the sun was coming up anyway, I couldn't see any reason to try and sleep. I picked up a guitar. It was an old nylon string that hardly played in tune. I started picking through some chords in a half-trance and began singing softly to myself, just thinking about that Le Baron and how my dad really liked that car. The words came fast and the melody started to take on a shape. Each new line generated more melody and the melody inspired more words. ""When no one is forgotten and nothing goes to waste, when sadness turns to laughter, when anger is defaced ... you'll start to know the way I feel about you.""I knew from experience that when a song comes to you like that, it's best to get out of your own way -- to be as detached as possible, and yet I couldn't help feeling excited that this was a song for my dad. I thought, ""At least now I won't be the only fool at the brunch without a Father's Day present.""""And if I could, I'd run out into the world and tell every boy and girl, to love before love takes itself away ... just like I'm loving you this Father's Day.""I made a quick recording of the song and I was so tired and so emotional that I started crying in the last chorus. I didn't want to let everyone hear me blubbering on tape so I reached over to erase it and sing it again, but at the last second I decided to leave it as was, tears and all.  The next morning I brought the cassette upstairs. The brunch was in full swing: the lox and the smoked whitefish had been taken out of the refrigerator and arranged on platters. The scrambled eggs and onions were warming on the stove. The cinnamon rolls and the cartons of Minutemaid were on the table and the brunch-goers were trying their best to slap on their happiest faces. I put the cassette in the stereo and I swear, it took no more than ten seconds for everyone to break down in tears and exit the room.  Now it was just my dad and me, both of us staring out the big picture window of our den, listening as the song played. As it ended, we held each other and cried. Whatever façade of normalcy we'd been putting up over the last several months washed away in the emotion of that song. I'd wanted to say so many things to him, and for so long. Somehow the song expressed everything so well. From that morning on, my dad carried the cassette around with him in his breast pocket. He died a few months later on Thanksgiving night. We got a call from the hospital as we were sitting at the table; the turkey had never even been carved. As tragic and sad as his death was, I've never felt remiss for not expressing how I felt. Putting my emotions on display was hard. Nonetheless, I felt close enough to my dad to keep the recording intact and then later, to play it for everyone at the brunch. As Professor Fredrickson explains, in contrast to our material possessions, the joy we derive from our most loving relationships does not diminish over time. In terms of creativity, this suggests to me that those deep relationships can gird us to withstand our innate fear of failure. Knowing that we have a rock-solid support system allows us the strength to ignore the negative assessments we have of ourselves and to reclaim a fearless, childlike relationship to the world. That support was the priceless gift my dad gave to me."

In the United States, it's hard for us to imagine something as shocking as children marrying at an age when they should be attending second grade, but it happens in many countries.In some cultures, child marriage is an accepted (although usually illegal) social norm, which dictates that children are married off to other families in exchange for a dowry that includes furniture or livestock. Globally, more than 15 million girls are married before the age of 18, some as young as 7 or 8 years old. Pregnancy and childbirth are are among the leading causes of death for girls ages 15-19 in low-income countries, and girls who are married early have few prospects for education, economic empowerment or viable employment. Organizations and campaigns such as The Elders, Save the Children, World Vision and Girls Not Brides are working to prioritize girls' education and reduce instances of child brides.Yet, in a landscape filled with NGOs dedicated to helping young women, the spotlight has rarely been shone upon child grooms - boys forced into marriage at an early age. In her Daily Beast article, ""The Sad Hidden Plight of Child Grooms,"" journalist Nina Strochlic urged research and reporting about these boys last year. This week, the poverty-fighting organization, CARE, has released a report detailing the child marriage problem in Nepal, where the devastating recent earthquakes threatened to move the statistics in the wrong direction. Titled ""Dads Too Soon: The Child Grooms of Nepal,"" the multimedia report details the forces pushing boys into early marriages in the farming villages of western Nepal, where the rates of child marriage are some of the highest in the world: 41 percent for girls and 11 percent for boys.In the report, the stories of several former child grooms -- now in their 20s and 30s -- reflect upon the emotional, physical and economic toll the practice has taken on their lives. While Pannibal Yadav and Mathura Dhobi were dropping out of school to perform odd jobs and help support both their parents and their own children, some of their acquaintances were finishing school, attending university and earning a wage. Today, they are husbands and fathers who want their own children to have the opportunity to complete an education and marry as adults to whomever they choose.""Nepalese law prohibits marriage before age 18, but the practice remains common in the poor, predominantly Hindu communities along the border with northern India,"" reported the Los Angeles Times in January.After the April 25 earthquake of 7.8 magnitude, up to one million children across the country have dealt with hunger and an inability to attend school due to lack of facilities, making them more vulnerable to the practice of child marriage.The marriages are primarily the result of peer pressure among parents of children deemed of marrying age in Nepalese culture, says CARE's Kumari Shah.""We hear over and over again from parents that people in the community start whispering and wondering what's wrong with a child if he or she isn't married early,"" Shah says. ""The pressure is hardest to take for poor families who can least afford to take risks. Wait too long, they fear, and their child will be stigmatized and unable to marry."" The good news is that community programs such as CARE's Tipping Point are engaging child grooms as key allies in the movement to strike at the roots of child marriage in Nepal.Hug your father today, and click here to hear the stories about the dads who were married too young and what they are doing to create positive change in their communities.Photo: Carey Wagner/CARE"

You're busy! Who has time to breathe, let alone sit and breathe? But if you think the only way you'll learn how to meditate is with a 25-hour day, think again.Plenty of busy people are making time for meditation. Media guru Arianna Huffington makes it a part of her morning routine. Rapper 50 Cent uses meditation to help him remain positive when faced with negative personalities. And Jerry Seinfeld won't let anything get between him and his meditation time -- he allegedly takes time between TV shoots to get zen.Cultivating Calm, On Your Time""I have a really chaotic schedule so I do it whenever I can,"" says Dan Harris, a correspondent for ABC News and the author of the New York Times bestseller 10% Happier. ""I don't freak out if I can't fit it in but I do think it's important to do something every day."" Harris has been meditating ever since he experienced a panic attack on air nearly a decade ago.He credits meditation with helping him control knee-jerk reactions to frustrating situations. Thanks to improved patience, Harris says he's a better listener and is able to hold shorter, more fruitful meetings. Meditation, he says, is ""fighting a lifetime pattern of letting your thoughts lead you by the nose.""Dina Kaplan, founder of The Path, a weekly meditation seminar in New York City, says meditation allows her to have more ""mental agility"" during her day. She's much more calm when faced with stress, and feels as though she makes better decisions. And science confirms these benefits: Your brain will actually change if you stick with meditation, just as your body changes when you exercise regularly. You'll be rewarded with improved memory and other cognitive benefits.""Don't put the pressure on yourself that you have to do it forever,"" Harris says. It's okay if you fall off the wagon for a few weeks, so long as you muster the grit to return to your practice. The power of meditation, he says, is derived from practicing daily. Watch the video below for a short meditation exercise from Happify, featuring Harris and Sharon Salzberg, a meditation teacher and author.So what's the secret to actually making time for meditation? We asked Harris, Kaplan and David Ngo, a behavioral designer at Stanford University and behavior consultant for The Path, for their best tips on how to actually create a meditation habit.7 Ways to Start Meditating Today1. Type it into your phone cal. Instead of simply hoping you'll be able to squeeze in meditation on the fly, try setting aside a specific time for it. ""If I carve out time to [meditate], that's the space for my practice to go,"" says Ngo. When you create that space, the habit can grow. But rather than thinking of meditation as another item on your to-do list, think of it as a gift to yourself, says Kaplan. 2. Do it in the morning. ""If you're starting out and you're struggling with developing the habit, I do think you should do it first thing [in the morning]"" says Kaplan. She meditates right after she brushes her teeth. By doing it right away, she has no excuse. Especially for parents with young kids, doing it before the day gets underway is your best bet for fitting in some ""me time,"" she says. Kaplan recommends not setting your goals too high in the beginning. ""If you can do five minutes, that's better than nothing.""3. Start with one breath. Don't underestimate the power of small behaviors. By focusing on taking one conscious breath when you have a spare moment, you can pave the way for creating a meditation habit. Ngo says this philosophy comes from BJ Fogg, Ph.D., behavioral scientist and founder of Stanford's Persuasive Technology Lab, who pioneered the idea of creating tiny habits. For example, to create a habit of tidying up at home, you might start by making your bed each morning. A tiny habit should be a behavior that requires little effort and can be performed in less than 30 seconds. ""That seed of the habit can then grow into a full-blow tree,"" says Ngo.4. Perform meditation after an existing habit. After you get into your car for your daily commute, try meditating for a few breaths instead of racing to turn on the ignition. Or quiet your mind after you go to the bathroom at work. ""The pattern is always after,"" says Ngo. ""This is called anchoring."" Ngo recommends choosing a daily occurrence or existing activity to remind yourself to meditate.5. Use headphones. As a TV correspondent, Harris has a packed schedule that involves a fair amount of travel. ""People think you have to sit in some position, but that isn't true,"" he says. ""There are four ways to do it: walking, standing, sitting or lying down."" No matter how busy life gets, Harris tries to fit in 30 minutes of meditation each day. His secret weapon? Headphones. He puts on a pair to cancel noise when he meditates in airports and on planes. ""As long as you're somewhere that's reasonably quiet, you're good,"" says Harris. (And if you're lying down and you fall asleep, that's okay, he says.)6. Siphon time from superfluous activities. Think about it: Do you really need to hit ""reply all"" to every email that hits your inbox? ""I would have considered myself busy at my last job, but it was just an excuse to procrastinate from what was really important,"" says Kaplan. As a successful start-up founder and Emmy award-winning producer, Kaplan says she was writing redundant emails and taking meetings that were unnecessary. ""If you're answering emails you don't really need to respond to, that would give you 15 minutes,"" she says. With that extra time, she suggests finding a quiet park bench to relax, or even sneaking into a hotel lobby for a few minutes.7. Practice mindfulness when you've got time to kill. Resist the urge to scroll through Instagram the moment your friend or dinner date heads to the bathroom. ""I think it's very healthy to have all sorts of moments in the day where you're just being,"" says Kaplan. It's tempting to use our phones as entertainment during those ""black spaces"" during the day, but Kaplan recommends pausing and just letting the moment happen instead of gluing yourself to your Facebook feed. Look around, smile at other people and enjoy some momentary calm. While it's not the same as doing a seated meditation, being fully present during these small moments can help you feel more comfortable confronting the thoughts rattling around in your mind.More from Life by DailyBurn:  4 Science-Backed Ways to Motivate Yourself to Work Out 9 Simple Tricks to Eat More Mindfully -- Starting Now 6 Signs That You're Exhausted (Not Just Tired)"

And while many of the high-flying postures appear complex and intimidating, a good deal of AcroYoga is quite accessible with some basic guidance and practice. Still not convinced? Here are a few more reasons to give AcroYoga a try:1. Builds Trust & Focus AcroYoga poses include a 'base', the partner who is actively supporting, and a 'flyer', the partner who is elevated and balancing on the base's legs or arms. In order to create a safe balance in each pose, both partners need to verbalize their actions and have complete reliance on one another. Working together this way fosters focus, communication, and a deep sense of trust.2. Improves Strength, Balance, & Flexibility The role of the base is to provide a stable foundation for the flyer. This means keeping the limbs steady and supportive, an act that strengthens the limbs and core. The flyer, on the other hand, moves progressively through a variety of poses and stretches while being elevated, an accomplishment that encourages balance and flexibility. Because it's common to interchange positions in AcroYoga, each partner has the chance to build strength, improve balance, and increase flexibility.3. Creates Confidence & Courage  The practice doesn't just benefit the body. Whether you're flying or basing, chances are you're pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. Intimacy, responsibility, and confidence all play a role in AcroYoga. Learning to overcome limitations and fears with your partner teaches you to do the same with yourself.To see more from Riva, check out her website  or give her a follow on Instagram* Photos above taken by John F.

Which, if true, would mean that he would never go outside again. He would never again enjoy the pleasurable scents in the many places he likes to stick his nose all over the great out-of-doors.

She feels confident that if ""you eat what you kill"" became her reality, she would survive. Just maybe not indoors.""Off!"" is another thing I say on a daily basis to both the cat and the dog and each interprets it in a slightly different way. The dog thinks I'm saying ""It is my wish that you rethink your desire to recline on the sofa."" He rethinks his desire to recline on the sofa and rejects the suggestion in a heartbeat so he doesn't move. The cat thinks I'm saying ""My underwear drawer is a fine place for you to sleep and so is my keyboard and please let me know if there is anything else I can do to make you more comfortable."" I can't win.""No!"" is another of my favorite expressions but I am sure that the cat and the dog interpret that simple word differently. If I say ""No"" to my dog, he knows I am not going to give him a treat at the moment. He can always hope for the future. If I say ""No"" to my cat, she thinks I am trying really hard to get her attention and her approval and she pities me.Sometimes when I leave I say to my dog, ""Be nice to Kitty."" Nigel would laugh if he was able when I say that because what he hears is this: ""Chase the cat all you want because I won't be here to scold you. Have fun!"" When the cat hears me say that, she doesn't care. She's not overly fond of either me or the dog but she knows she can go to places the dog can't so she is safe.""Who did this?"" almost always ends up being a rhetorical question as neither the cat nor the dog can answer the question. All they hear anyway is ""Blah blah blah?""

Only one of them thinks that could really be a problem.""Mummy's home!"" is what I usually announce when I finally return. When the cat hears that she assumes reason has just been restored to her life because she is the Queen and I am the Prime Minister. But when the dog hears that Mummy's home, he knows that the lovely lady who dispenses the food is back where she needs to be to feed him.

He died of heart failure four days before St. Patrick's Day, a couple of months shy of his 79th birthday, and after a year of hospice care. He took his last breath quite peacefully while I sat by his bedside with my mother and Seamus, my parents' big, fluffy, orange and white cat. I was stunned by how clear it was that my father's spirit had left his body. Only his earthly container remained. A shell of him lay still and quiet and cool on the bed ... but he was gone. And so was a family history I'd neglected to plumb.   Some people seem to be supernaturally connected to loved ones who've gone on to the great beyond. Not so for me. Oh, I can imagine what my father might say or think about something, what movies he'd like to see, or what books he'd be reading if he were still here. And I've wondered how much he might know about our earthly lives here without him. There are things I hope he doesn't know and others I wish he did. I wish he could have seen my daughter play point guard on her AAU basketball team and hear her play the guitar and sing songs she's written herself. I wish he -- a Fordham man -- had seen my son graduate from another fine Jesuit institution ... and I wish he'd seen that same grandson get married last year. I wish he'd lived to see the election of an African-American president... But had he lived even six more months, he'd have been heartbroken by 9/11, not only because he was a pacifist, but because he was a native New Yorker, born and bred on the island of Manhattan. I'm glad he didn't see the towers fall and I wonder if it's true what the book of Revelation says about heaven ... Will God wipe every tear from their eyes? Will there really be no more death or mourning or crying or pain...? I rationalize that if heaven is all it's cracked up to be, with everyone eternally happy, then my father has not been aware of things that might cause him grief -- not terrorist attacks, his daughter's missteps, a grandchild's illness, or my mother's debilitation from dementia. What I wonder about more than any of this, though, is why I didn't query my father about his younger self when I had the opportunity. I was a reporter, trained to ask questions ... yet I didn't. It's possible that that my father constructed unspoken and invisible barriers around his own family-of-origin issues, and that on some deep, mystic level I was discouraged from going there. But it's also true that I was wrapped up in childrearing and marriage and work and church committees and friends. I hadn't yet developed an interest in the past beyond my own girlhood experiences. But now, I crave knowledge of earlier generations, and the dribs and drabs I've unearthed through census returns, ships' manifests and other public records are like crack. I get a hit; I want more.There are revelations...My grandfather eloped, leaving Northern Ireland for New York City in 1905. He'd lost his first wife and three children -- two infants and a 14-year-old son -- by the time my dad came along, his fourth and youngest child with wife number two. And there are dead ends...I've yet to find evidence of my grandfather beyond 1942 when he filed a WWII draft registration card. He was 55-years-old and working for the Otis Elevator Co. I don't know how he died or when ... And there's nobody left to ask. My dad told a lot of stories, but precious few about his childhood. I know he once stole a Charlotte Russe from the neighborhood bakery, running home lightning fast to avoid being caught ... that on wash days his mother made rice pudding ... and that he once hid under the kitchen table to avoid a whipping from his father -- my only memory of my dad ever mentioning his own. So, Dad, I have a few questions...How bad was it? Was your father an angry drunk? Is that why you never spoke of him? Was he bitter with grief from losing a wife and three children? How often was he out of work? What did he tell you of his own father? Or of his childhood in County Tyrone? How did he treat your mother? How did they meet? How and when did your father die and where is he buried? Did you have a favorite childhood meal? Or were you simply lucky for anything on the days there was enough to eat? Why did you enter the monastery at a time when others were joining the service? Did your mother pressure you into it? And how did she feel when you left religious life after 16 years? Why did you and Mom move so far away from your families? There are years worth of questions. You might want to start asking them, even if you think you're not interested, because one day, it's likely you will find yourself trying to fill in the blanks to gain a greater understanding of those who came before. And if you wait too long like I did, it'll be too late. So, if your parents -- or grandparents, aunt and uncles -- are still alive and compos mentis, and you haven't already done so, consider asking the questions. The secrets, stories and experiences carried from one generation to the next give us historical and personal context that goes far beyond why we have blue eyes or red hair or the Kelleher nose.And while we're at it, we might begin to ponder the stories we want to tell to our children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews. Because ancestry.com is great ... but it's no substitute for a tale told with your uncle's impish grin, your grandmother's brogue, or a tear in your father's eye.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

In all that time, we have never seen this kind of artistic interpretation and this special model of automobile being incorporated together as a canvas for fine art. This inspiration and implementation happened because of Sir Alfred J. DiMora. Sir Alfred DiMora showed a special enthusiasm for cars at ten years old when he began to race miniature slot cars, which led to a genuine passion for the automobile. By the time he was thirteen, he dreamed of building his own car, and, like most genuine passions, simply would not let go until the goal was realized.

DiMora/DiMora Motorcar.DiMora admits being 'pushed over the edge' after seeing the film ""American Graffiti,"" which he has viewed over a dozen times and was instrumental in motivating him to design and build his own custom, high-performance automobiles. Who would have known that decades later he would have the pleasure of meeting Bo Hopkins (""Joe,"" the leader of the ""Pharaohs"" greaser gang in the movie), and they remain good friends to this day. In a recent interview that I did with Bo, he said, ""In those days, the cars, often modified, lowered, customized and beefed up, had a distinct style and integrity that simply does not exist with today's cars, until now."" Sir Alfred J. DiMora, his wife, Yvonne DiMora, George Barris (designer/builder of famous Hollywood custom cars), and actor Bo Hopkins (""American Graffiti""). Photograph courtesy of Sir Alfred J. DiMora/DiMora Motorcar.DiMora began rebuilding engines and transmissions; he studied books on 1930s Roadster designs; and attended welding and machinist programs. He was ready to go after his dream, and at eighteen, drove from New York to California with a drawing, a vision, and $400 in his pocket. His target was prestigious Santa Barbara, where he slept on the beach those first few weeks. He found his first job there as a machinist and worked part-time at a gas station. He soon was building luxury cars at Clénet Coachworks, Inc., where he was one of the first employees. Not long afterwards, Alfred co-founded the Sceptre Motorcar Company with a small group of people who shared the same ambition of building the Sceptre 6.6S. His first prototype won ""Best of Show"" in the 1978 Los Angeles Auto Show.By that time, DiMora was able to buy out the Clénet Coachworks and set up his own factory in Carpinteria, California. He revived manufacturing the Clénet Series II Cabriolet and the Series III Asha, and created the Series IV Sportster. Clénets were hand-built and sold to celebrities, royalty and other motor-enthusiasts around the world. Some of these included Sylvester Stallone, Rod Stewart, Julio Iglesias, Farrah Fawcett and King Hussein of Jordan, just to name a few. Ken Gross, Jay Leno and Sir Alfred DiMora look over renderings of the Natalia SLS 2 at Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. Photograph courtesy of Sir Alfred J. DiMora/DiMora Motorcar.The Clénet was featured in movies and television shows such as ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty."" President Ronald Reagan declared 1986 the Centennial Year of the Gasoline-Powered Automobile, and DiMora's Clénet was selected as the Official Centennial Car. The Clénet was called ""Drive Art"" by Automotive Age and the ""American Rolls Royce"" by Fortune magazine; DiMora and the Clénet also were honored at the Automotive Hall of Fame that same year.DiMora recently began to see an uptrend developing in both the art and automobile investment genres, so he envisioned merging the two to see if they could be combined successfully, developing a paradigm to build on the strength of both the art and automobile worlds. Just as Dale Chihuly's unique, hand-blown glass art helped change the typical paint and canvas art platform, so will this innovative blending of art with the automobile, in DiMora's professional opinion. After a great deal of research, DiMora discovered the work of Taiwanese artist and Zen Master Lee Sun-Don at the Beverly Hills X-Power Gallery. ""Master Lee has been described as the ""modern Asian Picasso."" When visiting Beijing in 1989, Master Lee Sun-Don found discarded, centuries-old doorknockers, which represented Chinese traditional craftsmanship. This saddened him, so he began collecting and preserving on canvas these rare antiquities, calling them the Great Treasure Gate series.  Master Lee Sun-Don in his studio in Taipei, Taiwan, working on a painting from the Great Treasure Gate series with a centuries-old lion's head doorknocker that represents Chinese traditional craftsmanship as a focal point. Photograph courtesy of GP Deva. ""The Chinese antique doorknocker has been a symbol of the rich and powerful since ancient times, especially the dragon (which represents royalty), and the lion (which serves as its guardian), hence 'the royal guards,'"" he said. ""I decided to utilize a great number of lion's-head doorknockers in my collection and they have now come to good use in this series."" Sun-Don is world-renowned and was invited to participate in the 53rd Venice Biennale, as well as impressive venues at the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and numerous other gallery exhibitions. When DiMora viewed the explosive, vibrant colors and the uniqueness of the doorknocker paintings, he easily pictured Master Lee's Totemic Energy Art on the Vicci 6.2 hood and side panels, and the rest is history. DiMora didn't know what to expect, but the success of their first joint collaboration showing at Art Revolution Taipei in 2014 was astounding, with Master Lee's art displayed on canvas and on the Vicci. Immediately, orders for their new rolling art series began selling quickly. The purchaser receives both the original canvas for their wall and the Vicci rolling art for their garage. Crowd viewing Master Lee Sun-Don, Sir Alfred DiMora, and the Vicci 6.2 at Art Revolution Taipei 2014.

What is more, this classic supercar, with its connotations of victor and conqueror, accords perfectly with the spirit of kingship and supremacy of my painting series, 'The Great Treasure Gate.'""

We will work together to produce a total of 25 limited edition Vicci 6.2 Emperor art automobiles, each with its unique Lee Sun-Don canvas masterpiece in the 'Great Treasure Gate' series.""  Finished collaborative art and automobile projects: Sir Alfred J. DiMora's Vicci 6.2 with Master Lee Sun-Don's painting on its hood. Photograph courtesy of Sir Alfred J. DiMora/DiMora Motorcar.DiMora now is being approached by other world-renowned artists wishing to do a joint collaboration.

In all that time, we have never seen this kind of artistic interpretation and this special model of automobile being incorporated together as a canvas for fine art. This inspiration and implementation happened because of Sir Alfred J. DiMora. Sir Alfred DiMora showed a special enthusiasm for cars at ten years old when he began to race miniature slot cars, which led to a genuine passion for the automobile. By the time he was thirteen, he dreamed of building his own car, and, like most genuine passions, simply would not let go until the goal was realized.

Who would have known that decades later he would have the pleasure of meeting Bo Hopkins (""Joe,"" the leader of the ""Pharaohs"" greaser gang in the movie), and they remain good friends to this day. In a recent interview that I did with Bo, he said, ""In those days, the cars, often modified, lowered, customized and beefed up, had a distinct style and integrity that simply does not exist with today's cars, until now.""

DiMora/DiMora Motorcar.DiMora began rebuilding engines and transmissions; he studied books on 1930s Roadster designs; and attended welding and machinist programs. He was ready to go after his dream, and at eighteen, drove from New York to California with a drawing, a vision, and $400 in his pocket. His target was prestigious Santa Barbara, where he slept on the beach those first few weeks. He found his first job there as a machinist and worked part-time at a gas station. He soon was building luxury cars at Clénet Coachworks, Inc., where he was one of the first employees. Not long afterwards, Alfred co-founded the Sceptre Motorcar Company with a small group of people who shared the same ambition of building the Sceptre 6.6S. His first prototype won ""Best of Show"" in the 1978 Los Angeles Auto Show.By that time, DiMora was able to buy out the Clénet Coachworks and set up his own factory in Carpinteria, California. He revived manufacturing the Clénet Series II Cabriolet and the Series III Asha, and created the Series IV Sportster. Clénets were hand-built and sold to celebrities, royalty and other motor-enthusiasts around the world. Some of these included Sylvester Stallone, Rod Stewart, Julio Iglesias, Farrah Fawcett and King Hussein of Jordan, just to name a few. Ken Gross, Jay Leno and Sir Alfred DiMora look over renderings of the Natalia SLS 2 at Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. Photograph courtesy of Sir Alfred J. DiMora/DiMora Motorcar.The Clénet was featured in movies and television shows such as ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty."" President Ronald Reagan declared 1986 the Centennial Year of the Gasoline-Powered Automobile, and DiMora's Clénet was selected as the Official Centennial Car. The Clénet was called ""Drive Art"" by Automotive Age and the ""American Rolls Royce"" by Fortune magazine; DiMora and the Clénet also were honored at the Automotive Hall of Fame that same year.DiMora recently began to see an uptrend developing in both the art and automobile investment genres, so he envisioned merging the two to see if they could be combined successfully, developing a paradigm to build on the strength of both the art and automobile worlds. Just as Dale Chihuly's unique, hand-blown glass art helped change the typical paint and canvas art platform, so will this innovative blending of art with the automobile, in DiMora's professional opinion. After a great deal of research, DiMora discovered the work of Taiwanese artist and Zen Master Lee Sun-Don at the Beverly Hills X-Power Gallery. ""Master Lee has been described as the ""modern Asian Picasso."" When visiting Beijing in 1989, Master Lee Sun-Don found discarded, centuries-old doorknockers, which represented Chinese traditional craftsmanship. This saddened him, so he began collecting and preserving on canvas these rare antiquities, calling them the Great Treasure Gate series.

""The Chinese antique doorknocker has been a symbol of the rich and powerful since ancient times, especially the dragon (which represents royalty), and the lion (which serves as its guardian), hence 'the royal guards,'"" he said. ""I decided to utilize a great number of lion's-head doorknockers in my collection and they have now come to good use in this series."" Sun-Don is world-renowned and was invited to participate in the 53rd Venice Biennale, as well as impressive venues at the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and numerous other gallery exhibitions. When DiMora viewed the explosive, vibrant colors and the uniqueness of the doorknocker paintings, he easily pictured Master Lee's Totemic Energy Art on the Vicci 6.2 hood and side panels, and the rest is history. DiMora didn't know what to expect, but the success of their first joint collaboration showing at Art Revolution Taipei in 2014 was astounding, with Master Lee's art displayed on canvas and on the Vicci. Immediately, orders for their new rolling art series began selling quickly. The purchaser receives both the original canvas for their wall and the Vicci rolling art for their garage.

What is more, this classic supercar, with its connotations of victor and conqueror, accords perfectly with the spirit of kingship and supremacy of my painting series, 'The Great Treasure Gate.'""

We will work together to produce a total of 25 limited edition Vicci 6.2 Emperor art automobiles, each with its unique Lee Sun-Don canvas masterpiece in the 'Great Treasure Gate' series.""

(Photo by Graeme Parkes/Newspix/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4c1583c000066000cb3e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When you think of Steve Irwin, it's easy to remember his wild antics: picking up poisonous snakes, jumping in the water with crocodiles and often throwing in his signature catchphrase.Crikey! Those were the good ol' days.But, while antics are great, the heart of ""The Crocodile Hunter"" has always been a message about conservation and a contagious love for animals. Now, nearly 10 years after the world lost Steve Irwin in a tragic wildlife accident in 2006, his daughter Bindi Irwin and her family are working everyday to keep that spirit alive.""Well, for us as a family, it’s a team effort. I think we have tried so hard to make sure everything he lived and died for carries on. My dad always used to say, 'I don’t care if anyone remembers me. I just want people to remember my message,' so we’ve tried to make sure that his heart and soul continue to live on through our work,"" Irwin told The Huffington Post. ""We hope to make sure that he’s proud and carry on his legacy."" In the years following the tragedy, Irwin has done way more than just keep her dad's legacy alive. She has helped his influence grow bigger than any utterance of ""crikey"" could ever describe. Irwin says the family's conservation organization, Wildlife Warriors, has now helped rescue and rehabilitate more then 58,000 animals at its Australia Zoo hospital alone. Irwin also uses her career in entertainment as a way to spread the word.""For me and my family,"" she said, ""I think our heart really lies in conservation, and I personally want to make sure that everything my dad worked so hard for continues on forever. Through television work and movie work, I'm able to use that platform to spread my message of wildlife and conservation to a greater audience.""One project in particular, ""Bindi's Bootcamp,"" recently became available on Netflix. On the show, kids compete in challenges and learn about new animals in the hopes of becoming a Wildlife Warrior at the end. Irwin says the show ""has so much excitement"" and hopes it inspires others ""to take the steps in their own world and accidentally learn something along the way.""In addition to a message of conservation, the young Crocodile Huntress also communicates positivity through social media, recently posting an Instagram about the importance of loving yourself that went viral. She says she was ""amazed"" that so many people started getting involved. ""The meaning of life is unconditional love, and so if you're able to surround yourself with that core of friends and family, you’ll be able to do great things,"" she said. As for what's next, Irwin says she's excited to ""see where life takes"" her, but, contrary to reports, you probably shouldn't expect her to be ""stepping away from khaki"" too soon. She ""loves being a girl and dressing up every now and again,"" she said, but if she had a catchphrase like her dad, it would be: ""Khaki: It’s not just a color. It’s an attitude.""Dad would probably be pretty proud about that answer, too."

It takes some heavy lifting to get that strong and chiseled physique. In fact, even if you want to be a better runner, you still need to incorporate strength training into your routine. But when you're strapped for time, and need to squeeze cardio and weights into a single sweat session, which should you tackle first? Strength training, according to the recent research and fitness pros. Here's why.Why Weights Shouldn't WaitIn a recent study published in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, researchers pinned three workout tactics against each other: strength training alone, running then strength, and cycling followed by strength. They found that exercisers did fewer weight lifting reps if they had just ran or cycled. Yet, doing strength training with no cardio beforehand resulted in more reps.""In my experience, I've found that most exercisers feel 'stronger' when they engage in resistance training first,"" says Robert Confessore, Ph.D., clinical exercise physiologist at Summit Medical Fitness Center in Kalispell, MT. Many scientific studies also demonstrate that aerobic training can negatively affect strength development when performed prior to lifting (whereas research is lacking on the reverse effect), he says. This is due to physiological changes in the muscles that help you move. When you use those fibers to fatigue before you do resistance exercises, your form and drive will likely suffer.And that can have a noticeable impact. According to Lacey Stone, an LA-based celebrity trainer, if you want the muscle-building benefits of strength training, it's best to start with those exercises. ""It's vital that you lift before your cardio workouts, because you will have the most power and the most strength to lift heavier loads, which in turn will make you stronger,"" she says.When Cardio Matters MostIn terms of fighting off fat, both resistance exercises and anaerobic workouts are crucial. ""When you gain muscle, it raises your metabolic rate, which helps you burn fat faster,"" Stone explains. And according to research, doing both strength and cardio decreases body fat significantly more than each method alone. So you can probably stick to the same formula mentioned above, but keep in mind this caveat: That same study showed that while fat mass and waist circumference decrease when you do a combo of the two techniques or just aerobic activity, lifting alone doesn't make you drop pounds.So if you want to slim down, you need to kick up your cardio -- even if that means skipping some weights when you're short on time. ""Just remember this: Strength training changes your shape and cardio changes your size,"" says Stone.If it's better cardio capacity you're after, Stone says there are mixed reviews on what to tackle first. It's still smart to strength train even if you want to be a better runner or biker. In fact, one study found that resistance exercises improved endurance athletes' performance, muscle power and economy. You may just need longer and more frequent cardio moves (some of those being stand-alone aerobic sessions), with cross-training days sprinkled throughout.Finding Your Formula for SuccessOf course every individual has different ideas for what they want to get out of their gym time, so tailor yours to your goals. ""To the recreational exerciser, I recommend experimenting with the order of the two types of training within the same workout, then gauge which works best for you,"" says Confessore. If you're still unsure of what to do, Confessore suggests scheduling these two types of workouts on different days -- that way, you don't have to worry about one affecting the other.The bottom line... Do what works for your body, but if you need a place to start: Tackle strength, then cardio.More from Life by DailyBurn:  The 7 Best Strength Exercises You're Not Doing Egg Whites or Whole Eggs: Which Are Healthier?
