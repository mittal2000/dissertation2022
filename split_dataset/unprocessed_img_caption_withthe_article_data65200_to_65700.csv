Chris Christie (R) even called him out during the last GOP debate for delivering the same ""memorized, 25-second response."" Rubio used a canned line three separate times in that debate, saying, ""Obama knows what he's doing"" even after Christie's attack.He then lamented the difficulty in instilling proper values in children in the 21st century twice in a row during a campaign event on Monday.Rubio is expected to finish second in the New Hampshire primary with about 15 percent support, according to HuffPost Pollster, which averages the state's latest opinion polls.He acknowledged Tuesday that he was not in the lead, saying that ""Trump is a clear frontrunner."" Rubio also noted that ""you've got some people who haven't campaigned anywhere else but here.""""It's a pretty unusual setup,"" he said. ""But we feel really good. I have more national security experience and foreign policy experience than anyone else than anyone on the Republican side, by far.""Also on HuffPost:"

In a petition filed against NYC (obtained by People), the actress alleges that she never should've been arrested by the New York City Police Department after she was accused of threatening Jeanine Heller -- her reported ex-girlfriend and stalker -- who she obtained a restraining order against. After Manning's arrest, the New York District Attorney's office declined to press charges against the actress, which the NYPD was aware of, but they arrested her anyway.""Ms. Manning should never have been arrested [when] the New York City Police Department received advance notice from the New York County District Attorney's Office that Ms. Manning would not be prosecuted based on an allegation of the subject complainant,"" Manning's attorney James Franzetti said in a statement obtained by The Huffington Post. ""It was also astonishing that the NYPD acted on an allegation of a complainant with a glaring prosecutorial (two prior arrests, charges including stalking and harassing Ms. Manning) and plea history."" Franzetti also added that the petition ""is the first step in a claim for damages arising out of the patently false November 18, 2014 arrest.""""Substantively, the petition concerns the acquired, actual knowledge of the City of New York of the essential, foundational facts which serve as the basis for Ms. Manning’s claims and causes of action for false arrest, civil rights and additional statutory violations,"" the statement continues. Heller, who's at the center of Manning's lawsuit, was arrested multiple times for harassing the star and last summer, was sentenced to six months in jail after violating a conditional discharge by texting Manning multiple times. Meanwhile, Manning was recently accused of attacking friend and makeup artist Holly Hartman. According to a TMZ report, Manning dared Hartman to stab her, though the actress' counsel denied the allegations. Also on HuffPost:"
2,POLITICS,New Hampshire Is Not 'Do-Or-Die' For Most Candidates This Year,Natalie Jackson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-hampshire-primary-sanders-trump_us_56ba41dde4b0c3c5504f1659,"Whatever happens Tuesday night, it's not really going to tell us much about the next nine months.",2016-02-09,The Huffington Post's front page on the afternoon of the 2016 New Hampshire primary shows six GOP candidates in a purported fight for their political lives.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ba42331800006f0080b989.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lots of headlines would have you believe that New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary will be a “do-or-die” moment for the various presidential hopefuls. Even The Huffington Post’s front page has framed Tuesday's contest as some kind of ""Hunger Games""-style death match among the GOP candidates.But once the dust settles in New Hampshire, we probably won’t know much more about either party's nomination contest than we did before. The New Hampshire primary is an imperfect predictor at the best of times, and this year that goes double. With a very crowded Republican field and a near-home-state advantage for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on the Democratic side, the results of Tuesday's primary will tell us what people in the Granite State think, but not much besides that.The state does better than Iowa at picking eventual nominees, but its record is still mixed. In four of the last six open GOP races, dating back to 1980, New Hampshire voters have picked the eventual nominee. In the last six open Democratic races, they’ve picked the eventual nominee half the time. Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire's Democratic primary in 2008, but Barack Obama was the nominee that year. John McCain won the state's primary contest in 2000, but the GOP candidate that year was George W. Bush.Notably, in the 1996 Republican primary -- when there were nearly as many major candidates as this year’s nine contenders -- the New Hampshire electorate did not hand the victory to the eventual nominee, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), but instead chose political operative and commentator Pat Buchanan. The race was extremely close, and Buchanan won with just 27 percent compared to Dole’s 26 percent. We could see a similar situation this year. The GOP primary winner could get less than 30 percent of the vote, and up to five candidates could get more than 10 percent. No one really knows what would happen next in such a scenario, but one possibility is that those five candidates could continue much farther into the primary season than expected. Drop-outs are widely anticipated after the New Hampshire primary, but there will be fewer campaign suspensions if long-shot contenders are able to reach 10 percent. On the Democratic side, although Sanders did have name-recognition problems in New Hampshire early last year, he has something of a quasi-home state advantage given his intimate knowledge of the region and its issues. He’s not necessarily gaining support by being from Vermont, but his brusque outsider manner appeals to New Hampshire’s independent political style. We don’t know yet if he will attract as much attention from the rest of the country -- we’ve been too busy watching Iowa and New Hampshire. Absent any major upsets Tuesday night, Sanders seems set to win New Hampshire's Democratic primary, and Donald Trump will most likely be the GOP victor. A win would obviously be a boost to either man's campaign, but it wouldn’t mean that they've locked down their party's nomination. It wouldn’t even necessarily give them an advantage going forward. For this year, at least, a victory in New Hampshire will just be a victory in New Hampshire -- no less, but almost certainly no more."

That's when they enlisted the help of the utility company and, without obtaining a warrant, set up a camera from a pole located roughly 200 yards away from Leon's trailer.That was good enough to monitor the brothers' activities for 10 weeks straight, including instances of Houston handling guns on the property. About a month after the surveillance ended, the agents moved in on the farm, seized 25 firearms -- 17 of them Houston's -- and charged him under a federal law that prohibits former felons from possessing them.Houston was ultimately convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison for the offense, in large part based on the evidence gathered through the warrantless surveillance of the family property.On appeal, the 6th Circuit ruled the surveillance didn't violate his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches.""The ATF agents only observed what Houston made public to any person traveling on the roads surrounding the farm,"" the court said, reasoning that the ""agents had a right to access the public utility pole and the camera captured only views that were plainly visible to any member of the public who drove down the roads bordering the farm.""But the court also dismissed the notion that the length of surveillance mattered to its constitutional analysis, noting that ""the Fourth Amendment does not punish law enforcement for using technology to more efficiently conduct their investigations.""As George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr observed in a legal blog, the court appears to have employed an interest-balancing theory to reach its conclusion -- that is, the surveillance is justified because it helps avoid giving wrongdoers ""the upper hand.""""The law cannot be that modern technological advances are off-limits to law enforcement when criminals may use them freely,"" the court said.The 6th Circuit ruling from Monday is an outgrowth of a 2012 Supreme Court decision that declared it unconstitutional to install a GPS device on a vehicle without a warrant -- the first major ruling to try to adapt the law on unreasonable searches and seizures to the realities of modern technology.Though she didn't write the court's lead opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whom the 6th Circuit cited, wrote separately to articulate a broad and liberal vision for how the Fourth Amendment should be interpreted in the age of smartphones and the surveillance state.""Awareness that the Government may be watching chills associational and expressive freedoms.

But a closer look at the available data also suggests that this progress may have reached a plateau and that millions of the remaining uninsured are probably going to stay that way.New survey findings published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday underscore just how far the U.S. has come in expanding health coverage. Through the first three quarters of 2015, the uninsured rate was 9.1 percent, meaning that 28.8 million Americans lacked health coverage. That compares to 14.4 percent, or 44.8 million people, in 2013 and to 11.5 percent, or 36 million people, in 2014.In other words, since Obamacare benefits took effect at the beginning of 2014, the number of people without health insurance has fallen a staggering 16 million and the rate of uninsured has dropped by nearly 37 percent. That's after just two years of sign-ups on the health insurance exchanges and expanded Medicaid, and those figures reflect lower uninsured rates at every income level and among every demographic group.Despite these impressive national results, the CDC survey also shows that most states didn't see a statistically significant decrease in the uninsured rate from the end of 2014 through September 2015. According to the agency's findings, just eight states did so. Changes in Uninsured Rates, 2014 to 2015""We will continue to see slow but steady progress in reducing the uninsured, but nothing like the tremendous decrease from the first couple years of the ACA,"" said Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. ""It has mostly stalled out, but it has stalled out at a significantly lower number of uninsured, completely as expected. No one anticipated the ACA to get to 100 percent coverage because it simply wasn't designed to.""Enrollment growth via the health insurance exchanges was considerably slower in the 2016 open enrollment period than in the first two years. The number of people joining Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program each month, a related benefit, has also flattened out, Levitt said. Louisiana is poised to expand Medicaid, but unless one of the more populous state holdouts -- like Florida or Texas -- does so, another big drop in the uninsured rate seems unlikely, he said.Indeed, what's happening on the ground is consistent with what the Congressional Budget Office projected when lawmakers passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and with its revised estimates last March. The agency correctly predicted that the number of uninsured would drop sharply in the first three years and then level off in the mid-20 millions, at about 10 percent of the population. The Department of Health and Human Services also anticipated this pattern before the 2016 open enrollment period, which ended last month.The persistent gap can be partially explained by the fact that many U.S. residents are simply ineligible for government-sponsored health benefits, even under the Affordable Care Act. According to other data analyzed by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 15 percent of the uninsured are undocumented immigrants who can't sign up for Medicaid or private insurance through the exchanges because of their citizenship status. Nine percent of those without coverage live in states that refused to enact the Medicaid expansion and left their poorest residents without access to that program or to subsidized private coverage, because the law limits financial assistance to people who earn at least poverty wages. But nearly half of the remaining uninsured do qualify for some form of help and aren't taking advantage of it, the Kaiser Family Foundation data show. Twenty-eight percent could enroll in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program but don't, while 22 percent qualify for tax credit subsidies on the health insurance exchanges.""This is a classic 'glass half empty/half full' story. Half the uninsured are eligible for some help. On the one hand, that leaves you to believe that substantial progress can still be made,"" Levitt said. ""On the other hand, we're two years into the program and those people haven't availed themselves of that help yet,"" he said. Apart from Social Security and Medicare -- which automatically enroll almost everyone who qualifies -- government programs typically don't reach everybody who could use them. And despite all the publicity (good and bad) surrounding Obamacare, not everyone has gotten the message, especially among hard-to-reach populations like those in remote rural areas or impoverished urban neighborhoods, which include large numbers of uninsured people.""We're not doing a very good job of educating people about their options and, if anything, that's probably going to get worse,"" Levitt said. He noted that funding for outreach and enrollment programs is on the decline. The latest data on health insurance exchange enrollment, made public by the Department of Health and Human Services last week, illustrate where things stand. ""There was a lot of people who came in at the beginning, some additional people in 2015, and then a modest number of additional people in 2016,"" Levitt said. ""We obviously don't have the uninsured numbers yet for 2016, but I suspect it'll show a similar pattern of more modest progress.""In the just-ended enrollment period, nearly 13 million people signed up for private coverage through the marketplaces, including more than 4 million new customers in 38 states using the federal HealthCare.gov platform and others on the 13 state-run exchanges. This at least met the federal government's own projections for enrollment. But federal officials expect the net gain in coverage through the exchanges to be about 1 million by the end of 2016, reflecting a mix of people leaving that coverage and others signing up during the year.There's another big reason why some people still go without health insurance: They simply can't afford it. The Kaiser Family Foundation data show that 15 percent of the remaining uninsured don't qualify for tax credits on the exchanges because they declined health benefits offered by their employers, and another 12 percent of the uninsured earn too much to get subsidies on the marketplaces.Changes to the Affordable Care Act, such as those promoted by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, could partially address the affordability issue in ways that would encourage more people to get insurance. For his part, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has proposed replacing all forms of health insurance with a single-payer program administered by the government that would achieve true universal coverage.But even if Clinton or Sanders wins the White House in November, they will face hostile Republican lawmakers in Congress whose primary focus remains dismantling the Affordable Care Act. Although the GOP keeps promising to come up with a plan to ""replace"" the law, no existing or previous Republican health care plan seeks to expand health coverage on the scale of Obamacare, and all would actually increase the ranks of the uninsured relative to today.Absent a major shift that makes Republicans in Congress and at the state level more amenable to government-funded health benefits, Obamacare has likely accomplished about all it can for the uninsured. That's meant a lot to millions of people, but millions more will continue to need help they won't get."

He later held a press conference and insisted he never meant to make the issue about race. ""I never said anything about white or black traffickers. ... What are they, black? I don't know. I just read the names,"" he said. But on Tuesday, he seemed to reveal his true feelings.""I had to go scream at the top of my lungs about black dealers coming in and doing the things that they’re doing to our state,"" he said on his weekly radio appearance on WVOM. ""I had to scream about guillotines and those types of things before they were embarrassed into giving us a handful of DEA agents. That is what it takes with this 127th [legislature]. It takes outrageous comments and outrageous actions to get them off the dime.""In recent days, LePage has also joked about bringing back the guillotine for drug dealers and urged Maine residents to shoot them on sight. And for the record, there are also white drug dealers in Maine. LePage has had a tense relationship with the Democratic-controlled state House, which recently tried -- and failed -- to begin impeachment proceedings against him. LePage also skipped the governor's traditional State of the State address before the legislature, instead submitting his remarks in a letter.

On Tuesday, Ghostface released a 12-minute video denouncing the immorality of hiking the price of a drug from $13 a pill to over $700 and calling out Shkreli by name. His mother and sister join in.""$750 for a pill, Martin? That's not right, Martin,"" says Ghostface, referring to how Turing Pharmaceuticals jacked up the cost of an anti-parasitic drug used to treat infections in HIV patients.This video appears to be a response to one that Shkreli released two weeks ago ""dissing"" Ghostface and threatening to delete the only copy of ""Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,"" a Wu-Tang Clan album that Shkreli reportedly bought for $2 million.Rivalries punctuated by insult-laden songs and videos have long played a big role in the hip-hop world. Over the summer, for example, Meek Mill called out Drake for not writing his own raps. Most famously, a beef between Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur morphed into the ""East Coast vs. West Coast"" rap war. It's rare, however, for a public skirmish between artists to actually elevate a serious political discussion.Emails made public by Congress last week from Shkreli's time as CEO of Turing show that he and his company strategized to hike prices as high as they could in order to profit off drugs that are used to treat relatively rare diseases. ""$1bn here we come,"" he wrote in one email.Shkreli's swaggering personality has helped draw media attention to how and why pharmaceutical companies are able to jack up drug prices with little regulatory oversight. Last week's email dump and a related congressional hearing revealed, for example, that Valeant Pharmaceuticals pursued a similar price-gouging strategy.As Bloomberg's Max Nisen wrote after the congressional hearing -- at which Shkreli pleaded the Fifth, but made quite a few funny faces -- this really isn't about any one person being evil. It's about the American health care system being broken:No one, not even the government, really knows what companies charge for drugs across a fragmented market. That creates dark corners where Shkreli thrived, where Valeant Pharmaceuticals (whose CEO Howard Schiller was also grilled on Thursday) devised its now publicly disavowed price-hike-focused business model, and where many others have massively boosted prices more quietly.Producing industry-wide reform is much harder than vilifying one or two boisterous executives. There are some signs of change ahead: Citing Shkreli's antics, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has made drug pricing a 2016 campaign issue. So if you were already mad about overpriced drugs or if this amazing Ghostface Killah video has inspired you, know there is a bit of political will to do something. Want to help? Call or email your congressional representative. Warning: This video contains a lot of profanity.As for Shkreli, he shot back:"

Sanders’ image is improving nationwide. And the role of money in campaigns is complicated. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, February 9, 2016.MANY NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS HEAD TO THE POLLS UNDECIDED - Ryan Struyk: ""A large chunk of the New Hampshire electorate says they're still willing to change their allegiances -- just a day before the primary. More than four in 10 likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire say they still could change their minds...A CNN/WMUR/UNH poll shows that less than half of likely Republican voters say they have 'definitely decided' who they're going to vote for. The GOP electorate is more fluid than the Democratic side. Roughly eight in 10 Democrats say that they have a firm choice in recent polling, with both candidates about equally firm in their support."" [ABC]What would constitute a surprise outcome? - Larry Sabato, Kyle Kondik and Geoffrey Skelley: “Polling in the New Hampshire primary is often far off the mark — the electorate has a remarkably high number of late-deciders and switchers — but keep this in mind: Trump has appeared strong in New Hampshire for more than half a year….And since early January, Sanders has led 38 straight polls, with most also showing a double-digit lead. So Sanders or Trump losing would be a big surprise....What wouldn’t be a surprise...Given the heavily fragmented polling data and the uncertainty surrounding the impact of Saturday’s debate on the outcome, we could see an electoral traffic jam that creates five '10-percenters' on Tuesday night.” [Sabato’s Crystal Ball] Polling averages show a tight race for second place - Donald Trump currently takes just over 30 percent in HuffPost Pollster’s average of the New Hampshire race, nearly twice the support of any other candidate, but the race for second is less clear. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has 15 percent, with Ohio Gov. John Kasich right behind at 14 percent. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has 12 percent, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has managed to get back into double digits with 10 percent. No change in the New Hampshire Democratic primary polls - Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ) has a 14-point lead over Hillary Clinton, 55 percent to 41 percent, according to HuffPost Pollster’s average. That’s mostly unchanged since mid-January, although it's possible Clinton saw a small bump in the polls after the Iowa caucuses. But will the polls be right? - Steve Koczela: ""When major upheaval happens at the last minute, it’s difficult to assess whether the polls were right when they were taken, if they end up different from the final result. Once Election Day has passed, a backward look to figure out when the race changed is often all but impossible. In a world ideal to pollsters, and those who collect and criticize polls for a living, there would be plenty of time to conduct more polls to fully assess the impact of every potentially seismic shift. But we live in the real world. And it’s really not about us....[A]t the end of the day, it’s up to the voters. And there is plenty of evidence many of them make up their mind at the end of the day, after the polls have stopped."" [WBUR] WHY A 74-YEAR-OLD SOCIALIST APPEALS TO MILLENNIALS - Harry Enten: ""Perhaps the most eye-popping statistic to come out of last week’s Iowa caucuses was Bernie Sanders’s overwhelming advantage among young voters. According to the Iowa entrance poll, Sanders beat Hillary Clinton 84 percent to 14 percent among Democrats aged 17 to 29…. But Clinton easily won among voters aged 45 and older, allowing her to essentially tie with him in the state. Pre-election polls in New Hampshire suggest that the age divisions in the Democratic electorate could be at least as dramatic here….[Y]ounger Americans view political labels like 'socialist' and 'libertarian' differently than older ones...that might be helping Sanders."" [538] Bernie Sanders’ favorables also rising nationally - Frank Newport: ""Heading into Tuesday's New Hampshire primary voting, the biggest shift we are monitoring in Americans' big-picture look at the candidates comes among Democrats. Bernie Sanders' image is becoming more positive to Democrats across the country by the day, even as Hillary Clinton's sinks….But there's a big cautionary note: Clinton's image among Democrats (and among all Americans if we go back in time) is extraordinarily labile -- meaning that it fluctuates. This past year alone, her net favorable among Democrats has gone from the +60s in the summer to as low as +46 in September, only to rise again in October and November and to fall again now to near her low for the year….What goes up or down for Clinton can easily reverse itself."" [Gallup] WHY THE CAMPAIGN MONEY TRAIL MATTERS - Kirby Goidel and Keith Gaddie: ""One of the observations currently being made about the 2016 presidential elections involves the ineffectiveness of money as a campaign resource….Raising large sums in mostly small increments, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has raised over $74 million, enough money to compete with the Clinton fundraising machine….If the campaign finance system is broken by Wall Street influence, how has a self-described 'democratic socialist' raised more money in individual contributions than any single candidate in the Republican field, and more small donor contributions than any candidate in history? On the other side of the aisle, Jeb Bush and his affiliated Super PACs have raised over $150 million to barely register as a blip in the national polls or in the Iowa caucuses….[M]oney is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for winning an election. Candidates who can't raise money necessarily lose, but raising (or spending) the most money is no guarantee of victory.""

Then, Jill Creighton came forward and reported that the group's president-elect had sexually assaulted her.Creighton, who was the ASCA treasurer when she reported the alleged incident, said the group treated her unfairly ""from the very beginning,"" which is why she went public with her complaint last week.ASCA is a higher education trade group that seeks to set industry standards on how to handle student misconduct cases, including sexual assault. Creighton said the organization gave more protections to Jason Casares, who she had accused of sexually assaulting her, during an investigation into her claims. Through a lawyer, Casares denied the charge.""The board simply afforded him the male privilege that we fight so hard to dismantle,"" Creighton said. ""It was shocking, is the only word I can come up with, because when it came to the community I felt I could rely on most to supply me with fundamental fairness, and provide a fair and unbiased process, it was totally the opposite.""Creighton and Casares were temporarily suspended from ASCA while the investigation took place. But Casares was allowed to delay his suspension by a day so he could give a presentation at a conference as an ASCA representative. The suspensions were ""to ensure that the board would not be influenced by either party during the investigation and resolution process,"" ASCA President Laura Bennett told The Huffington Post. The investigation by an outside law firm examined whether Casares had violated ""expectations for elected leaders as outlined in ASCA's governing documents,"" she said. (Casares did not up presenting at the conference, however, Bennett told HuffPost after this article was first published.) Creighton maintains that Casares was given a full, unredacted copy of her complaint. However, she said she received a redacted version of statements from Casares' side, which she believes gave more protection to his witnesses than to her own. Later, during a hearing held by telephone on Jan. 27, Creighton said Casares was allowed to hear her full testimony before responding, but that she was not allowed to listen to his response. ASCA documents obtained by HuffPost confirm this was the arranged process for the hearing. The investigation determined that Creighton's claims ""could not be substantiated."" Creighton said the ASCA board was given a full report of the findings but that she received only a summary conclusion. Bennett confirmed both parties received the same summary report at the same time.Creighton said she felt as if the conclusion blamed her for being alone in a hotel with Casares, and that her questions about the investigation had gone unanswered. Creighton has filed a complaint about the investigation with the ASCA and has taken a voluntary leave of absence from the group.Bennett said the investigation was fair and that the procedures gave Casares the chance to defend himself. ""Both parties were given the opportunity to address the board and be heard before a decision was reached, even though association bylaws do not require it,"" Bennett said in a statement. ""In terms of Mr. Casares receiving a full copy of Ms. Creighton's complaint, it is association policy that a copy be provided to the individual named in a complaint so they can respond. This is also why Mr. Casares was permitted to hear Ms. Creighton's presentation to the board -- so he could respond."" Casares resigned from his position on the ASCA board after the investigation. Creighton says she declined an offer to replace him. However, at the group's annual conference on Friday, a slide displayed in a session named ""Jill Casares"" as the organization's president-elect. Confusion over whether Creighton would accept Casares' old position led to the ""incredibly unfortunate mistake,"" Bennett said. ASCA leadership offered Creighton both a personal and public apology. Some members asked questions about the situation between Creighton and Casares at a forum at the conference, but many attendees said they left without answers because Bennett cited confidentiality restrictions. The fallout has continued for Casares. Last week, Indiana University Bloomington, where he was the director of student ethics and deputy Title IX coordinator, placed him on administrative leave while ""the university examines the allegations made against him,"" said spokesman Mark Land. IU learned of Creighton's allegations last week when she went public with them on Twitter.IU will also conduct an ""independent review"" of the 15 to 20 sexual misconduct disciplinary hearings in which Casares has participated since the beginning of the current academic year. This will be completely separate from the police investigation into the allegations against Casares, Land said, and the university ""has not set any sort of timetable for completing its work, although we don’t think it will take all that long."" ASCA said in its statement last week that it wants to move forward. But Creighton's public complaints are complicating that for members who still have questions for an organization whose leadership they turn to for guidance when handling similar cases with students.""I have no doubt that everyone involved wants the best for the Association, but it feels like we have very different approaches as to how that might happen, how to make that happen,"" Creighton said. ""But I feel addressing the problems more directly and more openly, and with more transparency will help us move forward, because we do it so well for our students, I want to do it well for ourselves too.""Police in Fort Worth, Texas, where the alleged assault took place, said they are still investigating and have not closed the case.

One of the faculty members, Thane Naberhaus, told the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education he would only take his job back if Newman stepped down.Previously:The president of Mount St. Mary's University, who last month was quoted in the school newspaper comparing struggling students to rabbits who should be killed, has fired two professors who criticized his policies. On Monday, President Simon Newman fired the professor who oversaw the student publication and a tenured professor who has condemned the leader of the small Catholic school in Maryland. ""Firing a tenured professor -- that’s nuclear,"" Peter Bonilla of FIRE told The Washington Post. ""That’s something that universities don’t do lightly. It’s definitely a shock if a tenured professor has gotten the ax; it raises a lot of questions about their right to free speech, their right to dissent.""At a meeting with faculty members last month, Newman apparently advocated pushing 20 to 25 struggling students to drop out early enough in the year that they wouldn't count against the college's retention rate, which is taken into account when determining a school's ranking.""This is hard for you because you think of the students as cuddly bunnies, but you can’t,"" Newman said, according to The Mountain Echo. ""You just have to drown the bunnies ... put a Glock to their heads.""Since that meeting, staff members have indicated that they are reluctant to speak out against Newman, for fear of retribution. It seems this week's firings have only breathed new life into these concerns. ""It's terrifying, and nobody is safe,"" said a faculty member who spoke to Inside Higher Ed on the condition of anonymity. ""It is shattering. It feels like the end of what so many of us have sacrificed for.""In response to the firings, FIRE has launched a letter-writing campaign to support free speech at the university.""Speaking freely is a dangerous proposition at the Mount if it is willing to go this far to silence its critics,"" Bonilla warned.

A pawnbroker in Detroit; a New York City police officer; a teacher in Chicago; the “Sleep Doctor”; the “Weedkiller”; a tech start-up; a high school hockey team; people from Alabama and Pennsylvania and North Carolina -- they're all eager to bring water to residents of Flint, Michigan.Stevenson is the director of Catholic Charities’ Center for Hope, which offers counseling, housing assistance, meals and other services for Flint’s disadvantaged residents. Now, much of their time is spent in the parking lot, handing out bottled water to people walking to the center and lining up around the block because their tap water is contaminated with lead.Donors send semi-trucks full of water to the Center for Hope daily, and other volunteers bring bottles in pick-up trucks, a school bus and a convoy of nine SUVs. One young man in upstate New York spent his bonus check from the mattress store where he works on water and renting a truck. He drove a few hundred miles to Flint last week and dropped off 250 cases of water at the Center for Hope. “These are people who just stepped up,” Stevenson said. “It’s a disaster, and it’s a horrendous thing, but people understand this need, and they understand the danger to your children, and they just give.”Catholic Charities is one of a number of local groups that have stepped up to face the man-made crisis that has left residents without drinking water.The disaster began in 2014 when Flint left the Detroit water system and began using the Flint River as a cost-cutting move. State regulators failed to require the city to properly treat the water.Without corrosion controls, lead from old pipes leached into the water resulting in resident complaints, though officials didn’t acknowledge the problem until last fall. The city has returned to its prior water supply, but it’s unknown when it will be safe to drink.Flint residents’ need for clean water is an emergency that has sparked an outpouring of donations -- celebrities and corporations have given millions of bottles, and dozens of smaller groups around the country are holding water drives. The Food Bank of Southeastern Michigan alone distributed 1.4 million bottles last month, and hundreds of volunteers are helping daily. But donations of water and filters only address one part of the larger disaster.“After we no longer have a water crisis, we’re going to have a lead crisis for at least 20 years,” said Kathi Horton, president of the Community Foundation of Greater Flint.Exposure to lead puts children at risk of critical development issues, including lower intelligence, lower academic achievement, worse fine motor skills and behavioral problems. Experts are most concerned about the outlook for the 8,000 or so children age 6 and under who were exposed to lead. While other groups handle daily water distribution, the Community Foundation of Greater Flint is raising money to address long-term issues stemming from the crisis -- even before they’ve figured out exactly what those issues are. Their Flint Child Health & Development Fund has accrued $1.7 million from over 3,000 donors since it was started in mid-January, with a goal of raising $100 million to provide medical, nutrition and education services to kids in the next couple decades. It’s separate from the United Way of Genesee County’s Flint Water Fund. About 5,000 donors have raised $1.2 million for the water fund, and once drinking water is safe, the organization will turn over any leftover money to the health & development fund.Horton credited Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who first documented elevated lead levels in Flint children, as a “visionary” who motivated community stakeholders to immediately look beyond current water needs and capitalize on national attention to raise money for long-term responses. That’s a component that is crucial and too often ignored in crises, said Center for Disaster Philanthropy President Robert Ottenhoff. He noted that 90 percent of all the money given after a disaster typically comes in the first 90 days.“Our giving to disasters tends to be very reactive, very emotional, very media-driven,” Ottenhoff said. “We’re not paying enough attention to issues like planning, like preparation, having good systems in place for building resilient communities.”In Flint, that’s resulted in some well-intentioned but misguided donations, like six bottles of water mailed to Catholic Charities that cost the sender $29 in postage. “At this point, unless people are sending a semi-truck of water at a time, we’re discouraging people from donating water because there’s so much in the pipeline,” local United Way chapter CEO Jamie Gaskin said. “The most natural inclination to help is to send water ... and we certainly don’t want to be ungrateful, but when people reach out we direct them to consider other options,” specifically the health & development Fund.Ottenhoff advised anyone seeking to help Flint to “take some time to think about what you would like to have accomplished.”“Your donation will be just as valuable, in fact may be even more valuable, if you give it a month from now, or give it a year from now,” he said.Horton pointed to long-term problems beyond health, like a negative economic impact for businesses and the city as a whole. But she sees the joint response to the Flint crisis as an encouraging sign that could put the city -- where 40 percent of people live in poverty -- on a different trajectory. “We are not accidentally named ‘Flint.’ We are tough, we are tenacious, we are strong,” Horton said. “That mentality is getting activated, and we are going to create a whole new day that’s a whole lot better for all of our residents out of this tragedy.”Learn more about the Flint Child Health & Development Fund and how to donate here.Kate Abbey-Lambertz covers sustainable cities, housing and inequality.

On Friday morning, employees of the Sacramento Women's Health Specialists clinic found a few dozen metal coat hangers spread across the clinic's doorway. A few hours later, the clinic posted a photo on their Facebook page which shows one of their escorts using the hangers to hang their bright pink ""pro-choice clinic escort"" vests. The Sacramento clinic is the largest of 11 other Women's Health Specialists clinics in the Northern California area. The clinic, which describes itself as a ""feminist women's health center"" on their website, wrote in the Facebook post that they refuse to be frightened by such ""ridiculous pranks.""""These hangers are sobering reminders of why the work we do is so important, and they also are just what we needed to hang up our clinic escort vests!"" the post reads.( Read the full Facebook post below.)The post had received over 2,000 likes as of Tuesday morning with many commenters adding words of support.It's ironic that the abortion protestors chose to use hangers as a form of harassment because the coat hanger has actually been used as a symbol for the pro-abortion movement over the years. The hanger is meant to remind us what would happen if abortion became illegal again and women were forced to seek back alley abortions. Director of Public Policy for the Women's Health Specialists clinics Eileen Schnitger told The Huffington Post that this form of anti-abortion harassment is very common for the Sacramento clinic and the other clinics in their group.""Women shouldn't have to go through this,"" she said. ""People are coming for their birth control methods, they're coming for fertility awareness, they're coming for adoption services, they're coming to get pre-natal referral."" Schnitger said this specific clinic has experienced ongoing harassment since they opened in 1973. Religious organizations stage protests lasting a month or two at a time. According to Schnitger, many of these protests amass 75 to 100 people and block the road with large altars while people dressed in religious robes threaten to perform a Eucharist as a political act. Protestors often harass people going in and out of the clinic, handing them pamphlets that falsely promise to reverse women's abortions. Schnitger said many of the clinics in the Women's Health Specialists group have experienced multiple arson fires, forcing many of their clinics to move locations every few years. One clinic burned down completely. ""We started our health centers as women saying we want to provide the services that we've wanted to receive and that women say they need,"" Schnitger said. ""What is so important about what we do is serving the needs of women in a straight-forward, information-sharing kind of way.""Also on HuffPost: "

Sebesta had convicted Robert Carter for the murders and tried to get Carter to say Graves was an accomplice. But the day before he was to testify, Carter told Sebesta he acted alone and Graves was not involved, the board said.""Sebesta never disclosed this information to the defense,"" the board said.Sebesta then presented false testimony implicating Graves, crucial in a conviction since there was no physical evidence linking him to the crime, it said.Before Graves' attorney was to present the alibi witness, Sebesta falsely stated in court that the witness was a suspect in the murders and could be indicted. The witness refused to testify and left the court, it said.Graves' conviction was reversed in 2006 and he was remanded for a new trial. In 2010, a special prosecutor found there was no credible evidence that Graves was involved in the murders and Graves was then released.Sebesta said he was being unfairly treated and that Graves was justly convicted.""I am concerned about the process,"" he said in a telephone interview, adding he was being targeted by state bar attorneys.""My opinion is that we presented the evidence we had and felt like it was sufficient,"" he said of the Graves case.One of Graves' pro bono lawyers applauded the decision.“In rejecting Sebesta’s argument, the Board of Disciplinary Appeals found that Charles Sebesta’s misconduct was so egregious that they characterized him as having ‘unclean hands.’ That certainly is a fitting description,” said Neal Manne.A study this month said that U.S. exonerations hit a record high in 2015 as more prosecutors have been looking at troubled cases.The issue has gained additional attention because of the hit Netflix documentary series ""Making a Murderer,"" which suggests authorities planted evidence against two Wisconsin men convicted of murder. The allegation has been rejected by local law enforcement.Also On HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Sunday, launching some of his most pointed attacks on his wife's Democratic presidential rival thus far. ""Hillary's opponent has a different view,"" Clinton said, declining to mention Sanders by name. ""It's a hermetically sealed box. It's very effective. The system is rigged against you by the big banks, and both parties are in the thrall of the big banks. Anybody who takes money from Goldman Sachs couldn't possibly be president.""Clinton was particularly animated when referencing a CNN report about how Sanders has been a prolific fundraiser for the Democratic Party -- meaning he has hobnobbed with the millionaires and billionaires, including some in the financial sector, he regularly rails against. Clinton said he ""fell out of [his] chair"" after reading the story, joking that Sanders ""may have to tweak that answer a little bit, or we may have to get a write-in candidate.""Hillary Clinton has also stepped up her criticism of Sanders, accusing him and his campaign during the last debate of engaging in ""artful smears"" against her.But no one on her campaign had engaged in such an extensive takedown until Sunday. Bill Clinton himself was significantly more restrained while campaigning last week in Iowa, according to Politico. Clinton on Sunday also accused Sanders' supporters of being sexist and attacking his wife's backers online. ""[Those] who have gone online to defend Hillary and explain why they're supporting her have been subject to vicious trolling and attacks,"" Clinton said, calling the comments ""profane"" and ""sexist.""Sanders denounced these so-called ""Bernie bros"" earlier Sunday in an interview with CNN. ""Look, we don't want that crap,"" he said. ""Anybody who is supporting me that is doing the sexist things is -- we don't want them. I don't want them. That is not what this campaign is about.""The Clintons and their daughter, Chelsea, are traversing New Hampshire in the final days before Tuesday's primary. Although Sanders currently leads in the polls, the state has traditionally been good to the Clintons, delivering a win for Hillary in 2008 and a second-place finish for Bill in 1992 -- an outcome that reenergized his campaign.""I was headed for single digits. And through the strength of my personal friends and the incredible effort we made, and because I had a message that was based on you -- not the Republicans, not the press not the pundits but you -- I picked up like, I don't know, 12 or 14 points in three days.

25,BUSINESS,"If Your Office Put A Calorie Counter Next To The Staircase, Would You Still Take The Elevator?",Jenny Che,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hospital-staff-wellness-programs_us_56b38916e4b04f9b57d8b3a1,An Alabama hospital realized it needed to turn workers' health around. Here's its first step.,2016-02-08,Getting healthy can start with something as simple as taking the stairs.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b9f9e41800006f0080b89b.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Many hospital workers, whose job it is to help people get well, struggle to keep themselves healthy and fit. Their jobs involve high levels of intensity and pressure, and managing those while trying to make mindful lifestyle choices can be overwhelming.But hospitals are starting to realize that change doesn't have to be hard. It can start with something as simple as taking the stairs instead of the elevator. In Alabama, employees at the Huntsville Hospital System are ditching elevator rides -- and having a good time while they’re at it. Last year, the hospital partnered with StepJockey, a British stair-tracking app, to encourage employees to opt for some old-fashioned stair climbing. Signs posted near elevator banks and stairwells inform people how many calories they can burn from climbing or descending, and they can scan their phone at the signs to track their progress as they incorporate more walking into their day.Inspired by the wellness programs at high-profile firms like Google, the Huntsville team was determined to bring a simple, cost-efficient program to its offices and raise awareness about physical activity in a state where the obesity level ranks among the nation's highest.“We felt it was important that we create a culture of wellness,” Teek Patnaik, who introduced the StepJockey partnership as part of Huntsville’s corporate wellness team and now works as a marketing project coordinator for the hospital, told The Huffington Post. “It needed to be serious, but also seriously fun.”Workplace wellness programs are increasingly becoming the standard at many of the country’s most recognizable companies. With easy access to nap rooms, mindfulness classes and health screenings, those employees -- often well-compensated -- are encouraged to move around the workspace and take care of themselves in order to increase their productivity.Many of these benefits, however, have been slow to catch on in other high-stress industries. At hospitals, for example, employee wellness isn’t always a priority -- an ironic state of affairs for an industry built around health. Research has shown that nurses who work overnight are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease and lung cancer. Obesity rates are also high among health care workers, and employers have been urged to be more proactive in boosting their workers’ attention to diet and exercise.Some hospitals, like the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, are finding ways to ensure their employees don’t get overwhelmed. The clinic implemented a “Code Lavender” to respond to nurses and physicians facing severe stress and burnout from their daily work. A team of holistic care nurses are dispatched to provide Reiki healing and massage, and healthy snacks and water if someone has had an emotionally draining experience.When Huntsville launched its partnership with the StepJockey app, it kicked off the initiative with a hospital-wide employee challenge to climb enough steps that would burn the same number of calories as it would take to summit Mount Everest. The teams hit the goal in three weeks -- so fast that the hospital turned it into a roundtrip Everest challenge.The signs encouraging stair use are now spread across three buildings on Huntsville’s campus, and may soon appear in the parking garages. An affiliate hospital, the Helen Keller Hospital in Alabama, recently picked up the program as well.The signs are key to what Paul Nuki, CEO and cofounder of StepJockey, describes as environmental intervention. Hanging signage around a workplace allows a company to engage even those employees who might not be focused on exercise.“If you want to get the group who are not interested proactively in health, then you’ve got to do it visually, with prompts and nudges on the walls,” Nuki told HuffPost. “Even if you’re still taking the elevator, you’re at least getting the health message.”The enthusiasm around the stair-climbing program encouraged Huntsville to spruce up its existing walking trails. Located indoors and outdoors, the paths indicate the number of miles that an individual has walked, but weren’t marked very well before.“You don’t have to make drastic changes to adjust to a healthy lifestyle,” Patnaik said. “Little adjustments can add up to make a pretty big difference.”As an added incentive, institutions that encourage stair climbing will also cut down their environmental impact. A recent analysis by StepJockey of published studies found that hospitals in England stand to save over $145 million a year in energy costs by swapping elevator rides for taking the stairs. If 15 percent of nurses who work at institutions that fall under the country's National Health Service opted to walk up and down the stairs, those hospitals would also save over 55,000 pounds of carbon dioxide over five years (the equivalent of the annual electricity use of three American homes). A 2009 report from researchers at the University of Chicago found that the health sector contributed to 8 percent of carbon emissions in the U.S. Not too surprisingly, hospitals are the biggest cause of that carbon footprint. Temperature control, ventilation and lighting all require enormous amounts of energy, the researchers found.But as the stair program shows, change can start with something small. Huntsville is the first U.S. hospital to partner with StepJockey, whose corporate clients include Deloitte, Procter and Gamble, KPMG and ESPN.“Hospitals want to get their own staff moving and send a clear message to their patients that movement exercise is really important, both to prevent disease and also in the recovery of patients,” Nuki said. “Huntsville wants to be seen as leading on the front for health.”"
