In particular, it allows me to reflect on my personal experiences and perspective, not just through a gender lens, but also that of an African-American.Since beginning my tenure at the Ms. Foundation for Women, I have embarked on a comprehensive listening tour, traveling around the county to hear from community leaders of all backgrounds. From our grantees to grassroots leaders, these are the people on the ground propelling grassroots movements that affect thousands of lives everyday.On one particular trip, I had the chance to visit the Underground Railroad Museum in Cincinnati, Ohio. As I walked through the museum, a standing memorial to the journey many slaves took to freedom and the risks many people took to help get them there, I reflected on how privileged I am to have the opportunity to serve in my current role as president and CEO of the Ms. Foundation: the largest, oldest women's foundation in the country. I also reflected on the obligation I feel everyday to honor those who have come before me. It has been said, and it is my belief, that: ""We owe it to our ancestors and to the sacrifices they made, to continue to achieve higher goals, while maintaining our identity.""As a woman of color, that is the lens that I look through everyday.In 2015, we -- all women -- stand at a unique time in our history. This is a time where we are not only reflecting on our past, but we are also witnessing the increased need to honor it by continuing the work of our predecessors. We are called now, more than ever, to fight not only for gender rights, but for racial justice for all. We continue to work to ensure that the lens of race and gender are not left out of our current social justice movements. Whether fighting for reproductive justice or environmental protections, the voices and experiences of all women must be included. Much like Harriet Tubman and the forgotten women of Selma, highlighted in Ava DuVernay's recent film, feminism has a leading role in shaping progressive movements to be inclusive, while striving not to be ambivalent of race.A prime example is the way women, particularly women of color, helped shape the Civil Rights Movement. DuVernay's depiction of the Civil Rights Movement unapologetically spotlights the contributions of black women too often downplayed in history. It is that perspective, and the acknowledgement of the key role of women in building strong and lasting movements, that drives the foundation to continue our work everyday.The work of the Ms. Foundation for Women is integral to building diversity -- both within the feminist movement, and all progressive movements. We play an important role by bringing a diverse and all-inclusive gender lens to philanthropy. Working with our funding networks, the Ms. Foundation helps identify the grassroots organizations working on the ground to build power in communities that are too often excluded from the tables where progressive strategies are planned.In cities and towns across the U.S., Ms. Foundation grantees are working on every aspect of women's equality. Our grantees are pressuring pharmacies to ensure that teens have access to emergency contraception, fighting for equal access to affordable healthcare, spotlighting the need for equal pay, working to end rape culture and helping to build a better childcare system for all while building grassroots activism and supporting the next generation of feminist leaders.That is why I am calling on you to renew your commitment and dedication to building diverse and powerful movements for equality. Together we can bring more people to the table by expanding feminist narratives and acknowledging the intersection of issues within the larger movement for women's empowerment. We must acknowledge, that to strengthen our movement, we have to address inequality as all women experience it. Also know, that I am committed to upholding our obligation to continue building diverse, inclusive movements for equality, and we promise not to rest until we have justice for all."

(Photo by John Lamparski/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6006f2400003100981a0b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What does it take to get to the top -- without losing your center? Our “Making It Work” series profiles successful, dynamic women who are standouts in their fields, peeling back the ""hows"" of their work and their life, taking away lessons we can all apply to our own.Soledad O'Brien has a lot going on.She's the CEO of the Starfish Media Group, a production company and distributor she founded in 2013 with a focus on ""life's untold stories."" Alongside her work there, she's reporting for HBO's ""Real Sports"" and Al Jazeera America and producing her two documentary series, ""Black In America"" and “Latino in America."" Oh, and she's raising four kids, too. The 48-year-old broadcast journalist started her career in 1987 as an associate producer and news writer at WBZ-TV in Boston -- and she's come a long way since. She's co-anchored NBC's ""Weekend Today"" and CNN's ""American Morning,"" and anchored CNN's ""Starting Point."" She's won awards for her coverage of events ranging from Hurricane Katrina to the Haiti earthquake to the 2012 elections. And in 2011, O'Brien and her husband Brad Raymond started the Starfish Foundation, which helps send young women to college.Watching O'Brien at an AOL BUILD interview on Feb. 5, it was clear that she thrives in her different roles. While answering questions about social media and race relations, she talked about how her experiences as a journalist, a businesswoman, a mother and a woman of color inform the work she's doing -- and the work she hopes to do next. O'Brien sat down with The Huffington Post to talk about advocating for herself, raising feminist girls and how people will surprise you when you ask for help.How would you define success?I think success changes as you change. Success before you have kids has a different definition than when you become a mom, than when you send your kids off to college. So for me, success is multifaceted. At one point it was about, “what’s my job title?” “How much money am I going to make this year?” Then you start thinking, “What’s the job I’m actually doing? What’s the quality of the work I’m turning in?” And then you think, “Well, what is my life like?” I think right now where I am -- with four kids who are all in the 10 to 14 range -- success for me is trying to figure out how to balance all the things that are important, and to balance them well. In a way where you’re not shorting yourself, or your work, which is something I’m very passionate about -- but you’re also not shorting your children, and your spouse. For me it’s about getting all these things to work in harmony. Would you consider yourself successful?Most days. I don’t think anyone is 100 percent successful. I think I am mostly successful, which is sort of what you aim for. You get up, you try to go to the gym, you try to eat well, you try to get your kids to school, help with homework and do good work and work on a project. And now I’m a CEO, so I'm growing a business. If you can make most of those things happen during any given day, then yeah, I think you’ve been pretty successful.Why do you do the work that you do?I have always been driven by telling good stories. Part of what drives me is to just tell stories about people whose lives fly under the radar -- that no one seems to necessarily care about. I think those stories can be incredibly interesting. I also have four kids, and I’m really driven to be as good a mom as I can be. I long ago gave up on pureeing baby food, I don’t really cook very well, we have comforters so we kind of make beds like -- swoosh, cover it up. So I feel like I have figured out the parenting thing at this moment in time, and it could change tomorrow. When my youngest son was diagnosed as deaf, we had two responses. One, we were very grateful to know what was going on, because he had been struggling a lot. And two, it gave us a real perspective on how bad things could be. Because he was happy, and he was healthy, and he is doing well in school, and he has lots of friends, and he’s a happy kid. And it is very easy to not have that. Covering stories as I have for NBC and CNN over the years, when you cover real disasters, it gives you the healthy sense of -- well, this is not a disaster. So I know that whatever little drama that’s happening is not a disaster, and we will get through it. Having that perspective on life is incredibly helpful. If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be doing?I used to tell people that I’d be doing hair... because for any girl who grows up with a lot of big hair, learning how to work a flat iron would be a really good thing. I don’t know, I can’t imagine doing anything else. I was pre-med in college, and I really thought I’d be a doctor. And then I left school and decided not to go to medical school, and I didn’t really know what to do, and I started working at a TV station and I was just good at it. It’s now been 28 years or something. I would love one day not to have 10 jobs -- kids and running a company and running a foundation and running around like a maniac -- but I love storytelling. So I really think I’d be involved in telling stories about people in some capacity.What advice would you give to young women starting to decide what they want to do in life? How do you encourage and guide your own daughters?I think there’s so many times when girls and young women are told, “It’s just not gonna work out.” And if I could give anyone advice, it would be this idea that the doing it or not doing it is up to you. And you have to run around and exploit all the resources around you. Pick people’s brains, bring them lunch, buy them coffee -- and just get in there to see how people who are doing what you want to do are doing it. Learn by watching and osmosis. There’s so much of life that is being book smart, but there’s a big chunk that’s just understanding how stuff works. I think women are often talked out of things. I remember when I had just had my twins, I had four kids under four years old. And the tsunami happened in 2004. I got a call from someone at CNN, and they said “well, we’re supposed to try to send someone to Thailand, but I know you won’t want to go, because moms don’t want to travel.” And I said to her, ""Well, I have four kids under four, so Thailand sounds amazing!"" And they sent me to Thailand. But it reminded me that you constantly have to challenge people’s expectations. [The caller] wasn’t trying to be mean, she just had expectations about what a new mom would do and she was foisting those expectations on to me. I said ""Listen, here’s what I want to do."" You have to restate it, sometimes firmly, sometimes gently, sometimes with a smile, and just constantly write your path -- and try to figure out how to get there. Hitting people up for information, help, guidance, advice, but staying on that path of “here’s what I want to do.” We’re just constantly, as women, talked out of it. “You can’t do this and that” -- but you can. You really can. If it’s something you really want to do, you can. And I think that’s a message that a lot of young women need to hear. You have to set the parameters of the experience and the success that you want to have. Women's roles and the topic of feminism have been huge conversations in the past couple of years -- especially when successful young women come forward saying they don't identify as feminists. I think that those women don’t know what a feminist is. Feminism needs a really good PR agency. They say, ""I’m not a feminist,"" and then go on to describe exactly ways in which they’re feminist. That’s a PR issue, not a factual challenge. Those are just women who don’t know what it is, and maybe women who don’t understand what feminism has done for them. My daughters who are 12 and 14 would describe themselves as feminists. I’m very aggressive about it -- I show them the opportunities that they have. They’re always stunned to hear about when people couldn’t do what they can do. They just don’t know. I’m not sure that all those young women [decrying feminism] have someone drilling into their heads, ""You know, the reason you get to do this is because there are a lot of people who fought for those opportunities."" Yeah, there's still this common misperception that feminists are man-haters who look down on other women for making certain choices, for example the choice to be a stay-at-home mom.Sometimes part of the conversation is how we love to posit women against each other. Working moms versus stay-at-home mom, and somehow everybody is better than the other person. We do have these fights that are sort of whipped up and not necessarily valid. In my kids' school, my daughters are able to do a lot of things because the moms who don’t travel as much as I do welcome them into their homes and allow my daughters to have great experiences. And sometimes I can take my daughters’ friends on cool experiences because of some of the work I do. And I think of it as a sharing thing. We are all rooting for our kids and other people’s kids to do well. I think that’s more the reality than the way it’s positioned sometimes.What do you think are the big issues women are facing? What’s holding us back from gender equality?A couple things. I think that women have to really figure out how to advocate for themselves -- and I would add myself to that list. I was doing an interview he other day with Tamara Mellon, who used to run Jimmy Choo. And she said it really surprised her that when she started asking people for help in her business, no one said no. She got to the point where she was like, ""I don’t know what to do, I’m stuck,"" and she turned to people and there was not a single person who said “I won’t help you. Leave me alone.” As a new CEO, I have found that very true. I have never had a single person who I called up and said “listen, can I pick your brain about something that I’m working on,” never once has someone said “yeah, you know what, no.” And I think the same is true for the young women that I mentor, and the young women in our foundation. When they go up to someone and say, “I am stuck on a thing, can you help me figure this out?,” they always get support. They always get help. Not just from the people who are mentoring them, but from random people who are happy to take a moment to try to help them be successful. The world is really full of those people. Women have to open themselves to saying, “I am not perfect. I am not flawless. I am going to get help, and I am going to get better.” That is a really good first step. And really trying to decide what kind of opportunities exist, and advocating for them. The whole argument about likeablilty. It matters, but at my age, you get to the point where you’re like “eh, screw it.” I’m too old. I don’t care anymore. You get to a point where you’re like, ""I don’t care if you like me. You just need to think that I’m good."" And that’s a very freeing thing. I just want to be good. I want to be clear, I want to be straightforward, I want to be respected, I want to have good quality work -- I don’t give a sh*t if anybody likes me. I don’t need to go and be their best friend. When I got to that point, it was really a great moment.The last thing I wanted to talk about was your involvement with CoverGirl's 'This Girl Can' campaign. I’ve been working on a project for them that should be launching very soon. They sent us out to go and do documentaries -- find young, amazing women who are overcoming challenges. The greatest assignment ever. When you invest in women, you can change communities. Literally. "

By the end, what we were actually talking about was love. Could they be interrelated? Can you lead with love? He brought me back to the moment that connected the two for him: First of all, do you remember Field Day at the end of the school year? It was a day filled with water balloon tosses, potato sacks, relay races; the sticky aftermath of red and orange Popsicle mustaches and cotton candy claws. It was the day that the athletically advanced could gain bragging rights, and somehow, the same kids always came out on top. The tallest, broadest, most popular kids really shined on Field Day. The most coordinated kid won the tosses, the fastest won the race. Let's call him David. Erik remembers being 10 at his elementary school's Field Day, rounding the final curve of the race with about 50 yards to go, slated about 10 yards behind David. For those that have never participated in a running competition, these final moments of the race are best defined as pure agony: your legs are heavy as cement, your arms went numb thirty seconds ago, and your lungs, well, they're sucking hard to bring in air through a passage that feels like the width of a pencil point. On this final stretch, Erik saw his opponent ahead of him. He thought, it's probably best to just take second, that feels safe, that feels right. He'd been there before, and he could settle for that again. Then another voice crept across his consciousness, perhaps because of a lack of oxygen. It whispered, you have more in the tank than you think you do. You can give more than you think you can. You can give everything you've got. With the proper mix of true grit, wild abandon, trust, and motivation, Erik found what it meant to break away from physical and mental limitations, and to give something everything. He won by one foot because he put one foot further than he thought he could. Erik doesn't know where David is today in his life, or how that race may have changed David's path, maybe it didn't change him at all. But for Erik, the compass was recalibrated. He started listening and trusting that other voice, the one inclined to put in everything he had, and the choice has brought him to some interesting conclusions. Firstly, he's found that it doesn't always mean winning; sometimes you give something everything, and you still end up second, you still lose the girl, you relapse, you're laid off. But most importantly, if you go into the race with a little more faith in your potential, a little more love for yourself, a little more love for the ones cheering for you, the investment will be worth your while. Your guts to take this path will leave an impact. Loving and leading this way is a risk, no doubt about it. It's a risk for your personal relationships, it's a risk for your professional reputation, it's a risk for your self-esteem. It's not comfortable. Instead, it's about finding what level of discomfort are we comfortable with. Going down the road to loving a lot means that you're more invested, more exposed to getting hurt. But what's the alternative? To not love not at all, or loving less freely, less completely, living alone? Isn't this the same as hurting, potentially, all the time? In Erik's opinion, the former is a risk worth taking, a free-falling plunge he's willing to fall into backwards, eyes closed. Why? Because whatever the investment may be -- financial, emotional, physical, spiritual -- the gains are doubled when they're done with love. At home with his wife and kids and at work with his patients and team -- his two families that simply go by different names -- Erik's method of leading with love is working. It's about giving everything you've got. I've mentioned before that my greatest undertaking for 2015 has been working with my team of writers at RTC to write my book, Leading with Love. We are familiar with the concept at RTC. It's been our mantra for the past two years, and we are lucky enough to watch it in action and feel its impact every single day with our clients. But when I met Erik at Conscious Capitalism in the fall, I was stunned by how effortlessly our values aligned despite our varying professions. We are a storytelling company, he is a dentist. We support our clients in sharing their message with words on the page, Erik and his team are restructuring the patient's experience, finding the time and space to value the body on the receiving end of their care. He is adamant that this starts with love. If you break it down, leading with love calls for heightened consciousness (might explain why two like minds found one another at a conference called Conscious Capitalism). It's about listening, but even more importantly, it's about actually hearing what is being said. It's about making time to listen, and space to process what you've heard. When you are conscious and present for the other human being a different conversation transpires. It's one of trust. From trust, grows a community and with a trusting community, you gain a culture. Much like the Field Day race, there are no short cuts to achieving trust, to strengthening community, or creating culture. You simply have to love what you do and grow toward it. As we talked, Erik said something that struck a nerve. He said, ""Corey, what I love most about what I do is listening to people. What I love even more is that they know, by the end of our conversation, that I cared about what they had to say."" That's what it takes to lead, be it from your doctor's chair, your fancy Herman Miller CEO chair at the head of the oak table, or from the front of the classroom, with love. Rand Stagen recently said to me that leaders get the organization they deserve. If you're focused on the profit of your work, things are only good when there's a profit. But, if you're passionate about the purpose of your work, you can always look in the mirror and be proud of your day. We have to trust that our bodies and minds can push further than we think they can. We have to trust that we can give everything we have to something we love. And we have to trust that that love will translate into leadership."

If, given a chance.Greeks simply don't feel they're getting that chance right now, with good reason.With all of the talk of GDP growth, primary surpluses, and repayment schedules, what is being lost is the continuing human cost of austerity.Unemployment in Greece right now is 25.8 percent. As a point of comparison, that is higher than the highest unemployment ever reached in the United States at the height of the Great Depression. Youth unemployment is even higher -- over 50 percent. My family is incredibly lucky to live comfortably, but too many Greek families can no longer put food on the table, much less help the future of their children. One study shows that Greece suffers a suicide a day due to austerity.For too long, Greece has been unfairly singled out. Nations around the world run afoul of financial obligations, but we are called to account. People around the world work less hard then Greeks, but we are stereotyped as lazy.I know and I have seen a different Greece. The Greece I saw leading up to the Athens Olympics was a Greece that was willing to sacrifice and willing to meet and exceed international standards. As a sponsor of students at the Clinton Global Initiative University -- I've seen firsthand the energy and potential of Greece's young people. And as the founding sponsor of the Clinton Global Initiative Mediterranean meeting, I look forward to bringing leaders to Athens this June to work on solutions to many of Greece's, and the region's, challenges. Inspiring movements and capturing potential requires time, and it requires leadership. When I served in the Greek Parliament, I was a member of a center-right party. Our new Prime Minister represents the left. You might think that I would reflexively oppose him, but I believe he represents the new leadership Greece needs. Now what he needs, is time.The Prime Minister-elect had yet to be sworn in before he was subjected to an unprecedented attack from leaders throughout Europe. The media immediately started splashing front pages with dated headlines that told the story of our past, as if it was necessarily the story of our future.The Greek people voted overwhelmingly for a new start. But Prime Minister Tsipras cannot deliver that new start alone. He needs help from World leaders and Europe's other leaders and the involved Eurozone officials, easing up the strict -- non-workable rules imposed -- on the Greek people. And I believe if World and European leaders help Prime Minister Tsipras deliver dignity to the Greek people, the Greek people will deliver for themselves -- and the world."

Police ruled the death a suicide, but his family believe it was murder.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0658250000940037b215.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The animus for Time Magazine's ""song of the 20th century"" was a photograph of a Southern lynching. A Southern lynching would often draw an entire region of spectators together for a day of socializing. Small children were even present in the crowd, lifted high upon shoulder for an uninterrupted view of the day's fatal proceedings. It was a strange, albeit frequent Southern spectacle, one that claimed many Black lives.Given the frequency of this horrid practice, and the abundance of lynching photographs in circulation, many that doubled as postcards, it is unclear why one particular photograph troubled, then inspired Abel Meeropol, a New York English teacher and poet. Yet, it did. Unable to free his mind of this troubling image over several days, Meeropol sought consolation through his pen. As ink dried upon its canvas, its residuum formed words that have haunted generations, words etched into our collective memory as lyric by the incomparable Billie Holiday:""Southern trees bear a strange fruit, Blood on the leaves and blood at the root, Black body swinging in the Southern breeze, Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.""Now seventy-six years removed its initial recording, there is still cause to sing this sorrowful song.On August 29, 2014, another Black body was added to the crowded annals of those swung by Southern breeze. In a cruel twist of irony, the body of seventeen year-old Lennon Lacy was not found swinging upon a Southern tree, but upon a Southern swing set - a fact only beginning the strangeness surrounding his death. Authorities in Bladenboro, North Carolina, abruptly ruled Lennon's death a suicide, declaring that he was depressed, and closed the case in five days.Still, many questions remain.Why did authorities fail to place bags over Lennon's hands to prevent contamination and preserve DNA from a possible struggle?Why didn't authorities take any pictures at the scene of Lennon's death?Why were the shoes found on Lennon's feet not the same shoes that he departed from home wearing?Why were the shoes found on Lennon's feet a size and a half smaller than his foot size?Why were those same shoes removed from the body bag between the time his corpse was placed in the body bag and the time the body arrived at the medical examiner's office?Strange.Very strange.Strange, still, is an independent examiner's conclusion that declaring Lennon's death a suicide is virtually impossible given Lennon's height, weight, and the items found at the scene.The circumstances surrounding Lennon's death, however, begin to lose some of its strangeness when the fact that he was in an interracial relationship with a white woman in an area still ripe with racial tension, and where the Ku Klux Klan has an active presence, is brought to the fore. History has taught us time and time again that when authorities move too quickly to close a case, a cover-up is afoot. With so many questions surrounding Lennon's death, the move to close his case remains startlingly strange, and it is cause for great concern. Thankfully, the FBI is now investigating the case.Strange, still, is how justice for so many Black lives remains so fleeting.Strange, still, is how swiftly certain tragedies that befall Black lives are swept under the rug.Strange, still, is the spectacle of a Southern lynching upon a swing set, a symbol of youthful euphoria now rendered the site of a Black youth's strangulation. Of Meeropol and Holiday's ""Strange Fruit,"" the late jazz writer Leonard Feather penned that it was ""the first significant protest in words and music, the first unmuted cry against racism."" The very nature of a lynching is to render the victim forever mute -- asphyxiating in suspended space -- the violent snapping of the neck. While Lennon Lacy is forever muted, we who love justice must become for him as Meeropol and Holiday: an unmuted cry.We must continue to pen Lennon's story.We must continue to sing Lennon's song.We must continue to seek answers to strange circumstances.We must continue to seek justice for another Black life, a life, strangely, still, gone too soon.This post is part of the ""28 Black Lives That Matter"" series produced by The Huffington Post for Black History Month.

6,BLACK VOICES,The Power and Future of Black Faith,"Pastor Michael McBride, ContributorDirector, PICO National Network’s LIVE FREE Campaign",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-power-and-future-of-b_b_6639836.html,"My vision only makes sense to those young men we met in Ferguson, and the future we seek to create if Black Faith will show up.",2015-02-08,"ST. LOUIS MO - NOVEMBER 30 : Worshipers listen as Reverend Al Sharpton speaks about the shooting death of Michael Brown during a church service at Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church November 30, 2014 in St. Louis, Missouri. Brown, a 18-year-old black male teenager was fatally wounded by Darren Wilson, a white Ferguson, Missouri Police officer on August 9, 2014. A St. Louis County 12-member grand jury who reviewed evidence related to the shooting decided not to indict Wilson with charges sparking riots through out Ferguson.

I am unapologetically black. And at times, I am apologetically a clergy leader in the American church. These self-descriptions attempt to gesture at the intersectionality of my own faith journey and perspective that informs the lens through which I see the world. While none of these self-descriptions give a full account of who I am, they are significant because they tell a story of what is shaping me. And this story deeply informs the way I see black faith relevant in a black future we dare to imagine.On August 19, 2014 while in Ferguson during the aftermath of Michael Brown's killing, I was walking down W. Flourissant for the evening resistance and protests. This particular night, we called for one hundred clergy to show up and be present. While walking to ""ground zero"", a group of young men asked ""Why are all you preachers out here tonight? What's going on?"" I said to them, ""We are here because we love you and we care!"" One of the young men replied, ""Fa real?""My encounter with these young men reflect one of my hopes for our black future: an accelerated day when young people disconnected from our faith and community institutions don't question why are we here. Nor respond with doubt, incredulity or skepticism when we reply with genuine love and concern.I have grown to love the spirit and vision of this burgeoning revolutionary era, particularly its guiding leadership principles of low ego, high impact. It resonates with my theological assumptions of Jesus who was moved by such a depth of love that he willingly evacuated his privilege and learned obedience through his death on the cross. And because of his low ego and high impact, my physical and eternal destiny is transformed.When I think of Black Future Month, and the kind of vision that could emerge from my Black Faith, it would be grounded in a similar spirit of low ego and high impact, showing up through what I will call the Body, the Ballot and the Buck.In my vision, the Body serves as a double entendre describing two ways we can show up. As institutions of black faith, can we re-imagine our congregations as more than a house for weekly worship? Can we embrace the notion of our institutional Body as power bases of black power and agency that can be leveraged to invent a future for our black families that see the kingdom of God on earth as it is in heaven? Likewise, can we preach, pray and act in ways that disciple our congregants to be open and willing to put their personal Body in the fight for freedom through principled nonviolent direct action or mentoring or any form of physical engagement?This would mean that clergy, seminaries and ongoing Christian education programs must develop a robust theology that collapses the false dichotomy between biblical understandings of righteousness and justice. Some of this work is emerging in places likePICO's Live Free Campaign, The Samuel DeWittt Proctor Conference, and the The Black Church Center for Justice & Equality. And while the Body may show up differently for institutions and individuals, the non-negotiable in my vision would be the Body showing up in concrete ways that leverage our unique privileges of power, wealth, talent and numbers to reaffirm that Black Faith matters in the future of black lives.Our Ballot could be utilized as a tool of accountability for elected officials and political interests who for too long have failed to respond with the requisite response that matches the depth and complexity of suffering in black communities through mass criminalization & incarceration, police brutality and state-sponsored violence. Can black faith incubate and unleash the moral outrage necessary to inspire sustained engagement in electoral and political engagement? This means regular social justice ministries committed to civic engagement, organizing and advocacy must be prioritized and resourced in our ministries. I believe black faith overflowing from neighborhood-based congregations can catalyze and sustain local political engagement between election cycles since all politics is really local. Organizations like the Values Partnership, Let My People Vote and National African American Clergy Network  are powerful resources which have year round capacity to support our local efforts.Our Buck gives us an opportunity to harness the $1 trillion dollars of economic wealth, which flows through the black community. Black faith can mine the theological and moral values of our traditions to critique the dominant and excessive spirit of materialism and unfettered capitalism grinding our communities into dust. Black Faith can sustain a rhythm of boycotts and economic interruptions that are targeted to demonstrate the power of wealth already at our disposal. Black faith institutions can channel business and parishioners to minority and women-owned businesses to keep our wealth circulating in our communities. I am inspired by Rahiel Tesfamariam's Not One Dime Campaign and the Blackout for Human Rights Campaigns, which seek to provide structure for a sustainable movement. Showing up through our Buck would increase more access to jobs, entrepreneurship, opportunities and self-sufficiency, all the while alleviating economic poverty in our communities.I can go on about many other ways that Black Faith can show up to create a black future where all of our families can live free. I could talk about: Re-entry ministries for the formerly incarcerated, health ministries for those living with HIV/AIDS, expanding our circle of concern to our LGBTQQI community members, and so much more.My vision only makes sense to those young men we met in Ferguson, and the future we seek to create if Black Faith will show up. May we show up creating the moral and theological confrontation that makes the systems and forces of this world answer: Which Side Are You On? Our scriptures teach us that faith without works is dead. May the works of our Black Faith be so alive that the future being invented can never be surprised to see us walking down the street.We'll know black lives matter when everyone is treated like they are created in the image of God and can live free to realize life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.This post is part of the ""Black Future Month"" series produced by The Huffington Post and Black Lives Matter for Black History Month.

And though great genes may have won her a place in front of the cameras as a teenager, it has been her work ethic and sense of discipline that has kept her there for the past three decades. Unlike many of her peers, Cindy never took up a party-girl lifestyle. Even throughout the height of her fame she remained focused on her health and career, selling five million copies of her home fitness routine in 1992 and releasing a cosmetics workbook four years later, snatching up endorsement deal after deal along the way. Since leaving the world of full-time modeling sometime around 2000, she hasn't slowed down, instead delving deeper into the world of business by creating a skincare line and furniture line and also acting as spokeswoman for several important charitable causes.There isn't really any doubt that the former supermodel is a sharp cookie. She graduated valedictorian of her high school and attended Northwestern University, until her modeling career was launched by renowned Chicago photographer, Victor Skrebneski. It was a smart move. In 1995, Forbes reported that Cindy was the world's highest paid model. But beyond the financial motivation behind her modeling, Cindy was able to travel the world and meet many fascinating people, learning from them as she went. This life experience has shaped her into the strong, independent woman she is today, and many have found that she has valuable words of wisdom to share.Last November, Cindy's new role as Art Van Furniture's Charity Challenge Ambassador was announced at ""A Shining Star Event"" in Chicago. I was fortunate to be able to sit with Cindy to discuss her partnership with Art Van, inspiration for her line, and her advice for those wanting to get into the business. ""If you're passionate about what you do,"" she said, ""and you're true to your own values and your own aesthetic, and you trust that... I think that's the way to have a successful brand in no matter what it is.""The Art Van Charity Challenge will generate millions of dollars for various local nonprofits throughout the Midwest, and Cindy is pleased to participate. Her history of giving-back began long before her partnership with the furniture retailer. She has been a highly visible spokesperson for valued charities and causes through much of her career. Particularly close to Cindy's heart are research and treatment centers for leukemia. She participates in fundraising for DKMS, an organization that registers bone marrow donors to be matched with the patients in need of them, and supports St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the Dream Foundation, and many more. As much as she has worked for herself and her family, through her philanthropic endeavors she has also touched the lives of many others. Overall, it is Cindy's sense of priorities and work-life balance that makes her an example of truly exceptional living. The happily married mother of two has stated that if she must choose between her family and career, she chooses family--without hesitation. But she's thankful that she can have it all. In the end, it seems that her opinion of furniture design is not entirely unlike her advice for designing one's life: ""It's really about creating a comfortable sanctuary for your family.""Follow Irene on Facebook, Twitter, and IOnTheScene.com!"

However, his fiancee told Reuters on Sunday that she had no information about his possible release.""The session has been set for Feb. 12, 2015,"" said Mostafa Nagy, the lawyer representing Mohamed, who was given an extra three years in jail for possessing a single bullet.Under a decree issued last November, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has the power to approve the deportation of foreign prisoners.Canada is deeply concerned with the announcement of a re-trial date despite assurances that Fahmy would be released along with Greste, the office of junior foreign minister Lynne Yelich said in a statement that also called for his immediate release.""We remain hopeful that Mr. Fahmy's case will be resolved in a timely manner,"" she said.Amal Clooney, one of Fahmy's lawyers, wrote to Sisi requesting a meeting to discuss the case, according to a letter dated Feb. 6 that was shown to reporters by his family.Baher Mohamed is Egyptian and holds no foreign nationality, making his case more difficult to resolve.Egyptian authorities accuse Qatar-based Al Jazeera of being a mouthpiece of the Brotherhood -- the movement the army removed from power in 2013. Al Jazeera denies the allegations.The journalists were detained in December 2013.They say they were doing their jobs and their imprisonment reinforced the view of human rights groups that the government was rolling back freedoms gained after the 2011 uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak.

The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for central New York, the western Catskills and much of New England through early Tuesday.The snow is likely to cause problems for commuters on Monday, though it's not expected to accumulate as rapidly as in some of the earlier storms, including a record-busting late January blizzard. There also is little risk seen of significant coastal flooding, a problem during last month's winter blasts.Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said he'll give an update the city's storm response Sunday afternoon at City Hall.As more flakes fell, all Michelle Currie could do was post on her Facebook page a photo of a weather map showing up to 18 inches of fresh snow that may fall on her home.""I have to laugh because otherwise I may cry,"" said Michelle Currie of Dracut, Massachusetts, a mother of five whose kids have already missed several days of school.Boston's transit system, the nation's oldest, has been particularly hard hit. The buildup of snow and ice on trolley tracks combined with aging equipment has stalled trains in recent days, delaying and angering commuters. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority general manager Beverly Scott said Saturday that crews were doing everything they could, including deploying massive jet-powered snow blowers, to clear tracks before the next storm.Gov. Charlie Baker acknowledged on Friday that the MBTA was handed an extraordinary situation with old equipment but said the system's overall performance was unacceptable.In many New England communities, the obvious problem is where to put the next batch of snow.David Lombari, public works director for West Warwick, Rhode Island, told the Providence Journal his town was already clogged with snow piles several feet high and school buses were parked in the usual snow storage lot.""I don't know what we're going to do yet,"" Lombari said. ""It's tough trying to find a place that meets all the proper (environmental) criteria.""State snow disposal guidelines require that communities use locations that won't harm environmental resources and have barriers that prevent contaminants from seeping into groundwater when the snow melts.Adding injury to insult perhaps, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency warned that potentially record cold temperatures and wind chills are expected to move into the region later in the week after the storm.Not everyone was dreading the blast of winter.Business has been brisk at Charles Street Supply hardware in Boston, where owner Jack Gurnon sells shovels, salt and sleds. He drove to Portland, Maine, to stock up so he'd be able to meet demand when the next storm came.""We actually have a lot of supply right now, and we're lucky because the big box stores, they're scrambling around, and I'm sitting on a whole bunch right now,"" Gurnon said.But an increase in sales isn't all he is looking forward to. ""I also love to ski, so as soon as this next mess is over with, I'm taking off and going north,"" he said.___Associated Press radio correspondent Julie Walker contributed to this report."

In fact, Dr. Bob himself has hardly changed over the years! Except that now he's much busier, not only working to maintain his own optimal physical fitness but also helping others to ward off the signs of aging. He has always been remarkably athletic, and his enthusiasm for health and fitness is both inspiring and contagious. While this passion has led him to set several world records for various feats (including an impressive 13,500 consecutive sit-ups and 321 consecutive handstand pushups), he is as equally interested in contributing to the growing body of anti-aging research, with the aim of increasing longevity and enhancing quality of life for the rest of us. In fact, Dr. Bob was the first to produce this sort of modern research and coin the term ""anti-aging."" Handstand pushupsIn his long and prolific career, Dr. Bob has written dozens of books on anti-aging, diet and nutrition, sports medicine, and more. He is the founder of the International Sports Hall of Fame and a co-founder of Life Science Holdings (a biomedical research company), the National Academy of Sports Medicine, and the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine.

Dr. Bob wanted answers to health and anti-aging questions that weren't available when he began his career, so he took action to find the solutions himself. We too can do this--even without a medical degree. The next time you have questions about a condition you are dealing with or possible treatment options you'd like to explore, be sure to read as much as you can from reputable sources and take a list of talking points to discuss with your doctor. And remember, building a trusting relationship with your physician is important, but in the end, our doctors don't cook for us and can't exercise for us. We have to take control of our own health. It is inspiring to see the results of those, like Dr. Bob, who do.

What's more, ""veteran operatives who were torn between Bush and Romney will be free to put their energies into the Bush camp,"" and ""former Romney donors were moving toward Bush.""Yep, Totally Jeb Bush: CNN concurs: ""Mitt Romney's decision to pass on 2016 anoints Jeb Bush as the clear establishment favorite."" South Carolina's GOP state party chair Matt Moore shows up in the piece, remarking, ""I think it is hard to argue that today's news did not help Gov. Bush.""Unless, Of Course, Jeb Bush Ends Up Being The Big Loser: The Federalist's Ben Domenech: ""So who benefits from this, and who is harmed? Somewhat ironically, it may be Jeb himself who takes a small hit over this. Bear with me here: with Romney in the race, Jeb would’ve had an opportunity to contrast himself as a fresh face, a break with the past of the GOP in a healthy way ... Romney would not have been able to win the nomination this time around, and he actually could’ve proven to be a useful foil for Jeb.""Well, In That Case, It's Gotta Be Scott Walker: ""This news is especially helpful to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who was already the thinking man's choice for a dark horse,"" writes Vox's Andrew Prokop, in a piece titled, ""Mitt Romney's exit is great news for Scott Walker, not Jeb Bush.""Definitely Walker!: Headline at Hugh Hewitt's site: ""Chuck Todd: Scott Walker the Other Big Winner Of Romney's Decision To Bow Out.""  Not So Fast! Don't Forget About Chris Christie!: Meanwhile, Business Insider is pretty sure that Bush and Christie are the big Mitt-stakes winners: ""Romney, the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee, suddenly announced Friday morning that he would not launch another White House bid in 2016. His exit opens up more space for establishment-oriented contenders with similar constituencies to Romney's -- particularly Christie and Bush.""It Could Also Be Rubio! (And Walker.): The Hill's Jonathan Easley: ""Walker and Rubio could also see a political windfall, building on what has been a big month for both potential candidates."" The Washington Post's Jennifer Rubin: ""Aside from Christie, Romney’s exit helps Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) the most. Both can appeal to the donor community and win over a chunk of Romney backers. They will need to build out their organization swiftly and show they have the gravitas to run and win a national campaign.""Anyone Got Kasich? Yes. ""Ohio governor John Kasich may also benefit somewhat from Romney’s exit.""The National Journal's Charlie Cook Makes A Bold Prediction: ""Several 2016 candidates could benefit from the 2012 GOP nominee's decision not to run."" Okay, thanks!What Do ""Not Very Well-Informed"" Millennials Think? According to Fusion's polling of ""not very well-informed"" millennials, ""With Romney out of the mix, former Florida Jeb Bush benefitted the most: He could be the frontrunner with Romney out of the way. In a Romney-less field, Bush leads the pack at 16 percent, jumping 4 percentage points from a field that included Romney.""Okay, Surely There's A ""Big Loser,"" Right? What About Rand Paul? I Don't See Him On This List: Per KSNV My News 3, ""Rand Paul could pick up Mitt Romney's fan base in Nevada.""The Real Winner, Of Course: Is anyone who got to monetize this media trope this week!_______________________So what is the 2016 election about this week?Effective governing! The Editors of the Dispatch-Argus, of Moline, Illinois: ""What it is and should be about is effective governing. And while we don’t expect, or even want, Congress to morph into a giant drum circle with members joining hands and singing Kumbaya, we do want them to work together, to be more than a fundraising machine for the next election.""Equality and responsibility! Andrew Beatty, Agence-France Presse: ""While Obama's budget has no chance of being written into the statute books, it will frame arguments about equality and responsibility that are likely to dominate the 2016 race to succeed him as president.""The wealth gap! David Shribman, The Detroit News: ""Indeed, there are two principal unspokens in the run-up to the next presidential campaign. The first is the quiet Republican hope that maverick Sen. Elizabeth Warren will challenge former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from the left in the Democratic primaries. The second is the anguish Republican candidates are having in trying to figure out how to address economic issues. ... At the heart of both of these unspokens is the increasingly apparent wealth gap.""What Time Is Hillary: An UpdateLast week, we parsed the news, looking for signs that pointed to when, exactly, Hillary Clinton might formally announce that she is running for president, as opposed to just persisting under the assumption that a Clinton candidacy was a fait accompli. Our findings? Hillary is definitely running, unless she isn't, and we will definitely know for sure in July and there is absolutely no rush because she is, in the words of an adviser, ""better off as a non-candidate."" Also we learned that ""July"" could mean ""April,"" because words have no meaning and time is relative.So is the matter settled? Of course it isn't. It seems that ""Clinton's advisers are split on when Hillary Clinton should launch her campaign."" You know, almost as if one adviser thinks ""she's better off as a non-candidate"" and a bunch of other advisers contend, ""Dude, why on earth did you say that to Politico?"" As CNN's Brianna Keilar reports:There could be 10 or more Republican candidates by this summer. That might be when Hillary Clinton gets around to officially moving toward a campaign, if she heeds some confidantes, who are privately arguing for an announcement in July to coincide with the start of the third fundraising quarter. Delaying until the summer is an idea that is said to be gaining momentum against those who want to stick to the plan for an April start date.The best part of this report is the part where Keilar writes: ""Democrats on both sides of the debate spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity so they could make their case without upsetting Clinton or those close to her for talking openly about internal deliberations."" I mean, if you're worried about the consequences of ""talking openly about internal deliberations,"" it seems to me that the best thing, for all involved, is to definitely return Brianna Keilar's phone calls. That's just common sense.The Week In PredictionsRand Paul: The National Journal's Josh Kraushaar says that Paul's has a ""getting elected"" problem, in that he ""can't"" get elected, because his ""heterodox views on foreign policy"" are at odds with his party, and more specifically, Iowa voters: ""Even in Iowa, a dovish state where Paul holds strong favorability ratings, the appetite for increased military interventionism against ISIS is high. In a new Bloomberg survey, nearly half of Republicans ranked 'more aggressively pursuing terrorists' as a leading issue out of 10 tested, ranking a close second behind repealing Obamacare."" Also hampering Paul's chances is one of his campaign organizers, A.J. Spiker, is apparently despised by Iowans. According to one Iowa GOP activist, Andy Cable, Spiker is ""toxic"" and Paul ""will get little or no exposure in the rural counties around Iowa, and most of that will be directly related to having A.J. Spiker as his front man.""Jeb Bush: More Iowa problems! Jeb Bush won't win Iowa. But it gets worse! According to Gary Gross, ""It's one thing for Gov. Bush to lose Iowa. There isn't a pundit that's giving him much of a chance of winning Iowa. It's another thing to finish a distant fifth."" It won't be great for the person who finishes fourth, either. (Who will presumably be Rand Paul?)Elizabeth Warren: The Hill contributor John LeBoutillier just lets it all hang out, predicting that Warren ""will run against Clinton in 2016."" He gives 20 reasons for his prediction, some of which are not actual reasons. (Example: ""14. So here is the big question: Will Elizabeth Warren run -- after repeatedly saying she is not running?"")Martin O'Malley: ""Martin O’Malley to rock New Hampshire this St. Patrick’s Day."" We are told that O'Malley's closest advisers are already downplaying the extent to which O'Malley will ""rock"" New Hampshire, in an effort to win ""the expectations game.""Hillary Clinton: Interesting and substantive prediction from Iowa-based Democratic organizer John Deeth: ""If Hillary Clinton is elected president, this will be the last Iowa Caucus."" Bold and weird prediction from MSNBC's Chris Matthews: ""I think she should go for a 55 percent victory, 54 percent victory because then she could bring the House in, she could bring the Senate in, and she could really rule this country. This country needs somebody to get control of it."" Bold and weirdly specific prediction from these people who have started some sort of online petition: ""Hillary Clinton will Announce in New York City on Saturday, July 4, 2015 in Central Park.""Prediction of Doom! Wrongest pundit alive Dick Morris says that ""Scott Walker could win,"" in a devastating blow to Walker's chances of winning.All The Advice That's Fit To AggregateJeb Bush should ""rethink his approach to marijuana policy."" He should also ""leave the race with dignity."" Scott Walker should not let Democrats define him. Marco Rubio should either run for president, or run for the Senate again, or run for governor. Chris Christie needs to watch out for the things that will hurt him, unless they help him -- specifically his vaccine comments (which ""may hurt as much as help in the Iowa 2016 race""), and his ""brash style"" (which may ""be a boon or a bust in 2016""). We'll Leave You With This, Whatever This Is"
