Us Weekly and E! News confirmed the baby news, as well. The ""Imitation Game"" star and the Klaxons rocker married in May 2013 after two years of dating. The Huffington Post has reached out to Knightley's reps for a statement and will update the post if one comes through.Rumors of Knightley's pregnancy first surfaced in November with Star magazine claiming she was 12 weeks along. Then, the actress was spotted at the Moet British Independent Film Awards on Dec. 7 and seemingly confirmed the reports as she firmly stayed away from alcohol. As for motherhood, Knightley made it pretty clear that she isn't keen on giving up her career after welcoming children. “I don’t want to deny my femininity. But would I want to be a stay-at-home mother? No,"" she told Vogue in 2012. ""On the other hand, you should be allowed to do that, as should men, without being sneered at."""

4,RELIGION,Hindu Priest Vows To Convert Hundreds On Christmas Day,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/christmas-hindu-conversions_n_6314002.html,,2014-12-12,"INDIA - DECEMBER 15: Yogi Adityanath, BJP Member of Parliament from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh at Parliament House in New Delhi, India ( Parliament Session Oct-Dec-2008 ) (Photo by Sipra Das/The India Today Group/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f3fc240000500098ad84.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LUCKNOW, India, Dec 12 (Reuters) - A Hindu priest-turned-lawmaker vowed on Friday to convert hundreds of Muslims and Christians to Hinduism on Christmas Day, despite a police investigation into an earlier round of conversions.Religious conversions in multi-faith India are threatening to sow fresh discord as Muslim groups and opposition parties accuse organizations tied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party of trying to undermine the nation's secular foundations.This week, police said they were investigating a case in which Muslim slum-dwellers complained they had been tricked into a Hindu conversion ceremony in Agra, lured by the promise of cheap government rations and voter identity cards.But Yogi Adityanath, a four-time member of parliament from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, said an even bigger ceremony to convert Muslims would be held in the northern town of Aligarh as scheduled and that it was an entirely voluntary affair.""We have been doing this every year for the past 10 years. It's not a conversion, its a homecoming,"" he said, adding that the families signing up for the ceremony were originally Hindus.India's 1.2 billion people are predominantly Hindus. But the country also has some 160 million Muslims and a small proportion of Christians.The constitution grants equal rights to everyone, but critics say hardline Hindu groups have become more assertive since the BJP came to power with a strong election victory this year and that the worst fears of minorities may be coming true.Last week, a government minister apologized for making derogatory remarks about non-Hindus. On Friday, Sakshi Maharaj, another Hindu activist parliament member representing the BJP, withdrew his remarks that the man who shot independence leader Mahatma Gandhi was a patriot.Gandhi was assassinated by Hindu nationalist Nathuram Godse and for years rightwing Hindu nationalist organizations were banned, even though they were exonerated of the killing.Sakshi's remarks touched off an uproar in parliament where opposition MPs refused to allow any business until he retracted.""These people talk of development, but are trying to create a rift in society,"" Hussain Dalwai, a Congress lawmaker said.The BJP denies any bias against minorities but says it opposes appeasement of any community. Modi has said he wants to focus on delivering economic growth for all Indians. But his rivals say he has to rein in the hardliners in his camp who are pursuing a divisive agenda.""These conversions are just the beginning,"" warned Mulayam Singh Yadav, a leader of a regional group. ""If this spreads to other parts of the country, there can be riots."" (Reporting by Sharat Pradhan; Additional reporting and writing by Sanjeev Miglani; Editing by Nick Macfie)"
5,POLITICS,The Budget Fight Was the First Skirmish in the War for the Soul of the Democratic Party,"Richard Kirsch, ContributorSenior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute and Director of Our Story -...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-budget-fight-was-the_b_6314060.html,For the next two years we will see Republicans do everything they can to deliver for corporate America at the expense of the American people. The only question is whether Democrats will enable them. Will President Obama continue to make compromise after compromise?,2014-12-12,"U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, exits after a news conference in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, Dec. 4, 2014. House Republican leaders are close to sealing a deal with Democrats over objections from Tea Party lawmakers to fund most of the U.S. government through September 2015 and avoid a repeat of last year's partial shutdown. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e076240000310098f923.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Progressives lost the battle over the budget last night because President Obama and a minority of Democrats took the side of Wall Street. It is the first of many losses we will see in the next two years as Republicans relentlessly pursue their corporate agenda. The bigger question is whether progressives will lose the war in the Democratic Party.Blowing up this budget deal should have been easy for Democrats. They were handed a perfect message: the Republicans are willing to shut down the government so they can bail out Wall Street the next time it wrecks the economy.Democratic votes were needed because a group of 67 right-wing Republicans opposed the bill on the grounds that it did not go far enough in opposing the president's executive order on immigration. The Republican split gave Democrats the leverage to demand that the bank bail-out provision be stripped from the bill.But with President Obama twisting enough Democratic arms (57 in total) to give in to the Wall Street-engineered Republican blackmail, that powerful, winning message was diluted.Democratic negotiators also agreed to the deal to repeal a provision of the Dodd-Frank law that prevents government bailouts of banks who engage in a form of risky trading. Their argument was ""Republicans made us do it; it's the best we could do."" But of course, with all the Wall Street money going to Democrats, that's a convenient excuse. They can turn around and wink at the lobbyists who deliver Wall Street campaign contributions, playing a game in which the dupes are the American people.The bailout of banks and Wall Street speculators remains deeply and broadly unpopular. It is an issue that generates anger among grassroots activists on the left and the right. For Americans who see Wall Street billionaires getting richer by gaming the system while families struggle to meet the basics, there could be no clearer contrast.Progressive Democrats fought back. In a rapid-fire display of the energy and nimbleness of progressive organizations and champions in Congress, the deal was quickly exposed.Senator Elizabeth Warren laid it out clearly on the Senate floor: ""We put this rule in place because people of all political persuasions were disgusted at the idea of future bailouts... Republicans in the House of Representatives are threatening to shut down the government if they don't get a chance to repeal it.""In the House, progressive Democrats joined the call. California Rep. Maxine Waters, the senior Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said, ""We don't like lobbying that is being done by the president or anybody else that would allow us to support a bill that ... would give a big gift to Wall Street and the bankers who caused this country to almost go into a depression.""The vigorous pushback from progressive groups and their allies in Congress convinced Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to break with the White House. Pelosi said that they were being ""blackmailed"" to vote for the bill, which she called ""a moral hazard."" Still, Pelosi did not use her considerable powers of persuasion to get fellow Democrats to vote no.For the next two years we will see Republicans do everything they can to deliver for corporate America at the expense of the American people. The only question is whether Democrats will enable them. Will President Obama continue to make compromise after compromise? Will Democrats in the Senate use the filibuster to block the Republican attack on working families? Will enough Democrats in the House keep coming to the rescue of a divided Republican Party?We will see the same fight in the Democratic primary for president. Will Hillary Clinton break from the Wall Street wing of the party with which she aligned as a senator from New York? Will her challengers make the same sharp contrast that Senator Warren did, when she began her speech on the Senate floor by asking, ""Who does Congress work for? Does it work for the millionaires, the billionaires, the giant companies with their armies of lobbyists or lawyers? Or does it work for all the people?""As I wrote after the election last month, Democrats who used a populist economic message -- who named the corporate villains and declared that ""we all do better when we all do better"" -- won. Democrats who ran to the mushy middle lost.But this is not just a fight for the soul of the Democratic Party, it's a fight for our very democracy. As Justice Louis Brandeis said almost a century ago, ""We may have a democracy or we may have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we cannot have both.""Americans are yearning for champions who stand up for them. If we have any hope of changing the direction of our economy from enriching the rich at the expense of the rest of us and of recapturing our democracy from the CEO campaign contributors and Wall Street bag men, it will be because progressive forces and elected champions stand up not just to Republicans but to President Obama and any Democrat who takes the side of Wall Street against America's working families.It is clear that progressives and the American people will lose battle after battle in Congress over the next two years. The real question is whether we will lose the war. Cross-posted from Next New Deal"

(Photo by Tibrina Hobson/FilmMagic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb493bd2000009900007cf4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Creed frontman Scott Stapp was hospitalized and placed on a 72-hour psychiatric hold last month after posting a video to Facebook in which he lamented his financial situation. Stapp's wife of eight years, Jaclyn Stapp, had filed for divorce weeks earlier, claiming that the singer's drug use had left him a ""paranoid shell who has threatened to kill himself and harm his family."" Recently, the singer allegedly told his wife that he is a CIA agent on a mission to assassinate President Barack Obama, prompting a call to 911. In a 40-minute recording, obtained by the TMZ, Jaclyn and her sister call for help to report that Stapp is ""very ill"": According to TMZ, Stapp told police that his estranged wife had stolen $6 million and, when he confronted her, she had retaliated by trying to have him committed. Police reportedly determined that the 41-year-old rocker did not show signs of mental instability to warrant another psychiatric hold. Seemingly fixated on Obama, Stapp gave a recent interview in which he blamed the president for his current financial problems.""In 2012 I was doing a promotional tour for my book 'Sinner's Creed' and went on Fox News and expressed a little concern and disappointment with President Obama. Within two months of that public statement, that's when the IRS began to freeze my accounts,"" Stapp said. ""I believe that the IRS situation is definitely a result of me expressing my dissatisfaction with President Obama. Absolutely, 100 percent.""UPDATE:  TMZ reports that Creed singer Scott Stapp has lost custody of his three children, after a Florida judge awarded sole legal and physical custody to his estranged wife.

Interviewed on a Sunday morning talk show in Washington, June 22, 2014, Cheney said he was a strong supporter of going into Iraq in 2003 and remains so now. He dismissed same-day comments by another prominent Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who blamed those who supported military action with emboldening Iran to have a larger presence in the region. Cheney said Rand is an ""isolationist"" who ""doesn't believe we ought to be involved in that part of the world. I think it's absolutely essential,"" Cheney said.

As is the norm whenever a military or intelligence scandal erupts, Cheney has been busy making the rounds on TV news this week, provocatively denying that the methods detailed in the Senate's report truly constitute torture. During an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday, Cheney criticized the Senate Intelligence Committee's findings (""full of crap""), rejecting the claim that waterboarding prisoners -- in some instances as many as 183 times, leading to ""a series of near drownings"" -- is torture. Still, Todd will ask Cheney once more to discuss his thoughts on the report. (Spoiler alert: he probably still thinks it's a ""terrible piece of work"" and a ""bunch of hooey."") ""Cheney will face questions about the CIA’s interrogation techniques and their effectiveness, as well as what the Bush White House knew about the details of the program at the time,"" the press release reads. ""The wide-ranging conversation will also address the state of the Middle East, immigration reform, and the race for 2016."""

He wrote, directed and stars in this film. So all that goes right with the movie is because of him and conversely all that goes wrong with the film is because of him. And a lot does go wrong as the film lurches from one uneven situation to the next.In the film Rock plays comedic actor Andre Allen. He has had a string of successes but now wants to try something different. As is frequently heard, he wants to be taken seriously. He also wants to put behind him his past as a drug and alcohol abuser. He is on the verge of getting married to reality star Erica Long (Gabrielle Union) and has a new serious film in release.While in New York to do press for the film, he agrees to have a tag along interview with New York Times reporter Chelsea Brown (Rosario Dawson). As he talks to the reporter about his past life, the audience gets to view some of the scenes of his downhill plunge. They appear to be funny but they also project a heartbreaking portrait of an artist out of control. This is one of the imbalances of the film. On the one hand it looks like a comedy (though not a terribly funny one), and on the other it is telling a serious story of one man's decline. These two varying viewpoints do not mesh well. Plus too many of the scenes are chaotic and frenzied with people talking over each other at such such a rapid pace that the dialogue is difficult to hear.Rock is very good in the lead role. He gives Andre enough emotion and depth to make him a likeable character. Andre is a victim in the film and this is the way Rock plays him. Dawson is also appealing as the reporter. Chelsea has a secret that comes out in the latter part of the movie and it is believable thanks to the attributes Dawson has provided in her performance.There are tons of cameos in the movie. Some are walk-ons while others have more depth. Sherry Shepherd provides an interesting moment as Andre's former girlfriend, and Cedric the Entertainer is a stand-out as a hack who uses Andre for his own benefits. Jerry Seinfeld and Whoopi Goldberg drop in and drop out quickly.The movie is rated R for profanity and nudity.Top Five does provide an in-depth look at a comedian trying for something new. It strives to make it real and believable, and it succeeds for the most part. The problem is the entertainment factor gets left by the wayside.I scored Top Five a bottomed-out 4 out of 10.

10,RELIGION,3 Lessons for America From Christian Bale's Moses,"Jennifer Danielle Crumpton, ContributorAuthor of Femmevangelical: The Modern Girl's Guide to the Good...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-lessons-for-america-from-christian-bales-moses_b_6315884.html,"Bale's Moses changes dramatically from a strapping, confident and commanding ""prince of Egypt"" -- the typical hero of braun and bravado -- to a wan, confused, tormented, exhausted servant.",2014-12-12,2014-12-12-article247231218E9585500000578165_306x611.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-12-article247231218E9585500000578165_306x611-thumb.jpg,"Earlier this week, I sat down with Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton, Ridley Scott and a handful of religion journalists to talk about Sunday night's New York premiere of Exodus: Gods and Kings. You might guess that a bunch of religion writers tried to school the artists on the religious veracity (or lack) of the movie, or criticize the atheist director's reality-based choices. Not so. In fact, I walked away from the earnest conversation feeling I'd just been blessed with something much deeper than a Sunday school lesson.Only a few men have notably played Moses on the big screen, small screen or stage. Becoming Moses and playing out one of the biggest coups in history surely lends an insight otherwise unattainable at a reader's distance. Listening to Bale talk about his extraordinary opportunity to slip into the skin of Moses and see events from his perspective in order to do the biblical icon justice got me thinking.Bale's performance of Moses, and his personal reflections about the care he took in embodying him, made me wonder what would happen to the narrative if he weren't so curious and open about Moses' authentic perception of both his own story and The Greater Story. It reminded me of the greatest danger to our narrative as a nation: our propensity for not caring to truly get inside the head of the other, not stopping to question our version of the story, not bothering to understand or find value in what seems foreign to us and not acknowledging the surprising truth present in experiences and realities we have not lived ourselves. In other words, usurping universal stories for our own narrow purposes and proofs, and dismissing the lessons that do not match a rigid worldview.Considering our discussion in light of the headlines this week, I came away with three lessons that we can apply to American ideological polarization, political leadership, foreign diplomacy, the latest report on CIA activity, views of the Ferguson and Staten Island tragedies and much more. It is up to you to decide how.1. One person's freedom fighter is another person's terrorist. Bale told ABC's Nightline that Moses in his time was ""...absolutely seen as a freedom fighter. A terrorist in terms of the Egyptian empire. What would happen to Moses if he arrived today? Drones would turn out after him, right?"" He made a quite simple observation about the tumultuous position and brazen actions of his character -- raised in the courts of Egypt and then hand-picked by God to turn and go to dramatic, deadly lengths to free the Hebrew slaves. He referred to the situation in applicable modern language we use today. Yet, rather than stopping to really listen, understand and consider his perspective, the media twisted Bale's comments into treachery and the religious went on the war path.But what is so offensive about recognizing that Moses heard God's voice telling him he was going to torture the oppressors with plagues and kill them off in a series of miraculously strategic initiatives, down to innocent animals and firstborn babies? And God needed Moses to help make it happen. It's what happened, after all. This statement by Bale is not about whether Moses would or would not have ""been thinking about drones,"" as Father Jonathan Morris, a guest on ""Fox and Friends,"" lamely suggested. It is actually about the most profound mysteries of life and deepest quandaries of humanity. Bale actually gets that.When it comes to survival, both physical and ideological, right and wrong start to bleed together. 'Thou shalt not kill' becomes a questionable tactical call or a vulnerability, not God's commandment once the Hebrews were out of Egypt. When interests collide, all bets are off. Does choking to death someone we are trying to subdue make us safer? Does ruthless torture reflect the protection of American values, or make us as bad as our enemies? I'll never forget working on a documentary about international relationships post-9/11, and meeting a teenage girl from Pakistan who knew she would never get married because she lost her leg in a drone strike and was forever marred. Or the child holding a baby in Tora Bora who looked into the camera and asked why the American king killed their civilian parents, leaving them alone, hungry and penniless.In the film, we see Bale's Moses simultaneously awe and reel over the violent terror and death God rains down on even the innocent people of the land under imperial rule. He is both in on it and pissed about it. Unlike other depictions I've seen, the situation in his eyes is not a given for a just or happy ending. We all condemn senseless violence, and today groups like ISIS have certainly taken misguided (pseudo) 'religious' brutality to an unprecedented extreme. 2. We've been demanding the wrong kinds of heroes. Looking to the iconic Great American Hero to lead our fights and protect us, we expect he -- and it's always a he -- to be consistently stoic and strong, unbreakably confident, decisive and sure. He never makes a mistake, changes his mind or admits he doesn't know what to think or do. We tend to demand perfection, or at least the spin to create the appearance of it. Politicians run and win on their records of never changing their stance on issues, which also means they have not thought critically, sought or learned new information, or grown personally and intellectually. Political parties refuse to relinquish a stance, compromise or accept a solution, even when the government is hours from shutting down.Bale's Moses changes dramatically from a strapping, confident and commanding ""prince of Egypt"" -- the typical hero of braun and bravado -- to a wan, confused, tormented, exhausted servant. He agonizes, questions every move, doubts himself, doubts God and yells. He bounces between realities, gets flustered and flounders. He struggles. This is the only way he could save his people: to be open to learning everything as he goes and certain of nothing. This is heroic leadership. And it is not acceptable in our modern mainstream, to our detriment.3. We can't be afraid to look crazy. Bale's Moses really loses it. He's no stoic-heroic Heston, and it is divine. Bale said Moses is ""the most intriguing person I've ever come across... He encompasses virtually every single emotion known to man.""On screen, we see this Moses' inner struggle and his shades of grey... the things we always secretly wonder about. Looking crazy was the only way to get the job done. Both Moses and Jesus seemed insane because they believed the unbelievable, saw the unseeable and did the unthinkable. After sacrificing any sense of comfort or security in life and fighting the good fight, Moses missed the promised land and Jesus went to the cross.What if we were brave enough as a world leader to do the counterintuitive thing? What if the example we set was to do the right thing despite what others do to us, and accept what comes. What if our ""Christian nation"" actually followed Jesus, who said there is no longer such thing as an eye for an eye, which only results in violence and retaliation? Would we die on the cross? Or would we be resurrected into a new life?Will we ever know?It is ridiculous to accuse unifiers, advocates and peacemakers of making our country seem weak... the attempt at finding common ground and making peace is the utmost display of strength. There is something to this loving our enemies thing, that we are promised will pay dividends for the human race. It's what Jesus did in his protest and activism against imperial oppression in his time. But some American Christians want torture, drones, bombs, boots on the ground, tons of guns, stop and frisks, shows of force and towering electric fences, because they are an oddly frightened, distressed moral majority for people who supposedly believe without doubt in an omnipotent, all-powerful God who will deliver them.In America, it seems easy to take our privilege too far and smugly smother our perceived enemies with rigid religious assumptions and warring cries of pre-ordained victory. It seems easy to wonder why black people are angry and tired and have had it, because we are too lazy and self-righteous and certain and distracted and scared shitless to slip into their skin. What if what we think is God's story is actually another story altogether, from a completely different perspective? What if God is every perspective, all together?We tend to conduct ourselves opposite of Moses' wrestling humility and Jesus' fearless empathy. We don't listen and understand before we react, and we refuse to turn the other cheek. Yet the ultimate success of this great experiment of ours will require compassion, critical thinking and compromise. It will require having no skin and every skin.Scott, Edgerton and Bale clearly took the Exodus story seriously, and Scott reiterated that they ""chose to play it as if it were historically true."" The only way Bible stories remain relevant and approach universal truth is if diverse human beings creatively bring them forward into the light of a new day and the hearts of new generations in new and unique ways. In the end, survival is not about controlling the story's outcome, but having faith in it."

He worked to protect wildlife through the National Wildlife Refuge system and to protect marine life through the Marine Mammal Protection Act. George MillerCongressman Miller, the former chair of the House Natural Resources committee, is retiring after serving 40 years in Congress. Miller was a tireless advocate of the environment, especially on the issues of expanding and protection national parks and forests and protecting his state's water supply. Miller was a lead sponsor of the California Desert Protection Act, which created Death Valley National Park, Joshua Tree National Park and the Mojave National Preserve. Miller spent decades working to improve California's water quality, restore fisheries and reduce wasteful water use. Henry WaxmanCongressman Waxman is retiring after 40 years in Congress. During that time, he amassed a long list of legislative accomplishments on behalf of the environment. Representing Los Angeles, Waxman worked from early in his career to reduce the air pollution that plagued his hometown. He was a primary author of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, which addressed urban smog, acid rain and the hole in the ozone layer. Waxman also authored the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Food Quality Protection Act. Waxman was one of the earliest congressional advocates of action to address climate change. He introduced the first climate stabilization bill in congress in 1992 and was the primary author of comprehensive climate and energy legislation that passed the House in 2009. Since then, Waxman has led the Safe Climate Caucus and continued to work for action on climate change.To these three legislative lions, we offer our sincerest thanks and wish you the happiest of retirements."

13,SPORTS,2014 in Sports: 6 Takeaways From the Complicated Year That Was,"Thomas McKenna, ContributorEditorial Fellow, Huffington Post",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2014-in-sports-6-takeaways_b_6316002.html,"However, while it's easy to lament to the failings of our sports fandoms in 2014, there's no denying that there was also a lot of good to come from the past year.",2014-12-12,"New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter (2) reacts after hitting the game-winning hit against the Baltimore Orioles in the ninth inning of a baseball game, Thursday, Sept. 25, 2014, in New York. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb77643220000ba01dd1190.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In many ways, 2014 was a year to forget in the world of sports. The instinct in most fans is to try and use sports as an escape from the problems or bad news of everyday life, but this year sports themselves were often the bearer of bad news. Donald Sterling's skin-crawling racism, Paul George's gruesome and avoidable injury, Tony Stewart's involvement in the death of the young Kevin Ward, Jr., the Ray Rice video, Adrian Peterson's switch, Roger Goodell's all-around incompetence -- we shook our heads at each one of these stories with disgust or disappointment, often both.However, while it's easy to lament to the failings of our sports fandoms in 2014, there's no denying that there was also a lot of good to come from the past year. Here are six ways in which sports inspired us, captivated us and reminded us why we investment the time in them in the first place.We touchingly said goodbye to a pair of living legends in 2014: Derek Jeter and Landon Donovan. When watching the two of them this year, it was obvious Father Time had his grip on both of them. Jeter's average barely hovered around .250 and Donovan was ignominiously left off the United States' World Cup team. Nevertheless, showmen and icons that they both are, each man managed one final memorable moment just before they exited the stage. It'll be a long time before either sport finds a superstar of similar magnitude.There was the collective rush of dousing our cheers with a heavy dose of patriotism during the Winter Olympics and World Cup. T.J. Oshie's marvelous shootout performance against Russia had people clamoring to put him on our currency. Meanwhile, Tim Howard's dominant goal-tending in Brazil earned him a tongue-in-cheek spot in the president's cabinet, as the ""Secretary of Defense."" Although the men's soccer team was bounced in the round of 16, moments like Howard's uncanny saves or John Brooks' goal ensured that this once maligned-sport is here to stay as a domestic force.2014 was also the year of personalities and pioneers, of iconoclasts and trailblazers. Michael Sam and Jason Collins inspired us all this year. Sam became the first openly gay football player ever to be drafted into the NFL and Collins became the first openly gay active NBA player ever. At the Little League World Series, Mo'ne Davis proved ""you throw like a girl"" is actually the best compliment going. As for big personalities, Seattle Seahawks cornerback has that in spades. Bigots and stupid people dismissed his brash and uninhibited comments following the NFC Championship Game as just the ranting of an uppity, angry black man, when in fact they were actually the embodiment of the most fundamental axiom of sports: if you can walk the walk, you're sure as hell allowed to talk the talk.The year's single best game in all of sports didn't come in a championship or postseason tournament, and it didn't feature any real household names (unless you count the two old guys on the sidelines). On February 1st, Duke and Syracuse met at the Carrier Dome for the first time as conference rivals. What followed was an instant classic in every sense of the phrase, a back-and-forth overtime battle that saw the Orange ultimately prevail 91-89. The two teams met in Durham for a rematch later that month. That game was exciting but not as priceless as the first, though it did give us one unforgettable moment, in Jim Boeheim's reaction to a late game charge call.And then there are the moments of individual grandeur, the flights of fancy and raw athleticism that leave us speechless. Thoreau saw the sublime in the ripples of Walden Pond, but I see it in the fingertips of Odell Beckham, Jr. Here are a handful of the most amazing individual plays and performances in sports this year.Another welcome trend in 2014 was the return of the Activist Athlete. Long gone were the days of Mohammad Ali's anti-war stance, Tommie Smith & John Carlos' black fists or Bill Russell's civil rights contributions. Jordan's ""Republicans buy sneakers too"" had become the law of the land. Athletes were supposed to #SticktoSports. Not so in 2014. We had the Clippers turning their warm-ups inside out in silent defiance of racist owner Donald Sterling. The St. Louis Rams receivers entered the Jones Dome recreating Ferguson protestors' ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot"" gesture. And multiple NBA and NCAA teams have recently donned ""I Can't Breathe"" tees in solidarity of Eric Garner. In a year when racial strife and civilian-police relations seem headed toward a fever pitch, it was great to see that sports don't just have to be an escape from our problems -- they can also serve as a challenge to us as a citizenry to be better than what we settle for.Thomas McKenna is a writer whose work has appeared in The Huffington Post, Gawker, Hollywood Take, Sports World News, and Rant Sports.

It's not all Will and Grace for many of us, who face the hard decision of choosing between housing and food -- or our health.December 15 marks the deadline to get health coverage that starts on January 1 in the federal and state marketplaces, and I urge everyone lacking insurance to get covered. I moved back home to San Francisco in 2011 and -- like lots of Millennials after the Great Recession -- I had a hard time finding a job. Working at a restaurant and paying my ridiculous San Francisco-priced rent, I couldn't afford health care after I turned 26 and aged off of my mom's insurance policy. It wasn't until the first Open Enrollment period in October 2013, when Americans could go online and shop for health care plans, that I could finally afford health care for myself. Eighty-five percent of Americans who selected health plans received discounts on coverage. The majority of young adults were eligible to pay less than $100 per month, or less than the cost of a phone bill.This year, young LGBTQ adults who still lack health insurance have another chance to sign up and reap the benefits of coverage. Some of those benefits include free HIV screenings, depression screenings, well-woman visits and preventive services such as pap tests and mammograms.Health care providers cannot discriminate against patients based on sexual orientation and gender identity, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, which is a huge victory for the LGBTQ community.If you haven't already, start shopping at Healthcare.gov or your state health insurance marketplace. And then be sure to see a doctor when you need it, even it means answering questions that seem redundant. Our generation ends up in the emergency room more than any other age group except the elderly, and we can't afford to risk our health -- or our finances.Want more information how the ACA helps the LGBTQ community?

They were held in the ghetto until they could be transported to camps farther east.Nearly 160,000 Jews went through Terezin. Most perished either there or in the death camps of Nazi-occupied eastern Europe. The camp remained in operation from autumn of 1941 till its liberation in May 1945The discovery of the objects, some of which bore their owner's names, was disclosed by the Ghetto Theresienstadt project, which is funded by German and Czech sponsors.""The unexpected finds such as these suggest that an abundance of precious legacies from the ghetto period are still waiting to be discovered in buildings throughout Terezin,"" the group said in a news release.The group said the highlight of the find was the head tefillin, a small black capsule containing a handwritten parchment scroll with the ""Hear, O Israel"" verses from Deuteronomy.Pious Jewish men are obliged to wear tefillin during their morning prayers and the capsules, one for the head and one for an arm, are cherished belongings.The group said the home owners wished to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue among Terezin inhabitants. They discovered the objects while replacing a roof truss in their attic in November.""In their view, the way that the objects were concealed under the beams indicates the great importance that the prisoners gave in hiding their possessions,"" the group said.The Ghetto Theresienstadt projects started in 2012 and is supported by the German Federal Cultural Foundation;, the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation; the Prague-based German-Czech Future Fund; and other groups in Germany and Czech Republic.

That many of these stories turn out to be apocryphal tends to be forgotten as the news media and the citizenry move on to the next sensation.In any case, trying to ban college fraternities is unfair and unwise. Smaller independent social units not controlled by a large bureaucracy serve as environments in which to develop supportive relationships. And most fraternities are safe organizations in which many people develop lifelong friendships. The few bad ones skew the numbers.As Will Kamin, president of Chi Psi at Amherst College, told The New York Times, ""For a lot of these guys, this [his fraternity] is the only place where they can talk openly about their lives and form strong bonds."" And he told CNN that membership ""has taught guys about what it means to be a man and a good man at that."" I confess to having been in a fraternity and, while I'm not a particularly outgoing person, found it to be an edifying experience, surrounded by young people who were, all in all, gentlemen. The majority have gone on to have productive and highly civilized lives. They were pretty nice people back then.Many fraternities also perform civic good works such as raising money for charities (including for the colleges themselves). Dorm living is too amorphous to elicit much of such commitment. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted, the variety of social and civic organizations in America is one of our great strengths.Why punish all fraternities for the actions of a few of their members?There is also the little matter of freedom of association, which a diverse democracy must protect. I suppose that colleges have the right to ban their students from membership in certain groups as a condition of being registered students, but at the risk of undermining the ""diversity'' that leaders of higher education always assert that they favor. (Of course, diversity in colleges doesn't always include diversity of opinion.)Individual fraternities vary about as widely as humans do. As with any organization, it depends on who is in them, particularly their leaders. And the prevention of bad behavior depends on the willingness of college administrations as well as fraternity and sorority leaders to report possible offenses to the police and cooperate with outside authorities in criminal cases. But all too often, crimes by students at colleges are treated as ""internal matters.""Indeed, over recent decades, many college and university administrations have acted to shield students from outside law enforcement. What college administrations should have been doing is to immediately call the police (not the campus cops) if they think that a crime has been committed. Such a stance will, over time, make students much less likely to commit them. Perpetrators must be made to realize that they will be punished.Any institution with large numbers of young people is particularly susceptible to excessive drinking and sexual assault. The Nov. 30 New York Times article ""In the Company of Men: Why is it so hard to prosecute sexual assaults in the military?"" detailed the very serious problems of inadequate reporting and prosecution of sexual assaults in the U.S. military.Some of the cases sound similar to recent fraternity incidents. As in other institutions where these problems persist, vigilant reporting and tough prosecution are essential to achieve long-term improvement.College administrations and faculty should, of course, lecture students on the perils of heavy drinking, sexual assault and so on. Most students, after all, are late adolescents and are presumably in college to learn about how to be responsible adults, and not just from academic courses. But shielding criminal students from the police goes too far. A crime is a crime, whether in the military, in a dorm, in an on-or-off-campus fraternity or anywhere else.Robert Whitcomb (rwhitcomb51@gmail.com) is a senior adviser and partner in Cambridge Management Group (cmg625.com), a healthcare-sector consultancy, a fellow of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy, former editorial-page editor for The Providence Journal (where he remains a columnist) and former finance editor of the International Herald Tribune."

(Photo by Kerry Brown courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox) Joel Edgerton and Christian Bale star Exodus: Gods and Kings.Travel from the north to the south of Egypt and there is a variance of skin color, tan to black. Now, and certainly 3,300 years ago during the time of Moses, the population never looked Anglo. Anyone who has been inside a tomb and viewed paintings of ancient Egyptians sees painted skin that looks brown. Not white. The chances of Egyptian pharaohs and their queens looking like Australians or Italians, is minute. This 2015, historically revisionist glimpse of Egypt with its racial population shift should be greeted with skepticism before the opening credits roll. Exodus: Gods and Kings skips over the strong visual of a Hebrew baby floating in a basket on the Nile. Instead, a grown-up Moses (Christian Bale) has a testy love/hate relationship with his weaker stepbrother Ramses (Joel Edgerton, an Australian who starred in The Great Gatsby). Ramses father Pharaoh Seti (John Turturro, an Italian American, O Brother, Where Art Thou?) has assessed the situation: in a heated battle with enemy forces (The Hittites), if you want to win, you'd choose to be in Moses' army, not Ramses'. Seti favors Moses, and Ramses can feel it.Within minutes, Moses is portrayed as a fighter, an accomplished swordsman; confident and unapproachable. Screenwriters Adam Cooper, Bill Collage, Jeffrey Caine and Steven Zaillian make him bigger than life. He's a Robin Hood, a Ben Hur, a gladiator. It's a persona meant to attract adventure fans to the theater, along with the curious faith-based crowd. Some will find the big screen hero they crave; others might be wary of the grouchy activist they meet. Many will feel something intangible is missing.Moses life takes a turn when he visits a region run by Viceroy Hegep (Ben Mendelsohn, Australian, The Dark Knight Rises) who treats his Hebrew slaves unmercifully and is stealing money from Seti. Nun (Ben Kinglsey), a Hebrew scholar and leader of the slaves, discloses a hidden truth; that the visiting royalty is not the son of Seti's sister Bithiah (Hiam Abbass, The Visitor), he is not Egyptian and that as an infant he was saved from the slaughter of Hebrew newborns. Basically, Nun is saying, ""Dude, you're a Jew."" And not just any Hebrew, you're a savior. Moses laughs it off, but holds that thought. Sometime later, Seti dies. Ramses takes over. Moses true identity is exposed and he is exiled. But oh yes, he returns...Scott's interpretation of what happens next includes a God that appears in the body of a British boy (Isaac Andrews, Hercules), plagues and pestilences that make Ebola look like a sore throat, and Moses returning from a sojourn starting a grassroots gorilla terrorist movement that leads hundreds of thousands of CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) Hebrews across the Red Sea to safety in the Promised Land. And yes, if you studied the Bible, Torah or Quran, you know that the Red Sea has its own special effects department. Scott's Gladiator movie was a huge spectacle built around huge events. The sheer weight of that over-the-top, lavish production did not shroud that story, it embellished it. Pity the director only has one gear. Over-drive. His skill-set overwhelms what should have been a simple, spiritual story about a humble man accomplishing a heroic feat. All Scott's Exodus is missing is Siegfried & Roy, Macy's July Fireworks and someone being shot out of a cannon. Mel Gibson's brutal The Passion of the Christ, regardless of the criticism it deserved, felt authentic. Scott's soulless direction/production does not.Bale is one of the best actors of his generation. His role in the Batman film The Dark Knight is iconic. In 3:10 to Yuma and Rescue Dawn, he proved he could tone his characters down to blend in to smaller productions. He's a brilliant thespian. However, his Moses is a sullen and aloof man who is never compelling. Edgerton, who is dripping in self-tanning lotion, is more convincing as the selfish Pharaoh. John Turturro is totally miscast as Seti and should go back to Brooklyn. Sigourney Weaver, cast as Ramses conniving mom Tuya and Seti's first wife, looks like a white witch and not an Egyptian Queen. Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of the sexually ambivalent Hegep is better fit for a daytime soap opera. Dar Salim, as Ramses' Commander Khyan, is the only one cast in a major supporting role that looks like he was born within 500 miles of Cairo. The cinematography (Dariusz Wolski, Prometheus) is crystal clear and colors pop off the screen. The costumes by Oscar-winning designer Janty Yates (Gladiator) are opulent. The special effects look obvious: A handful of extras posing as 400,000 Hebrews headed for a dip in the Red Sea look very digitally enhanced. The parting of the sea resembles a big tidal wave in Hawaii, and not the way you'd imagined it to look. The over-the-top 3-D spectacle makes arrows fly by your head. War scenes on the level of those in Lord of the Rings erupt. The one saving grace is perhaps the rousing, ultimate chase scene; Egyptians pursuing the Hebrews to the sea. It's disconcerting that Anglo-looking actors got top roles in this film and people of color were regulated to extra parts. But that isn't this film's biggest transgression. Scott and his tech crew have concocted a bombastic production centered on a mythical man that is a prophet in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. When audiences leave the theater they will likely remember the blockbuster battle scenes and not the nuances of the man behind the legend. This film, like Bob Marley's ""Exodus,"" needed a spiritual feel. It has none. Visit NNPA Syndication Film Critic Dwight Brown at DwightBrownInk.com."
