The vote was scheduled to take place on Feb. 14, amid concerns that millions of voters would be disenfranchised by Boko Haram's brutal insurgency, as well as delays in distributing voter ID cards.Election commission chairman Attahiru Jega said Saturday that the vote would be rescheduled for March 28 because security agencies were unable to guarantee safe elections while they focus on battling Boko Haram militants.""We wish to call on all Nigerians to accept this in good faith to deepen democracy in our country Nigeria,"" he said.Earlier Saturday, civil rights groups opposed to postponing elections protested in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, the Associated Press reported.The vote comes at a critical moment for Nigeria. Boko Haram has stepped up its brutal campaign to establish an Islamic caliphate in the country's northeast. More than one million Nigerians have fled their homes amid the slaughter.The conflict has increasingly spilled over into neighboring Cameroon, Chad and Niger, and this week the African Union pledged thousands of troops for a joint force to battle the Islamists.  A protestor holds a banner as Nigerian security forces look on during a protest in Abuja, Feb. 7, 2015. (AP Photo/Lekan Oyekanmi)More from the Associated Press: Officials in President Goodluck Jonathan's administration had been calling for the postponement. Any delay was opposed by Jonathan's chief rival, former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari and his opposition coalition, even though the opposition is expected to take the most votes in the northeast.The United States has been urging Nigeria to press ahead with the voting. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Nigeria two weeks ago and said that ""one of the best ways to fight back against Boko Haram"" was by holding credible and peaceful elections, on time.""It's imperative that these elections happen on time as scheduled,"" Kerry said.The elections had been called early. Elections in 2011 were postponed until April. May 29 is the deadline for a new government to be installed.Supporters of both sides are threatening violence if their candidate does not win. Some 800 people were killed in riots in the mainly Muslim north after Buhari, a Muslim, lost the 2011 elections to Jonathan, a Christian from the south.Analysts say the vote is too close to call in what is likely to be the most tightly contested election since decades of military dictatorship ended in 1999.Jonathan's party has won every election since then but the failure of the military to curb the 5-year Islamic uprising, growing corruption and an economy hit by slumping oil prices have hurt the president of Africa's biggest oil producer and most populous nation of about 170 million."

A recent outbreak of measles has some doctors encouraging vaccination as the best way to prevent measles and its spread. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fa3c250000cf003a0da8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Welcome to this week’s ALL TOGETHER, the podcast dedicated to exploring how ethics, religion and spiritual practice is informing our personal lives, our communities and our world. ALL TOGETHER is hosted by Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, the executive editor of HuffPost Religion and the host of All Together. You can download All Together on iTunes, or Stitcher. “In an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead. The measles had turned into a terrible thing called measles encephalitis and there was nothing the doctors could do to save her.”Those words were written by Roald Dahl, who wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach. As Matthew Herper reported at Forbes.com, Dahl wrote those words about his own daughter who died at the age of 7 in 1962. Dahl was hoping to influence those in the UK to follow America’s example of compulsory immunization that had resulted in measles being virtually wiped out Until recently. In early January, health officials began to trace an outbreak of measles to people who had visited Disneyland. Many of those infected turned out never to have been vaccinated against the disease, which raised the puzzling, and frankly, enraging question of why this is happening when measles had essentially been eradicated in America. The answer is that a rising number of parents choosing to not have their children vaccinated, despite the risks that poses, not only to their own children, but to others around them who for health reasons are not able to be vaccinated. Those who do not vaccinate must ask for a religious exemption or an exemption based on personal belief. This week on ALL TOGETHER Raushenbush and his guests talk into the importance of vaccinations and the role religion is and could be playing. Joining Raushenbush in this important discussion is Dr. Claire McCarthy who is a mother and pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital. In a recent piece on The Huffington Post, McCarthy broke down why this measles outbreak is so worrisome. She writes: Measles is extremely contagious; if someone has it, they will infect 90 percent of the people around them who aren't immunized. It's scary, because measles can be dangerous. 1 in 20 people who get it will get pneumonia. 1 in 1,000 will get encephalitis, a brain inflammation that can lead to seizures and brain damage. 1 or 2 in 1,000 will die.Also joining the discussion is Dr. Robert Klitzman, who is a professor and Director of the Bioethics Program at Columbia School of Public Health. Dr. Robert Klitzman is no stranger to debates on vaccines. He literally wrote the book on it with his book Ethics of HIV Vaccine Trials. Dr. Klitzman’s new book is called The Ethics Police?: The Struggle to Make Human Research Safe and he explains how patients should have agency in their own health care, and that of their children. But, it is equally necessary that doctors explain to the public the importance of protecting society with vaccines. One of the interesting elements of the vaccine debate is how one can apply to be exempt, not just through religious means but through personal belief. Kara Lowentheil, directs the Public Rights/Private Conscience Project at Columbia Law School and explains a bit of the history behind religious exemptions and how they can be used, and abused. And Sally Steenland who is the Director of the Faith and Progressive Policy Initiative at the Center for American Progress, joined Raushenbush to talk about why this is not a religious liberty issue and together they come up with an idea for role religion really should be playing in the vaccination crisis. Jesus commands to love our neighbor as ourselves. This gets to the heart of the vaccination issue. It’s not just about loving your own family. It is also about caring for the well-being of your neighbors and your community. Everyone should vaccinate their children as an act of love."

Zarif's warning has not been previously reported.In a statement posted on the Iranian Foreign Ministry's website, Zarif later denied discussing domestic issues with Western officials.Western officials acknowledged the move may be just a negotiating tactic to persuade them to give more ground, but said they shared the view that Rouhani's political clout would be heavily damaged by the failure of talks.The warning that a breakdown in talks would empower Iran's conservative hardliners comes as the 12-year-old stand-off reaches a crucial phase, with a March deadline to reach a political agreement ahead of a final deal by June 30.The agreement aims to end sanctions in exchange for curbs on Tehran's nuclear program, though hard-to-bridge differences remain, particularly on the timing of the relief on economic sanctions and the duration of the deal.Both U.S. President Barack Obama and Rouhani, who Iranian officials say has staked his career on the deal, are facing stiff domestic opposition to an agreement, narrowing the scope for compromise.The Iranian officials who spoke to Reuters said Zarif had raised the concern over Rohani's fate with Kerry. The two men have met repeatedly in recent weeks in an attempt to break the impasse, most recently on Friday when they talked for over an hour on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference .""As Rouhani is on the frontline, naturally he will be more harmed,"" said one of the officials, who has direct knowledge of Zarif's discussions with Kerry.Other Western officials said the Iranian delegation had raised the same concern in talks recently. If the talks fail, Rouhani would likely be sidelined and his influence dramatically reduced, giving hardliners like Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps an upper hand, Iranian officials and Western analysts say.However, a senior U.S. official denied that Zarif had issued any such warning about Rouhani.""We'll leave assessment of Iranian politics to the Iranians but this rumor is untrue,"" the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.The Iranian Foreign Ministry website quoted Zarif as saying: ""Domestic issues were never raised with foreign officials during any of the meetings."" CONFLICTSA comprehensive nuclear deal is seen as crucial to reducing the risk of a wider Middle East war, at a time when Iran is deeply involved in conflicts in Syria and Iraq. After nearly a year of talks, negotiators failed for the second time in November to meet a self-imposed deadline for an agreement.Iran rejects allegations it is developing the capability to produce atomic weapons. But it has refused to halt uranium enrichment and other sensitive atomic work, leading to U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions that have hobbled its economy.One of the Iranian officials, who also had direct access to the talks, said the Americans were talking in terms of years for the sanctions relief while Iran wanted curbs on oil and banking to be lifted within six months.Rouhani was elected in 2013 on promises of ending Western sanctions, improving the economy and reducing Iran's diplomatic isolation.But he faces a worsening power struggle with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has said Iran should immunize itself against sanctions, suggesting he is prepared to live with them. Khamenei has the final word on any deal.Rouhani has said Iran needs to end its isolation to help its economy, which has also been hit hard by plunging oil prices.Both Israel and Saudi Arabia are suspicious of the U.S. decision to engage with Iran on the nuclear issue. Israel has threatened to use military force against Iranian nuclear sites if diplomacy fails to contain the threat it feels Tehran poses.The United States, officials familiar with the talks say, has already compromised on the issue of how many centrifuges Iran would be allowed to operate.Obama could temporarily suspend many of the harshest unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran but permanent removal would have to be approved by the Republican-controlled Congress, where there is little appetite for sanctions relief.The Senate is finalizing a bill for tougher sanctions if there is no final nuclear deal by June 30. Obama has vowed to veto any new Iran sanctions bill.Another Western official said Rouhani appeared to have underestimated the resolve of Washington and Europe to demand limitations on Iranian nuclear activities for a decade or more in exchange for sanctions relief.""Rouhani thought that by speaking nicely and not calling for Israel's destruction, Western powers would rush to sign a deal, any deal, with Iran,"" the official said. ""He miscalculated. The Western powers may also want an agreement but they're also constrained by Congress, Israel and Saudi.""

I really doubt that,"" said the conservative German leader, who has led western efforts to try to resolve the crisis through negotiations and will travel to Washington on Sunday for talks with Obama.U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, speaking at the same conference, tried to play down differences with Europe, saying he and Obama agreed that no efforts should be spared to resolve the conflict peacefully.But he made clear that Washington stood ready to provide Ukraine with the means to defend itself, saying: ""Too many times President Putin has promised peace and delivered tanks, troops and weapons."" BLANKETS VS TANKSU.S. senators Lyndsey Graham and John McCain, both Republican hawks, were withering in their criticism of the German stance, which is supported by other big European countries like France.""At the end of the day, to our European friends, this is not working,"" Graham said of Merkel's diplomatic efforts. ""You can go to Moscow until you turn blue in the face. Stand up to what is clearly a lie and a danger.""McCain added: ""The Ukrainians are being slaughtered and we're sending them blankets and meals. Blankets don't do well against Russian tanks.""Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula in March last year and evidence that it is supporting separatist forces in the east of the country, which the Kremlin denies, have driven Moscow's relations with the West to a post-Cold War low.The EU and United States have imposed a series of sanctions against Moscow that have contributed to a sharp downturn in the Russian economy.Merkel and her allies in Europe want to continue to punish Russia by tightening the economic screws. Obama faces pressure from members of Congress to do more.In an emotional plea for support in Munich, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko listed the number of troops and civilians that had been killed since the crisis started and held up red passports of Russian soldiers he said had been found fighting in Ukraine.""We are an independent nation and we have a right to defend our people,"" he said, calling for political, economic and military support. Calling himself a ""president of peace,"" he made clear that Kiev only wanted defensive weaponry.He received strong backing from Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, who said Ukraine should be supported ""with all means necessary to defend, not to attack, to defend its people and its territory.""Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, also in Munich, said there were ""good grounds for optimism"" that the talks between Merkel, Putin and Hollande could yield a deal.But Lavrov also delivered a diatribe against the West. He accused Europe and the United States of supporting a ""coup d'etat"" against deposed Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovich, a Moscow ally, a year ago and turning a blind eye to nationalists he said were intent on ethnic cleansing in eastern Ukraine.Hollande, speaking to reporters in the city of Tulle in central France, cast the talks with Putin as a last-ditch effort to avert full-blown conflict.The French leader, Merkel, Poroshenko and Putin are due to hold a call on Sunday, before the chancellor travels to Washington.""If we don't manage to find not just a compromise but a lasting peace agreement, we know perfectly well what the scenario will be. It has a name, it's called war,"" Hollande said. (Additional reporting by Adrian Croft, Lesley Wroughton, Shadia Nasralla, Andreas Rinke & Sabine Siebold)"

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is seen outside the Supreme Court in Washington, on October 8, 2013 in Washington, DC. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Committee, a first amendment case that will determine how much money an individual can contribute directly to political campaigns.

The austerity mindset, embraced by Germany and the International Monetary Fund, is known for imposing austerity, cutting government spending on public services and social benefits, and, finally, Greece had had enough. Voters realized that austerity was only prolonging the economic downturn by reducing the amount of money in circulation. The ""tough love"" posture of austerity makes for virtuous sound bites (""tighten your belt,"" ""fiscally responsible,"" ""balance the budget,"") but it is bad economics. It relies on the false metaphor that household budgeting is the same as budgeting for a nation with its own sovereign currency. The austerity mindset faces a new foe in the U.S. Senate as well. The re-shuffle of the last U.S. election that put austerity-minded Republicans in power has ironically resulted in a new anti-austerity economist being hired by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the Senate Budget Committee -- Professor Stephanie Kelton of the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Professor Kelton is a proponent of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), a very pro-stimulus economic approach. Her hiring represents the biggest step forward for MMT, since the PR coup of the Trillion Dollar Platinum Coin in 2013. At that time, Kelton reportedly created the #mintthecoin hashtag that was featured in columns by Paul Krugman and others.Sanders' hiring of Kelton is a break from the more conciliatory ""balanced budgeting"" approach of some Democrats, such as former treasury secretaries with ties to Wall Street and fiscally-conservative ""deficit hawks."" Kelton and her MMT colleagues go beyond the traditional Keynesian stimulus of short-term deficit spending. They seek to unleash the power of monetary policy to circumvent the scarcity mindset imposed on government action, perhaps even bringing the Trillion Dollar Coin back into the discussion. Kelton and her fellow MMTers would support types of stimulus that would direct money toward the 99 percent through policies, such as a universal jobs guarantee, that would wipe out systemic unemployment, or investments in the trillions of dollars in delayed infrastructure maintenance needs. This stands in contrast to Quantitative Easing (QE) as used by previous Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, which propped up the banking sector by purchasing bank assets, such as treasury notes or mortgage backed securities, and was a boon to the financial sector, but not to most people. Besides helping people in poverty, MMT-style economic stimulus can also be better for the planet. Environmental issues get less attention in an economic downturn when opponents use, ""We can't afford it,"" as an excuse for not tackling big issues. ""The economy"" (like wars in the Middle East) can take up all the available bandwidth for public discourse. MMT-style policies would alleviate the budget constraint, and allow for greater public goods spending, which may be needed to prevent a crash if, and when, market analysts finally factor in the $27 trillion in un-burnable carbon that currently sits on the fossil fuel companies' balance sheets. Each new pension fund or campus endowment's divestment from fossil fuels raises awareness of the huge market risk of fossil fuel companies and the coming liabilities for carbon fees and purchasing permits once carbon pricing is adopted. Rather than letting the carbon bubble, and crashing demand for fossil fuels bring down the economy, MMT would encourage a robust government response. An important caveat is that sustainability requires tying stimulus efforts to economic reforms that decouple carbon emissions from economic growth. This can be accomplished with an economy-wide carbon cap, an escalating price on carbon and returning the revenues back to households. Senator Sanders understands this because in February 2013 he and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) proposed an upstream fee on carbon emissions, with three-fifths of revenues refunded to residents as a Family Clean Energy Rebate.Senator Sanders is in the minority party in the Senate, but his impact leading up to the 2016 election may be how he affects the debate inside the Democratic Party. In appointing Kelton to this position, Senator Sanders is providing an opportunity for the public and the media to hear new ideas for how government can play an active role in facing the challenges of the 21st century, including: climate change, infrastructure and care for the poor and elderly. Saving the planet is going to take money, so we need a type of economics that gives us the power to create it."

It has been on my mind lately, because the other two people involved have long since passed, and I'm thinking I had better start sharing those moments for others to carry on. The memory is simple: many people are gathered in a tight crowd. My mother is holding my hand as we make our way through it. Somebody is speaking. My mother stops. She lets go my hand, grabs my chin, and turns my head towards the speaker. ""See that man?"" She asks. ""He is a great man."" That man was César Chávez. President Obama Speaks at Chávez monument dedication, White House Photo.I haven't yet visited Nuestra Señora Reina de la Paz, which, since 2012 has been protected as César E. Chávez National Monument, but I plan to go and pay my respects to the peaceful man. I want to understand the sense of place, why it was his ""spiritual harbor."" I'm glad that the president set aside his place of refuge and final resting place for the world to learn about, and reflect upon, a significant part of American history and civil rights for laborers. My mother would be glad, as well as many other Latinos like her, who knew what it meant to labor in the fields California before the United Farmworkers' Movement came along. But I am also remembering my moment with Mom and César Chávez for another reason: I am angry. I am angry that the very Antiquities Act, which gives presidents power to set aside National Monuments, is about to be gutted. I am angry that this executive power, designed to cut through the slow wheels of Congress and administrative bureaucracy to save places of historical and scientific interest, will evaporate if some members of Congress have their way. The Marine Access and State Transparency Act (H.R. 330) and National Monument Designation Transparency and Accountability Act (S. 228) are House and Senate bills that would strip Presidents of the power to designate National Monuments, and also require a waiting period before any protections can be put in place on congressionally declared monuments. Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho, who introduced S. 228, claims that the bill is intended to inject ""local input and support"" into the process of designating monuments, by eliminating an alleged ""top down"" approach. What he absolutely fails to recognize is that in 2011, President Obama had already determined to ""engage the public to identify and recommend potential sites on existing federal lands for protection under the 1906 Antiquities Act."" Proponents of the bill also ignore that the president has, in fact, been listening to the public. Latino communities have been directly involved in encouraging the president to designate Rio Grande del Norte National Monument, Organ Mountains Desert Peaks National Monument and the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument, a January 27 article, Judith Kohler of the National Wildlife Federation cites example after example of public engagement in monument designation, and concludes that:All the public, grassroots support would mean little if a president, who, after study and listening to community requests, would still have to win congressional approval... After all, congressional gridlock and ideological objections to conserving public lands are the reasons people to push for action under the Antiquities Act in the first place.So, what is really behind the desire to eliminate the president's power to protect our heritage? Introduced last month, the bills' timing is significant. Now, while the oil and gas industry has plans to drill its claws deeper into more of our beautiful homeland in the American west, Congress is doing its own dirty work. Perhaps proponents of the bills fear that presidents will protect treasured cultural and natural sites when they are about to be overrun by the greed and speed of petroleum development, or other extractive industries. They certainly intend to keep our presidents from doing so. As former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt describes it:The crusade against America's public lands is now a national effort, sponsored and produced behind-the-scenes by sophisticated lobbyists funded with torrents of cash from the oil and gas industry, the largest lobby in Washington.What it boils down to is an already wealthy industry run by some of the wealthiest people in the world wanting to take it all. What is wrong with balancing the damage our industries do by protecting the real fabric of this land, the stuff that can't be sold, the stuff that makes us who we are? Why shouldn't we protect our fishing streams or mountain lakes, historic houses or ancestral dwellings? If it takes a president to protect a place, so what? Any president will do. Even George W. Bush designated National Monuments; he designated a vast area of the Pacific, vaster at that time than all the national parks put together, while protecting subsistence fishing and the traditional cultural uses of Native Hawaiians in that area. He also protected a small place, the African Burial Ground, in the costly real estate of Lower Manhattan. President Bush signs a proclamation creating the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. White House Photo.Perhaps I am not so angry as I am sad. I think about all the places that we value, and how little those values mean to the people who are attacking our public lands. I think about the places such as Chaco Canyon that might have been completely looted, or things that might have decayed away if they weren't protected, like the Statue of Liberty. National Monuments are about the entire nation's legacy in all its human history and biodiversity. They are memories and living places we hold in trust for the future. We must now protect the Antiquities Act."
15,TASTE,The Worldwide Market for Wine and Spirits Looks... Tentative,"John Mariani, ContributorPublisher of ""Mariani's Virtual Gourmet Newsletter"" and award-...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-worldwide-market-for-_b_6630162.html,These are neither the best of times nor worst of times for the global wine and spirits markets.,2015-02-06,2015-02-06-GuillaumeDeglise_033_redimensionner_1.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-02-06-GuillaumeDeglise_033_redimensionner_1-thumb.jpg,"These are neither the best of times nor worst of times for the global wine and spirits markets, but it is a time of uncertainty about the economy, politics and societal changes that make predictions about the future more difficult than it's been in a long time.For while the 1980s and 1990s were a period of soaring expectations--and not a little hype--it did seem the whole world was becoming more interested and could better afford to buy more wine and spirits than at any time in history. Then came 9/11, the debacle of 2008, the economic collapse of Greece, Ireland and Spain, and increasing terrorism in major cities, topics to be discussed at the VINEXPO trade show in Bordeaux this summer (below).To an extent, wine and spirits sales overall are still rising, but the future is anything but certain. Vodka still dominates spirits sales, and whiskies and bourbons are projected to rise 8.8% and 19.3% respectively over the next five years. These and a great deal more data have just been released by the IWSR, a forty-year old marketing company that tracks brand performance in 125 countries across the world using local market input from distributors, importers, producers, retailers, duty-free and gray operators in each country. To find out the effects of all these data, I had a conversation by phone with Guillaume Deglise (below), CEO of Vinexpo, which commissioned the IWSR report, to ask which and how forces will drive the market in 2015 and beyond. Q. Your new report makes much of the impact of the Asian market on global sales, but there is also some caution in it.A. While 2013 growth in the region has been curtailed by the Chinese government's anti-corruption legislation, five-year forecasts remain positive at about 3.5% growth. Cognac and Armagnac have found new markets in Asia, and sales rocketed by 19% from 2009-12 and are expected to grow annually at a 3% rate. But there too the Chinese have been forced to cut back. Right now Asia-Pacific accounts for 63% of the world's total spirits consumption. Q. Which categories are showing the most growth in spirits?A. Premium whiskies and Kentucky bourbons are back in vogue, with Russia, Brazil, Mexico, India and Poland driving forces outside of the U.S. Vodka is still number one in sales but that's leveling out now. Baijiu, a spirit like vodka made and mostly consumed in China, is the number one best seller of all. Q. Are the current sanctions against Russia and falling oil prices going to hurt the Russian market?A. Russia is difficult to predict. Vodka is still the best-selling spirit there, but the younger generation does not want to pursue the same habits of their elders. They are much more open to spirits from outside Russia.Q. What about the weakening of the euro? How will that affect global sales of European wines and spirits?A. The industry has, as a result of the stronger dollar, become much more competitive than in the past. A strong dollar translates to lower prices for French, Italian and Spanish wines and spirits, which offers clear advantages on the international scene. I don't think export will be much affected through 2016 but that depends on the future value of the euro. Q. Do you think some producers in Europe will try to make up for the falling price of the euro by hiking their own prices?A. It will depend on the price category of each wine and on the stocks available. If there is a lot of stock, they won't push prices up; they'll look to improve their margins. Remember, the U.S. is still the largest consumer of wines and spirits in the world. Some producers of very high-end, rare wines and spirits may raise their prices. Q. What about sparkling wines?A. Sparkling wines (excluding Champagne) accounted for 8% of the world's wine consumption - and are expected to rise to 8.9% by 2018. Spanish cava sales, spurred by growth in imports to Belgium, Nigeria and France, escalated by more than 100,000 cases in 2013. In that same year Italian prosecco sales doubled. Q. Has this hurt Champagne sales?A. I used to work for Champagne, so I know it well, and consumption has dipped--1.4% globally in 2013-- as consumers everywhere look to cheaper alternatives like prosecco and cava. Outside of France, Champagne is perceived as very high priced, only for special occasions, but I believe it still has a quality that cannot be matched, and grape prices in Champagne are very high. Even though French consumption is down, they continue to drink Champagne because they have access to many more inexpensive labels. Champagne sales are increasing, however, in the U.K, U.S, Australia and Japan. Q. What about wine consumption?A. Red wine continues to dominate, representing 54.8% of all still wine consumed in 2013. Reduced demand, primarily in China--where more than 90% of wine consumed is red--drove worldwide consumption down by 19.8 million cases. Rosé sales are going up nicely, by about 9%.Q. Recent reports indicate that the business lunch has not only declined in importance because have so little time and are forced to eat at their desk, but that when they do dine out they order less and cheaper wines. Do you see that in France, too?A. Oh, yes, there is a big change in consumption patterns everywhere. Business people don't take as much time to enjoy lunch, and they drink less, though they drink better wines. Not the high-end labels, however, because the executives cannot be seen showing off to their clients the way they once did. Expense accounts have been cut and, as you know, we are still in a deep economic crisis in Europe.Q. Is there a bright spot somewhere in that?A. Yes, the younger generation, especially in France, is spending more time in wine bars and bistros. The sales are now being driven by them."

The document states all administrators, faculty and staff, including non-Catholics, will be required to refrain from saying or doing anything publicly that contradicts church doctrine.That has prompted criticism from within the school community and among gay rights activists.""The new 'moral clauses' proposed ... by Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone stands in stark relief to the message of inclusion being promoted by Pope Francis,"" Lisbeth Melendez Rivera, a director of in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Religion and Faith Program.Cordileone stressed that the handbook additions are meant to provide clarity for teachers and not to target any for dismissal.""The intention is certainly not to pry into the private lives of the teachers. We certainly aren't going to do that. People are entitled to their private lives, but teachers also have to respect the mission of the school in the way they live their public lives,"" he said in a in a YouTube video posted as school principals presented the changes to teachers Tuesday.The four schools — Archbishop Riordan and Sacred Heart Cathedral Prep in San Francisco, Marin Catholic in Kentfield, and Junipero Serra in San Mateo County — enroll about 3,600 students and are among a handful of Catholic schools nationwide with teachers represented by a labor union.Archdiocesan Federation of Teachers President Lisa Dole, a social studies teacher at Marin Catholic, said union members were still digesting Cordileone's statement and hoped to have a better sense of what it bodes for teachers Friday, when the archbishop is scheduled to answer questions at a meeting of faculty and staff.""We are pleased that the document acknowledges that the teachers in our high school are not all the same, like many Catholics around the world who struggle with their adherence to some of the teachings of the church,"" union leaders said in a statement. ""However, there are still concerns with the proposed language and some key issues that the union and archbishop are hopeful that we will be able to work out.""Catholic bishops in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Honolulu and Oakland, California, aroused concern within their dioceses last year when they added clauses to teachers' employment contracts listing the behaviors they were expected to adhere to.Since schools under his direct control are unionized, Cordileone does not have that ability. But he has proposed that the contract being negotiated identify all school employees as ministers of the church — a change gay rights groups said would put teachers who not adhere to the beliefs in the handbook at risk of firing.The U.S. Supreme Court has exempted churches and religious schools from having to abide by federal anti-discrimination laws for employees in ""ministerial roles.""Liberal San Franciscans have viewed Cordileone with suspicion even before he was installed as archbishop in October 2012. As the auxiliary bishop in San Diego, he helped spearhead the passage in 2008 of a state constitutional amendment that had outlawed same-sex marriage in California. Since 2011, he has chaired the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops subcommittee that works to oppose same-sex marriage nationwide."

Williams will succeed Tom Brokaw as anchorman of NBC's ""Nightly News,"" as NBC becomes the first of the three networks to announce a succession plan for their chief anchors. (AP Photo/Diane Bondareff, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c4d22400005000567eb2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- NBC News continued to reel on Friday in the wake of revelations that ""Nightly News"" anchor Brian Williams misled the public about his experiences reporting on the Iraq war and as his Hurricane Katrina coverage came under fresh scrutiny.NBC News president Deborah Turness, who has not publicly commented since Williams’ on-air apology Wednesday, told employees in a memo Friday afternoon that the network had assembled “a team dedicated to gathering the facts to help us make sense of all that has transpired.”The network’s decision to investigate Williams comes nearly two days after the onslaught of questions and social media criticism began. Williams apologized on-air Wednesday night for falsely claiming during a broadcast the previous week that his helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade in March 2003. But Williams has not explained how his version of events shifted dramatically over the course of 12 years and several Iraq War veterans have since disputed whether he was anywhere near the attack. Williams appeared to have been thrown a life preserver Thursday when Rich Krell, an Iraq veteran who claimed to have flown Williams’ helicopter in Iraq, told CNN that the aircraft came under small arms fire, though not anything as heavy as an RPG. But after other crew members disputed his account, Krell told CNN he could no longer trust his memories of that day’s events. The internal investigation will be led by Richard Esposito, who heads NBC’s investigative unit, according to the Daily News. Reached on Friday, Esposito referred HuffPost to a network spokeswoman who declined to comment. The New York Post reported that in addition to Williams' work on the Iraq war, the probe will involve his coverage of Hurricane Katrina, which has also faced criticism in recent days. The New Orleans Advocate raised questions Thursday about Williams' claims that he saw dead bodies floating in the French Quarter, which sustained less flood damage than other parts of New Orleans since it's on higher ground, and that he contracted dysentery after the storm.In the memo, Turness said that she and Williams addressed the “Nightly News” team Thursday night and a larger group of colleagues Friday morning. “Brian apologized once again, and specifically expressed how sorry he is for the impact this has had on all of you and on this proud organization,” she wrote.Turness said the network is now trying to figure out “what the best next steps are – and when we have something to communicate we will of course share it with you.” While management may not be revealing more until the investigation concludes, the Williams controversy is the talk of 30 Rock. Staffers are questioning whether he can weather the media storm and if he has enough allies to keep in him in the anchor desk. Some at the network have speculated that former “Nightly News” anchor Tom Brokaw isn’t a fan of Williams and has been particularly upset about his successor’s admittedly false claim about his Iraq war reporting. Brokaw pushed back against a New York Post story claiming he wanted Williams fired, but notably didn’t offer his own statement of support. ""I have neither demanded nor suggested Brian be fired,"" Brokaw said in an email to The Huffington Post. ""His future is up to Brian and NBC News executives."""

As an African American woman, McBride's death deeply affected me. Nineteen-year-old McBride was shot and killed while seeking help on the porch of Theodore Wafer, a 55 year old white man, in a Detroit suburb, following her car accident in the pre-dawn morning hours of November 2, 2013. McBride's loud knocks on Wafer's door were answered by him with a single 12 gauge shotgun bullet to her face. He then called 911. On August 7, 2014, Wafer was convicted for the murder of Renisha McBride and later received a sentence of 17 to 32 years.I remember Renisha McBride as she was black, a woman and human. She did not deserve to die for banging on a door for assistance from what should have been a Good Samaritan. Her story reminds me of the phrase that ""there but for the grace of God go I."" I am Renisha McBride. I now realize, at any time, I could meet her fate, simply for seeking help from any one of my white neighbors, under similar circumstances. Many African Americans understand the plight of black men when it comes to racial stereotypical profiling and meeting a tragic and undeserved violent death. McBride's death sadly reminds us that same fate is available for black women.While the case of Renisha McBride captivated me, many media outlets gave it scant coverage. And some outlets that did cover her case treated her with anonymity, often referring to Wafer as the ""porch shooter"" without naming McBride. Ms. McBride was not a porch- an inanimate object. Wafer did not shoot the porch. He shot and killed a vibrant young black woman. When the jury delivered the verdict on August 7, 2014, the Associated Press initially tweeted that ""Suburban Detroit homeowner convicted of second degree murder for killing woman who showed up drunk on porch."" The AP's tweet makes Wafer seem respectable as a ""Suburban Detroit homeowner"" and demeans and blames McBride for being a drunk on his porch. Renisha McBride deserved better. And Black Twitter quickly responded with thehashtag #APheadlines --causing the AP to reword and change its wording of McBride from drunk to reflect that she was unarmed.We must use our collective efforts to break down and eliminate black stereotypes in the media. Those stereotypes of super human strength and size, up to no good, victim shaming and blaming devalue the lives of blacks in the media. We must call out the media whenever it fails to recognize black women as human. As a society, we are losing our moral compass when a stranger -- a young black woman needing help, cannot expect to receive a 911 call from another stranger, a white man. While the prosecution and defense said the case was not about race, as a former prosecutor, I beg to differ. Wafer heard loud banging and saw a shadowy black person on his porch in that fateful early pre-dawn hour. He also potentially saw all the stereotypical associations of blacks -- up to no good, stronger than King Kong, violent and countless other derogatory stereotypes used to describe blacks. And Wafer likely acted upon those stereotypes. Wafer's actions are representative of a continuing and growing pattern and practice of stereotypical racial profiling leading to blacks being killed. By breaking down black stereotypes in the media, some black lives might be saved.We cannot bring back Renisha McBride. We must bring light and life to her story so by telling and re-telling the story another Renisha McBride might survive. McBride, a cheer leader in high school, graduated from Southfield High School a little more than a year before her untimely death. She loved having fun with her family, parents, sister and friends. Renisha McBride was black, a woman and human. She deserved to be alive today. Her life and black women's lives matter.This post is part of the ""28 Black Lives That Matter"" series produced by The Huffington Post for Black History Month.
