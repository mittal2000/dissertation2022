Rowling certainly seems to thinks so.,2015-08-07,"Katie Sola - Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a686c41300001400939930.jpg?ops=100_100,"The inspired world of Harry Potter fandom has blessed us with a truly magical joke.Author J.K. Rowling celebrated her 50th birthday on July 31, and good wishes poured in from her 5 million Twitter followers. Including this gem: In the series, Firenze is a centaur who lives in the Forbidden Forest on the grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He teaches divination at the school, saves Harry's life when Voldemort attacks him and fights in the Battle of Hogwarts. The centaur colony banishes him for helping humans.In other words, he's a pretty good friend.Rowling was amused by the joke.Thank you, Rowling, for taking a break from shutting down misogynist bullies and slamming Serena Williams' critics to identify the Chosen Pun.CORRECTION: This article previously stated that Firenze taught divinity at Hogwarts when in fact he taught divination."
1,POLITICS,Tea Party Lawmakers' Reported Affair Cover-Up Is Being Investigated,Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/todd-courser-cindy-gamrat-cover-up_us_55c4d3d7e4b0f1cbf1e4bd7b,State rep allegedly wanted to distract from affair with fake story about gay sex.,2015-08-07,<p>Michigan tea party state House Reps. Todd Courser and Cindy Gamrat reportedly tried to cover up their relationship.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c4dc931400002e002e24d5.jpeg?cache=VReGO2h546&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A report that a Michigan state House representative planned to cover up his affair with a colleague by planting a fake sex scandal story will be investigated, House leaders said.The Detroit News published recordings Friday in which they identify Rep. Todd Courser (R) telling a staffer about his affair with fellow tea party Republican Rep. Cindy Gamrat. Both are married and have children. In the recorded May 19 meeting, Courser instructs aide Ben Graham to send an anonymous mass email to Republicans that would accuse Courser of paying for sex with a man behind a Lansing nightclub. The false story was intended to minimize the blowback if the affair between Courser and Gamrat were later revealed.“I need to, if possible, inoculate the herd against gutter politics that are coming,” Courser says in the recording given to the paper by Graham. The aide refused to send the email and was fired last month along with Gamrat staffer Keith Allard. According to The Detroit News, Gamrat agreed to Courser’s plan. House Speaker Kevin Cotter (R) issued a statement Friday saying he had asked the nonpartisan House Business Office to ""review the matter and determine whether there was a violation of House rules or any evidence of illegal behavior.""The News reports that Courser wanted Graham to claim he was sick the day he sent the email. A follow-up meeting that included Gamrat reportedly overlapped with a committee meeting Courser was scheduled to attend, the outlet noted. Other former aides said the representatives' relationship affected their job performances. “We will not stand for any violation of House rules or law, and we will not let anyone's actions tarnish this institution,” Cotter said.U.S. Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.) has called on Courser to resign.Courser ""has proven to be completely unfit to represent the hardworking residents of Lapeer County, using taxpayer dollars to abide and assist his gross misconduct,"" she said in a statement. ""This behavior is a slap in their face, especially from someone who presents himself as a moralist.""In the Detroit News recording, Courser reads a version of the email he wants Graham to send. It is similar to an email published by a Michigan political blog that was reportedly sent the following day and calls Courser a “bi-sexual porn addicted deviant” and a “gun toting bible thumping cock sucking freak."" The email also accuses Gamrat of helping cover up Courser’s behavior and calls her a ""tramp."" Gamrat told The Detroit News she wouldn't discuss staffing issues, while Courser confirmed the voice on the tape was his but wouldn't comment on it further. They were both elected to the House last year and have shared resources and staff. Cotter removed Gamrat from the Michigan House Republican caucus in April for allegedly breaking caucus confidentiality rules. Courser and Gamrat are both strong supporters of traditional marriage. After the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of same-sex marriage in June, Courser said it was a “crushing day for those who believe in traditional marriage and traditional morality.” In advance of the ruling, he introduced legislation that would prevent anyone other than clergy members from performing marriages. Courser's aide, Graham, told his boss it would be better for the lawmaker to quit or admit to the affair. In a text message to Graham published by the News, Courser says he doesn’t think resigning is “the way to go down.”“We decided to destroy ourselves,” Courser says in the recording. “If this is the lead-in, we go for the sham, the scam.”In his campaign announcement last year, he shared a different point of view.“The best way to right the course for our state is to provide leadership that will again earn the public’s trust,” he said.

Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) got a backhanded compliment from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who lauded him as ""honest enough to call himself a socialist."" Even former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo (D), whose tenure ended in 1994, merited a mention.But most of the GOP field? Not so much.A few Republicans did take on Donald Trump after the moderator directly asked for their opinions, with former Texas Gov. Rick Perry disparaging him for ""using his celebrity rather than his conservatism,"" and businesswoman Carly Fiorina challenging him to define his governing principles.Other than that, however, the lone bit of genuine infighting during the debate came from Jindal. After delicately sidestepping an opportunity to criticize fellow candidate and Ohio Gov. John Kasich by name for taking federal money for Medicaid expansion, he came out swinging against former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whom he said was advocating for Republicans to ""hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.""(Fiorina also took on Bush after the debate, telling Bloomberg that the former governor’s comments on women's health issues were ""foolish."")But the rest of the Republicans, who will be debating later Thursday night, weren’t mentioned at all in the early debate. While Perry mentioned a few of his fellow low-polling candidates by name, he was mostly complimentary: He cited Lindsey Graham's hawkishness on Iran, suggested Fiorina might replace John Kerry as secretary of state, and, of course, lauded his own jobs record in the third person.The final tally of how often each politician was directly mentioned by a candidate during Thursday’s early debate, per the transcript:Barack Obama or Obamacare: 20Hillary Clinton: 14Donald Trump: 6Joe Biden: 1Bernie Sanders: 1Jeb Bush: 1Scott Walker/Ted Cruz/Mike Huckabee/Ben Carson/Marco Rubio/Rand Paul/Chris Christie/John Kasich: 0For more GOP debate coverage, visit our liveblog.Also on HuffPost:"

Jerry Brown (D) said the intense wildfires blazing across the state are part of a ""new normal"" spurred by rising temperatures and drought.The governor met Thursday with firefighters who are battling Northern California's Rocky Fire, which has burned nearly 70,000 acres in Lake, Colusa and Yolo Counties, destroyed dozens of structures and forced thousands to evacuate. That fire is now 45 percent contained. Speaking at a press conference, Brown said the fire should serve as a ""wake-up call"" for the entire state.""The fires are changing. The drought over the last several years has made everything drier,"" Brown said. ""People can argue about how much of that is climate change, but we know the annual temps are going up over the last 50 years.""""I think this is really a real wake-up call because of the way this fire performed,"" Brown continued. ""It's a new normal. We're going to get ready. We have resources, we'll need more, but you can be sure that the California firefighting personnel and all their different departments are ready and we're going to do everything we possibly can.""Brown's remarks come less than a week after he declared a state of emergency in order to free up more resources to battle the wildfires.""California's severe drought and extreme weather have turned much of the state into a tinderbox,"" Brown said in a statement last Friday. ""Our courageous firefighters are on the front lines and we'll do everything we can to help them.""As of this week, more than 10,000 firefighters are battling 24 major fires across California. While wildfires are common during the state's typically dry, hot summers, the historic drought plaguing the West coast has exacerbated the fires and made it more difficult for emergency workers to contain them. According to state data, there have been nearly 1,500 more fires this year than the average number during the same period over the last five years."

12,ENTERTAINMENT,Zebra Katz Carves His Own Path To The Limelight,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zebra-katz-interview-lollapalooza_us_55c3a4a7e4b0923c12bbf8ff,And he's changing the music industry.,2015-08-07,"<p>Zebra Katz performs at Soho House Chicago on July 31, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c3a7171d00002f00144119.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Brooklyn rapper Zebra Katz takes to a stage, it’s impossible to turn away from his piercing gaze.Such was the case last Sunday when Zebra Katz played an early afternoon set at Chicago’s Lollapalooza. With massive trees protecting the area from the blistering August sun, he stalked, pounced and growled his way through songs ranging from his scathing new EP, “Nu Renegade,” to his better-known tracks, particularly the forever-fresh “Ima Read.”All the while, the crowd gathered around the stage continued to grow in size to the point where Zebra Katz, clad in an all-white ensemble, ended his set off-stage, rapping while surrounded by his fans. The fourth wall had definitely been broken, and yet, the spell he held his audience under had not.Three days earlier, Ojay Morgan, the man behind the “character” of Zebra Katz, sat in the basement of Berlin, where he was headlining the Chicago nightclub’s annual pre-Lollapalooza “side show.”While he spoke with the same wit and conviction familiar to anyone who’s ever taken in a Zebra Katz performance, Morgan clearly occupies a different space in the world than Zebra Katz, which makes it difficult to put a finger on what Morgan is all about -- and this appears intentional. “Zebra Katz has a bigger bank account than I have, that’s the difference,” Morgan told The Huffington Post. “It’s really good to have a veil. Like Andy Warhol said, you should always have something to sell and I’m not selling myself, I’m selling a product. I’m selling a brand, selling a lifestyle and it’s not myself. That’s the comfort I have.”The Zebra Katz ""brand,"" which grew out of a performance piece Morgan first presented while a student at Eugene Lane College, hit the indie mainstream in 2012 with the release of “Ima Read,” a song that attracted the attention of the music and fashion world elite.Since then, Zebra Katz has remained prolific, releasing a steady stream of mixtapes and videos while traveling around the world performing live sets that are just as intense, if not more so, than the material they are drawn from. Over the past year, he’s played shows in Spain, Switzerland, Germany and Japan. Last week, while spending time in Jamaica with his family -- his parents are Jamaican -- he was stung by a jellyfish. But throughout that time, Morgan has still yet to release a full-length album as Zebra Katz and has also expressed frustration with how his music has often been lumped in with that of artists like Le1f, Mykki Blanco and Cakes da Killa as a sort of New York-born queer rap ""revolution."" “I’m completely against the genre-ization of [a 'queer rap scene'] because it’s really fucked up,” Morgan, who identifies as queer, said. “I think as artists we have so much more to offer than a blanket sexuality that most people think is helping us sell music because it’s not. For some, it may, but it’s not in my music and not in my aesthetic.”Instead of pursuing a more traditional path through the music industry, Morgan has taken an almost completely independent route, releasing his own music and doing his own publicity -- he may have been the only artist playing Lollapalooza who listed himself as his own media liaison.But all that’s not to say Morgan doesn’t play well with others. For his “Nu Renegade” EP, released in May, he worked with London-based Iran-born producer Leila Arab, a frequent Björk collaborator Morgan met at a show of his. The result is a collection of six songs that are dark and sexy, sparse yet overwhelming and occasionally challenging to listen to. All of the songs, too, have accompanying videos which are being released once-a-month up until the final three, which will comprise a mini-film of their own.The latest, the video for the EP-opening “Blk Diamond,” is as disturbing as it is explosive. The track itself brings together elements of rap, trip-hop, electronic and industrial music, like a mix of Grace Jones, the Haxan Cloak and Tricky at their strangest.“We think it isn’t one of the ‘nicest’ EPs to come out this year,” Morgan admitted of ""Nu Renegade."" “It’s really brutal and I think that’s kind of just the reflection of our time and a reflection of what’s happening. No matter what realm or fragment of society is fucked up, it glimpses and touches on that.”Twenty minutes into the interview, Morgan pulls back the curtain on his approach to his music and videos ever so slightly, explaining that the videos draw inspiration from horror films like “Rosemary’s Baby,” “The Shining” and “Candyman"" and that he relishes playing a villain-type character through his music.And though his visuals and lyrics might sometimes feel esoteric, Morgan insists there is a message to be taken away from the work, even if it’s not entirely spelled out.“If people say it’s dark, it’s dark because people are only looking through the peephole of the world I’m creating. I haven’t let everyone in the door,” Morgan said. “But I’m talking about real-life shit. I’m talking about race. I’m talking about my black body, my body, how it means for me to have this body and how I want other people to experience it or experience me. That’s why I’m putting out so much work and all these visuals because it’s content, and with more content you have more context for what the hell I’m talking about.”With festival season winding down, Morgan has his sights on completing his first full-length album for next year, in addition to bulking up his label, ZFK Records, to help artists with a similar point-of-view as Morgan gain exposure.

With massive trees protecting the area from the blistering August sun, he stalked, pounced and growled his way through songs ranging from his scathing new EP, “Nu Renegade,” to his better-known tracks, particularly the forever-fresh “Ima Read.”All the while, the crowd gathered around the stage continued to grow in size to the point where Zebra Katz, clad in an all-white ensemble, ended his set off-stage, rapping while surrounded by his fans. The fourth wall had definitely been broken, and yet, the spell he held his audience under had not.Three days earlier, Ojay Morgan, the man behind the “character” of Zebra Katz, sat in the basement of Berlin, where he was headlining the Chicago nightclub’s annual pre-Lollapalooza “side show.”While he spoke with the same wit and conviction familiar to anyone who’s ever taken in a Zebra Katz performance, Morgan clearly occupies a different space in the world than Zebra Katz, which makes it difficult to put a finger on what Morgan is all about -- and this appears intentional. “Zebra Katz has a bigger bank account than I have, that’s the difference,” Morgan told The Huffington Post. “It’s really good to have a veil. Like Andy Warhol said, you should always have something to sell and I’m not selling myself, I’m selling a product. I’m selling a brand, selling a lifestyle and it’s not myself. That’s the comfort I have.”The Zebra Katz ""brand,"" which grew out of a performance piece Morgan first presented while a student at Eugene Lane College, hit the indie mainstream in 2012 with the release of “Ima Read,” a song that attracted the attention of the music and fashion world elite.Since then, Zebra Katz has remained prolific, releasing a steady stream of mixtapes and videos while traveling around the world performing live sets that are just as intense, if not more so, than the material they are drawn from. Over the past year, he’s played shows in Spain, Switzerland, Germany and Japan. Last week, while spending time in Jamaica with his family -- his parents are Jamaican -- he was stung by a jellyfish. But throughout that time, Morgan has still yet to release a full-length album as Zebra Katz and has also expressed frustration with how his music has often been lumped in with that of artists like Le1f, Mykki Blanco and Cakes da Killa as a sort of New York-born queer rap ""revolution."" “I’m completely against the genre-ization of [a 'queer rap scene'] because it’s really fucked up,” Morgan, who identifies as queer, said. “I think as artists we have so much more to offer than a blanket sexuality that most people think is helping us sell music because it’s not. For some, it may, but it’s not in my music and not in my aesthetic.”Instead of pursuing a more traditional path through the music industry, Morgan has taken an almost completely independent route, releasing his own music and doing his own publicity -- he may have been the only artist playing Lollapalooza who listed himself as his own media liaison.But all that’s not to say Morgan doesn’t play well with others. For his “Nu Renegade” EP, released in May, he worked with London-based Iran-born producer Leila Arab, a frequent Björk collaborator Morgan met at a show of his. The result is a collection of six songs that are dark and sexy, sparse yet overwhelming and occasionally challenging to listen to. All of the songs, too, have accompanying videos which are being released once-a-month up until the final three, which will comprise a mini-film of their own.The latest, the video for the EP-opening “Blk Diamond,” is as disturbing as it is explosive. The track itself brings together elements of rap, trip-hop, electronic and industrial music, like a mix of Grace Jones, the Haxan Cloak and Tricky at their strangest.“We think it isn’t one of the ‘nicest’ EPs to come out this year,” Morgan admitted of ""Nu Renegade."" “It’s really brutal and I think that’s kind of just the reflection of our time and a reflection of what’s happening. No matter what realm or fragment of society is fucked up, it glimpses and touches on that.”Twenty minutes into the interview, Morgan pulls back the curtain on his approach to his music and videos ever so slightly, explaining that the videos draw inspiration from horror films like “Rosemary’s Baby,” “The Shining” and “Candyman"" and that he relishes playing a villain-type character through his music.And though his visuals and lyrics might sometimes feel esoteric, Morgan insists there is a message to be taken away from the work, even if it’s not entirely spelled out.“If people say it’s dark, it’s dark because people are only looking through the peephole of the world I’m creating. I haven’t let everyone in the door,” Morgan said. “But I’m talking about real-life shit. I’m talking about race. I’m talking about my black body, my body, how it means for me to have this body and how I want other people to experience it or experience me. That’s why I’m putting out so much work and all these visuals because it’s content, and with more content you have more context for what the hell I’m talking about.”With festival season winding down, Morgan has his sights on completing his first full-length album for next year, in addition to bulking up his label, ZFK Records, to help artists with a similar point-of-view as Morgan gain exposure. He’s also looking forward to playing more live shows, with a European tour slated for the fall.In the meantime, he won't be turning to the Internet for input on his next move.“I used to Google ‘Zebra Katz,’ but I don’t anymore because I don’t really care for peoples’ opinions that much,” Morgan said. “If I would have listened to everything people told me to do, I definitely wouldn’t be here.”"
