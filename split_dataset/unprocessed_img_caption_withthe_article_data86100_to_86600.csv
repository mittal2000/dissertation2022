0,POLITICS,Elizabeth Warren Has A New 'Sheriff Of Wall Street' In Mind,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-rohit-chopra_n_7614538.html,,2015-06-18,"Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, speaks during a Senate hearing on Thursday, April 23, 2015, in Albany, N.Y.

Andrew Cuomo (D) to replace the head of the New York Department of Financial Services -- Benjamin Lawsky, nicknamed the ""Sheriff of Wall Street"" for his tough enforcement approach -- with Rohit Chopra, a top regulator at the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. On Thursday, a coalition of consumer advocates and progressive groups also voiced their support for Chopra, saying in a release that he has ""a strong record of uncovering and addressing predatory behavior"" in the financial industry.Chopra is currently the CFPB's student loan ombudsman and assistant director. He has testified before Congress on the growing evidence for a negative ""student debt domino effect"" on the economy, caused by the country's more than $1.2 trillion in outstanding loans. He has also investigated student loan servicing companies and is credited with aiding a $96.6 million settlement between the Department of Justice and student lender Sallie Mae for improper conduct. In May, the CFPB signaled that it was developing its own rules to regulate student loan companies, which are currently subject to Department of Education regulations that many consider outdated and ineffective. Inside Mortgage Finance first floated Chopra in May as a possible contender to replace Lawsky. The other candidates that have been mentioned are either currently in private practice or have less obviously aggressive regulatory track records.A spokeswoman for the CFPB confirmed to The Huffington Post that Chopra is planning to leave the agency, but would not say where he is headed. Lawsky will officially leave his post in late June. Zach Carter contributed reporting."

It had all kinds of ideas in it, some better than others, but those of us who care about evidence were ecstatic about the often-repeated requirement that federal funds be used for programs ""based on scientifically-based research (SBR),"" particularly ""based on scientifically-based reading research (SBRR)."" SBR and SBRR were famously mentioned 110 times in the legislation.The emphasis on research was certainly novel, and even revolutionary in many ways. It led to many positive actions. NCLB authorized the Institute for Education Sciences (IES), which has greatly increased the rigor and sophistication of research in education. IES and other agencies promoted training of graduate students in advanced statistical methods and supported the founding of the Society for Research in Educational Effectiveness (SREE), which has itself had considerable impact on rigorous research. The U.S. Department of Education has commissioned high-quality evaluations comparing a variety of interventions such as studies of computer-assisted instruction, early childhood curricula, and secondary reading programs. IES funded development and evaluation of numerous new programs, and the methodologies promoted by IES are essential to Investing in Innovation (i3), a larger effort focused on development and evaluation of promising programs in K-12 education.The one serious limitation of the evidence movement up to the present is that while it has greatly improved research and methodology, it has not yet had much impact on practices in schools. Part of the problem is just that it takes time to build up enough of a rigorous evidence base to affect practice. However, another part of the problem is that from the outset, ""scientifically-based research"" was too squishy a concept. Programs or practices were said to be ""based on scientifically-based research"" if they generally went along with accepted wisdom, even if the specific approaches involved had never been evaluated. For example, ""scientifically-based reading research"" was widely interpreted to support any program that included the five elements emphasized in the 2000 National Reading Panel (NRP) report: phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, comprehension, and fluency. Every reading educator and researcher knows this list, and most subscribe to it (and should do so). Yet since NCLB was enacted, National Assessment of Educational Progress reading scores have hardly budged, and evaluations of specific programs that just train teachers in the five NRP elements have had spotty outcomes, at best.The problem with SBR/SBRR is that just about any modern instructional program can claim to incorporate the standards. ""Based on..."" is a weak standard, subject to anyone's interpretation.In contrast, government is beginning to specify levels of evidence far more specific than ""based on scientifically-based research."" For example, the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC), the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR), and i3 regulations have sophisticated definitions of proven programs. These typically require comparing a program to a control group, using fair and valid measures, appropriate statistical methods, and so on.The more rigorous definitions of ""evidence-proven"" mean a great deal as education policies begin to encourage or provide incentives for schools to adopt proven programs. If programs only have to be ""based on scientifically-based research,"" then just about anything will qualify, and evidence will continue to make little difference in the programs children receive. If more stringent definitions of ""evidence-proven"" are used, there is a far greater chance that schools will be able to identify what really works and make informed choices among proven approaches. Evidence-based and evidence-proven differ by just one word, but if evidence is truly to matter in policy, this is the word we have to get right."

The parts that are still confusing and raw. Because that's what it feels like when someone comes into your life with a gun and tries to kill you.,2015-06-18,"A woman prays at a makeshift memorial near the Emanuel AME Church June 18, 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina, after a mass shooting at the Church on the evening of June 17, 2015. US police on Thursday arrested a 21-year-old white gunman suspected of killing nine people at a prayer meeting in one of the nation's oldest black churches in Charleston, an attack being probed as a hate crime. The shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in the southeastern US city was one of the worst attacks on a place of worship in the country in recent years, and comes at a time of lingering racial tensions. AFP PHOTO/BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb803212600003001837616.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Many of us don't know how to respond to news of the shooting Wednesday night at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C. For me, it brings back memories of the worst kind. I was present at the Knoxville, Tenn., Unitarian Universalist Church on July 27, 2008, when a politically motivated gunman fired a shotgun at members of the congregation during a youth performance of a musical, killing two people and wounding seven others. The shooter pleaded guilty and is serving life in prison without parole. This is my experience.--It feels confusing.One minute you are are sitting with your family -- husband, mom, stepmother, children -- waiting for your oldest baby, your 10-year-old, and your dad to perform in the church play. You're encouraging your smallest girls, ages six and eight, to go sit in another pew so they can see better, and then you're calling them back because the play has already started. The next minute is a misplaced sound... perhaps a light bulb exploding? Perhaps a microphone crackling? Because what sound I would have never guessed I was hearing was a gun. In church. Hurting people. Killing people. Shaping lives. And yet, on July 27, 2008, that all happened. About seven minutes later -- it is surreal -- we are lying on top of children under pews. I am looking at my husband, Lane, with my mind racing. Do I pretend to be dead? Do I talk to the girls? Do I just get up and double-check to be sure it wasn't a lightbulb? Because people don't just come in and shoot other people. Not in church (not in schools, or malls, or any-freaking-where). But especially not in church, my church, the church I grew up in. And then there's a voice telling us that we need to get out, it's safe, come this way. We are stumbling to the back of the church into the sunlight. We move slowly, blearily, still willing to believe, wanting and needing to believe it was while knowing it was not just a lightbulb. The next part was even worse. Mothers screaming for their babies, calling, wailing, yelling names. Every time I see a picture of the front of the newspaper of mamas in anguish, this is the soundtrack: absolute panic, absolute fear, undergirded by hope because you have to have hope. Some smart person had quickly grabbed the children out of nurseries and classrooms and taken them to the church next door where they were locked down and loved on. But communication was stalled, there wasn't a seamless deployment of activity -- because someone had just opened fire in our church. Finally, gratefully, heartbreakingly, families and kiddos were reunited. Clutching each other we find Virginia, our eldest, and we search with our eyes (because we are paralyzed and confused) for my father. Waiting. Shaking. I don't think we say it out loud but we know that he was in the back of the church, where the man came in. And now we can't find him. I'm calling my brother, a minister at another church, to say, ""Come now."" I don't know if I was asking him as a brother or as a minister, or simply as an attempt to connect to a world that was normal 20 minutes ago. And then my dad comes out. His shirt is bloody and he is calm-ish. He and others had tackled the shooter and confined him. And then they held one of the victims in love, peace and appreciation for having stood in front of that man and protected the children, the congregation and his church. He swapped his life for it. Eventually the ""authorities"" -- the FBI, the ATF, I don't know exactly who, but the people who can tell us why this happened -- arrive. Except they don't know either. They ask us: How many shots did we hear? What was the timing? Is there anything we want to share? Then, unbelievingly, they send us home. It's like when you have your first child -- a life-changing, monumental, what-do-we-do-now moment -- and the hospital sends you home. Where is the manual? Where are the instructions? Are you sure you should let us go? Because there are so many more layers and chapters to this story, and they all have to do with life after a man with a gun comes into the church where you were raised. I do want to tell the other parts, which include layers of love, of community, of lessons learned. But those soften and reshape this story (which I know is my story and my perspective). And today, when I woke up to news of another church shooting -- of nine people killed in the place you feel safest -- I only want to share the parts that ripped me up. The parts that are still confusing and raw. Because that's what it feels like when someone comes into your life with a gun and tries to kill you. --Rachel Bohstedt Estes is outreach director at Canterbury United Methodist Church in Birmingham, Ala., where she lives with her husband and three daughters.

After 34 years as a school social worker, she's finally retired. Part of her bucket list is to attend the annual Martha's Vineyard Agricultural Society Fair in late August. Previously, this wasn't possible because she always had to be back at school in the early part of that month. This year our families' summer trip to the island will include experiencing the charm of the Ag Fair for the first time.Last March, when Laura read about the Ag Fair poster contest, she urged me to enter. If I won, it would be so much fun to see posters, featuring my art, hanging all over the island to advertise the fair. I was already envisioning how cute my grandsons would look wearing t-shirts displaying my design. The best part of all would be giving the framed original to my sister as a retirement gift.I worked around the clock on my illustration to get it to the judges before the April 1st deadline. I was pleased with what I came up with and felt I had a real chance of winning.On April 7th, I got a call letting me know that although my entry was a runner-up, it wasn't chosen to represent the fair. At first, the news stung more than a little bit. After awhile, it came to me that this was not a loss. Granted my poster won't be showcased around the island, but who cares? The important thing is the original art would be hanging on Laura's wall. I knew all the hours spent creating it would make it even more special to her. As for the t-shirts? There was nothing stopping me from having them made for my favorite people, so I did.Today, I'm even more sure that even though the poster competition didn't go my way, it still worked out perfectly. None of our efforts in life are ever wasted. We can't always see the reverberations of good intent, but they ripple forever outward just the same. Doing something out of love for another is no small thing. Winning and losing are all a matter of perception. Getting a good photo of my grandsons wearing the Ag Fair t-shirts wasn't easy. My poster was designed around a snapshot of the ponies that live down the street.*Click here to sign up for my newsletter and receive a free 5×7 print!Text and images © Sue Shanahan.

AFP PHOTO / FILIPPO MONTEFORTE (Photo credit should read FILIPPO MONTEFORTE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb900d92100002501c971a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Pope now recognizes the obvious: our climate is changing as a consequence of human activity. But still, not everyone agrees. James Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said the following: ""We should be good stewards of the earth God gave us"" because climate change science ""isn't settled."" So Inhofe invokes god, for which there is faith but no evidence, while remaining unconvinced of climate change, the evidence for which is overwhelming. Inhofe passionately believes with no hesitation in something that cannot be proven but denies the tangible reality in front of his face.We are now suffering the consequences of the new political phenomenon in which ignorance is celebrated and worn as a badge of honor. The science committees are chaired in both the House (Lamar Smith) and Senate (Inhofe) by anti-science, anti-intellectual, anti-reason religious zealots. This is like putting Richard Dawkins in charge of theology at the Vatican. The results are predictable; we rearrange deck chairs (burn fossil fuels unabated and argue about where to drill) on the Titanic (earth), ignoring our existential problem while arguing about all that is inconsequential as we plow into the iceberg (climate change). (In case the analogy was not obvious enough).And not to disappoint, we can predict that we will hear insufferable, ironic, self-contradictory but self-righteous pabulum from prominent politicians in response to the Pope's new-found environmental concerns. To wit, presidential candidate Jeb Bush uttered this most amazing phrase: ""I think religion ought to be about making us better as people and less about things that end up getting in the political realm."" Not sure whether to laugh, cry or pull my few remaining hairs out with that one. Really? Really?  Abortion? Stem cell research? Same-sex marriage? Public prayer? Teaching creationism is schools? Did Bush actually just say we should keep religion out of politics? That is like Charles Manson telling us we really should keep violence out of our lives. How quickly Bush forgets that he and his fellow Republicans mobilized evangelical Christians in 2000 to take over the GOP, jamming religion down our political throats like never before. No wait, I get it: it is OK to bring religion into the politics of all those wedge issues; but arbitrarily and with no rationale, we can't bring religion into the issue of climate change. Because Bush says so. Yep, my head is going to explode. But back to the Pope. The Pope, by the way, is not bringing religion to the debate; he is simply acknowledging that the science is overwhelming and compelling, and given that, there is a moral obligation to act. He is not claiming god told him humans were altering the climate. That would be bringing religion into the debate. But he does not get a free pass now just because he is finally admitting the obvious. He does so reluctantly, with hesitation. His encyclical calls on us to change our ways to ""combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it."" He hedges his bets talking about volcanoes, and goes only so far as to say that ""most global warming"" is induced by human activity. All this is a bit equivocal and weak. Still, not a bad sentiment in the end. However, it is difficult to hear the Pope and not immediately conjure up a jumble of clichés and questions: better later than never; too little too late; better than nothing; Captain Obvious; and where was the Catholic Church twenty years ago when we could have done something about the problem?We have come to a bad point in human history when people only believe the conclusions of solid science when a religious leader gives them the nod.While the Pope's comments on climate change are welcome, if obvious and too late to the party, let us not get carried away thinking the Pope is a born-again environmentalist. For millennia, peoples of nearly all cultures have been taught that humans are special in the eyes of their god or gods, and that the world is made for their benefit and use. That is, at least Western religions promote the idea that environmentalism is for wimps and long-haired liberals because god put everything here for humans to exploit. This is made clear in Genesis 1:1.""God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, over all the creatures that move along the ground.' So God created man in his own image, in the image of god he created him; male and female he created them.""This early biblical passage is representative of many that give humans the special status of being made in god's image, unlike any other creature on earth, and clearly implies human dominance over all other living things. Humans are told to ""subdue"" the earth and ""rule over"" the air, land and sea. These religious teachings not only condone but actively encourage humans to view the environment as separate from them, put here for their pleasure. Such biblical bias about our place in earth's history is one reason why the religious right resists the idea of anthropogenic climate change; we could not alter something god put here for our benefit. The explicit religious mandate to exploit natural resources remains clear and unambiguous, in spite of the Pope's new encyclical and past heroic efforts to harmonize religion and environmental sciences. Numerous academic and international organizations have made the futile attempt, including The Forum on Religion and Ecology, the largest international multi-religious project of its kind, and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, founded in 1936 by the Vatican to promote scientific progress compatible with the Church's teachings. The argument used by those seeking reconciliation between religion and environmental protection point to the integrity of all creation, or reverence for all things created by god, insisting that religion and concern for the environment are not only compatible, but have been so all along. Those are welcomed sentiments. In fact, as is frequently the case, the Bible contains contradictory passages about the natural world, reasonably allowing for such an interpretation. Old passages can also simply be reinterpreted to fit the facts or to be compatible with newly adopted ideas. Pope John Paul XXIII said in 1961:Genesis relates how God gave two commandments to our first parents: to transmit human life--'Increase and multiply'--and to bring nature into their service--'Fill the Earth, and subdue it.' These two commandments are complementary. Nothing is said in the second of these commandments about destroying nature. On the contrary, it must be brought into the services of human life.But the harsh facts of human history belie this benign revisionist interpretation of the meaning of ""subdue"". The preponderance of unambiguous passages in the Bible giving mankind dominion over nature's bounty argues against any idea that religion is environmentalism in disguise. As Renaissance scholar Lynn White famously wrote in 1967, ""We shall continue to have a worsening ecologic crisis until we reject the Christian axiom that nature has no reason for existence save to serve man."" His words remain true 40 years later, when religious conservatives in the United States view resource extraction as an inalienable right and the burning of fossil fuels a paean to god.Sure, the Pope is right about climate change; and hopefully this will be the start of a millennium in which the Catholic Church repudiates its previous history of teaching that god put the earth here for us to exploit.

I think I have three pictures that are solid documentary evidence that I did, in fact, exist. When I was 14, I thought I was the toughest bitch around. I shaved the back of my head, wore flannel shirts, baggy pants, and a choker (it was the '90s; don't judge me). One day, I was sneakily smoking a cigarette out my bedroom window, when my mother called me downstairs. She wanted to take me clothes shopping! This was relatively unheard of because it was well past back to school shopping, not Christmas or my birthday. Cautiously, I agreed to go. Into the car we go, just me and mom. We lived pretty close to the mall, so I didn't understand why she was getting on the highway. As we drove, I realized that she wasn't taking the exit to the mall. Panic struck. ""Where are you taking me?"" Nothing. No answer, just driving. Now I'm losing my mind; I had been duped and my mother has lost her mind. After several minutes of screaming my head off, she finally told me: we were going to a church to go see a visiting statute of Mary. Oh, and I was getting blessed. I blacked out from rage. I'm being held hostage for Jesus.Holy. Shit.We got to the church and I refused to leave the car. I made a huge scene, mortifying my mother.

But I did it and didn't burn, surprisingly.We left and didn't talk much. I felt like I had been victimized. My mother looked dejected and sad. But! A deal was a deal, which I reminded her of frequently the whole ride home.She pulled into a gas station a few miles from our house, went in and bought my cigarettes. She gave them to me as I sat in the front seat, shocked. Because I was a complete and total asshole, I decided to smoke one. I lit the cigarette. Then, the unexpected happened. I felt guilty. Overwhelmingly guilty. Angry, I threw it out after only a few drags.When we got home, I went to my room and couldn't wait to tell my friends what a sucker my mom was! But those phone calls never happened. I couldn't bring myself to do it. I kept thinking about how disappointed my mother looked when she walked out of that gas station, over and over. Then, I did the unthinkable: I gave the pack back to my mother. I literally could not smoke another one.We never really discussed what happened. We didn't have to; she won. All those years of Catholic guilt paid off. I did the right thing.  Amen."

From an employer standpoint, having employees ever at the ready sounds like an ideal situation; problems can get resolved with the ""send"" of a text or email. But it may be time for us to stop and think about the implications of this kind of information bombardment for employees.Employee Wellbeing Month captures the essence of what drives individual success both inside and outside the workplace. Different from ""wellness,"" ""well-being"" recognizes that all aspects of life are interrelated and, thus, should be treated holistically. Well-being looks at the physical, emotional, psychological, financial, social, and spiritual health of employees' lives.From an employer's perspective, addressing all of these aspects can help maximize the performance and productivity of the current workforce -- not to mention attract a future workforce. Employee well-being should be a pressing employer concern no matter what the economic climate. Remember that during the economic crisis, the financial component of well-being rose to the top of mind for many individuals. Leading organizations recognized the importance of developing workplace initiatives that would support and sustain employee well-being, morale and productivity during this difficult time of layoffs, cost-cutting and employer-sponsored benefits reductions.One of the items often overlooked is one's mental and emotional health. Although we continually read in the media how poor mental health takes its toll on individual and families, many employers have failed to address this aspect of well-being. According to the results of a Buck Consultants at Xerox survey report, ""Promoting Mental Well-being: Addressing Worker Stress and Psychosocial Risks,"" Singapore-based employers stand out as being the most supportive at 78%, and the United States is noted as the least supportive at 46%. Despite this ranking, 88% of U.S. employers believe their corporate culture supports the mental well-being of employees.One thing that organizations have started offering in the workplace to address this component of well-being is mindfulness meditation, which has its roots in Eastern spiritual practices. Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, an MIT-trained scientist, has been practicing mindfulness for almost 50 years, and began teaching it in 1979 to people suffering from chronic pain and illness. He developed Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, a program that is used in more than 700 hospitals, clinics, and stand-alone programs worldwide. MBSR is helping to bring the practice of mindfulness meditation into mainstream medicine and demonstrating that practicing mindfulness can bring improvements in both physical and psychological symptoms as well as positive changes in health attitudes and behaviors. At this year's World Economic Forum, mindfulness was one of the hottest topics, with multiple sessions not only devoted to the science behind mindfulness, but also how to practice it. Although mindfulness is a form of meditation, it is unique in that it attempts to bring awareness to your thoughts, physical sensations, and surroundings. The practice is about paying attention to the present without judgment. By focusing on the here and now, many people who practice mindfulness find that they are less likely to get caught up in worries about the future or regrets over the past, and are better able to form deep connections with others. Being mindful makes it easier to enjoy life's pleasures as they occur; helps you become fully engaged in activities; and creates a greater capacity to deal with adverse events (e.g. become more ""resilient"").Sounds simple enough, doesn't it? Well, it's not. Think about it. I'll return to my original point and ask: How distracted are we today as we live in this 24/7 digital world? Our lives are filled with distractions, and most of us are on auto-pilot, rarely conscious of what we are doing and where we are going. ""Going through the motions"" has become the norm. This is probably why there is a growing movement in the United States to train people to appropriately address the stressors of daily life. It is not about avoiding major life decisions, but rather about arriving at a state of mind to more easily discern without the added stress/anxiety. It serves as a primer for sound, rational thinking.In December, there was a very good piece on ""60 Minutes"" that addressed the topic. After watching it, I was able to relate to some of the practices demonstrated. Though I was familiar with many of the practices shown in the training, I recall that the first time I went through them, some of the exercises seemed a bit odd and a lot of the ""homework"" seemed overwhelming and challenging. However, over time, I began to better understand the reasons behind the approaches taken, and began reading more about the science behind it. A year later, when I took a ""refresher"" course, it resonated a bit better for me, and offered additional ways to address my emotional health. So how does this tie back to business?Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has started to move into the corporate world, along with yoga and other stress-reducing techniques. The primary business case is that if you are fully present in the moment on the job, you will be more effective in your decision-making and work better with other people. MBSR is offered to employees in organizations like Aetna, Google, General Mills, U.S. Military, Intel, Keurig Green Mountain, Goldman Sachs, Target, and others, often as part of a continuum of well-being offerings. Results have documented everything from lowering health-care costs, relieving stress, improving sleep, reducing chronic pain, and positively addressing depression and anxiety disorders.Life moves so quickly. We miss the present. I'm sure many of us can relate to those moments when we're in the middle of a conversation with someone, but our minds are elsewhere: Where we need to be, what we need to do, where we need to go next. I sometimes miss the beauty of nature and relationships all around me. I struggle with practicing mindfulness because, well, it takes practice and mindfulness! But it's important to remember that practice allows us to change behavior! Meditation does not need to be 30 or 60 minutes; it can be 10 quality minutes done on a regular basis. Here is an article on what mindful people do differently every day.  For me, mindfulness practice is another tool in the toolbox. As we celebrate Employee Wellbeing Month, of which WorldatWork is a proud supporter, let's remember all of the components of well-being, including sound mental health. Along with a supportive workplace culture, mindfulness meditation, as part of an umbrella of well-being initiatives, has shown positive signs in improving physical and mental health, and enhancing employees' overall wellbeing  Body, mind and spirit. It's all connected! Appreciate and BE in the present moment, and remember to simply BREATHE."

US police on Thursday arrested a 21-year-old white gunman suspected of killing nine people at a prayer meeting in one of the nation's oldest black churches in Charleston, an attack being probed as a hate crime. The shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in the southeastern US city was one of the worst attacks on a place of worship in the country in recent years, and comes at a time of lingering racial tensions.

You don't have to worry about those nine beloved children of God who were shot at Mother Emmanuel AME. They went home. Our faith tells us they are with God in glory. There might be no more perverse thing than to shoot people in a sanctuary. In the Christian tradition a sanctuary is a holy, set apart place of special safety and vulnerability. In some traditions soldiers and workers take off their fire arms and knives and leave them at the door to enter the sanctuary. In some traditions, even shoes come off to step into those holy places.Dylann Roof walked into a church that would have welcomed him as a beloved child of God. He asked to meet their pastor who was also a state senator and then had the honor of sitting next to him for some Bible study.Bible study is when you take a portion of text and try to unpack it. You read around it and consider what it might be referencing and you play with it. You let it speak. Some scholars hate this, but it has deep roots in the Protestant understanding that the Word is revealed in these words and has something to say to us here and now. It is intimate and can be rambling and disjointed, even funny. It is hard for me to imagine how you could sit with people engaging such a tender practice together and then shoot them. I wonder what text they were reading. I wonder if it was about love or forgiveness or maybe liberation. It is often about liberation. The Bible tells us stories of the cast out being raised up and the rejected given the place of honor. I wonder what they were reading Wednesday. I wonder if it was the love and tenderness of those black people in conversation with their God that confirmed for Dylann Roof that they were a threat to the world as he wanted it to be. I wonder if the spirit of Denmark Vesey was in that place. The iconic moments of violence in the civil rights movement were not staged. They were like June 17, 2015 at Mother Emmanuel. A hate-filled armed man or group of men seeking out a boy or a Sunday school class or a little girl. Looking back at history we tell these stories as a linear narrative of events that lead to a tipping point at which change comes. I'm ready to look back already. I think it's time to look back at Oklahoma City, Tamir Rice, Columbine, Trayvon Martin, Sandy Hook, Walter Scott, Aurora, and now Mother Emanuel and say it went too far a long time ago. We as a nation must face racism and reject it --decry it boldly and change it in ourselves. And we must disarm. Even if you can't let yourself believe that your gun-collecting hobby is lethal, haven't enough people died for you to find another way to have fun? Humor us. Collect something else: knives or shuriken perhaps? This kind of violence doesn't happen in other countries like ours, our president reminds us. There is only one difference between them and us, access to guns. And, race, the most real unreal thing in American life. What would an anti-racist United States look like? All it would mean is the freedom for all people to pursue a life with dignity and to be protected from harm by the state. To do that we would need to dismantle the prison industrial complex, substantively reform policing, raise the minimum wage, and insure that all of our kids have a decent education, the usual stuff but for everyone. The storyline seems clear to me. Let this be the last time not the new normal."
13,POLITICS,North Carolina Makes Last-Minute Change To Voter ID Law Facing Challenge In Court,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-voter-id_n_7616370.html,,2015-06-18,"Members of North Carolina student chapters of the NAACP and opponents of voter ID legislation wear tape over their mouths while sitting silently in the gallery of the House chamber of the North Carolina General Assembly where lawmakers debated and voted on voter identification legislation in Raleigh, N.C., Wednesday, April 24, 2013. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb900cb200000c70101df1a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The North Carolina General Assembly passed a bill on Thursday allowing voters who do not have government-issued photo identification to still vote in next year's elections by signing an affidavit and presenting alternate forms of ID.The photo ID requirement was set to go in effect for 2016 under a larger elections bill passed by the GOP-controlled state legislature two years ago. The ID provision, along with other voting restrictions, will be challenged by civil rights groups in federal court starting July 13 in Winston-Salem. The affidavit measure now heads to Republican Gov. Pat McCrory. Under the new measure, voters would be able to swear that they could not obtain an appropriate form of photo ID to vote due to factors like lack of transportation, work schedules and family responsibilities. Voters would instead present an alternate form of identification, the last four digits of their Social Security number and date of birth. The initial voter ID law from 2013 allowed low-income voters to get a free identity card from the state Division of Motor Vehicles. The law was considered one of the nation's strictest voter ID bills in that it didn't allow for public employee IDs or student IDs from state universities. By the state's own calculation, more than 300,000 registered voters lacked the law's acceptable forms of ID. Civil rights advocates have also objected to the state's cuts to early voting, elimination of same-day registration and discounting of valid votes cast outside a voter’s assigned precinct. The state also eliminated preregistration for 16- and 17-year-olds and abolished straight-ticket voting. Republicans argue that such voting restrictions protect against voter fraud, while voting rights advocates and Democrats say such fraud is nearly nonexistent. Those opposed to voter ID laws also say low-income voters, seniors, students and those with disabilities can be disenfranchised by these policies, even if free IDs are provided, given the cost of taking time off work to go to the DMV or the challenges of tracking down missing birth certificates.The Southern Coalition for Social Justice, a civil rights group that has contributed to the legal assault against the state's voting restrictions, said in a press release following the vote that though the legislature had ""capitulated"" with the voter ID modification Thursday, the overall bill still made it harder for North Carolinians to vote. ""These changes not only add to the already long lines at polling places and the administrative burden placed on election officials, but they also disenfranchise qualified North Carolina voters who for valid reasons are unable to obtain photo identification or make multiple trips to government agencies in order to exercise their constitutional right to vote,"" the group said in the release. ""Although today’s changes are a step in the right direction for North Carolina voters, obstacles to voting remain.""Republicans called the new measure ""a failsafe"" for impacted voters, so no North Carolinian would experience impediments to accessing the ballot box. But according to local news outlet WRAL, Democratic legislators were frustrated that the new provision allowing for affidavits was only happening now, rather than in 2013 when they voiced their initial objections to the package of voting restrictions. ""One of the reasons that we put a two-year delay in the photo ID provision is so that we could get some feedback,"" Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R) said. ""What that provision represents is some of the feedback to try to make sure that everyone who is eligible to vote has an opportunity to not only cast their vote but have their vote counted.""A report from Democracy North Carolina released this week estimated that the voting restrictions reduced turnout by at least 30,000 voters in the 2014 election. In analyzing provisional ballots cast during the election, the group concluded that ballots that were rejected were disproportionately cast by black voters. Civil rights groups like the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP haven't stopped drawing attention to the impact of the voting restrictions; 10 activists were arrested on Wednesday evening protesting the 2013 bill. It remains to be seen how this modification to the voter ID law will affect litigation next month, given that civil rights groups are suing over the entire package of voting restrictions. "

""It also recognizes the cost rules still apply when a plaintiff refuses a reasonable settlement offer and forces the parties to go through an expensive trial.""Kleiner Perkins had offered Pao, now interim chief executive of microblogging company Reddit, nearly $1 million to settle before her case went to trial.Pao did not accept and sought to convince a jury earlier this year that the venture capital firm had short-circuited her career because she is woman.The jury sided with Kleiner Perkins.Pao, who has said she would appeal, has offered to drop her case for $2.7 million, Kleiner Perkins said in a court filing earlier this month.Pao's lawyer was not immediately available for comment on Kahn's tentative ruling.

Philip Morris will have a ""license to kill"". A ruling is expected very soon from the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a branch of the World Bank.One hundred million deaths in the 20th century, more than both World Wars combined, are attributable to smoking or inhaling tobacco. According to the World Health Organization, tobacco kills almost 6 million people every year, more than malaria (3 million), more than HIV/AIDS (2.5 million), more than tuberculosis (1,7 million). 600,000 of these are non-smokers involuntarily exposed to smoke. In total, tobacco use is responsible for the death of about 1 in 10 adults worldwide. [1]The long-term effects of deliberate disinformation campaigns continue to make themselves felt, since 25 percent of U.S. citizens still believe that there is no solid evidence proving that smoking kills. [2] If the present trend continues, there will be one billion victims in the 21st century. Of these deaths, 70 percent to 80 percent will occur in countries with low or average incomes. Despite these facts, the tobacco industry wants to continue to produce cigarettes. Philip Morris is even now suing countries -- Uruguay, Australia, Norway, and the United Kingdom -- for protecting its citizens from illness and premature death. These countries have adopted some of the best anti-tobacco legislation in the world. Phillip Morris is suing them because the governments are increasing the size of health warnings on cigarette packets from 50 percent of the cover to 80 percent, and prohibiting tobacco companies from using sub-brands like Marlboro ""light,"" ""extra,"" ""green,"" and ""gold"", in an attempt to give the impression that some cigarettes are safe to smoke.Philip Morris claims that tax records from cigarette sales showed that warnings had ""no effect at all"" on consumption. If that was the case, one wonders why the industry spends so much effort to prevent them! In fact, the decrease in sales since the warnings were incorporated is dramatic. According to a study conducted by Uruguay's University of the Republic in collaboration with M.I.T., when the government started to crackdown on smoking in 2005, 40 percent of adults Uruguayans smoked. Today, only 23 percent of them do. Among the 12 to 17-year-old age bracket, smoking has been reduced from 30 to 13 percent. The decrease was especially marked among pregnant women. [3]A Sad History of Deceit and Lack of CompassionIn the 1930s, German researchers demonstrated that tobacco leads to lung cancer, but their work was ignored. In 1953, Ernest Wynder and his colleagues at the Sloan-Kettering Institute in New York found that cigarette tar applied to the skin of mice led to deadly cancers. The tobacco industry panicked and launched a media campaign to convince the population that there was ""no sound scientific basis for the charges."" In 1967, the tobacco firm Brown and Williamson announced that, ""there was no scientific evidence that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer or any other disease."" It came to light later that scientists working for the industry actually reached the same conclusion as the other reports. In the 1980s, after the Surgeon General concluded that passive smoking was also harmful to health, Philip Morris financed a project called Whitecoat, enrolling European scientists to ""reverse the erroneous scientific and popular concept that environmental tobacco smoke is harmful to health."" Today, the tobacco industry has still not thrown in the towel. It is now targeting developing countries, and is prospering in Africa, in the Middle East, and in Asia (which is home to 60 percent of the billion smokers on the planet, 350 million of them in China alone). In Indonesia, for example, it offers young people a reward if they agree to transform their cars into ads for their brands. In China, Marlboro even sponsors school uniforms (with their logo, of course.) According to a Philip Morris insider, an internal memo explains that, ""Today's teenage[r] is tomorrow's potential regular customer, and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens."" A well-known trait of psychopaths is that they do not feel any remorse about the harm they cause to others.How to Protect People from Being Harmed?Since it is well established that banning advertising lowers cigarette consumption, the first thing to do is to ban all ads. Studies have also shown that most smokers aware of the dangers of tobacco want to stop smoking. Still, in many countries, few people know the specific risks of tobacco consumption (only 37 percent in China, where people smoke freely in crowded trains or buses). Governments need to be more proactive in informing their citizens about the serious dangers posed by smoking.Even though many think that a ban is impractical in the context of globalization, countries like Finland and Australia have already taken the path of eradication with two initiatives: removing any positive image of tobacco by making all cigarette packs the same, and banning smoking in the streets to put an end to the phenomenon of imitation.A very pragmatic way is to hit their wallets: A group of English medical experts is encouraging governments to have the public health bill systematically paid by tobacco companies, since they are responsible for all these diseases and deaths. [4] Philip Morris' revenue in 2013 ($80.2 billion) were higher than Uruguay's GDP ($55.7 billion).As various international instances are about to pass a judgment on Philip Morris' court cases, let's remember that we need to save lives, not grant the industry a ""license to kill"".References: 1.

When I finally got pregnant with our daughter, you jokingly told my obstetrician that you were going to walk into my C-section with your scrubs on and your hands up at a 90-degree angle in front of you, like a surgeon. Instead, you came in, looked at me lying there, on the table, and became an automaton -- your nerves about the momentous changes coming to our lives apparent in the glazed look in your eyes.Then they handed her to you, and you came alive -- something in you cracked open. When we got home, you split the night shifts with me. You would be on from 11-3, feeding her a bottle of pumped breast milk, and it was my turn from 3-7.

Some paperwork was missing from his chart, so while I was running around trying to locate it, you were left to hold our boy's hand as they sedated him before the test. When I returned, I found you in the waiting room, dissolving in tears. I took one look at you and assumed that the worst had happened -- that something had gone terribly wrong. ""You should have seen the look on his little face,"" you told me between sobs. ""I was helping them hold him down so they could put in the IV, and he looked at me with this expression like I was betraying him. Like I was supposed to be protecting him and I was just letting them do this to him. I swear, I will never get that image out of my head -- that look on his face."" You continued to cry the messy, snotty tears of a man who had just forsaken his own son -- making multiple trips to the bathroom to procure toilet paper, as the moments slowly ticked by in a hospital waiting room that inexplicably had no tissues available. It was a test that was supposed to last 20 minutes, but took almost an hour. A month later, we found out why -- learning that, unrelated to the stroke, Owen had also been born with a brain malformation so rare, the condition didn't even have a name. He was literally missing the parts of his brain responsible for speech. There was no prognosis, and when I asked his well-respected and beloved neurologist whether he would ever have speech beyond that of a 5-year-old, she sadly told us that she just didn't know.

It is not for the weak or faint-hearted. Game of Thrones demonstrates the importance of having a strategic plan which will assist you in reaching your ultimate goal. Even then you may encounter unexpected resistance or roadblocks, but you'll be better prepared to meet them head-on.You must hold the interest of your teamRemember when Jaime Lannister pushed young Bran Stark out of the window in Season One? It was shocking! After we began breathing again, we knew that we were hooked. That's what the right training program should do, stimulate interest from the start. It should never be boring, but should leave your team craving more.You can't allow your old guard to hinder progressViserys Targaryen, the brother of Daenerys, ""Mother of Dragons"" mistakenly assumed that as senior sibling, the crown was his birthright. When Khal Drogo poured molten gold on his head he discovered that was not the case. Senior therapists may be comfortable feeling entitled to behave in a way that's non-productive and doesn't serve to elevate your brand. They may even discourage the enthusiasm of newer team members. Make it clear to them that stellar customer service and sales performance will trump seniority every time.Tough experiences can produce magicWhen Daenerys willingly entered the funeral pyre of Khal Drogo, she knew that she was all powerful. However your therapists probably don't come close to that level of self confidence. Most therapists are introverts and their discomfort with selling retail may even be palpable. But as their manager you should know their potential. Be ruthless about ensuring their success. Because once they complete spa training, and see what they've accomplished, magic will happen. They'll emerge from the fire like Daenerys with baby dragons of confidence, better listening skills, and heightened empathy.Sometimes you need to pull out your big gunsJon Snow successfully rallies the Wildling's leaders with minimal resistance. But when his army is later attacked by the nightmarish White Walkers, only his weapon of Dragon Glass is effective in killing them. Luckily he has Wun Wun the giant, who alternately flings them aside or squashes them into the ground. Spa therapists are often divided into cliques. If a clique leader is resistant to training, their entourage may refuse as well. Don't hesitate to seek verbal or written support from your Wun Wun, aka senior management to help your team more quickly understand the necessity of change.Strategic alliances are critical to successThe ""Breaker of Chains"" and ""Mother of Dragons"", has always kept a trusted confidante close by. Daenerys understands the importance of having a touchstone. Whether it's her lady-in-waiting, Missandei, or her intellectual superior Tyrion Lannister, she believes in establishing relationships and the power of comprehensive listening. During your training classes there will be a lot of interaction with everyone learning at their own pace. You'll want to ask an assistant manager or colleague that your team trusts to help monitor their progress and report back to you. This will enable you to more accurately assess the effectiveness of the training while providing encouragement to your team. Game of Thrones shows us that the road to success may be rife with drama but in the end for your customers, brand and team, it will be worth the journey."

Gay marriage is now legal statewide after the courts ruled that the ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional and the Supreme Court declined to intervene.

When something happens that is not to their liking, they will strike out in a variety of fashions, many of which do not line up to a logical agenda of self-interest. Part of the challenge of parenting, in such situations, is to show them how by reacting differently they can make the situation better, not just for themselves, but for others.Conservatives worldwide apparently need such a parental voice at times to help them see the same thing. A year and a half ago a young man in Utah proclaimed he would starve to death if Utah allowed same sex marriages to take place. I wrote a letter to him in an effort to show him that his actions were not heroic, they were immature. Same sex marriage became legal in Utah, and he avoided starvation.Now a couple in Australia is doing their own version of a kid rant over same sex marriage. Nick and Sarah Jensen have declared that should Australia recognize same sex marriages, they will get a divorce. Nick states they married “as a fundamental order of creation, part of God’s intimate story for human history, man and woman, for the sake of children, faithful and for life. And so, if later on in the year the state does go ahead and changes the definition of marriage and changes the terms of that contract then we can no longer partake in that new definition unfortunately.”He speaks of a “contract” that they had with the state which would guarantee marriage defined as being only between a man and a woman forever.Of course, no such contract exists.As a dad, this scenario is all too familiar. My sons were both adopted through foster care and are only four months apart in age. We call them “almost twins” reflecting that in many ways, they have achieved a bond that I have only seen in biologically born twins.My son Jesse has always been the one to lead in their game playing. When they were about 6 years old, Jesse would create card games to play. After a while, Jason would become very frustrated and I would have to intercede. It was not difficult to see the cause of their conflict — the cards and rules of the game were literally stacked against Jason. As they were explained to me, I could see that the rules would only lead to the point where Jesse would win.So I made him change the rules. As soon as that happened, Jesse, who is a bright kid, could see that things were not exclusive to him anymore and he immediately….quit. “I don’t want to play anymore,” he would bellow, and mind-bogglingly declare, “It’s not FAIR.”The Jensens are having a similar meltdown. They see that the rules which favor only them are changing, and therefore, they want to — quit. I have written them a letter.Dear Mr. and Mrs. Jensen,Rob Watson is a writer for The Next Family and hosts a show called “A Gay Dad Coffee Chat with Rob Watson.” He lives with his family in Santa Cruz.
