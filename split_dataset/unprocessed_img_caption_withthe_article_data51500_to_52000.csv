The family was enjoying a European dream vacation that started with the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain, and flamenco dancing in Barcelona, family friend Jess Davis told media.“They had been celebrating Bastille Day in Nice when this unthinkable and unfair act of terror took Sean and Brodie from the world far too soon,” Davis told The Dallas Morning News. “It is a terrible loss.”“We are heartbroken and in shock over the loss of Brodie Copeland, an amazing son and brother who lit up our lives, and Sean Copeland, a wonderful husband and father,” the family told the newspaper in a statement. “They are so loved.”Sean Copeland’s brothers are planning to pick up the rest of the family from Nice this weekend, KXAN reported. It is unclear if the other family members were near the site of the attacks Thursday night.Family friend Jason Dixon told local station KXAN that Brodie had just completed fifth grade and was a gifted athlete. He still doesn’t quite believe the two are gone.“It was a devastating feel, it took me a while to sink in. I called some people to confirm to make sure what I had read had actually happened,” said Dixon. “Every time we were around, [Brodie’s] attitude and personality were infectious and it rolled off on me as an adult and obviously the kids, but he was a natural at youth sports.”Both young Brodie and his father were avid baseball fans.On Thursday evening, Brodie’s team, the Hill Country Baseball Club, shared a photo of him taken in France just hours earlier.“Nobody deserves this type of fate, especially not such a wonderful family,” the caption read. “You are in our hearts, thoughts, and prayers. Rest in peace, Brodie and Sean, you will be remembered by many.”Family and friends shared condolences amid hundreds of comments on the photo, many of them noting how much Sean and Brodie contributed to their community and how deeply their absence will be felt.“No words can describe how we feel,” wrote Jeff Petry. “Sean and Brodie touched our lives in so many ways. Such a good man and a great kid and teammate.”“I’m in complete shock! Some of the best people I’ve had the privilege to know,” added Victor Flores. “You will definitely be missed Sean and Brodie. Kim, i do not have the words nor know what you are going through. I’m truly sorry for your loss.”Sean Copeland worked as a vice president in a software division at Lexmark, a technology company. In a statement, Lexmark spokesman Jerry Grasso said he “was not only a terrific leader in the company but a phenomenal person who will be dearly missed.”Sean’s niece, Haley Copeland, said the loss of her family members has been unbearable:This is an extremely difficult time for my family and anyone who knows Sean and Brodie Copeland. Losing a loved one is hard no matter the circumstances but losing a loved one in such a tragic and unexpected way is unbearable. Prayers are much appreciated.Amid countless condolences and offers of prayer, another relative, Heather Copeland, offered a more succinct take: “I just want my cousin and uncle back.” "

Advising that Hile, an avid long-distance runner, should get used to the notion that she wouldn’t be training for as many marathons from then on out. “That really just pissed me off,” Hile told The Huffington Post recently.Hile had just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. But from that moment on, she set out to prove the doctor wrong. To show that she could still conquer those 26.2 miles whenever she liked. Ten years later, and Hile has done just that. To date, she’s completed 49 marathons ― 36 of which occurred after her diagnosis ― totaling 1,283.8 miles. That’s 943 miles on a right foot that drags, on a right leg that won’t quite cooperate, on a body that acts up whenever she gets too hot or too cold. That’s the equivalent of running a third of the way across the U.S. ― and more than the coastline of her home state of California.Far from letting her 2006 diagnosis and subsequent depression keep her away from the track, Hile learned how to use the fear she harbored as her inspiration to lace up every morning. She’s used marathons as motivation to persevere through the pain, and her day-to-day ability to train as a continual litmus test for her health and happiness.Now, she’s facing her biggest race-related challenge yet. She wants to become the first person with multiple sclerosis to complete seven marathons on seven continents in just 12 months’ time.Hile first began running marathons in October 2000, seduced into the sport after witnessing the roller coaster of emotions her then-boyfriend, now-husband, spun through after a race.She was hooked by the time she crossed her first finish line, and ran 12 more by the time she learned she had MS exactly six years later.Since January of 2006, she had been experiencing what felt like “really painful electroshocks” in her right bicep. But given the physical exertion she put herself through on a regular basis, her doctor wrote off the pain as a pinched nerve or the like.But the shocks became more painful ― until, occasionally, her arm would go entirely numb or get unbearably itchy. Hile was eventually given an MRI, at which point the doctors noticed lesions in her brain and spinal column, leading them to her ultimate diagnosis ― and her ensuing depression.Ironically, it wasn’t until her symptoms worsened and it became nearly impossible for her to run that she found a way to fight against her despair.“I started feeling these odd sensations in my feet,” Hile recalled. “It felt like there was gum stuck in my shoe all the time or it felt like my feet were on fire, and I started tripping and falling while running,” She had developed a symptom called foot drop, which made it increasingly difficult for her to get enough lift on her right side to move at a quick, consistent pace.It was then that her neurologist told her she should “lower her expectations.”“A mantra just formed in my head at that moment,” she said. “‘I’m going to prove you wrong. I’m going to do what I can to never give up.’”And so she began to search for any means possible to keep running.She connected with a specialist, who crafted a carbon fiber device that inserted into her right shoe, extended up the back of her leg and attached to her calf, thereby lifting her toes up to prevent those trips and falls.The orthotic affected her gait, sure, but it also enabled her to get back into her running shoes and onto the track, leading Hile to realize to what extent her ability to run dictated her emotional state. Her head cleared and her depression lifted whenever she made her way onto a course, despite the physical toll even a 30-minute jog would take.The same holds true all these years later, even as the disease continues to hamper her running. She may no longer be able to open a water bottle in the middle of a race or run without her husband by her side, but she’s found that the process of signing up, lacing up, and lining up for a given 26.2-mile battle recharges her with the strength she needs to fight her disease, every time.“Even on days when I’m fatigued or something my run doesn’t go well, just the fact that I’m out there doing it, that elevates my mood and really, really helps me get through the day,” Hile said.So that’s why she has dedicated the next year of her life to the seven-continent challenge: both to raise dollars for the National MS Society and to shine a light on what she sees as humans’ innate resilience in the face of insurmountable odds.“[I want] people to say, ‘Hey look, there’s Cheryl, she’s an ordinary person … so if she can do this, then I can definitely do this,” Hile explained.She’ll start in Cape Town in September, before heading west to Buenos Aires, north to Honolulu, south to Antarctica, then stopping in quick succession in Tokyo, Vienna and Christchurch. Her January stop in Antarctica is the leg she’s most excited ― and most anxious ― for. Her symptoms flare up in the cold, and last year the temperature for last year’s race was a balmy minus 4 Fahrenheit with windchill.But the Antarctica marathon’s organizer has promised her that, even if it takes her eight hours, even if it takes her all day, everyone down at the race will do their damnedest to ensure she makes it to mile 26.The 12-month globetrotting trek would take its physical toll on anyone, let alone someone with MS. But that’s not what Hile’s concentrating on.Instead, she’s thinking about that day in late 2006 when she was told she’d no longer be able to do what she loved. And at the point in these upcoming marathons when it gets the toughest ― around mile 20, when the adrenaline’s gone and the pain level’s high ― she says she knows exactly what she’ll be repeating to herself over again to push herself to that finish line: I do what I can and I never give up. I do what I can and I never give up. I do what I can and I never give up. To complete her challenge, Hile needs to fundraise about $54,000.

3,POLITICS,Obama Administration Will Hand Off Iran Portfolio To An Uncertain Future,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-iran-after-obama_us_5788012ce4b08608d333ca52,The personal relationship between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart has allowed for an informal detente. And it's about to end.,2016-07-15,Can the diplomatic breakthroughs achieved by Secretary of State John Kerry and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif last after the Obama administration leaves office in January?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5788029e1b00002600f6dfd0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As the international community marks the one-year anniversary of the Iran nuclear deal, some Iran-watchers say they are worried what will happen after the Obama administration, staffed with officials who helped broker the historic diplomatic agreement, leaves office in less than six months.These concerns are based on a belief that a foundation of the U.S.-Iran rapprochement is a delicate personal relationship between two key actors that’s unlikely to extend into the next president’s administration, even if former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wins the election. In the absence of formal diplomatic relations, it was the efforts of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iran Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif ― and a handful of their deputies ― that allowed the U.S. and Iran to reach breakthroughs like the nuclear accord and a subsequent prisoner swap. The unusual relationship between Kerry and Zarif also allowed the secretary of state to phone his counterpart and avert a military confrontation when U.S. Navy sailors accidentally drifted into Iranian waters earlier this year. “You don’t have anybody, as of Jan. 20, or maybe before, who can pick up the phone to somebody and say, ‘Hey look, we’ve got a problem’ … There’s nothing in place that would help you deal with an emergency,” said William Luers, a retired diplomat with 31 years of experience in the foreign service. “There’s lots of ready-made opportunities for mistakes,” Luers cautioned. “And once there’s a mistake, then you have to figure out, how do you unravel it. The immediate reaction, given the nature of the U.S.-Iranian relations historically, is to be macho on both sides. And then you lose control of a situation.”Some regional experts and former diplomats fear that outgoing Obama administration officials will be replaced in January by people less willing or less able to manage potentially explosive bilateral issues with the longtime U.S. adversary.Whether it’s Clinton or former reality television star Donald Trump in the White House, “relations are going to deteriorate to some extent,” predicted Ariane Tabatabai, an Iran expert and visiting professor at Georgetown University. While parties to the nuclear agreement have generally adhered to its terms, there’s a long list of potential flash points facing whoever replaces Kerry as secretary of state. Over the past year, the Iranians have accused the U.S. of discouraging foreign investment in Iran, dampening the effects of sanctions relief. Congressional Republicans marked the one-year anniversary by calling for more sanctions against Iran, which Tehran would likely view as a violation of the deal. Iran continues to imprison U.S. citizens without charges, or on unfounded allegations. Washington and Tehran back opposite sides in civil wars in Syria and Yemen. And even with a common enemy ― the Islamic State ― they differ in how to fight the extremist terrorist group. The large U.S. Navy presence off the coast of Bahrain makes an altercation between the American and Iranian militaries a constant simmering threat. “The reality is, personal rapport matters tremendously, and the rapport that has been built between Kerry and Zarif is a unique one,” said Trita Parsi, the head of the National Iranian American Council, which lobbied aggressively in support of the nuclear accord. That rapport between Kerry and Zarif was developed after the two spent hours in marathon negotiation sessions, in person and over the phone. “It’s certainly true that the negotiations at some point did get personal with the fact Zarif and Kerry are kind of the same sorts of guys,” said Richard Nephew, a former member of the State Department negotiating team. “They’re big talkers. They like the thrust of the debate. It was adversarial at times, but I think they genuinely understood one another and could see eye to eye on a number of things.”While Clinton and her top aide Jake Sullivan were involved in early stages of the negotiations with Iran, it’s not clear that they ever developed that same rapport with their Iranian counterparts (in part because Iran’s more moderate leadership came to power shortly after she stepped down as secretary of state). Parsi described Iranians as generally “suspicious” of Clinton. Tabatabai said they are “wary” of her. Parsi and Tabatabai said people in Iran took note when Clinton listed “the Iranians” as an enemy she is proud to have made during a presidential debate last year. When Clinton speaks about enforcing the nuclear agreement, said Parsi, she frames it in terms of punishing the Iranians for potential violations and does not explicitly promise to block congressional sanctions that could stymie the agreement, as Obama does.But Nephew argued that the notion that Clinton is substantially more aggressive in her rhetoric on Iran than the Obama administration is overhyped. President Barack Obama and his deputies often talked tough on Iran, too, he noted. In the final stages of negotiations, Obama concluded nearly every statement on the subject with an obligatory warning that if talks failed, the U.S. would bomb Iran to prevent it from getting nuclear weapons. The nuclear agreement succeeded, Nephew said, not because Kerry and Zarif got along, but because both countries deemed it to be in their strategic interest ― a reality that is likely to outlast the Obama administration. It’s harder to predict what Trump’s relations with the Iranians would be, mostly because he doesn’t seem to have an Iran policy. He moves freely between pledging to rip up the nuclear accord and enforce it vigorously. “It’s not clear to me that Mr. Trump understands this agreement, has read this agreement, understands the weight of this agreement, or would know how to manage this agreement,” said Wendy Sherman, a former undersecretary of state who served as the State Department’s chief negotiator in the nuclear talks.Regardless of what approach Trump would ultimately land on, it’s unlikely that the Islamic republic would be receptive to a man who has floated the idea of banning Muslims from the U.S. That’s especially true if he selects as vice president former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has appeared multiple times at rallies hosted by the Mojahedin-e-Khalq, or the MEK, an exiled group advocating regime change in Iran. Republicans and Iran hawks, of course, may regard Trump’s disinterest in establishing establishing ties with the Iranians as a virtue. Both the Clinton and Trump campaigns declined to comment for this article. Individual personalities aside, it’s the lack of broad, institutionalized means of communication between the two countries that causes supporters of improved relations between the U.S. and Iran to worry.Embassies and diplomats typically provide continuity when a president leaves office. There are some career foreign service officers, like Stephen Mull, the diplomat tasked with overseeing implementation of the nuclear deal, who have relationships with the Iranians and will likely stick around past January. But Mull’s mandate is strictly limited to the nuclear issue. A State Department official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said there are efforts underway aimed at “solidify the existing relations beyond what Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Zarif have established and to ensure that going into the next administration, there will be lines of communication.” But the official declined to elaborate. The most obvious solution would be for the U.S. and Iran to re-establish normal diplomatic relations, Zalmay Khalilzad, a former ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq, and the United Nations; and James Dobbins, a former special envoy to Afghanistan, suggested last month. But a more politically realistic approach, they said, would be to assign mid-ranking diplomats to the interests sections of embassies representing each other ― Switzerland for the U.S. in Iran, and Pakistan for Iran in the U.S.If there is a concrete plan to avoid a breakdown in communications, it seems that former diplomats from both sides have yet to hear about it.“The relationship between Kerry and Zarif was hugely impactful in terms of reaching the [nuclear deal] and continuing cooperation afterwards. However, because it is more a personal relationship and not institutionalized, it is hard to imagine how this level of dialogue can continue once Obama leaves office,” Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a former nuclear negotiator for Iran, wrote in an email. “The channels of communication need to be formalized,” Mousavian continued.

She had been in the Texas city after a sniper shot and killed five police officers last week.“I heard like two pops. I thought it was fireworks and then didn’t think anything of it but all sudden all these people were running in the opposite direction speaking in French and screaming,” Crouch told KTVT.“It’s really sad when you’ve been marked safe twice on Facebook in the last week. We shouldn’t live in a world like that,” she added.“I saw bodies flying like bowling pins along its route,” Damien Allemand, a journalist with local newspaper Nice Matin, wrote in a Medium post.“Heard noises, cries that I will never forget.”The truck eventually came to a stop and the driver emerged from the vehicle with a weapon. Police shot him dead. It’s unclear whether he had an accomplice, authorities said Friday morning. Local resident Wassim Bouhlel recalled seeing “bodies everywhere” following the attack. “There was carnage on the road,” he told The Associated Press.Dominique Molina, president of the San Diego-based American Institute of Certified Tax Coaches, witnessed the massacre from her hotel balcony while on vacation with her family, including her 14-year-old son.“It’s horrific, it’s really horrific. I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,” she told NBC 7 San Diego. “I cant even tell you how many people I saw die in front of my eyes.” She described the scene as “a pathway of bodies.”Molina described the “scary awful” situation and posted photographs of the promenade in several tweets.Kayla Repan, from Boca Raton, Florida, was visiting Nice with her fiancé.“The whole city was running,” she told the AP. “I got extremely frightened and ran away from the promenade. It was chaos. We hid in a restaurant but now we moved to a separate hotel.”She later relived the experience on camera:Kevin Harris, a Briton who was also on vacation in Nice, watched the attack unfold from the terrace of his hotel room.“I heard a lot of screaming and shouting,” he said on Friday. “I came out onto my terrace and in front of me I could see lots of what appeared to be bodies lying on the road just outside of where I’m sitting now actually.”Meanwhile, London-based lawyer Harjit Sarang said she was attending the display with her children when the attack began:Counterterrorism officials have taken over the investigation into the attack, HuffPost France reports. No group has yet claimed responsibility.But a police source told Reuters news agency that the attacker was a 31-year-old French-Tunisian. This is a developing story; please check back for updates."

Expect celebrities and activists to be tweeting #BetterThanThis as Trump and other Republicans take the stage at the convention.The Clinton campaign will be basing its operations from its headquarters, less than a mile from the Quicken Loans Arena where the Republican action will be taking place. It will hold a daily press conference, offer calls for the media and send out rapid response.Democratic officials including DNC Chair and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.), Sen. Al Franken (Minn.) and Reps. Xavier Becerra (Calif.), Joe Crowley (N.Y.), Ruben Gallego (Ariz.) and Bennie Thompson (Miss.). There will also be a strong showing from the Ohio delegation with Reps. Tim Ryan, Marcia Fudge and Joyce Beatty as well as former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, who is currently running for Senate. That Ohio presence is a contrast to the Republican side, where the talk has been on all the state politicians who are not going to attend. Ohio Gov. John Kasich ― who dropped his presidential bid against Trump in May ― doesn’t plan on attending, and Sen.

Kaine is also affable, savvy about foreign policy and has executive experience as a former governor of Virginia and a former mayor of Richmond, the state’s capital.And as a Virginian, Kaine could help Clinton win a battleground state in the Nov. 8 race against Republican Donald Trump.He is the obvious safe choice, according to many Democratic members of Congress. And though the Clinton campaign is keeping the vice presidential selection process tightly under wraps, many Democrats in Washington see Kaine as the front-runner.But in a year when standard political playbooks are being tossed aside, some Democrats in Congress and in outside groups want to see Clinton make a more unconventional pick for her already historic run as the first female presidential nominee of a major party.U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fierce critic of Wall Street, and Julian Castro, a Latino who is the U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, are among two popular figures mentioned by Democrats who want to see Clinton go bold in her vice presidential decision.As Clinton moves toward a final decision before the Democratic convention in Philadelphia July 25-28, she is heading out on the campaign trail on Thursday with Kaine, where the two will appear at a rally in Northern Virginia.Annette Magnus, executive director of Battle Born Progress, a progressive advocacy group in Nevada, said she did not think Kaine would be the best choice.“For the demographics that we’re looking to motivate in this election, I think it’s going to be really important to have especially a person of color as her running mate,” Magnus said.Besides Warren and Castro, Labor Secretary Tom Perez, Representative Xavier Becerra of California, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and, more recently, retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis have all been mentioned as possibilities.Asked about Kaine, Artie Blanco, a super delegate from Nevada, said he would not be her top pick.“Excited, no. Okay with, you know, sure,” she said.Blanco said she likes Becerra and Perez as potential picks. She said Warren “would be fantastic” and she likes Brown’s stance on worker issues. CAN HE FIRE UP VOTERS?Thursday’s event with Kaine will give Clinton an opportunity to gauge whether the 58-year-old Harvard-educated senator would help her fire up a crowd and make for a comfortable fit on the campaign trail.Some Democratic senators on Wednesday rallied around Kaine.Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who has served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with Kaine, said in a brief interview: “If you look at the totality of Tim’s life and his work, I think there are elements that would bridge that divide” between progressive Democrats and more establishment Democrats who have fostered Clinton’s drive for the White House.Brown, the senator from Ohio who also has been mentioned as a potential running-mate, played down the divide, saying that now that former rival Bernie Sanders has endorsed Clinton, “the party is not in need of healing particularly. People are on board and ready to go.”They might be “ready to go” for Clinton, but many are holding out for a more progressive vice presidential pick.Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, a Muslim who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, praised Kaine, but said, “I would prefer someone...who’s really going to signal to the progressive base that we’re going to make some advances on this income inequality people have been suffering from.”(Reporting By Richard Cowan in Washington and Luciana Lopez in New York; Additional reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Amanda Becker in Washington; Editing by Caren Bohan)"

But that format can be limiting during big news events, he told Politico in an interview published Thursday.“What we enjoy most is being topical at the top of the show,” he said. “Our favorite thing is something happens at 5 o’clock on the day of a show and we can do it on the show at 5:30, which is when we tape. ... And I don’t really want to lose that opportunity just because the event that everybody is going to be talking about happened at 10 o’clock that night.” Colbert’s schedule change gives viewers yet another alternative to cable news for some of the latest stories from the conventions.Convention speeches can run as late as 11 p.m. ET, meaning Colbert’s team may have to make some very quick turnarounds (”The Late Show” airs on CBS at 11:35 p.m.).He and his team “will bounce room to room ... and turn [news from the convention] into the monologue as quickly as we can,” he said. Colbert plans to be on the ground for some time during each convention, but will return to New York City each night to record the show.The Republican National Convention will be held in Cleveland from July 18 through July 21, while the Democratic National Convention is in Philadelphia from July 25 through July 28.Colbert is tapping a wide variety of guests to join him on his show. During the Republican convention, his guests are set to include Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), “Scandal” star Tony Goldwyn and comedian Keegan-Michael Key. During the Democratic convention, he’ll be joined by “Last Week Tonight” host John Oliver, former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin.According to Colbert, covering a convention is essentially “reporting on someone’s sales meeting.”“The convention has its own agenda,” he told Politico. “... And taking someone’s PR and sales at their face value is also a lot of fun.”"
8,POLITICS,Even Trump's Likely VP Pick Thinks His Muslim Ban Is Terrible,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-muslim-ban-donald-trump_us_5787c2c9e4b0867123e02e1d,Mike Pence also once vowed to vote for Ted Cruz over Trump.

Mike Pence (R) as his vice presidential pick. Pence in December rebuked Trump’s proposal as “offensive and unconstitutional.” As Pence began to emerge as Trump’s likely pick, he largely stood by his earlier remarks, telling reporters Tuesday at an event in Indianapolis that he’s “taken issues with the candidates from time to time.” Pressed on how he could share a ticket with a candidate whose proposals he didn’t support, Pence stopped short of criticizing Trump as pointedly as he did in December. “Look, I served in Congress for 12 years, I’ve been governor for three and a half years. I haven’t agreed with every one of my Republican colleagues or Democratic colleagues on every issue,” Pence said. “But I’m supporting Donald Trump because we need change in this country.”Though Pence objected to the proposed ban on Muslims ― who comprise nearly one-quarter of the world’s population ― he aligned himself with Trump on the idea of barring Syrian refugees fleeing civil war from entering the country. Following the deadly terror attacks in Paris, Trump said Syrian refugees could be a “Trojan Horse” for terrorists seeking entry to the U.S.All of the attackers were found to be European citizens and not refugees, but Pence and more than 30 other governors still objected to letting Syrian refugees into the U.S. in the aftermath. A federal judge later blocked Pence’s move to have agencies who help resettle refugees financially cut off. Pence’s disagreement with Trump’s Muslim ban isn’t the only issue that might cause awkwardness on the campaign trail: the governor in May pledged his support to former Trump rival Ted Cruz.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
9,POLITICS,Trump Polls At Zero Among Black Swing-State Voters,Samantha Neal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-polls-at-zero-black-swing-state-voters_us_5787f375e4b0867123e0681b,A new poll shows the presumptive GOP nominee performs abysmally among a key portion of the voting electorate. Sad!,2016-07-14,"U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign stop in Tampa, Florida, on Feb. 12.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5787f3971a00002600dd16c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Trump garners a whopping zero percent of the electorate among African-American voters in key swing states, a slice of the population that lies at the intersection of two key constituencies. The recent Wall Street Journal/NBC/Marist poll shows that among the entire Ohio electorate, Clinton and Trump tie at 39 percent. Across Pennsylvania, Trump trails Clinton by a 9-point margin. Yet among Ohio and Pennsylvania black voters, Trump’s poll numbers are utterly appalling ― he yields zero percent of the black vote in these key swing states. This comes as no surprise given Trump’s penchant for espousing politically incorrect statements, many of which have traditionally alienated minority voters. And new research from Pew shows that over half of the electorate says that treatment of minorities is very important to their vote for president; in fact, 82 percent of black voters say this is among the highest issue on their 2016 agenda.The Cook Political Report characterizes African-American voters as “the overlooked key to 2016.” According to exit poll data from 2012, African-American voters accounted for Obama’s margin of victory in seven key states: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada and Virginia. “Without these states’ 112 electoral votes,” the Cook Political Report writes, “Obama would have lost decisively.”And Trump’s abysmal poll numbers among black swing-state voters fares poorly in comparison to previously successful GOP candidates. George W. Bush, for instance, clinched 16 percent of the black vote in both Ohio and Pennsylvania in 2004.Unfortunately for Trump, swing state black voters aren’t the only segment of the population he should be concerned with winning over. He suffers among two other key slices of the electorate: white college educated voters and voters under 30. According to the Pew Research Center, Clinton leads Trump by 25 points among voters under 30. In fact, even Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson pulls a greater portion of this segment of the electorate than Trump. The GOP nominee even suffers among white college-educated voters, a demographic that not only constitutes one-third of the electorate but that Republicans have traditionally won since 1952. Among this group, Clinton crushes Trump by 16 percentage points, according to a Bloomberg poll. This signals trouble for Trump, chiefly when taking into account swing states where college-educated voters are a particularly dominant voting force, such as Virginia and Colorado. Trump fares much better among non-college educated voters ― and the feeling is mutual. As he once famously said: “I love the poorly educated.”"

So far, the two biggest donors for the events are the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the lobbying arm of the drug industry, and Anthem, Inc., a major health insurer. PhRMA and Anthem each contributed $50,000 to the committee, according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission.Unity Convention 2016 raises money for Priorities USA Action, the super PAC backing Clinton’s presidential campaign; Senate Majority PAC, which supports Democratic Senate candidates and is closely tied to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid; and House Majority PAC, which is close to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and is tasked with electing Democrats to the House. Each of these super PACs contributed $10,000 to help cover the cost of their convention events. PhRMA and Anthem are major lobbying forces in Washington with significant policy interests that will arise in the next administration and Congress. PhRMA and Blue Cross Blue Shield, of which Anthem is a member, are perennially two of the top 10 lobbying groups that spend the most, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Super PACs and dark money nonprofits are closely connected to donors with important lobbying interests, The Huffington Post has previously reported. PhRMA was the key player in the Washington influence industry to help the Obama administration push the Affordable Care Act through Congress. The lobbying group made a behind-the-scenes agreement to support the legislation as long at it did not include long-standing Democratic Party policies allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices for seniors or allow cheaper drugs to be imported from Canada and other countries. A draft of the 2016 Democratic Party platform, however, calls for Medicare to negotiate drug prices and allows for such drug importation. In addition, the platform calls for capping the price of prescription drugs, including how much Americans pay out-of-pocket for drugs, as well as expanding community health centers that can obtain cheaper drugs and increasing how quickly generics reach the market.The draft platform also includes a call for a public health insurance option to be created and offered to people using the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Clinton and President Barack Obama have both recently called for the public option to be adopted. But the public option was a controversial sticking point when Congress debated the legislation. Health insurers ― including Anthem, which was known at the time as WellPoint ― were adamantly opposed to the public option and also fought against the larger bill. In fact, health insurers played along with the Obama administration publicly to influence the legislation while working covertly with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to defeat it. The public option was ultimately left out of the legislation after then-Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut ― a state that a number of major insurers, including Anthem, call home ― refused to back the bill if it was included.That same draft platform, however, does not include a call for a single-payer health care system. Delegates affiliated with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pushed for a platform committee vote to adopt a government-run health insurance program, essentially Medicare for everyone, but were defeated by delegates connected to Clinton. Nothing scares health insurers more than efforts to replace them with government-provided insurance, as that would essentially put them out of business. Insurers, including Anthem, are currently funding the opposition to a Colorado ballot initiative to create a single-payer system for the state. Insurers have pumped $1 million into a ballot committee called Colorado for Coloradans to oppose Amendment 69, The Intercept reported. Anthem is the largest donor to the opposition, with a $500,000 donation. The Anthem-backed opposition employs a litany of Democratic Party consultants, including one employed by Priorities USA Action.Even more pressing for Anthem, though, is its pending merger with rival insurer Cigna, which comes at a time of increasing consolidation and monopolization across all industries. Democratic senators, including Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, have called for the Department of Justice to block the Anthem-Cigna deal, as well as a merger between Aetna and Humana. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), an increasingly influential politician who joined the push for the DOJ to reject the Anthem-Cigna merger, recently called for a new era of antitrust enforcement to prevent the consolidation of economic and political power. And for the first time since the 1980s, the Democratic Party’s platform includes a call to “enhance the antitrust enforcement arms of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and encourage other agencies to police anticompetitive practices in their areas of jurisdiction.”The Snoop Dogg concert is just one event planned for the week of the Democratic convention. Because a super Pac is funding it, its donors are required to be revealed to the public. There will be dozens more parties and events to fete lawmakers and other officials around Philadelphia that will be funded by undisclosed corporate interests."

Several senators urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in the weeks leading up to the break, which starts on Friday, to bring up a broader piece of legislation that contains a $220 million aid package for communities grappling with crumbling water infrastructure like Flint. “Here I was, wishful thinking for a long time,” Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) told The Huffington Post on Thursday. “I’m not criticizing Mitch, because he said if we can find a place ... we can do it, but it just didn’t happen.”In recent weeks, the Senate has been busy with legislation relating to the Zika virus threat and the opioid epidemic, and the debate over gun violence. Late last month, Inhofe and 29 other Republicans sent a letter to McConnell pressing him to bring the Water Resources Development bill that includes the Flint money up for a vote before the summer recess. But McConnell never did. Flint’s water has been tainted with lead since the state of Michigan switched the city’s water source to the Flint River in 2014 without following proper treatment protocols. The new water corroded the city’s lead pipes, and last fall research showed lead levels spiking in Flint kids’ blood. Lead is a dangerous toxin that can cause all kinds of health problems, including miscarriages and irreversible brain damage in children. In October, the Michigan government admitted it caused a crisis and warned residents not to drink the water, and in January, President Barack Obama declared a federal emergency. Earlier this year, Michigan Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, both Democrats, worked with Inhofe on a measure to provide loan credits for any city dealing with a presidentially declared water infrastructure emergency. But the legislation kept hitting procedural obstacles before finding a home in the water resources bill, and now time’s up.Congress will be gone until after Labor Day, and the remaining time left this session is small given a shortened calendar for the election year. Inhofe said he expects the bill to come up for a vote in September. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on Inhofe’s Committee on Environment and Public Works, told HuffPost that McConnell said it would get a vote at some point. “He said he was going to bring it up, so I’m encouraged by that,” Boxer said. Michigan is the only state that currently has the kind of presidentially declared water emergency required for help under the legislation. In August, the president’s emergency declaration will expire, though it’s already been extended once before. Testing shows Flint’s water still has too much lead, and is unsafe to drink without a filter. “Thousands of boys and girls now will never be who they could be because of lead in the water,” Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said on the floor Thursday. “No relief for them, zero relief. One hundred thousand live in that city. They were all adversely affected. They were all poisoned.”Though the problem is urgent, it’s also long term ― even with optimal treatment, every city faces the threat of lead-tainted water until it replaces its lead pipes. In that sense, extra federal help will never be too late.“It is critical that we get this done soon but it does not take the place of the state government’s need to act and act now,” Stabenow said in a statement. “The people of Flint have waited too long!”In a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Wednesday, Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) and other House Democrats complained that Flint had been left hanging. “In recent months, this Congress has brought forth legislation regarding other crises including the Puerto Rican debt crisis, the Zika virus and the opioid addiction epidemic, but has failed to bring up legislation to send resources to Flint to deal with the water crisis,” the letter said. Kildee wants consideration of his Families of Flint Act, a package of proposals including funds for replacing lead pipes and providing health monitoring to Flint kids with elevated blood lead levels. This week the House did approve two other Kildee-sponsored measures to help the city pay for pipe repairs and lead testing, but it’s not clear if those items will make it to the president’s desk. Some Flint residents also traveled to Washington this week, where they lobbied lawmakers to set up a victims’ compensation fund for Flint. “For everybody else, water is something you don’t think much of, because you go to your faucet for a cup of water, you can just go on about your day,” Flint resident Melissa Lightfoot, a mother of two, told The Detroit News. “For us, we’re not able to do that. We have to go, ‘Oh, I have to go to my basement and get another thing of bottled water because we used all the ones that we had.’”"

Republicans released a list of 62 convention speakers Thursday. According to a count by The Huffington Post, approximately 65 percent of them are men and 82 percent are white. The gender breakdown isn’t that far off from the 2012 Republican convention ― 63 percent male ― or the Democratic convention that same year ― 62 percent male. But it is worse on including speakers of color. In 2012, GOP convention speakers were 78 percent white. Democrats’ 2012 speakers were 62 percent white. Democrats have not yet released a list of speakers for their 2016 gathering, which will take place in Philadelphia the week after Republicans meet. This year, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) appears to be the Republicans’ only Hispanic speaker, and Lisa Shin ― a New Mexico doctor and member of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump ― the only Asian-American speaker.In contrast, in 2012, Mitt Romney’s campaign featured up-and-coming minority politicians like New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. And since then, the Republican National Committee has tried to do a significant amount of outreach to minority communities, recognizing the GOP can’t simply rely on white voters due to the country’s changing demographics.The 2012 convention also showcased the top politicians in the party ― people like Sen. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), Rep. Mia Love (Utah) and Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval. This year, many GOP leaders are staying away or making themselves scarce. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker will be there. Walker has endorsed Trump, but barely.Trump also promised his convention would be full of celebrities ― including people who could appeal directly to the public, not just political insiders. But the lineup doesn’t really deliver. The most notable non-politicians are athletes, including Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White and professional golfer Natalie Gulbis.The Huffington Post was unable to account for one speaker on Trump’s convention list: Alex Wist. An internet search didn’t really turn up any results, and the RNC did not return a request for comment on him. This piece has been updated to count only the speakers the RNC released Thursday, without the inclusion of three additional speakers reported by The New York Times. One of those speakers, former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow, said Thursday evening that he would not be speaking at the convention. "

He was later taken to the hospital. That night, Cooper tweeted that Perry was “stable right now, with family & is under the best care.” Apparently, that wasn’t enough information to put Tyler at ease. “I don’t give a s**t about the band. I want Joe to live,” the Aerosmith frontman said. “I’m really concerned and worried right now that I’m not getting any news. I’m a little bummed out, and that scares me. I don’t know whether it’s heat prostration or whether he’s been working himself too hard or getting off on wrong things passionately.” Though Perry’s camp has yet to issue an updated statement about the rocker’s health, a representative for the Hollywood Vampires told People on July 11, “Joe Perry will rejoin his fellow Vampires on stage again soon.” To read the rest of Tyler’s interview with Billboard, head here.

Meanwhile, 62 percent of voters polled said the same of Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.That number rose 5 percent for Clinton since pollsters asked the same question last month, before FBI Director James Comey determined that her decision to use a private email server while she was secretary of state was “extremely careless,” but did not merit criminal charges.On Monday, a separate ABC/Washington Post poll found that 56 percent of respondents disagreed with Comey’s decision.It’s admittedly not an exact measure of honesty or trustworthiness, but PolitiFact, a fact-checking website, found that 51 percent of Clinton’s statements are “true” or “mostly true.”PolitiFact’s same analysis for Trump found just 11 percent of his statements to be “true” or “mostly true.” The vast majority of them ― 58 percent ― are split between “false” (39 percent) and the even more incendiary “pants on fire” category (19 percent).The CBS/New York Times poll isn’t all bad news for Clinton, however.

Meanwhile, 62 percent of voters polled said the same of Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.That number rose 5 percent for Clinton since pollsters asked the same question last month, before FBI Director James Comey determined that her decision to use a private email server while she was secretary of state was “extremely careless,” but did not merit criminal charges.On Monday, a separate ABC/Washington Post poll found that 56 percent of respondents disagreed with Comey’s decision.It’s admittedly not an exact measure of honesty or trustworthiness, but PolitiFact, a fact-checking website, found that 51 percent of Clinton’s statements are “true” or “mostly true.”PolitiFact’s same analysis for Trump found just 11 percent of his statements to be “true” or “mostly true.” The vast majority of them ― 58 percent ― are split between “false” (39 percent) and the even more incendiary “pants on fire” category (19 percent).The CBS/New York Times poll isn’t all bad news for Clinton, however.

17,POLITICS,Unusual Polling Question Reveals Which Candidate Is More Likely To Win In November,Samantha Neal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poll-candidate-expected-win-clinton_us_5787c63de4b08608d33379be,We usually ask voters which candidate they plan to cast a ballot for. But asking which one they think will win actually reveals more.,2016-07-14,"Hillary Clinton delivers a speech at the Old State House in Springfield, Illinois, on July 13, 2016. A surprise question reveals how likely she is to win the election in November.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5787c68e1a000023006fa6ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump has recently been gaining ground in the latest polls at both the national and state level, suggesting that the email scandal plaguing Hillary Clinton has not left her unscathed. However, when polls ask voters who they think will win the election rather than whom they plan to vote for, people overwhelmingly believe Clinton will prevail. If the predictive capacity of the “expectations question” is as accurate as it has been in previous years, Clinton is poised to win this election. In fact, she currently polls better than President Barack Obama did against Mitt Romney and John McCain at this point in 2012 and 2008, on both whom voters expect to win and whom they plan to cast their ballot for.Questions that measure voter expectations are often more accurate at predicting a winner than asking people which candidate they will vote for. These questions typically read along the lines of, “Regardless of who you are voting for, who do you think will win the election?” When asked to provide objective expectations as opposed to subjective intent, respondents must evaluate a wider variety of preferences than simply their own.As for which candidate voters think will prevail in November, Clinton utterly eclipses Trump. According to every pollster who has tracked this question over the past month (YouGov/Economist, NBC/SurveyMonkey, Suffolk University, CNN/ORC, CBS), Clinton wins by a margin ranging from 16 to 28 percentage points ― and this lead has been sustained over the entire course of the general election.On the intent question (”Who are you voting for?”), the HuffPost Pollster model, which aggregates all publicly available polling data, shows a much tighter race. Clinton only leads by a 3-point margin.Looking back on the last three presidential elections, the expectations question predicted the overall outcome much more accurately than the intent question in nearly every poll who asked it in months leading up to the election. At this stage in the 2012 election, Obama led Romney by an average of 25 points on the expectations question, according to polls from YouGov/Economist, Suffolk, Gallup, CNN/ORC, ABC/Washington Post and Pew. The voter intent question indicated a much closer race ― Romney and Obama were within 1 point of each other. The same pattern holds in both the 2008 and 2004 races.The merit of the expectations question has been researched extensively by David Rothschild and Justin Wolfers, who argue that asking people whom they expect will win instead of whom they prefer “grabs a much larger slice of people’s experience and knowledge, including a whole range of idiosyncratic facts” that are otherwise impossible to quantify. In this sense, voters are prompted to make a projection based on their cumulative experiences, which typically produces a more accurate prediction than a singular vote can.The expectations question also reveals something about our own beliefs: We’re influenced by the way we perceive other people think.In other words, people are more likely to vote for the candidate they think will win because of a “bandwagoning effect” ― or the idea that individuals will vote for a candidate that they believe others are voting for. The implications of these findings for the 2016 election are clear: For one, polling indicates that people overwhelmingly believe Clinton will win the election. (And recent history shows that’s an accurate prediction.) Also, the overarching perception that Clinton is going to win could also garner her more votes among undecided voters in the fall. "
18,POLITICS,Top Rabbi At Jared Kushner's Synagogue To Speak At Republican National Convention,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rabbi-kushner-synagogue-rnc_us_5787bdc7e4b03fc3ee4fc0d4,Rabbi Emeritus Haskel Lookstein apparently isn't bothered by Trump's popularity among neo-Nazis.,2016-07-14,Rabbi Haskel Lookstein's appearance at the RNC is an effort by the Trump campaign to bolster Trump's credibility in the Jewish community after the candidate refused to disavow his anti-Semitic fans and tweeted a meme previously posted on a neo-Nazi website.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rabbi Emeritus Haskel Lookstein from Jared Kushner’s synagogue will speak at the Republican National Convention, a four-day event billed as a celebration of the “core themes” of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign. The inclusion of Lookstein, from the Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, on the speakers list is the latest effort by the Trump campaign to counter criticism that Trump has shied away from condemning his neo-Nazi supporters and has, at times, propagated blatantly anti-Semitic images and themes himself. Until now, the leadership at Kehilath Jeshurun, an Orthodox synagogue in New York’s Upper East Side, has avoided both endorsing either candidate and weighing in on the controversy surrounding the father-in-law of Kushner, one of their more prominent members. Last month, The Huffington Post surveyed the rabbis at Kehilath Jeshurun, asking for their thoughts on Trump’s silence after dozens of his neo-Nazi fans hurled Holocaust-themed death threats at Jewish reporters who dared criticize their “Glorious Leader.” Lookstein, through an assistant, declined to comment. Other rabbis at the synagogue voiced cautiously-worded concern but stopped short of outright condemning the reality television star. “You would hope that he would say something more direct ― say, “Don’t say things like this.’ I don’t know why he or any candidate wouldn’t want to make a statement like that,” Rabbi Elie Weinstock said in a phone conversation in mid-June. “I think that’s sort of the nature of politics. You may like certain things about someone. Donald Trump has said positive things about Israel and things that resonate with the Jewish community. And yet there are these supporters of his that go off and do harmful things and hateful things that you sort of can’t imagine are taking place,” continued Weinstock, who has written that he is a registered Democrat.Rabbi Roy Feldman, who is also affiliated with Kehilath Jeshurun but said he does not know Kushner or the Trump family personally, said he doesn’t think the community holds Kushner responsible for Trump’s failure to condemn his anti-Semitic fans. “I am not sure to what extent Mr. Trump listens to his advisors,” Feldman said. The tension between Kushner’s Orthodox Jewish faith and the recurring anti-Semitic undertones of the Trump campaign peaked earlier this month after Trump tweeted a meme that was previously posted on a neo-Nazi website. The image depicted Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s face over a pile of money next to a six-pointed Star of David, emblazoned with “Most Corrupt Candidate Ever.” Days later, Dana Schwartz, a reporter at the Observer, a paper owned by Kushner, wrote an open letter to her boss, essentially asking how he could stomach supporting a candidate who openly flirts with anti-Semitic rhetoric and then plays dumb when called out for it. The letter prompted Kushner to break his silence on the issue and pen a response, defending his father-in-law an “incredibly loving and tolerant” man. He invoked his grandparents’ history as Holocaust survivors, and accused the media of “mob mentality” for reporting on the curious relationship the Trump campaign has developed with anti-Semitic groups. The offensive tweet, Kushner suggested, was the result of Trump having a small, fast-moving team rather than “armies of handlers” ― a clear jab at the Clinton campaign. If Lookstein’s presence at the RNC is an attempt to bolster Trump’s credibility with Jewish voters, another faith-based speaker at the event may dampen that effect. Pastor Mark Burns, who once told the crowd at a Trump rally that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) a Jewish Democratic contender in the race, needed to “get saved” and “meet Jesus,” is also listed as a speaker at the convention.Lookstein did not respond to a request for comment on why he’s chosen to attend the convention, which can be interpreted as offering tacit support to Trump.Fortunately for Lookstein, Trump opted to make the theme of next week’s confab, “Make America Great Again” rather than his second-favorite catch-phrase, “America First” ― an expression widely used by Americans who opposed efforts to overthrow Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and warned that “the greatest danger” to the U.S. was the influence Jews exerted over movies, radio, media and the government.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Just ask Mila Kunis who, in an interview with Babble, described a trip she and her daughter Wyatt made last year to go visit Kunis’ husband, Ashton Kutcher, at work. After ensuring she had packed all the necessities and prepared for any possible baby emergencies, Kunis realized while driving that her daughter wasn’t strapped into her car seat.“I was like, oh, f**k me,” she said. “And I’m on the 101, and she’s just like blah, like fine in her car seat, nothing, no strap whatsoever. And I think I just turned white.”Kunis told Babble she quickly pulled over and buckled Wyatt in and later cried when she told Kutcher about the incident. Just a few weeks ago, she also realized Kutcher had made the same mistake with their daughter when she got her out of the backseat and noticed she wasn’t strapped in. She said discovering this made her feel less alone in her chaotic parenting journey that moms and dads know all too well.Luckily, Kunis hasn’t been too hard on herself because of a mistake many parents have probably made. While promoting “Bad Moms,” she told ET Canada she considered herself to be a “pretty solid mom” to Wyatt. “I’m the only mom my daughter is hopefully ever going to know and I’m the best version there is for her,” she said. “I’ve only been a mom for 21 months.”No doubt Kunis, who announced last month that she is expecting, will be a “solid mom” to her second child, too.H/T Babble"

Oddly, the actor who played the series’ original Sulu, George Takei ― an openly gay LGBT activist ― seemed to take issue with the decision for a moment last week, saying it wasn’t true to “Star Trek” creator Gene Roddenberry’s vision. Takei has since clarified his comments, saying he was “not disappointed” by the character.In a recent interview, The Huffington Post asked producer J.J. Abrams about the decision to portray Sulu as gay, along with his thoughts on Takei’s media snafu. Make no mistake: Abrams is fully on board.“It’s about time that there’s a gay character in this universe,” Abrams told HuffPost.“It is done, as you saw, in a way that is not in the story of the movie, which is one of my favorite things about it. It’s beside the point. I feel that George Takei’s reaction ― I’m sure has more to do with George Takei, and the baggage he brings to the proceedings. I think it may be his perception of having played a character a certain way. It might mean something personally to him. I have nothing but respect for the man, but I think it’s a preposterous thing for, of all people, a ‘Star Trek’ actor — who’s come out himself — to say that Gene Roddenberry wouldn’t have wanted this.” Abrams, in fact, believed the “Star Trek” creator would have applauded the decision over Sulu. “One of the many things I admire about [Roddenberry] was … how he was so about inclusivity, and I can’t imagine that he would not have wanted one of these characters, if he had been allowed ― which, of course, he would never have been allowed to in that era ― [to] have them be gay.”Abrams continued, “It feels like that is classic Roddenberry, so I don’t know what or why George Takei would take issue with it. I understand he’s backtracked a little bit. But I love the way [writers] Simon Pegg, Doug Jung and [director] Justin Lin did it. Doug Jung, who’s the co-writer, actually plays the husband of Sulu. I think it’s something I’m really proud of.”Now with three “Star Trek” films under his belt, Abrams says his outlook has changed drastically since taking on his first. The producer says he’s come to love how open the franchise’s universe really is.“Of the many things I hope that this film honors, and what Roddenberry did, is that sense of family,” he said. “No matter what you look like, no matter what your cultural, religious, sexual preferences are, regardless of your sex or in fact species, that we are all reliant upon each other and part of a collective. And I think that that’s the thing that resonates the most to me about these stories.”“Star Trek Beyond” hits theaters July 22. "

Her vow to act on her own regarding immigration was particularly significant given the Supreme Court’s recent ruling that left President Barack Obama’s policies on deportation relief at a standstill. Clinton first said more than a year ago that she would go further than he did, and she said the Supreme Court’s split decision hasn’t changed that. “I’ve said throughout this campaign that DAPA is squarely within the president’s authority and I will keep saying that and fighting for it,” she said in a speech to the League of United Latin American Citizens conference, referring to the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program. “But there’s more we can do.” Clinton said she would create “a simple, straight-forward system where people with sympathetic cases or who can show a history of service to their communities can make their case and be eligible for deferred action,” similar to the one that allows victims of labor abuses to stay in the country. She also promised a bill within the first 100 days of her presidency that would address the issue comprehensively, including a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.Her speech was an effort to solidify her support with Latino voters, a growing community that largely favors her over presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. She told the crowd that Latinos are the future of America and that they could decide the election, as long as they register and vote. That would include putting more politicians in Congress who support comprehensive immigration reform. Republicans appeared to be moving that way, or at least toward legal status for some undocumented immigrants, in 2013, when the Senate passed a reform bill co-authored by GOP senators. Even with a pro-mass-deportation candidate like Trump leading the party, Clinton argued, there’s still potential to get back to some agreement on the matter. “We do, in my opinion, have a consensus that something must be done,” Clinton said of immigration. “Whether we get it done will depend on this election.” The Republican National Committee, unsurprisingly, did not seem to agree. Its Hispanic communications director, Helen Aguirre Ferré, called the speech “world-class pandering” in a statement and said Clinton’s “support for President Obama’s lawless executive overreach to fix our broken immigration system clearly shows that she has zero intention of working with Congress or respecting our Constitution in solving the issue.” Clinton’s speech went beyond immigration: She also promised efforts to close the wage gap, expand education opportunities and boost employment through infrastructure spending that she said would particularly help Latinos because they make up a significant portion of the construction industry.More broadly, she painted the election as a referendum on whether Americans want to celebrate the country’s diversity or oppose it, citing Trump’s attacks on Latinos, including an Indiana-born judge who the candidate said was biased against him due to the judge’s Mexican heritage. Clinton said Trump “is running the most divisive campaign of our lifetime” and telling people to be afraid of those with different ethnicities, religious faiths and places of birth. “That’s, my friends, no innuendo or dog whistle anymore. It’s all out in the open now,” she said. “So we’ve got to come back twice as strong and twice as clear. We have got to say with one voice that Latinos are a vital part of the American community.” "

Just don't read the Constitution.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5787b69d1a000024006fa657.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans have never made it easy for President Barack Obama to confirm judges. But Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) came up with a new reason the Senate shouldn’t be filling empty court seats: It’s not our job.Democrats including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Mazie Hirono (Hawaii) made repeated requests Wednesday to confirm a batch of Obama’s judicial nominees who are ready for votes. Each time they tried, Tillis objected and suggested the Senate shouldn’t be spending time on judges.“What we get are things that have nothing to do with doing our jobs,” he said. “I’m doing my job today and objecting to these measures so we can actually get back to pressing matters.”It’s a weird thing to say since it is literally the Senate’s job to confirm judges, as spelled out in the Constitution. It’s also ironic that Tillis is the one saying this, given that he’s overseeing the longest federal court vacancy in the country. There’s been an empty seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina for 3,848 days, or 10.5 years.Democrats seemed perplexed by Tillis’ rationale.“I’m not sure what version of the Constitution you’re reading that doesn’t say confirming judges is part of your job in the United States Senate,” Warren said.“Of course confirming judges is part of the Senate’s job,” Hirono said. “In fact, only the Senate can do that.”Tillis spokesman Daniel Keylin later declined to clarify to HuffPost why Tillis said it isn’t the Senate’s job to confirm judges. Instead, he criticized Democrats for “refusing to do their jobs” by using Senate floor time to request votes on judges when Republicans wanted to debate bills relating to veterans and troops.“Rather than pontificating your own personal political views, you should refer back to his remarks, which put judicial confirmations into historical context,” Keylin said.Congress is about to recess until early September, and since it’s a presidential election year, when judicial confirmations tend to peter out in the fall, Democrats have been pushing to confirm at least some judges before they leave. At least 24 judicial nominees are ready for votes. None are controversial, and all have bipartisan support. In fact, 23 of them were confirmed unanimously by the Judiciary Committee, of which Tillis is a member.But they’ve stalled because of politics. GOP leaders want to leave those court seats empty until next year, when they’re hoping Donald Trump will be in the White House and put forward more conservative nominees.The problem with that is some courts really need vacancies filled ― some have been waiting years ― and because the Senate has been moving so slowly to fill them, court vacancies have been skyrocketing. Cases are getting backed up for years and judges are burning out trying to keep up. Even some Republicans are urging their leadership to let nominees get votes.“Talk is cheap. Real cases are piling up. Real courts are starved for help,” Warren said. “If Senate Republicans leave town without putting a single one of these highly qualified, non-controversial judicial nominees on the bench, they are making it clear that for them … politics trumps everything. Even an independent judiciary.”Watch Tillis’ exchange with Democrats below.This post has been updated with comment from Tillis’ spokesman."

Traditionally, the vice presidential choice is used to build enthusiasm among party loyalists.Trump’s choice of running mate is seen as critical because his defeat of 16 rivals in the Republican primary race left the party divided and some party leaders are still uneasy about some of his campaign positions, and his style.Sources familiar with campaign operations cautioned that while Pence and former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich were finalists, Trump could always have a last-minute change of heart and choose someone else from his short list.A source close to the campaign said Trump appeared to be leaning toward Pence but could easily change his mind.Gingrich told an ABC News correspondent he expected to hear Trump’s decision after 1 p.m. EDT and would not be surprised if Trump chooses Pence.New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, 53, a former rival to Trump in the presidential race, is also high on the list of potential running mates and provides the kind of counterpunch to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton that Republicans like.Pence, 57, a former congressman, is seen as a safe choice, not too flashy but popular among conservatives, with Midwestern appeal and the ability to rally more party faithful behind Trump.Gingrich, 73, is a close adviser to Trump with a wealth of ideas and deep experience in the legislative process from his time as speaker of the House of Representatives in the 1990s.In what has been an unusually public process, Trump, 70, sat down with both Pence and Gingrich separately in Indianapolis on Wednesday.He also met with a fourth potential No. 2, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, 69, of Alabama, who has been one of Trump’s closest advisers.The New York businessman had dinner with Pence on Tuesday night after they appeared together at a rally. Trump, joined by daughter Ivanka and sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, had breakfast with Pence and his wife, Karen, on Wednesday at the governor’s residence in Indianapolis.Trump adviser Ed Brookover told CNN that Trump “first and foremost” wants a running mate who he has good chemistry with and someone who can help him govern best.(Reporting By Steve Holland; Editing by Peter Cooney and Frances Kerry)"

Lamar Smith claims those probes are trying to ""silence free speech.""",2016-07-14,Rep. Lamar Smith has a long history of denying climate change.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585840961200008310ef02d2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In his latest showing of support for Big Oil, a House Republican has subpoenaed state attorneys general and environmental groups that are investigating whether companies like Exxon Mobil committed fraud by covering up the risks of climate change.Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) said during a press conference Wednesday that the subpoenas are necessary to “protect the American people from further infringement of their free speech rights.”Smith, who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, has a long history of denying climate change and going after those who accept the scientific consensus.The investigations led by the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts, Smith said, “amount to a form of extortion,” “threaten legitimate scientific debate about climate change” and are a “blatant effort to silence free speech.”The congressman’s First Amendment argument is also a go-to defense for the oil industry in its fight to keep buried what it knew about the effects of fossil fuels and when.In November of last year, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Exxon seeking documents related to the allegations that it lied to the public and its investors. In March, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said her office would join the Exxon Mobil probes in New York and California. In June, Exxon filed a lawsuit against Healy in an effort to bar a so-called civil investigative demand from her office.Also this spring, a larger coalition called AGs United for Clean Power formed after reports by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times found that Exxon executives were aware of the climate risks associated with carbon dioxide emissions, but funded research to cover up those risks and block solutions.A recent investigation by the Washington-based Center for International Environmental Law uncovered documents showing that the oil industry, including Humble Oil (now Exxon Mobil), was on notice about the potential role of fossil fuels in CO2 emissions no later than 1957 and already “shaping science to shape public opinion” in the 1940s.Responding to the congressman’s announcement on Wednesday, Eric Soufer, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said the American people “will wake up tomorrow morning shaking their heads when they learn that a small group of radical Republican House members is trying to block a serious law enforcement investigation into potential fraud at Exxon.”Smith’s committee, he added, “has no authority to interfere with these state law enforcement investigations.” Moreover, Soufer said that the New York attorney general “will not be intimidated or deterred from ensuring that every New Yorker receives the full protection of state laws.”Republican members of the science committee who joined with Smith on Wednesday saw things very differently. Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas) accused the attorneys general involved in the investigation of veering away from enforcing the law and participating in “environmental activism.”“Since when did it become a crime to express an opinion or to even hold an opinion?” Weber asked. “This posse of attorneys general believe that those whose opinion or scientific research conflict with the alleged consensus view on climate change should be the subject of an investigation and possible prosecution by none other than our own government officials. You talk about a chilling effect on free speech.”He claimed that the attorneys general sought to intimidate and put out of business those who disagree with their views on climate change.At least three of the eight environmental groups being subpoenaed ― Greenpeace, the Union of Concerned Scientists and 350.org ― slammed Smith’s announcement in public statements.“It’s beyond ironic for Chairman Smith to violate our actual free speech rights in the name of protecting ExxonMobil’s supposed right to misrepresent the work of its own scientists and deceive shareholders and the public,” said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists.May Boeve, 350.org’s executive director, called the subpoenas an “obvious attempt by Exxon’s Congressional allies to intimidate critics of the company.”“It’s going to have the opposite effect,” Boeve said. “They may want to silence us, but we’re just going to keep getting louder.”Smith questioned the groups’ motives on Wednesday.

Lamar Smith claims those probes are trying to ""silence free speech.""",2016-07-14,New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is looking into possible fraud by the oil industry.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5786a5991b00002700f6dc47.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In his latest showing of support for Big Oil, a House Republican has subpoenaed state attorneys general and environmental groups that are investigating whether companies like Exxon Mobil committed fraud by covering up the risks of climate change.Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) said during a press conference Wednesday that the subpoenas are necessary to “protect the American people from further infringement of their free speech rights.”Smith, who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, has a long history of denying climate change and going after those who accept the scientific consensus.The investigations led by the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts, Smith said, “amount to a form of extortion,” “threaten legitimate scientific debate about climate change” and are a “blatant effort to silence free speech.”The congressman’s First Amendment argument is also a go-to defense for the oil industry in its fight to keep buried what it knew about the effects of fossil fuels and when.In November of last year, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Exxon seeking documents related to the allegations that it lied to the public and its investors. In March, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said her office would join the Exxon Mobil probes in New York and California. In June, Exxon filed a lawsuit against Healy in an effort to bar a so-called civil investigative demand from her office.Also this spring, a larger coalition called AGs United for Clean Power formed after reports by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times found that Exxon executives were aware of the climate risks associated with carbon dioxide emissions, but funded research to cover up those risks and block solutions.A recent investigation by the Washington-based Center for International Environmental Law uncovered documents showing that the oil industry, including Humble Oil (now Exxon Mobil), was on notice about the potential role of fossil fuels in CO2 emissions no later than 1957 and already “shaping science to shape public opinion” in the 1940s.Responding to the congressman’s announcement on Wednesday, Eric Soufer, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said the American people “will wake up tomorrow morning shaking their heads when they learn that a small group of radical Republican House members is trying to block a serious law enforcement investigation into potential fraud at Exxon.”Smith’s committee, he added, “has no authority to interfere with these state law enforcement investigations.” Moreover, Soufer said that the New York attorney general “will not be intimidated or deterred from ensuring that every New Yorker receives the full protection of state laws.”Republican members of the science committee who joined with Smith on Wednesday saw things very differently. Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas) accused the attorneys general involved in the investigation of veering away from enforcing the law and participating in “environmental activism.”“Since when did it become a crime to express an opinion or to even hold an opinion?” Weber asked. “This posse of attorneys general believe that those whose opinion or scientific research conflict with the alleged consensus view on climate change should be the subject of an investigation and possible prosecution by none other than our own government officials. You talk about a chilling effect on free speech.”He claimed that the attorneys general sought to intimidate and put out of business those who disagree with their views on climate change.At least three of the eight environmental groups being subpoenaed ― Greenpeace, the Union of Concerned Scientists and 350.org ― slammed Smith’s announcement in public statements.“It’s beyond ironic for Chairman Smith to violate our actual free speech rights in the name of protecting ExxonMobil’s supposed right to misrepresent the work of its own scientists and deceive shareholders and the public,” said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists.May Boeve, 350.org’s executive director, called the subpoenas an “obvious attempt by Exxon’s Congressional allies to intimidate critics of the company.”“It’s going to have the opposite effect,” Boeve said. “They may want to silence us, but we’re just going to keep getting louder.”Smith questioned the groups’ motives on Wednesday. Those investigating the industry, he said, “want the companies to settle out of court so they can obtain funds for their own purposes.”The congressman has received $675,597 in donations from the oil and gas industry since 1989, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets.org."
26,POLITICS,Congress Passes Industry-Backed GMO Bill,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-passes-industry-backed-gmo-bill_us_5787c0b5e4b03fc3ee4fc617,The measure wipes out a Vermont law that made clear labels mandatory.,2016-07-14,"Paul Ryan's House of Representatives passed a controversial bill that erases Vermont's GMO label law, among others.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5787ca0d1a000024006fa6da.jpeg?cache=QO1JgSkBsQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Congress passed a bill on Thursday that wipes out state laws requiring the labeling of genetically modified ingredients in food.The bill particularly strikes down a Vermont labeling law that just went into effect this month and required ingredients derived from genetic engineering to be disclosed on packaging.The new bill, which passed 306-117 in the House, is expected to be signed by President Barack Obama. It makes the explicit labeling of genetically modified ingredients voluntary, and says that companies may instead use a computer-generated “quick response” or QR code. Consumers can scan that code with a smartphone and go to a website to find out if a product has GMOs.Not all ingredients that come from genetically modified plants would have to be labeled, either. If modified genes are removed in the manufacturing process ― something that happens with soy oil, sugar and corn syrup ― there would not have to be a notification.The bill’s backers said it would give customers who are interested in discovering the contents of their food a way to do so without adding costs for businesses or creating a patchwork of state laws.“Without this legislation, inconsistent state-level food labeling laws will lead to market disruptions and supply chain complications, which are simply intolerable for our ranchers and our farmers and those attempting to feed the world,” said Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.). “It would not only harm agriculture communities but result in higher prices at the grocery.”While some opponents of the bill have argued about the safety of GMOs, highly regarded scientists have called them safe.But most of the opponents did not argue about safety, pointing instead to consumers’ desire to know what is in their food and where it comes from.“This is not about passing judgment on the safety or the science behind genetic engineering,” said Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.). “It’s to say that 90 percent of the American people want to know what’s in their food.”The vote was more bipartisan that usual, with a sizable number of members from each party differing. One Republican who sided against the bill said it just made no sense for busy shoppers.“Food labeling needs to be simple and clear,” said Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.). “QR codes and telephone numbers do not meet that definition. What mother shopping with her children is going to stop in the middle of the food aisle to call a company or go on a website to check the content of every product they would like to buy?”Others said the bill was a boon to big agribusinesses that would rather not have anyone worried about GMOs.“Let’s be honest. This is exactly what some in big industry want. They want people to be confused. They don’t want people to have access to information,” said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.). “And when big industry speaks, Congress not only listens, Congress rolls over and gives big industry whatever it wants.”McGovern predicted that Americans would eventually demand a clearer system.“For those who think this ends the debate, that this is it, I have a prediction: You’re wrong,” McGovern said. “People are going to continue to fight to demand clear mandatory GMO labeling. They have a right to know what is in their food.”"

As he walked back, two young men with face masks told him to “give it up,” and at least one of them pulled out a pistol, according to the Aurora Sentinel.Marquez, a 10-year veteran of the department, was shot in the chest and abdomen multiple times before one of the suspects ran away. But he managed to open fire and shoot the other suspect, Jhalil Meshesha, in the leg.Another bullet from Marquez’s .45-caliber handgun went straight into the barrel of Meshesha’s pistol.“It ... actually hit Meshesha’s .40-caliber handgun and traveled down the barrel, colliding with a cartridge that was in the chamber of the gun,” according to a letter written by Arapahoe County Deputy District Attorney Rich Orman to Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader and Aurora Police Chief Nick Metz.Matt Ingui, the investigating detective, described the shot as a “one in a billion thing,” according to KDVR.com.Prosecutors said Marquez acted appropriately when, believing his life to be in danger, he shot his gun. He will not be charged in the shooting, according to the Denver Channel.The bullets that hit Marquez damaged his intestines, colon and liver and caused fractured ribs. Although he is currently not on duty, sheriff’s spokesman Mark Techmeyer told the Denver Post that the department is “still hopeful for a full recovery.”"

32,BUSINESS,This Is How Far Trump Will Go To Stop Staffers From Leaking Info,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-lawsuit-confidentiality-agreement_us_5786ea70e4b08608d332f5db,A $10 million lawsuit has revealed a confidentiality agreement between the campaign and a former staffer.,2016-07-14,"Donald Trump really, really doesn't want his staffers leaking info to the press.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578790971b00002700f6de19.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A confidentiality agreement filed as part of a lawsuit between Donald Trump and an ex-staffer shows just how far the presumptive GOP nominee will go to ensure his employees don’t talk about what goes on behind closed doors. The open-ended agreement allows Trump himself to define what information it covers and forces all disagreements to be settled in private. It was submitted on Tuesday as part of a lawsuit the campaign filed against Sam Nunberg, a former staffer fired last year over racist posts on Facebook, and unsealed Wednesday.The Trump campaign is seeking $10 million in damages because it says Nunberg leaked information to the press. Nunberg, in addition to disputing the contract, says he did not leak the information.The Trump NDA also demonstrates just how powerful these types of agreements can be ― it’s slanted against the signatory and leaves far more power in Trump’s hands. Corporations are increasingly favoring these types of broad contracts.The agreement prevents the signatory from disclosing any confidential information or saying anything negative about “Mr. Trump, any Family Member, any Trump Company, or any Family member company,” or any assets any of those entities own. Confidential information, the document says, includes anything Trump wishes to remain private.The agreement also includes a very broad non-compete clause that prohibits Nunberg from working or volunteering for any state or national campaign other than Trump’s while Trump is a presidential candidate.The agreement also says that if Trump chooses, he can sue Nunberg in New York court or decide to take the case to binding arbitration, and Nunberg cannot contest Trump’s decision. In other words, Nunberg has no choice but binding arbitration, while Trump retains his right to sue Nunberg in any court if he wants to.The campaign’s use of such a broad confidentiality agreement combined with forced arbitration would likely have kept the details of the dispute secret, but for one point: The contract the Trump campaign is seeking to enforce was between Nunberg and an entity called Trump 2012 PCA. Nunberg says that Trump 2012 PCA is a fake entity and that the NDA is therefore invalid.Instead, Nunberg says the contract that should apply is the consulting agreement he signed with the Trump exploratory committee. That contract doesn’t include an NDA, and requires that all disagreements be settled in a trial by judge.Trump is known to require both his corporate and political employees to sign confidentiality agreements. Recently, the Associated Press reported that Trump’s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was prohibited by a confidentiality agreement from revealing private or negative information about Trump in his role as a news analyst on CNN, leading to questions about what value he could provide viewers beyond pro-Trump talking points.It’s not just Trump’s senior staffers, however, who are required to sign NDAs. The Associated Press reported in June that “campaign volunteers and even a maker of his famous ‘Make America Great Again’ hats” have to sign NDAs.Read the agreement below: "

Mike Pence, manages to combine the two.Pence remains basically an unknown outside his home state of Indiana. While 5 percent of American voters rate him favorably and 8 percent rate him unfavorably, 86 percent don’t have any opinion of the governor at all, according to a July CBS survey. Just 7 percent of Republican Party voters view him favorably, while 6 percent have a negative opinion and the rest are unsure.A recent McClatchy-Marist survey found Pence slightly better known but somewhat more disliked, with 12 percent of Americans rating him favorably, 21 percent unfavorably and 68 percent not sure what they think. Republican voters’ opinions were more evenly split, with 15 percent viewing him favorably and 15 percent rating him unfavorably.Pence’s relative anonymity puts him in the company of past VP picks, many of whom were far from national figures, as FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten notes. Although he is far less controversial than some other potential Trump choices ― such as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ― Pence would also be one of the least-liked VP nominees since at least 1976.A Morning Consult survey conducted last weekend found that Pence’s selection would likely be a wash for the GOP ticket, with 12 percent of voters saying it would make them more likely to back Trump, 12 percent saying it would make them less likely, and the remaining three-quarters saying either that it would have no impact or that they weren’t sure. Choosing Pence might not make much difference even in Indiana, where polls already show Trump comfortably ahead. While Barack Obama won the state in 2008, it has gone Republican in every other presidential election since 1968.But within his home state, the Indiana governor is a polarizing figure. Voters there are evenly split in their views of Pence’s gubernatorial record, according to a May survey conducted by NBC News, The Wall Street Journal and Marist University.In 2013, Pence was generally well-liked by Indiana residents, scoring a 52 percent favorable rating in a poll from Howey Politics Indiana. Then his ratings slid precipitously in the wake of a national controversy over the state’s “religious freedom” law, which would have allowed businesses to refuse service to LGBT customers on religious grounds. An April 2015 HPI poll found his favorable rating down to just 35 percent.“I’ve been covering Indiana politics for three decades, and I don’t recall a sitting governor experiencing that kind of decline over this short period of time like we’ve seen here,” HPI publisher Brian Howey said last year.Both electoral precedent and current polling suggest that most vice presidential nominees do relatively little to help or hurt their tickets.Fewer than one-third of undecided voters this month said that the choice of vice presidential nominee would be very important to their presidential vote, according to YouGov. In fact, they ranked it nearly dead last in their list of priorities.Historically, vice presidential nominees have sometimes failed even to capture their home states, let alone put the ticket over the top.“Our analysis suggests that presidential candidates have at least three times the influence on vote choice as the vice presidential candidate,” political scientists Kyle Kopko and Christopher Devine wrote in April. “In order for a running mate to help a candidate on a national scale, he or she must be exceedingly popular; in order to hurt, the VP must be tremendously unpopular. By and large, neither happens.”Pence would seem unlikely to prove the exception ― a fact that Trump himself acknowledged earlier this week.“History has said nobody ever helps,” Trump told The Washington Post on Monday. “I’ve never seen anybody that’s helped.”"

NEW POLLS POINT TO CLOSE RACES IN IOWA, WISCONSIN, OHIO AND FLORIDA - Polls released yesterday show Hillary Clinton up by a few points in Iowa and Wisconsin, tied with Donald Trump in Ohio and trailing by a small margin in Florida. Clinton has strong leads in Virginia and Colorado polls.Iowa: Two new surveys both give Hillary Clinton a slim lead in Iowa, with NBC/WSJ/Marist polling showing her up by 3, and an automated Gravis poll putting her up by 2. HuffPost Pollster’s model, which also includes the results of an earlier Loras poll that had her up by double digits, gives Clinton a 4-point edge over Donald Trump. Wisconsin: The latest release from Marquette Law School gives Clinton her narrowest advantage yet in the state. It shows her with a 4-point edge over Trump, down from a 9-point lead in Marquette’s poll at the beginning of June. The results line up with the other most recent survey, a late June release from CBS/YouGov, which had Clinton up by 5. HuffPost Pollster’s model, reflecting Clinton’s more substantial lead in past surveys, still gives her a nearly 9-point advantage.Ohio: Two polls from NBC/WSJ/Marist and Quinnipiac both show Clinton and Trump tied in Ohio. HuffPost Pollster’s model has Clinton up by just over 2 points. Florida: Quinnipiac, which last found an 8-point lead for Clinton in Florida, now gives Trump a 3-point edge in the state. That marks the fourth consecutive poll to find the Republican ahead, although the remaining three were conducted either by GOP firms or for conservative clients. HuffPost Pollster’s model gives Clinton 44 percent to Trump’s 42 percent. Virginia: Fox News polling gives Clinton a 7-point lead over Trump in Virginia, after a spate of other surveys suggesting a somewhat closer race. HuffPost Pollster’s model has Clinton up by just under 5 points. Colorado: Polls from Fox News and Monmouth University agree that Clinton has a solid lead in Colorado. The Fox survey shows Clinton leading by 10 points, and Monmouth has a slightly larger lead of 13 points. HuffPost Pollster’s model shows Clinton up by 5 points, 43 percent to Trump’s 38 percent, since earlier polls showed a closer race.Pennsylvania: Two polls in Pennsylvania, one from Quinnipiac and one from NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, had conflicting results, although the organizations agree that Ohio is tied. The Quinnipiac Pennsylvania poll has Trump up by 2 points, while NBC/WSJ/Marist has Clinton up by 9 points in the state. The primary difference is in Trump’s support: Quinnipiac has Clinton at 41 percent and NBC/WSJ/Marist has her at 45 percent, but Quinnipiac’s Trump number is 43 compared to 36 in NBC/WSJ/Marist. NBC/WSJ/Marist has 17 undecideds, compared to Quinnipiac’s 13 percent. There’s no way to know for sure which is more accurate. The HuffPost Pollster model averages out all of the polls to show a 3-point Clinton lead. These polls indicate a slight decline in Clinton’s lead - Nate Silver: “[T]he bevy of state polls worked strongly to Trump’s benefit overall. His chances of winning the Electoral College are up to 29 percent, from 23 percent on Tuesday, according to our polls-only model. And they’re now 33 percent, up from 27 percent, in our polls-plus model, which also accounts for economic conditions. FiveThirtyEight’s forecasts are generally conservative until late in the race, so those qualify as fairly big changes by our standards….[W]e’re entering a period of rapidly moving political news. Bernie Sanders endorsed Clinton only Tuesday. Trump is expected to name his VP later this week. And then we’ll have the party conventions. The prospects definitely look better for Trump than they did a week or two ago, but the landscape also looks blurrier, and it may not be until mid-August that we have a chance to catch our breath.” [538] National estimates show Clinton is strong overall, but some states are very close - Cameron Easley: “If the presidential election were held today, Hillary Clinton would top Donald Trump 320-212 in electoral votes to clinch the White House, according to an extensive Morning Consult analysis of 57,000 voters. The 2016 presidential race is far from over, however. Morning Consult’s polling data is within 2 percentage points in eight key states. Iowa is not included in the electoral count because it is a statistical dead heat. The other close states are Florida, Georgia, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. When those states are removed from the electoral count, Clinton garners 241 electoral votes and Trump receives 190. If Trump wins a few of those states, he could come out on top.” [Morning Consult]AMERICANS ARE FEELING WORN OUT BY THIS ELECTION - Jeffrey Gottfried: “A new Pew Research Center survey conducted June 7-July 5 finds that about six-in-ten Americans (59%) feel exhausted by the amount of election coverage, while 39% say they like getting a lot of coverage about the election. This feeling of fatigue is particularly true among those who aren’t following news about the election very closely – 69% of this group say they are worn out compared with about 41% of those who follow the election very closely. That said, just because Americans are worn out by the amount of coverage does not imply that interest in or attention to the election itself is low. In fact, a recent Pew Research Center report showed that there was greater interest than during previous campaigns. Further, in February, we found that 91% of Americans had learned about the election from at least one type of source in the previous week...There is only one topic that most Americans say has received too little coverage – candidates’ stances on issues (55% feel this is under-covered).” [Pew]  AMERICANS THINK STAKES ARE HIGHER THIS YEAR THAN IN PREVIOUS ELECTIONS - Jim Norman: “Large majorities of all three major U.S. racial and ethnic groups agree the election stakes are higher this year than in prior years, with 66% of blacks, 63% of whites and 50% of Hispanics strongly agreeing....[R]oughly seven in 10 or more of each group agree they are afraid of what will happen if their candidate does not win, 64% of blacks, compared with 53% of whites and only 38% of Hispanics, strongly agree.” [Gallup]  PERCEPTIONS OF RACE RELATIONS HIT LOWEST POINT IN OBAMA’S PRESIDENCY - Giovanni Russonello: “Sixty-nine percent of Americans say race relations are generally bad, one of the highest levels of discord since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles during the Rodney King case, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll….Relations between black Americans and the police have become so brittle that more than half of black people say they were not surprised by the attack that killed five police officers and wounded nine others in Dallas last week. Nearly half of white Americans say that they, too, were unsurprised by the episode, the survey found….Asked whether the police in most communities are more likely to use deadly force against a black person than a white person, three-quarters of African-Americans answered yes, and only about half as many white people agree.” [NYT] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

As it turns out, protecting their prey could prove key to recovering ferret populations.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other agencies have been experimenting for several years with a vaccine to protect prairie dogs from sylvatic plague, a devastating bacterial disease that fleas transmit. Now proven effective in small populations, the agency has turned its attention to management. It is exploring alternative delivery methods, including the use of all-terrain vehicles and unmanned aircraft.Randy Matchett, an FWS biologist in Montana, told The Huffington Post that drones are particularly appealing, as the technology would allow for large areas of land to be treated quickly, cost-effectively and with little impact to the environment.“I’m saving hover boards for last,” he joked.The population of black-footed ferrets once numbered in the tens of thousands, ranging from Canada to Mexico. But much like their favorite meal, the ferrets ultimately fell victim to habitat loss, lack of food and disease, according to the FWS. Twice the species was believed to be extinct.These rare, solitary creatures now inhabit about 2 percent of their historic range. Roughly 300 individuals were known to exist in the wild at the end of 2015.The FWS said in an environmental assessment detailing its proposal to begin using drones that the recovery of black-footed ferrets is among the agency’s highest priorities.

Their numbers have fallen to a fraction of their historic levels. In 1992, for example, he watched a single 1,300-acre colony reduced to just 37 acres in three weeks.The proposal calls for using unmanned aircraft to distribute the candy-like vaccines on up to 10,000 acres of the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge, located in northeastern Montana. The plan is now awaiting approval from the agency’s regional director, Matchett said.Equipped with GPS and a dispenser that Matchett described as a “new and improved gum ball machine,” the drones would be able to shoot bait in three separate directions simultaneously, evenly distributing them at a rate of 50 pellets per acre.While someone walking can typically cover 3-6 acres per hour, a drone could be outfitted to treat 200 acres per hour, according to the FWS. Matchett said he hopes to begin using drones by Sept. 1 of this year and eventually take the technology elsewhere.“I envision treating 10,000- to 30,000-acre parcels with this vaccination,” he told HuffPost. It’s no secret why drones become “pretty attractive, pretty fast,” Matchett added.Equally as attractive is the idea of saving a critter once thought gone forever. "
