0,POLITICS,Meet The Third Party,Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gary-johnson-2016_us_56e1df47e4b0860f99d85380,"If you're a Republican who can't stand to vote for Donald Trump, Gary Johnson might be your guy.",2016-03-10,"Former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson thinks this election provides a good opportunity for a Libertarian candidate. ""I've never said anything as stupid as Trump,"" he told The Huffington Post.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Does Donald Trump even lift, bro? That was the implied question behind Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson's address to the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, as the former two-term New Mexico governor rattled off his various athletic accomplishments -- a lousy strategy if you're crafting a Tinder profile, but it certainly made for an attention-grabbing stump speech. ""I'm a competitive athlete,"" Johnson, who served as the Libertarian Party's standard bearer in 2012, boasted to several thousand convention attendees. ""I've done hundreds of athletic competitions … I'm planning to ride the divide, which is a 3.000-mile unsupported mountain bike race. ... I've done Ironman Hawaii four times.""Sure, Johnson was technically appearing at a forum on the future of conservatism, and sure, Johnson's Antarctic expeditions and hot air balloon hobby didn't exactly have a lot to do with that. But Johnson wasn't there to gab about the 10th Amendment. Johnson was there to let you know that bro skis, that bro mountain bikes, that bro climbed Mount Everest on a broken leg and that bro, in bro's own words, is a ""fierce competitor."" Bro wanted you to feel his bicep -- no, really feel it. ""Why is anyone going to want to talk to me if I'm going to be a dolt?"" Johnson answered later, albeit coyly, in an interview with The Huffington Post. ""I do believe I've led a really interesting life."" Doltishness aside, it was certainly different. And it was clear Johnson wasn't just presenting himself as someone who can appeal to a conservative electorate cast adrift by Donald Trump, but as someone who can be the Libertarian Donald Trump by matching the front-runner's boisterous, media-savvy brand of politics. The greatest free market president. A really fabulous disciple of the Austrian School. Just the best. Ayn Rand. John Galt. It's gonna be beautiful. In case his point wasn’t clear enough, consider the Libertarian debate where he called Trump a “pussy.”Gary Johnson is a kind of John Kasich-Donald Trump hybrid: avuncular, goofy and a little aloof, like the Ohio governor, but with Donald Trump's deeply ingrained sense of how an off-the-cuff style can keep the media's attention. During a discussion of his open-market plan for health care reform, Johnson envisioned an America teeming with minute-clinics. ""If we had a free market model for health insurance, we would have insurance to cover ourselves for catastrophic injury and illness and we would pay-as-you-go in a system that was very, very affordable,"" he said. ""Stitches ‘R' Us! Gallbladders ‘R' Us!""Johnson is honing his soundbites, and now's certainly the time to do so. The Democratic front-runner is Hillary Clinton, who remains a polarizing figure and has struggled to engender the kind of enthusiasm enjoyed by Bernie Sanders and, previously, by Barack Obama. On the other side of the aisle, establishment and conservative Republicans are suffering a nervous breakdown over the prospect of a Donald Trump or Ted Cruz nomination. A number of prominent lawmakers, including Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, have already spoken out against Trump's politics, and Cruz is as popular in the Senate as a five-day work week (which is to say, not at all). Cruz's colleague Lindsey Graham literally joked about murdering him.""Can you believe the state of politics right now?"" Johnson exclaimed with almost childlike delight during his interview with The Huffington Post. ""Arguably the two most polarizing figures in America, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, are going to be the nominees!""""Trump gets the nomination by appealing to the 30 percent [of GOP voters] who think the scourge of the Earth is Mexican immigration,"" he added, unsympathetically. ""I'm not making any claims that a Libertarian run is going to be any different than it was before, but if there were ever an opportunity, it is now."" The way Johnson sees it, there's a ""vast middle"" of the electorate that would be drawn to his socially liberal, economically conservative platform and turned off by the polarizing figures that are likely to secure the two main parties' nominations. Sure, maybe Democratic voters will have to stomach his desire to gut entitlements, and Republicans his stated belief that Mexican immigrants aren't ISIS sleeper agents, but Libertarians are banking on an exhausted electorate that won't mind as much. ""I've never said anything as stupid as Trump,"" Johnson contended. Johnson, naturally, takes a glass-half-full view, and insists he could work with any Congress. With Democrats, he could pursue agenda items like immigration reform, criminal justice reform and reversing the decline of reproductive rights. With Republicans, he could team up on gutting Obamacare, entitlement reform and corporate tax reform. ""What you're reading is, 'Where's the third party?' The Libertarian Party is going to be the only [third] party on the ballot in 50 states,"" he predicted. Johnson anticipates a kind of media snowball effect, with reporters inevitably turning their gaze to his candidacy, either through better-than-expected poll numbers or a natural curiosity about presidential alternatives. Johnson's biggest goal for the general election campaign is to gain a spot in the debates, and he is suing the Presidential Debate Commission over its 15 percent threshold for admittance. ""[The media] will probably [first] focus on the marijuana thing like they've always done,"" Johnson speculated about the narrative surrounding his campaign. ""Unlike four years ago, now you've got 58 percent of Americans supporting legalizing marijuana, so in my opinion if that gets focused on, then OK, that's a good start.""  ""When [Republican Nebraska Senator] Ben Sasse comes out and says, 'I'm going to vote for the third party if Donald Trump is the nominee, and other Republicans are saying the same, what is he thinking? He's thinking Libertarian!"" said Johnson. ""[T]he table is set."" Before Johnson can implement his big-tent strategy, he needs to secure the Libertarian Party's nomination, and says he is ""flying low"" until the party finalizes its nominee during its Memorial Day convention in Orlando. It shouldn't be too difficult. His chief opponent is anti-virus software magnate John McAfee, who last year was arrested for driving under the influence and for possessing a firearm under the influence. In 2012 he was named as a person of interest in a Belizean murder investigation and promptly dropped off the grid, resurfacing a month later in Guatemala, where he was ultimately deported to the U.S. Even by the Libertarian Party's eccentric, anything-goes third party ethos, nominating a guy who has had to replenish a go bag seems a bit far-fetched. And if the Libertarians are trying to offer a credible alternative to Donald Trump, choosing a seasoned state executive over a paranoid survivalist who at this very moment might be slowly emerging from a swamp in full camouflage while gripping a knife with his teeth would seem to be the rational choice. Other candidates include an actor, a lawyer who likes to appear in Civil War regalia and a self-described ""Spiritual Visionary since June 2006.""However, it's clear that if Johnson hopes to offer himself as a serious alternative to the Democratic and Republican nominees, he'll have to polish his presentation a bit. During a discussion about the late Antonin Scalia's Supreme Court seat, Johnson -- who believes the Senate should consider President Barack Obama's nominee -- conceded he couldn't name the remaining eight sitting Supreme Court justices. Asked about his plan to reform Social Security, he suggested three proposals, but could only articulate two: raising the retirement age and creating personal investment accounts. ""Gosh there's one other one, what is it?"" Johnson mused before trailing off. The final proposal -- means testing for Social Security recipients -- came to Johnson several minutes later. To his credit, he was able to discuss the proposal in detail, but if he does make it into the general election debates, there will be no two-minute lags, and SNL's writers would love nothing more than a pro-weed third party candidate who forgets things. Then again, this is the Donald Trump election, and Johnson's eccentricities and weaknesses might actually be strengths. He's certainly ready to measure hands."
1,POLITICS,What Happened When A Black Reporter Crashed A White Nationalist Event,Robert Baldwin III,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-reporter-white-nationalist-event_us_56df2f2ae4b0000de40655d2,"Many of the attendees said they didn't like to be described as white ""nationalists."" OK, then.",2016-03-10,"The Ronald Reagan Building, where the white nationalists of the National Policy Institution met earlier this month. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56df370c1e0000c60070f7f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On a brisk Saturday in early March, I went to the Ronald Reagan Building to spend the evening with a bunch of white nationalists who were in town for the National Policy Institute’s winter conference.The three black security guards at the entrance grimaced when I asked for directions to the eighth-floor rotunda room where the group was holding its event.Their faces eased when I explained that I was a reporter there to cover the conference. They laughed, though they still looked puzzled about why I would want to attend this kind of gathering. Despite having a badge and gun, one guard joked that he’d “pray for me."" As I walked to the rotunda, another officer asked whether I was there to work the front desk.NPI, which describes itself as an organization ""dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of people of European descent,"" had a press hour scheduled to begin shortly after I arrived. I was presumably the only black person the guards saw headed to that event.About 50 people were gathered in the room overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue to hear from NPI President Richard Spencer. Spencer, who has proposed creating ""an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,"" has been called ""one of the country’s most successful young white nationalist leaders."" The room was filled with white men in business casual attire who wore their hair in a side-shaven combover reminiscent of Nazi Germany, a style that Spencer also sports.I approached a white, female staffer to inquire about where I might check in for media credentials. Without prompting, she quickly assured me that she didn't work for NPI -- she was part of the facility staff assigned to work the event. She was visibly concerned and seemed confused by my presence, but directed me to make myself “comfortable.”Unexpectedly, that was the only major awkward black-elephant-in-the-room moment that I experienced. The attendees appeared to be more comfortable with my presence than I'd assumed, considering that the rest of the evening was spent observing pseudo-academic rhetoric of white separatists.There were several noticeable themes in their discussion. Many of the attendees said they didn't like to be described as white “nationalists,"" even though creating a separate white nation is exactly what Spencer has called for. They often refused to give their last names, which they said was because they worry about facing a social or employment penalty for aligning with this cause. And they tended to give evasive answers to every question about the actual policies they would like to see implemented. Questions on planning were avoided. Questions about strategy were shunned. Comments on concrete action were snubbed in favor of what came across as a thought experiment rather than any clear agenda.""There are tons of policy proposals. Millions of pages and words are being published every day. But what is not being done? I want to do what no one else is doing or what very few people are doing,"" Spencer told reporters. ""I know it might be a little bit ironic because it is called the National Policy Institute. But I think you have to have identity first before you have policy.""Instead of elaborating on specifics, Spencer told reporters he wants to “engage in a philosophical conversation -- a conversation that we are not having.""Much of the conference agenda centered on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, and how it is helping the mission of the organization. While Trump is not formally aligned with their organization in any way, Spencer said his candidacy is ""energizing"" the movement. Conference attendees said Trump's ideas on issues like immigration give them something to rally behind.“My perspective is basically that of an American patriot,” said an attendee named Chris, who did not give his last name. “I want what's best for American citizens of all races. Politically, my goal is a stabilizing of the demographic changes that have been going on in the United States.”An interesting -- and audacious -- moment arose in my conversation with Chris when he described himself as a “mainstream conservative,” with the exception of his belief in “race realism,” a pseudoscience that argues black people will always be inferior to whites because of, among other things, our smaller brains.I took a quick survey of the room. The servers and I were the only black people there. If I had felt any discomfort, it would be in the image of the black server walking with a tray, offering brisket sliders to men that would prefer he live in a separate nation.They validated this event, in large part, by the community it afforded them. It came across as a shelter for the false cause of white victimization in America. The group provides them protection to discuss their beliefs without restraints on their speech -- speech they claim is being limited in liberal, politically correct America. The attendees desire their own playground of sorts, where they can talk about white separation and preservation, under the leadership of Spencer, a man who charges that white America is “avoiding and denying their own identity.”Nathan, a student at California State University Stanislaus, has been involved with NPI for a year. He credits the Internet for giving him a forum to discuss his perceptions on race, because there “hasn't been a platform prior."" Discussion of white oppression, he said, is ""essentially censored from any form of debate or dialogue.""“There has just really been a monologue about social issues going on in the last 50 years,” he said. ""Anyone who has come out with the fact that people of European heritage have rights and have interests have been socially ostracized, and they have been disenfranchised economically.”While my presence shocked the people that worked in the building, conference attendees didn't seem hesitant to discuss their thoughts about the need to advocate for white people. As I stood 3 feet away, on the other side of a small cocktail table, Spencer gladly held forth about the need to create a separate nation to preserve the white race. "

4,POLITICS,Everything You Need To Know About The Bad Democratic Turnout Numbers,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/low-democratic-voter-turnout_us_56e0944ae4b0b25c9180a3ee,"When Democrats aren't feeling the Bern, they aren't showing up.",2016-03-09,Democrats are showing up in large numbers in the states that end up voting for Bernie Sanders. But turnout hasn't been as high in states that ultimately voted for Hillary Clinton. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e098f0150000ad000b180c.jpeg?cache=6m1QZrX34U&ops=crop_0_66_4351_1711%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- So far in the Democratic primary, there's only one set of circumstances in which the party is producing strong voter turnout: When Bernie Sanders wins a state, tons of voters are showing up.In Colorado, Kansas and Maine, Democrats have actually surpassed the turnout of the 2008 primary contests, while the caucuses in Minnesota and Nebraska only narrowly missed. Sanders won all five states. That's no small feat. Democrats were energized in 2008, eager to turn the page on the Bush years, and excited by two candidates whose election would have represented a breakthrough for millions of people.But much of this primary season has been a different story. In every state that Hillary Clinton has won -- which is most states -- the party is seeing a significant decline in voter turnout from the 2008 election. Half as many Texas Democrats came out to vote this year than in 2008. In South Carolina, turnout was down by a third. Virginia? Down by one-fifth. A lot of these states don't really matter -- Democrats aren't going to win Mississippi or Alabama, no matter how many people show up at the primary, and they aren't going to lose Vermont no matter how many people are feeling the Bern. But low turnout should be at least somewhat worrying to party leaders, since Clinton will almost certainly be the eventual Democratic nominee. There aren't many independent voters anymore. People like to tell pollsters they're independent, but the voting patterns of these people are typically heavily partisan. The Democratic Party has a major demographic edge over Republicans -- if it can get the Obama coalition of black, Latino and Asian-American voters to show up at the polls. When they do, as in 2012, they win. When they don't, as in 2014, they lose. The good news for Clinton is that low turnout at the primary stage doesn't mean a party will lose in the general election. As Nate Silver has noted, the party that secured the most primary votes has lost seven elections since 1972. But it's still a meaningful way to gauge the excitement among a party's base. Ask anyone at the Democratic National Committee whether they'd like to see good turnout numbers in the primary, and they'll tell you that, yes, of course they would.Clinton has also been a national political figure for almost a quarter-century, and it's hard to get voters enthused about the status quo in a year in which Washington politics isn't very popular. Many Democrats cast their first vote for a woman president in 2008. The second one just isn't historic. Still, a full 79 percent of Democrats say they would be satisfied with Clinton as the party's nominee. By contrast, only 49 percent of Republicans say the same of Donald Trump, who is likely to be the GOP standard-bearer in the fall. And if Trump becomes the nominee, his flagrantly racist campaign rhetoric will surely motivate large numbers of Democrats to come out to the polls if for no other reason than to vote against him.Trump's hostility to minorities makes it hard to see him winning swing states like Nevada and Colorado that have large numbers of Latino voters. But he could win the presidency if he can flip the Rust Belt for Republicans. And Trump did, in fact, ride criticism of U.S. trade policy to a victory in Michigan on Tuesday night. Michigan, meanwhile, is one state in which a Sanders victory has not translated into great numbers for Democrats. While both Clinton and Sanders easily beat the state's 2008 turnout numbers for Clinton and Obama, Michigan's primary wasn't hotly contested that year -- the state was being punished by the DNC for violating its primary scheduling rules. And on Tuesday, Republican turnout in Michigan eclipsed the Democratic total by 10 percent.Zach Carter is a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast ""So, That Happened.""

5,TASTE,Ben And Jerry's Announces 3 Brand New Core Flavors,James Cave,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-and-jerrys-core-flavors_us_56e036a4e4b0b25c91803b78,Thank goodness.,2016-03-09,"An inside look at Ben and Jerry's new Cookies and Cream Cheesecake Core flavor, out now.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e039471e0000b300703944.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We all love Ben and Jerry's for all the good they've done for our planet. They've phased out ingredients with GMOs, they've gotten the Fair Trade USA seal of approval, they're making vegan ice cream now, they support gay marriage, and they've even made a flavor for Bernie Sanders. But let's be real, we really care about the ice cream.And we clearly care about the Core flavors most of all. In an announcement on its Snapchat feed Tuesday and Wednesday, Ben & Jerry's launched three more Core flavors: Cookies and Cream Cheesecake Core, Coconuts for Caramel Core and Brownie Batter Core.Taking off from the success of its earlier run of Core flavors (pints of ice cream with a core made of fudge, caramel, jam, etc.), these new flavors aren't a huge departure from the originals.The Brownie Batter Core flavor is made with chocolate and vanilla ice cream with fudge brownie bits, and a brownie batter core that our tasters said was ""REALLY gooey, almost like hot fudge. The chewy brownies are nice, but there's a whole lot of sweetness going on in here,"" and ""I'm not sure if everyone could handle it.""The Cookies and Cream Cheesecake Core flavor is made with chocolate and cheesecake ice cream with chocolate cookies and a cheesecake core, but our tasters had trouble detecting where the cheesecake was: ""Really it was just chocolate and vanilla, with little cake bites. Which is fine, it tasted good, but it sounds like it was a marketing attempt to alter a pretty standard ice cream flavor that falls flat. I'd rather buy a pint of Americone Dream if I'm getting Ben & Jerry's.""We were unable to try out the Caramel Coconut flavor because it wasn't yet ready for previews (but we're sure it's delicious).Stay tuned for updates on when it'll be available near you."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) won the Michigan Democratic primary on Tuesday, but Hillary Clinton won Flint, the Michigan city that received the most attention in the run-up to the election. Clinton won Flint with 65 percent of the vote to Sanders' 34 percent, according to Greg Giroux, who crunched the raw numbers for Bloomberg Government. Sanders won the state with 49.8 percent to Clinton's 48.3, a result earlier polls had failed to predict.Flint, a city of nearly 100,00 that is 57 percent African American, has been in the national spotlight because of a drinking water crisis for which Republican Gov. Rick Snyder has repeatedly apologized. Flint's water has been poisoned with high levels of lead since the Snyder administration oversaw a switch in the city's water source and failed to ensure its proper treatment in 2014. Although Sanders called on Snyder to resign all the way back in January, Clinton's response to the Flint water crisis has been more forceful. She visited the city on a campaign stop on Feb. 8, where she spoke to a packed church and met with local officials.Sanders held a forum in Flint for community members later that month, and he met with Flint residents in Detroit before that.Clinton’s campaign also put Sanders’ campaign on the defensive in January when they proposed an additional presidential debate in Flint and Sanders did not immediately agree. At the debate, Clinton joined Sanders in calling on Snyder to resign, and both candidates said Flint's water crisis is an example of infrastructure problems throughout the country. ""We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate,"" Clinton said.Clinton enjoyed the endorsement of Flint Mayor Karen Weaver (D), and Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), the congressman representing the district in which the city is located.Weaver told MSNBC’s Chris Matthews on Tuesday night that she had decided to back Clinton because of her early engagement with Flint on the water crisis. Weaver helped bring national attention to the water crisis when she declared an emergency at the end of last year. “As soon as I did the emergency declaration back in December, she immediately contacted us,” Weaver said. “She started sending really high-level people to Flint and looking at what could they do to help the situation. They have been in constant contact with us, communication. They’ve been there several times.”Despite Clinton’s loss in Michigan, her win in Flint shows that African-American voters still favor her over Sanders. Clinton’s advantage among African Americans has been a key driver of her enormous delegate lead over Sanders.Statewide, Sanders won 28 percent of the African-American vote, while Clinton picked up 68 percent, according to the CNN exit poll. Sanders nonetheless performed better among African Americans than he did in many Southern states, where African Americans make up a larger share of the Democratic electorate.Among the 85 percent of Michigan voters who told CNN's exit pollsters they would prefer stronger water safety regulations, 53 percent favored Sanders and 44 percent favored Clinton.

9,POLITICS,Now A Democrat Is Holding Up The Flint Water Bill,Laura Barrón-López and Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-flint-water_us_56e09086e4b065e2e3d4a227,"A fellow senator wants to use the Flint aid legislation to expand offshore drilling, and Bill Nelson isn't having it.",2016-03-09,Bill Nelson has some Gulf Coast beef with legislation inspired by the Flint water crisis.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_346_5119_2707%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- For weeks, senators have said they are close to a deal on legislation to help Flint, Michigan recover from the poisoning of its water supply, but on Wednesday another lawmaker threw a wrench in the negotiations. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) put a hold on the agreement just as Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) appeared close to putting out a flame with Republican Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) over the legislation.Nelson doesn’t have a problem with the underlying bill, which makes money available to cities like Flint coping with decaying water infrastructure, or with a separate piece of energy legislation tied to the Flint bill. But he is wary of an offshore drilling amendment that Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) wants to attach to the energy bill. The measure would increase revenue sharing for states that allow offshore oil and natural gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.""Sen. Nelson supports the energy bill and the money for Flint but the Republicans insist on an amendment that would start the process of drilling off Florida’s coast,"" Nelson spokesman Ryan Brown said in an email. ""After four decades of protecting Florida’s beaches and military training areas in the Gulf, Sen. Nelson isn’t going to stop now.""While Cassidy's bill doesn't have to do with Florida specifically, and any final drilling decision is up to the federal government, Nelson's spokesman said the senator is concerned that if the amendment passes the, ""huge financial incentive"" it grants would create ""such immense pressure to continuously open up new areas to offshore drilling that it'd only be a matter of time before they'd start looking to open up areas off Florida's coast.""Before Wednesday, Lee was the only remaining senator preventing a vote on the Flint-inspired bill, saying Michigan had the resources it needed and Congress shouldn't get involved in a local water crisis. Lee said the bipartisan effort to craft a response to Flint amounted to ""grandstanding.""""It's outrageous to think we're grandstanding,"" Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) said Tuesday. ""We're trying to find a way to provide resources to the people of Flint. The people of Flint have waited too long.""Bloomberg BNA reporter Ari Natter said on Twitter that Stabenow had reached ""a conceptual agreement"" with Lee. Asked by HuffPost, a spokeswoman for Stabenow would only say that negotiations continue. And no deal had been reached with Lee, according to a spokeswoman for Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), who co-authored the Flint bill. If the entire package is unable to move before the Senate leaves for its spring recess on March 21, senators will probably look for a different pathway to move money for Flint. Inhofe’s spokeswoman noted that the Water Resources Development Act, currently under review by a committee, could be a viable option.Democrats originally wanted $600 million in direct assistance to Flint, where the water has been tainted by lead since 2014 thanks mainly to the state government's decision not to treat the water to prevent it from corroding the city's lead pipes. The current version of the proposal, the result of a compromise with Republicans, would provide loan credits to any area facing a water crisis, though Flint is the only one that currently meets the standard set by the draft legislation.Even in small doses, lead can have damaging health effects, including permanent brain damage in small children.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56df321a1e0000b30070386a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You probably don't spend a lot of time thinking about the ""supervolcano"" lurking beneath Yellowstone National Park, but should that behemoth decide to erupt, it would be nothing short of catastrophic.By some estimates, 87,000 people would die almost immediately, and two-thirds of the United States would be left uninhabitable.A new study, however, suggests we humans might have a fighting chance after all -- if, that is, we're in good running shape.Researchers looked at the pyroclastic flows -- a fast-moving mix of lava, ash and volcanic gas -- following a super-eruption in Arizona 18.8 million years ago, and discovered that they moved much slower than many experts previously thought.The recent findings have sparked a debate within the scientific community, raising questions about whether people in the immediate area of such a cataclysmic event would stand any chance of escape.""I wouldn't recommend anyone try to outrun a volcano,"" study co-author Greg Valentine, a volcanologist at the University at Buffalo in New York, told Live Science. ""But there's a few of us that could.""For their study, published Monday in the journal Nature Communications, Valentine and his team focused on an ancient eruption at Silver Creek caldera, in western Arizona. According to the UB Reporter at the University of Buffalo, when this supervolcano blew its top 18.8 million years ago, it flooded parts of California, Nevada and Arizona with pyroclastic flows. Some flows traveled more than 100 miles from their source, according to the study.By looking at rocks in the ancient volcanic deposit, the researchers determined that the flows from the Silver Creek eruption reached ""modest and uniform"" speeds of around 10 to 45 mph. In comparison, flows during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, which killed 57 people, were clocked at around 380 mph, according to the study.Valentine told the UB Reporter that understanding the behavior of ancient flows could help experts do a better job of forecasting and preparing for future volcanic disasters. “The character and speed of the flows will affect how much time you might have to get out of the way, although the only truly safe thing to do is to evacuate before a flow starts,"" he said.But some are skeptical of the recent findings.Charles Ferguson, an expert on the ancient Arizona flow and a research geologist with the Arizona Geological Survey, told Live Science that there are outcrops that suggest the ash moved quickly and energetically. ""I think their hypothesis is more problematic than explanatory,"" Ferguson said of Valentine and his team. While the average person can run about 15 mph, a 2010 study found that, in theory, humans have the potential to reach up to 40 mph. Whether you're John Doe or Usain Bolt, it's probably a good idea to high-tail it away from an erupting supervolcano -- at least as far as the nearest working vehicle."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pulled off an upset victory in the Michigan primary Tuesday, picking up the majority of delegates in a state seen as a must-win for him to maintain a place in the Democratic race.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came into the Michigan primary with a strong lead in the polls, particularly among minority voters who make up a quarter of the electorate in the state. Clinton has dominated with non-white voters in this primary season, so a Sanders win in diverse Michigan stands out among his previous primary victories.Michigan had been cast as Sanders' last, best hope for mounting a real challenge to Clinton's lead in the delegate count, and his campaign manager called the vote ""a critical showdown."" The state's primary is positioned between Super Tuesday and major primaries in Ohio and Florida on March 15, and it awards 130 delegates proportionally.The two candidates faced off in a debate in Flint, Michigan, on Sunday, trading jabs on a wide range of issues. Sanders targeted Clinton's record on trade deals and job creation, linking her to NAFTA and the Obama administration's trade policies. Sanders hoped his populist stances on these issues would appeal to voters who have been ravaged by the recession.But Clinton also claimed Sanders opposed the auto bailout, arguing that it saved 4 million jobs in the region. Sanders actually voted in favor of unsuccessful measures in Congress that would have bailed out automakers, but opposed the program that ultimately directed funds to Detroit because it also went toward bailing out Wall Street.Both candidates have focused on the Flint water crisis in their appearances in the Michigan, blaming the state government for failing to protect the city from lead-contaminated water. They each called on the state's Republican Gov. Rick Snyder to resign over what Sanders described as a ""dereliction of duty.""Clinton won Michigan in 2008, but due to a dispute over the state's primary date that year, the Democratic National Committee only awarded half of the state's delegates.This article has been updated to include Sanders' votes on the automaker bailout."

Rick Snyder (R) requested on Tuesday $1.2 million for legal services, more than double the $500,000 already earmarked. Attorney General Bill Schuette asked for a separate increase in funds to $1.5 million to pay a firm investigating the government's involvement in the crisis.Flint has been reeling after residents discovered brown water flowing from their taps in 2014. The local government largely ignored complaints about the situation for months until reports emerged saying the water was contaminated with dangerously high levels of lead, a neurotoxin that can cause brain damage in young children.The failed response has prompted a severe backlash against Snyder, including allegations that state and city officials ignored evidence the water was toxic. President Barack Obama called the incident ""inexcusable"" and Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have both called on the governor to resign.Several high-profile lawsuits have already been filed against the government. Another seeking class-action status was filed earlier this week on behalf of seven families from areas with lead-poisoned water .The increased legal fees will be used to investigate whether any laws were broken in the government's response and to defend the governor's office against any wrongdoing. A spokesperson for the governor told the Detroit Free Press the legal contracts would become more expensive ""based on the anticipated billing for work already completed and the workload as we look ahead.""“The attorney general is running an independent, broad-based investigation team that will leave no stone unturned,” Andrea Bitely, a spokeswoman for Schuette, told the Detroit News.As The Huffington Post's Dana Liebelson and Arthur Delaney reported last month, Schuette's office already seems to have chosen sides in the crisis, advising lower-level officials they would need to find their own lawyers while the attorney general defends the governor.State lawmakers attacked the new budget proposal and called the increases ""outrageous"" and a ""kick in the teeth"" to taxpayers already hurting from toxic drinking water.The contracts will go to the State Administrative Board for approval on Tuesday."
13,ENTERTAINMENT,"On 'The Women Tell All,' Black Bachelorettes Take The Fall For Race Problems",Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-tell-all-bachelor-race_us_56df166ae4b0000de4063645,"When ""The Bachelor"" tokenizes black women, it sets them up to become each other's worst competition.",2016-03-09,That is one very blonde group of eligible bachelorettes.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e04da91e0000950070f8f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"From the moment the teaser for ""The Bachelor"" Season 20's ""The Women Tell All"" special started rolling, things looked ominous. After behaving well and refusing to engage in confrontations with other women in the house, black, Haitian-born contestant Jubilee Sharpe clearly still managed to rub some of the bachelorettes the wrong way -- that much was obvious from watching the season. And in clips teasing ""The Women Tell All,"" it became clear that the other women used the special to circle the wagons against Jubilee, berating her for not sufficiently ingratiating herself with them or participating in house drama. Once the special itself got going (after the traditional crashing-of-the-viewing-parties segment featuring Ben and Chris Harrison), any fears awoken in Jubilee fans and critics of the show's race problem were made real. That problematic racial subtext suddenly became text, and it was simultaneously painful to watch, deeply important, and an elision of the real race issue at the heart of ""The Bachelor.""As ""Bachelor"" contestants go, even within this season (remember the episode of ""Olivia and 'Teen Mom'""?), Jubilee's transgressions seemed minor, more worthy of a frank chat than a group shaming. She ticked the other women off by making ironic comments downplaying her one-on-one date, yes -- not exactly a malicious crime, but certainly a misunderstanding. She retreated to the bathroom when Amber tried to engineer a group confrontation about this point of tension at a cocktail party, but avoiding overblown interpersonal drama definitely seems like a solid choice, even if it frustrated the other bachelorettes at the time. So why did the women present decide Jubilee seemed like such a prime target? Shushanna (remember her?) went out of her way to snidely inform Jubilee that many of the ladies in the house hadn't wanted her to return from her one-on-one date, as if that hadn't been made clear by interviews included in the show itself in which her housemates said just that. The submerged racial dynamics at play, as is typically the case on ABC's lily-whitewashed ""The Bachelor,"" were clearly intended to remain unacknowledged, even as a clip of Lauren H. implying that Jubilee wouldn't get along with other ""soccer moms,"" a racial dogwhistle if I ever heard one, replayed on the screen to refresh our memories. When they did bubble to the surface, however, it wasn't Chris Harrison, Jubilee, or any of the white contestants who yanked them into the daylight: It was Jami and Amber, the two other black bachelorettes this season. During the season, Amber obviously butted heads with Jubilee. Her ill-fated bathroom confrontation with Jubilee appeared to be the beginning of the end for both, making Amber look like a bully in front of the Bachelor, while planting seeds of doubt in Ben's head as to whether Jubilee gets along with other women. But when Amber and Jami joined forces to call Jubilee out on national TV, the moment was not one ""The Bachelor"" seemed prepared for.The actual dispute: Amber and Jami, backed by Shushanna, recalled Jubilee telling them she was ""the real black girl"" in the house, and would make it further on the show than any ""real black girl"" ever had. Jubilee initially denied ever saying that, looking truly baffled; after a brief break, the discussion reopened, and she said that she remembered saying that she was ""the full black girl"" in the house. Later, Jubilee told People magazine, ""I said I am the one full black girl in the house. I think of that as a fact."" (Amber and Jami both identify as biracial.)The two women heard something Jubilee says she didn't intend in her words -- that they were not really black women. Ultimately, Jubilee seemed to absorb this and apologized in a manner that seemed very genuine. But the sour flavor of the spat lingered -- especially as none of the other girls, even Lauren H., were asked to apologize to her for their microaggressions, racist implications, and fairly obvious stereotyping of her based on the color of her skin.A few tweeters pointed out during the show that the dynamic of the Jami/Amber vs. Jubilee debate fell along lines of colorism. Simply put, colorism typically refers to discrimination between lighter- and darker-skinned members of a racial group, often carried out by light-skinned people in the group to the detriment of dark-skinned ones. For example, light-skinned black people may find it easier to get jobs, be perceived as more romantically desirable, or may even be assumed to be smarter and more educated. This issue has drawn a bit of discussion recently thanks to Zoe Saldana's portrayal of Nina Simone in an upcoming biopic, despite Saldana's distinctly lighter skin tone. Since Saldana has been the face of the movie, and the name tossed around by infuriated commentators, it's easy to overlook, or forget to mention, the forces truly at fault for her casting and the perpetuation of colorism. Simone's daughter recently defended Saldana from the attacks arising from the film, pointing out, ""she is someone who is part of a larger picture."" That larger picture can be glimpsed in the film's writer/director, Cynthia Mort -- a white woman -- and the white-dominated team behind the movie, as Jezebel's Kara Brown pointed out.LIke ""Nina,"" ""The Bachelor"" is a Platonic ideal of how colorism is generated and sustained by the white power structure. This form of discrimination may go on within the black community itself, but to leave white discrimination out of the conversation is deeply myopic. Here's how we see it work on ""The Bachelor"": The show offers few opportunities to black women, and those slots they do fill with black women typically go to lighter-skinned, often biracial black women, like Amber or Leslie Hughes, from Sean Lowe's season, who also identifies as biracial. Silently, it's conveyed to darker-skinned women that to be deemed acceptable for the show, it would really help to be light-skinned black women -- a message all the more difficult to miss because this mirrors how white institutions already privilege light-skinned black people over dark-skinned black people.When a woman like Jubilee emphasizes her own identity by pointing out that she's the only non-biracial black woman on the season, she makes light-skinned black women feel their identities as black have been erased or dismissed. Alisha Ramos' Mixed Feelings newsletter on the episode focused on how Amber and Jami were displaying a sense of hurt that their identities had been defined by someone else, clearly in a way they disagreed with -- a common frustration for mixed-race people.Meanwhile, the predominantly white network, producers, and cast members sit back, benefiting from never having to worry about whether their skin color is acceptable in different contexts, and allow the black bachelorettes to fight over the mantel of ""token black girl."" What's particularly fascinating: Usually, we would never see this behind-the-scenes conflict. Race never even overtly came up during the show, though obviously the subject was discussed in the house. We saw the bad blood, the division into factions, but not the nuanced racial tensions that fostered the discord. On ""The Women Tell All,"" Amber and Jami took the opportunity to attack Jubilee, but they really revealed the depths of the tokenism, isolation, and pervasive microaggressions that make life on the show still more treacherous for black women.As Jezebel's Kate Dries pointed out: Only because of the way this show has historically been cast and structured (with few women of color) did Jubilee feel so impinged -- and therefore vocal -- about the significance of her race versus the races of the other women. Instead of race aligning her with the other women of color, it pitted them against each other (as it often does), arguably undermining all of their chances of being confident enough during the time they did have with Ben to get to know him better.Aware of their crumbling foothold on a white-dominated show, women like Amber and Jubilee can easily find themselves fighting each other for that tiny sliver of the pie that's been tossed to the black bachelorettes -- the honor of being the token contestant who ""makes it furthest,"" as Jubilee put it.What can the show really do to improve the situation, not just with lip service or pretensions of color-blindness? One of the tricky aspects of a dating show like ""The Bachelor"" is that the lead's taste in partners will guide casting, and even more so the few who make it late into the season and earn consideration for casting as the next lead. And unfortunately, racism isn't absent from dating. Studies have suggested that it's easiest for white people in the U.S., and most difficult for black people and Asian men, to get attention in the dating pool.Bachelor Ben, for all his virtues, has a pretty obvious type: pretty, all-American girls-next-door -- preferably blonde.That's not something he can change abruptly, but it seems likely it also wasn't something ABC took into consideration during casting. Attractiveness, fan popularity, a late run into the season, ""readiness"" for love on reality TV and similar traits, we know, come under consideration when the network is casting a lead. But why not whether the lead is interested in dating women of different races? Why not whether she's dated men of color in the past? Making a conscious effort to cast someone with diverse tastes, romantically, is one seemingly nebulous but vital component in diversifying the series. Not to mention the benefit of contestants of color feeling truly in the running, not just as tokens -- a leveling of the psychological playing field that would only improve the odds of a black contestant winning or being made the next lead.Maybe the rumored casting of Caila Quinn, who is half-Filipina, as the next Bachelorette will push the dial, but it remains to be seen. Based on the show's history, it seems far more likely to be a gesture to appease the increasingly race-conscious masses than a genuine shift in the show's direction. Let's hope there's more to the story.For more on ""The Bachelor: The Women Tell All,"" listen to the HuffPost podcast ""Here to Make Friends"" recap the show:"

The candidate spoke at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, where he was flanked by piles of his company's products: Trump bottled water, Trump wine and Trump steaks. After a brief speech touting his victories -- ""There's only one person who did well tonight: Donald Trump,"" he said -- Trump veered into something like an informercial, bragging about his successful business ventures and even hawking some of his products.""Trump steaks -- where are the steaks?"" said the likely Republican nominee, waving his hand toward an actual pile of raw steaks at the event. ""We have Trump steaks. By the way, if you want to take one, we'll charge you about 50 bucks a steak."" (As the Daily Caller reported, the steaks weren't actually branded with Trump's logo.)Trump became more narcissistic as the event wore on. A reporter asked him about a new television ad, paid for by the conservative anti-Trump group the American Future Fund PAC, that hits the candidate for his use of profanity and paints him as un-presidential. The real estate mogul, who recently called Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) a ""pussy"" and addressed the size of his penis at a debate, seized the opportunity to compare himself to former President Abraham Lincoln. ""I can be more presidential than anybody, if I want to be,"" Trump said. ""More presidential than anybody, other than the great Abe Lincoln. He was very presidential.""Trump said he wasn't offended by the negative ad -- he wants it to keep running, because it shows a ""certain degree of anger"" that he thinks is resonating with American voters.""It shows a certain degree of, 'We're not gonna take it anymore from all these countries that have been ripping us off and taking our jobs and taking our money like we're a bunch of babies,'"" Trump said. ""Very, very stupid babies.""Trump does seem to be resonating with voters-- particularly angry, white male ones. A new Wall Street Journal poll shows that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would beat Trump 51 to 38 percent in a general election, but Trump would beat Clinton 53 to 35 percent among white men only. And Trump is rapidly pulling ahead of his Republican rivals, despite intensifying efforts by the GOP establishment to stop him. Trump won Hawaii's primary on Tuesday as well, though its results were officially reported after the press conference.Trump said the reason people like him is because he's not afraid to be politically incorrect and say out loud what other people are thinking. He had a perfect opportunity to demonstrate that quality at the press conference Tuesday night, when an NBC reporter asked him what parents should tell their children about the profane language he uses. Instead of answering the question, Trump mercilessly mocked the reporter. ""Oh, you’re so politically correct,"" he said. ""You’re so beautiful. Oh, look at you. Awwww. Aw, he’s so. Oh, I know. You’ve never heard a little bad, a little off, language. I know, you’re so perfect. Aren’t you perfect. Aren’t you just a perfect young man. Give me a break. You know what? It’s stuff like that that people in this country are tired of. It’s stuff like that."" Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

A new study suggests that it can also help you to appear more intelligent to others.The way our faces look when we're tired can influence how people perceive us, and not necessarily in a good way, Sean Talamas, lead author of the study and a post-doc researcher at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, told The Huffington Post.""People over-generalize in judging those with droopy eyelids and a frown as being tired and having a low mood, both of which have a well-documented detrimental effect on cognitive performance,"" he said. ""Therefore it should be no surprise that many of us find people who look less alert and who have a lower mood as less intelligent looking.""The study, which was published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General on Feb. 25, involved 200 participants who rated how intelligent and attractive 190 different faces, with neutral expressions, appeared in photos.The researchers measured the degree of eyelid openness and mouth curvature seen in each photographed face, and then analyzed how the participants rated each image. They found that having more ""awake"" and open eyes and a slightly curved mouth related positively to intelligence ratings.""When looking at composites of all the faces that were rated as most intelligent versus those that were less intelligent looking, subtle differences in eyelid-openness and mouth curvature continued to be prevalent in the high-intelligent looking composite images,"" Talamas said. ""Measuring the subtlety of these differences objectively was difficult, but finding that it was related to perceived intelligence wasn't surprising.""However, the extent to which these subtle facial cues influenced perceived intelligence was astonishing, Dr. David Perrett, psychology professor at the University of St. Andrews and a co-author of the study, told HuffPost.""We were very surprised by the size of the effects, very subtle changes in the mouth and eyes has a profound impact on impressions of ability,"" he said.Perrett and Talamas agreed that the new research helps us better understand how and why we might make certain judgements of others -- especially judgments that are often stereotyped and unfounded.""It's important to understand how we perceive others and how we are perceived, as studies show time and time again that, although frequently cautioned against it, we often judge a book by it's cover,"" Talamas said.This can be particularly important in a classroom setting or job interview in which perceptions of intelligence can have a real impact,"" he added. ""Being aware of how we can change our perceived intelligence with more sleep can hopefully encourage better sleep habits."""

The legislation, which the committee passed with bipartisan support in a 14-6 vote, favors a voluntary national standard rather than mandatory labeling. It would pre-empt a labeling law in Vermont, the first of its kind in the U.S., that's set to go into effect in July.The bill, backed by Agriculture Committee Chairman Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), could be called to a Senate vote as early as next week, according to The Huffington Post’s sources. The House already approved similar legislation last year.Backers of the Roberts bill, which include prominent industry figures like ConAgra, DuPont, Coca-Cola and Walmart, appear confident in the proposal’s chances, even as a rival group of senators has proposed alternative legislation.The alternative bill, introduced last week, aims to protect state-level GMO laws while also working toward a plan that would avoid a national patchwork of conflicting regulations. It is backed by Sens.

17,POLITICS,What's At Stake In The Senate's Looming GMO Labeling Battle,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gmo-labeling-bills-senate_us_56e05526e4b0b25c918053be,Industry groups are behind an aggressive push to make it harder to know if your food contains GMOs.,2016-03-09,"In this October 2014 photo, signage above a soup bar in Boulder, Colorado, indicates that the menu items are GMO-free. The debate over GMO labeling appears ready to reach the Senate floor.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A key debate regarding products that contain genetically modified organisms -- specifically, the question of whether they should have to carry labels stating as much -- is set for a showdown.Last week, legislation cleared the Senate Agricultural Committee that would block state-level laws mandating GMO labeling. The legislation, which the committee passed with bipartisan support in a 14-6 vote, favors a voluntary national standard rather than mandatory labeling. It would pre-empt a labeling law in Vermont, the first of its kind in the U.S., that's set to go into effect in July.The bill, backed by Agriculture Committee Chairman Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), could be called to a Senate vote as early as next week, according to The Huffington Post’s sources. The House already approved similar legislation last year.Backers of the Roberts bill, which include prominent industry figures like ConAgra, DuPont, Coca-Cola and Walmart, appear confident in the proposal’s chances, even as a rival group of senators has proposed alternative legislation.The alternative bill, introduced last week, aims to protect state-level GMO laws while also working toward a plan that would avoid a national patchwork of conflicting regulations.

18,SCIENCE,Computers Can Now Read Our Body Language,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/computer-bored-body-language_us_56cf087ce4b03260bf75964f,Scientists have rigged up computers to detect boredom based on movement.,2016-03-09,"In the future, this man's laptop might be able to tell that he's bored.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56cf08d61500002b000b0aa0.jpeg?cache=ni8IFrJEjJ&ops=crop_0_440_1931_1116%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Bored with the Excel spreadsheet or work emails on the screen in front of you? Your laptop will one day be able to tell, according to new research. Researchers have developed a program that allows a computer to read your body language and determine whether you're bored or interested by what you see on the screen. The University of Sussex findings, published Tuesday in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, showed that measuring a person's involuntary movements as they use a computer can reveal whether they are absorbed in what they're doing. Involuntary movements are tiny micro-movements that we constantly make. They include movements in the neck, face and limbs -- such as fiddling the hands, crossing the legs, shifting our gaze and turning the neck.If we're bored or unengaged, we'll make more of these movements. When we're interested in what we're doing -- which the researchers refer to as ""rapt engagement"" -- we make fewer involuntary movements.""It's the same as when a small child, who is normally constantly on the go, stares gaping at cartoons on the television without moving a muscle,"" Dr. Harry Witchel, a body language expert at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and the study's lead author, explained in a statement. For the research, 27 healthy participants sat in front of a computer with speakers. The participants were presented with a range of stimuli that ranged from enthralling to utterly boring over the course of three minutes -- ""fascinating games to tedious readings from EU banking regulation.""Meanwhile, the researchers used a handheld sensor device to track the participants' involuntary hand movements over the three-minute period. The movements were then measured and analyzed with video motion tracking. They also compared involuntary hand movements during two reading tasks, one engaging and one non-engaging, and found that the engaging reading task resulted in 42 percent fewer involuntary hand movements. ""People naturally make involuntary movements about once every 10 seconds -- this is the background 'movement of life,'"" Witchel said. ""What we showed is that when people are engaged with what is on a computer screen -- particularly when they are interested -- they inhibit their non-instrumental movements. People even inhibit their leg movements.""These findings could help computers to better detect a person's engagement level, potentially leading to improvements in digital learning. For instance, a tutoring program that adapts to the user's interest level could change its strategies when it detects the student becoming disengaged.The findings also have important implications for the development of artificial intelligence. According to Witchel, the research could one day help scientists to create more empathetic robots that are able to react to a person's level of engagement. ""Such robots or technologies will have to be able to read and respond to the emotions of the humans they interact with,"" he said. ""Part of that emotion-recognition will depend on posture and body language."""

21,POLITICS,Polls Got It Seriously Wrong In Michigan's Democratic Primary,"Ariel Edwards-Levy, Janie Velencia, and Natalie Jackson",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-michigan-polls-were-wrong_us_56dfaa6ce4b0b25c91801d95,"A swing and a Mich for pollsters, who said Hillary Clinton would easily win the state.",2016-03-09,Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks during a campaign event in Miami at the James L. Knight Center on Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56dfab9e1e0000b3007038e8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After a run of relative successes, polls missed in a big way Tuesday in Michigan's Democratic primary.Surveys showed Hillary Clinton a heavy favorite in the state, with those conducted in March giving her margins of between 11 and 37 points over Sanders. HuffPost Pollster, which includes all publicly available polling, gave Clinton an 18-point lead.Instead, Sanders pulled off a narrow victory, marking what could be a historic polling misfire.What happened? It's too early to know for sure, but there are a number of things that could have gone wrong.For one thing, though surveys in the state were consistent, they were relatively scarce. Fewer than 10 were released in the week before the election, with none fielded entirely after the Democratic debate Sunday in Flint, Michigan. Polling misfires often come down to a late surge toward one candidate, and Sanders made a concerted effort to swing the state. He outspent Clinton on ads in Michigan, according to data from Kantar Media, spending $3.5 million to her $2.6 million, and making a heavier investment in the last week before the primary.Surveys show Sanders gaining steam in Michigan, rising an average 9 points since mid-February, and a CBS/YouGov survey found voters more likely to report rising opinions of him than of Clinton.Exit polling also offers some hint of momentum for Sanders. According to preliminary results, he led by 7 points among the small fraction of voters who made up their minds last week, but trailed by 3 points among voters who decided prior to then. A last-minute shift, though, likely isn't enough to explain the discrepancy, especially since pre-election surveys showed Sanders far more than 3 points behind.The other possibilities largely revolve around demographics: Either Sanders turned out groups that favored him in heavier numbers than expected, or he managed to do far better among some groups than the polls anticipated.Sanders himself predicted an upset, telling supporters last week that with high enough turnout, he could win. The state saw a record number of voters.Results suggest that Sanders, who struggled to make any inroads among black voters in the South, fared significantly better in Michigan. Exit polls show him winning 30 percent of the state's black vote, compared with just 10 percent in Mississippi. A NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll of the state, which gave Clinton a 17-point lead, found him winning just 21 percent of African Americans, while a CBS/YouGov poll found Sanders taking just 19 percent of the black vote.The pre-election polls also appear to have underestimated turnout among young voters, who overwhelmingly support Sanders. That same NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll showed 18- to 29-year-olds making up 15 percent of the electorate, whereas the exit poll showed 20 percent of the electorate in that age group. In the pre-election poll, Sanders won the age group 74 percent to 25 percent; in the exit poll, his margin was bigger -- 81 percent to 18 percent. There were also differences on education in the Michigan electorate compared to the polled electorate. The NBC/WSJ/Marist poll had 38 percent college graduates in its sample, while the exit polls show 45 percent of the electorate was college graduates. Sanders does notably better among college graduates. Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray, whose survey found Clinton 13 points ahead, attributed the miss to ""voter volatility"" rather than an error in sampling. He noted that their poll showed an older, more heavily female electorate than the results suggested by exit polls. Clinton also under-performed among moderate, conservative and African-American voters, he said, although none of those differences was enough to explain the magnitude of the miss. ""[T]he biggest difference seems to be among white voters and gender,"" he said in an email. ""We had 49/48 Clinton among white voters compared to 42/57 in the exit polls. We had women at 59/36 versus 53/46 exit poll. We had men at 48/49 versus 44/54. So, it's a little bit of everything.""There are a few other possible factors at work. For one: Clinton voters, assuming she was a lock to win, might have felt less urgency to vote. Some, exit polls suggest, even might have crossed over to the Republican primary instead to vote against Trump.Pollster Bernie Porn of the Michigan firm EPIC-MRA, whose final survey showed Clinton 25 points ahead, pointed to a broad combination of those factors, including unusually high youth turnout and a last-minute focus on U.S. trade policy.""Based on past primary elections and what we expected as a reasonable increase for Sanders, we had about 12 percent age 18-34,"" he told HuffPost in an email. ""We are guessing that the percentage age 18-34 was in the 18-20 percent range. When we reweighted our poll for a 20 percent level of turnout for age 18-34, we were within 3 points of where Clinton ended up as a percentage.""Porn added that Sanders' attacks on Clinton's trade record during and after the last debate likely had an impact that came too late for the polls to measure. And he noted that the Clinton-friendly areas near Detroit, unlike the rest of the state, saw lower-than-anticipated turnout.As FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver noted, Michigan has a long history of polling upsets. Add another one to that list.This article has been updated with comments from pollster Bernie Porn."

Many have declared their intention to not support Trump under any circumstances. Many more fret about how a Trump nomination might adversely affect their party's opportunities down the ticket. It's safe to say that there's not a lot of love for Trump on Capitol Hill. But what if I told you that those lawmakers can do something, right now, to give an outlet to their Trump antipathy and make the world a better place to boot? Because I can think of one thing they can do: pass a federal law protecting people from strategic lawsuits against public participation, more colloquially known as SLAPP suits.What is a SLAPP suit? Basically, it's a lawsuit designed to chill free expression, in which a deep-pocketed litigant sues their critics knowing that even if they don't have a good case on the merits, the mere process of having to participate in the court battle could financially exhaust the defendant. Such lawsuits favor large corporations and wealthy plaintiffs, even when their cases are entirely frivolous. It's a very good way to deprive anyone without plutocratic financial reach of their free speech rights without actually having to win an argument.And Donald Trump? He loves him some SLAPP suits.Over at The Washington Post, Paul Farhi has a piece that details Trump's history of using the courts to quash dissent. The piece mostly focuses on Trump's recent vow to ""open up"" the current libel laws (somehow?) so that they protect him from facing public criticism (because he's thin-skinned), and details at great length the libel lawsuit Trump filed against former New York Times editor and Huffington Post executive editor Timothy O'Brien, who famously wrote a book about Trump in which he cast doubt over the reality television star's net worth.Deep down in the piece, Farhi offers up this revelation:Trump said in an interview that he knew he couldn’t win the suit but brought it anyway to make a point. “I spent a couple of bucks on legal fees, and they spent a whole lot more. I did it to make his life miserable, which I’m happy about.”In the first place, let me disclose that I have had lengthy conversations with O'Brien about his Trump book and the ensuing libel case he faced. In discussing both, I wouldn't describe him as ""miserable."" His emotional state, when talking about that case, was more like ""giddy."" Imagine a puppy dog in a ball pit, and that's how O'Brien seems, when he recalls these events.But more to the point, what Trump is describing in this instance is a SLAPP suit. They make him ""happy."" He'll probably go right on pursuing them. And regardless of what his net worth is (Trump sought, unsuccessfully, $5 billion in damages in the O'Brien case, which I guess would have settled the issue), Trump can intimidate critics in this fashion for pennies on the dollar.Back in 2011, another wealthy tyrant possessed of well-known physical diminution, Washington, D.C.-based NFL owner Dan Snyder, sued the Washington City Paper for having published ""The Cranky Redskins Fan's Guide to Dan Snyder,"" a piece which exhaustively detailed Snyder's many, many shortcomings. This case had the potential to test the City Paper's financial means.Fortunately, Snyder's P.R. flack went to an ""Ethics in Sports Media"" panel at Philip Merrill College and announced to all the students in the room that the case was essentially designed as a strategic lawsuit against public participation. The District of Columbia, which was the venue for this trial, happens to have some of the stronger anti-SLAPP protections in the country, so it's no surprise that the City Paper cited the laws specifically in their legal filings. (Snyder eventually filed to dismiss his own lawsuit.)Courts and lawmakers have, in recent years, taken a very dim view of SLAPP suits. At the moment, 28 states have enacted anti-SLAPP statutes of varying efficacy, and certain courts are more likely to toss a SLAPP suit than others. But without federal protection, vexatious litigants like Trump can still go forum-shopping for a venue that might look on their nonsense cases favorably.Here's some good news, though! Congress actually has the opportunity to put the kibosh on SLAPP suits. As the editors of the Los Angeles Times noted in their August editorial calling for a federal anti-SLAPP law that was as strong as the one in California (which is widely considered to be the gold standard), a solution may be right at hand.Efforts to create a federal anti-SLAPP law started at least six years ago, but this year marks the first time that a sizable and bipartisan group is backing such a bill. One impetus is the growing number of SLAPPs aimed at Web-based businesses that provide a forum for the public to discuss, rate and criticize the world around them. The proposal -- HR 2304 by Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) -- has at least two dozen cosponsors. Borrowing heavily from California's law and a similar statute in Texas, the bill would allow people sued in federal court or in states with little protection against SLAPPs to have a federal judge dismiss frivolous claims based on speech ""made in connection with an official proceeding or about a matter of public concern.""That bill, HR 2304 -- or the ""SPEAK FREE Act of 2015"" -- was referred to the House Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice in June. This might be a great time to dust that thing off and pass it in bipartisan fashion. It's good for free expression, it's a fitting bill to enact at this populist moment, and best of all, it would deprive Trump of something that makes him happy.Really, why wouldn't Congress pass this? Probably because the vast majority of your Congresscritters are on the take from powerful corporate interests who want to reserve for themselves the right to crush and destroy the rest of us at will, that's why.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits ""Eat The Press"" for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast ""So, That Happened.""

25,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Aims To Regain Momentum At Debate After Surprise Defeat In Michigan,Samantha Lachman and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-debate-florida_us_56e04b94e4b0b25c91804a56,Expect lots of talk targeting Latino voters.,2016-03-09,Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are meeting up for another debate on Wednesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e04d921500002a000b1770.jpeg?cache=mPOH04Q4rI&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will meet for their eighth primary debate Wednesday evening in Miami, one night after Sanders pulled off a huge upset and narrowly defeated Clinton in Michigan. It wasn’t that long ago that the Democrats were only supposed to meet for six debates, but both candidates believed it was to their advantage to negotiate for more as it became clear that Sanders was posing a legitimate threat to Clinton’s campaign. Their debate Sunday evening in Michigan focused in large part on the lead-contaminated water crisis in Flint, as well as on international trade, but immigration did not come up. That’s guaranteed to change on Wednesday, since the debate will be hosted by the Washington Post and Univision, the Spanish-language television network. Clinton's campaign hopes to blunt Sanders’ bid by crushing him in Florida on Tuesday, where recent polls have had her up by 30 points over Sanders. Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio also hold their Democratic primaries the same day. Since Florida sends 246 delegates to the Democratic convention this summer, it is by far the biggest prize of the night.While Sanders has defeated Clinton in majority-white states like New Hampshire, Colorado, Minnesota, Maine, Kansas, Maine, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Vermont, Clinton has won by much larger margins in states with larger nonwhite electorates. She’s won every contest in the South, as well as the Iowa and Nevada caucuses and the Massachusetts primary. Latino voters -- and nonwhite voters in general -- could be pivotal in upcoming races, Florida in particular. Pew Research Center reports that Latinos make up about 18 percent of eligible voters in the state. While immigration does not rank as the first priority for most Latino voters, it is often a decisive one. Clinton is currently leading among Latino Democrats in Florida, according to a Washington Post-Univision News poll released Wednesday. Sixty-eight of them support her, versus 21 percent who support Sanders. There was a similar margin on immigration; 66 percent of Latino Democrats polled said they trusted Clinton more on the issue, while 18 percent chose Sanders. Both Clinton and Sanders are trying to appeal to the pro-reform voters, with promises to immediately push for bills in Congress or to act on their own -- going further than President Barack Obama has -- if those legislative efforts fail. The campaigns gave a preview of their attack lines in dueling calls with the press on Tuesday, bringing out Latino lawmakers and former officials to do so. Sanders supporters, including Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), said Clinton was inconsistent on the issue, citing her 2007 opposition to driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants and her 2014 statement that unaccompanied minors coming to the U.S. from Central America ""should be sent back."" Clinton supporters hit back, pointing out that although he voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2013, Sanders voted against it in 2007. He also broke with Democrats in a 2006 vote to protect Minutemen militias that patrolled the southern border, and was generally absent from reform efforts during his time in the House, Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) told reporters on a call.Gutiérrez said Latinos should ask ""where was he before he was running for president?"" ""The truth is that at the moment when we needed someone to stand up and defend our vision of immigration, at the moment when immigrants were being demonized, Sanders was playing for the wrong team,"" he said. While Clinton still has a relatively comfortable lead over Sanders in delegates, the senator’s campaign has said he is going all the way to the convention. He certainly has enough money to do so, as small-dollar donors who aren't yet maxed out helped him out-raise Clinton in January and February. Since the states that vote on Tuesday are delegate-heavy ones, and are awarded proportionally, Sanders needs to keep as close to Clinton as possible to maintain the argument that he’s better-suited to take on the Republican nominee in November. The debate will be broadcast at 9 p.m. EST on CNN and Fusion in English and Univision in Spanish. The Washington Post’s website will also have a livestream. "
26,POLITICS,Why Bernie Sanders And Donald Trump Won The Michigan Primaries,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-donald-trump-michigan-trade_us_56e031e9e4b0860f99d74646,"It's the trade deals, stupid.",2016-03-09,"“Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America,"" Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders said in his recent debate against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Michigan.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Despite their countless differences as presidential candidates, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and business mogul Donald Trump have been hammering on the exact same theme for months on the campaign trail. The democratic socialist and the Republican billionaire agree on one thing: U.S. trade policy has been a disaster for working-class Americans.That message helped propel both insurgent campaigns to their respective victories in Michigan on Tuesday night. For Sanders, the win marks a historic upset in the modern history of Democratic presidential primaries.The exit polling from Michigan indicates that most voters there are wary of free trade agreements -- and that Sanders and Trump drubbed their opponents among those voters. According to CNN, 58 percent of Democratic voters polled after casting ballots said they believe U.S. trade with other countries takes away U.S. jobs, compared with just 30 percent who said they believe it creates them. Among that group, Sanders won by a whopping 17-point margin: 58 percent to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's 41 percent. He won the primary overall by less than a 2-point margin.Republican voters were almost as bearish on U.S. trade policy as their Democratic counterparts, according to CNN. Fifty-five percent said they believe trade kills U.S. jobs, compared to 32 percent who said they believe it creates them. Among that group, Trump won twice as many votes as any of his competitors, earning 45 percent to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's 22 percent, Ohio Gov. John Kasich's 20 percent and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's 9 percent. Overall, he won the Michigan primary with about 36 percent of votes.Trade -- and resentment toward U.S. trade policy -- has been the sleeper issue in 2016. By eliminating trade barriers with low-wage countries, the North American Free Trade Agreement and subsequent treaties over the past two decades have encouraged U.S. companies to move jobs to countries where workers are paid less. Sanders has made a point of pressing Clinton on trade throughout the Democratic debates, including just days ago. The Vermont independent has been a vocal opponent of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal with 12 Pacific Rim countries championed by President Barack Obama. Clinton's stance on the deal hasn't been nearly as clear. Trump, meanwhile, has made a point of saying -- over and over and over again -- that China and other nations are ""killing us"" on trade, and he points to our trade deals as a key reason.It isn't surprising that Michigan voters would have a dim view of our trade deals, or that they would now be gravitating to candidates who loudly reject those deals. Like other Rust Belt states, Michigan has lost a lot of manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a free trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, came into force in 1994. According to an analysis of labor statistics by the think tank Public Citizen, Michigan shed 231,752 manufacturing jobs between 1994 and 2015. Those lost jobs had employed 28.3 percent of the state's manufacturing workforce. In 2010, an analysis by the liberal Economic Policy Institute found that the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico after NAFTA was enacted led Michigan to lose 43,000 jobs. EPI said Michigan was the hardest-hit of all U.S. states.And Democratic voters in Michigan no doubt remember who signed NAFTA into law: Hillary Clinton's husband, President Bill Clinton."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56df92001e000087007038e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a depressingly apt metaphor for gender inequality in women's soccer, U.S. Women's National Team goalkeeper Hope Solo shared a photo proving that the world's top women players are literally competing on an uneven -- and very patchy -- playing field. Ahead of Wednesday night's championship match against Germany for the inaugural SheBelieves Cup, Solo offered a look at the sorry condition at FAU Stadium in Boca Raton, Florida. The so-called ""grass ceiling"" has become shorthand for the glaring inequality that pervades women's soccer. When it comes to prize money, for example, the World Cup winning women's team got $2 million, while the men's team that lost in the first round got $8 million. Huh?Last year's tournament was the first World Cup ever -- men's or women's -- to be played on artificial turf. The players noted the artificial turf significantly changes the style of play and is much harder on the player's bodies -- which in pro soccer, are their livelihood. During their World Cup victory tour months later, the team refused to play on the torn up, outdated, rock-strewn turf field in Hawaii for a friendly match against Trinidad and Tobago. Even their coach cut practice down to 30 minutes to prevent potential injuries.FAU stadium for the SheBelieves Cup is a grass field, but the USWNT players have previously stated the issue isn't simply turf versus grass, it's about ""field conditions and player safety."" Men's teams, by contrast, are not subjected playing on sub-par fields. (Or expected to stay in the same hotel as their opponents. Or encouraged to wear tighter shorts to show off their bodies.)The ""turf war"" even sparked a 2015 gender discrimination lawsuit ahead of the World Cup in Canada, thought it was later withdrawn. The team's last official collective bargaining agreement bars the women from striking -- over field conditions or otherwise. The more current but less official ""memorandum of understanding,"" meanwhile, is at the root of another battle the women are fighting against the U.S. Soccer Federation. Ironically, on International Women's Day, Solo and her fellow female players' call for ""#EqualMeansEqual"" remains just a hashtag. "

""I think your question is a very nasty question, and I'm not proud of it because I didn't even hear of it, okay?

Odom was wanted in connection with the Sunday afternoon shooting of Pastor Tim Remington outside the Altar Church, Coeur d'Alene Police Department spokesman Jared Reneau said in an email. The attack is the latest in a spate of highly publicized shootings in the United States that have made gun control an issue in the presidential race.Remington had led a prayer at a Cruz rally on Saturday, and was shot the next day in the church parking lot in what police have called a preplanned attack.The senior pastor lost consciousness after being shot six times, including in the skull, after Sunday morning service, John Padula, outreach pastor at the church told Reuters.Remington regained consciousness on Monday evening as a candlelight and prayer vigil for his recovery was under way, Padula said.""He opened one eye and gave me a thumbs up,"" Padula said, adding that Remington does not have feeling in his right arm but appears to be improving. ""It's absolutely unbelievable,"" Padula said. ""Without God, there is no way he'd be here.""There is no apparent connection between the shooting and Remington's appearance at the Cruz rally, Padula noted. Surveillance video at the church appeared to show the suspect scoping out the church days before that event.Cruz, an outspoken supporter of gun rights, could not be reached for comment on Tuesday, but a campaign spokeswoman told NBC News on Monday that they were praying for Remington's recovery.Authorities told local broadcaster KREM that Odom, who is an ex-Marine with a history of mental illness, should be considered armed and dangerous.The suspect fled the scene of the shooting in a silver sedan before police arrived. Padula said he was not aware of any evidence that Odom and Remington knew each other."

CNN barely even mentioned Clinton's remarks and went right back to its panel of guests.Fox News' Bret Baier noticed that none of the networks cut away for Clinton. He commented that his network ""held on"" Trump during her event. But Fox didn't replay Clinton's speech afterward, at least not immediately.[10:29] "
