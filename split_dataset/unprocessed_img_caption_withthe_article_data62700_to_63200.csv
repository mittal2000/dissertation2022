0,POLITICS,Missouri Democrats Filibuster For 39 Hours To Stop Anti-Gay 'Religious Freedom' Bill,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/missouri-filibuster-lgbt-religious-freedom_us_56e0514be4b065e2e3d45217,But Republicans passed it anyway.,2016-03-09,"Missouri state Sen. Bob Onder (R), left, is the sponsor of a constitutional amendment that would prevent the state from punishing taxpayer-funded groups, or people, who deny services to same-couples because of their religious beliefs.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586d75731500009506e9e827.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A 39-hour filibuster waged by Democratic senators in Missouri ended early Wednesday as Republicans forced a vote on a bill that would let organizations openly discriminate against same-sex couples.The bill, SJR 39, proposes amending the Missouri Constitution to prohibit the state from “penalizing clergy, religious organizations, and certain individuals for their religious beliefs concerning marriage between two people of the same sex.”In effect, it opens the door to all kinds of anti-gay discrimination by taxpayer-funded entities. It means state-contracted counselors, for example, could deny services to people in same-sex marriages. Taxpayer-funded adoption and foster care agencies could refuse to place children in their homes. State-funded homeless shelters could turn away people in a same-sex marriage. Government employees could refuse to file official forms for such people, a la Kim Davis, or decline to provide state tax benefits to them.“After a record-breaking filibuster, the majority decided they did not like democracy,” Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Missouri, told The Huffington Post. “This is an effort to amend our constitution to enshrine inequality. So it’s incredibly concerning.”Republican legislators, who say the measure “protects religious people from government penalties,” passed the bill 21-11 on Wednesday morning. It still has to clear another Senate vote, and then it will go to the GOP-led House, where it is expected to pass. From there, it will go to Missouri voters for approval, either in the August primary or the November general election.Missouri Democrats sparked a national campaign over their filibuster, which broke records in the state and has been compared to then-Texas Sen. Wendy Davis’ 2013 filibuster of an anti-abortion bill. Davis and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton were among the high-profile figures cheering on Missouri Democrats this week, using the hashtag #NotInMyState.Missouri Republicans also drew some notable supporters.White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that he didn't know much about the bill's specifics. He added, though, that from the sound of it, it is ""inconsistent with the values of justice and fairness and equality that this administration has long pursued.""The fight in Missouri comes at a time when bakers and florists have faced legal challenges in other states for refusing to provide services for same-sex weddings. It also comes as Republicans in other states, like Georgia, are pushing similar bills.The business community has played a major role in stopping bills like this, and that could happen in Missouri. In Indiana, for example, corporations like Salesforce and Apple publicly opposed a similar bill there, threatening to pull their business out of the state if it became law. The measure was subsequently watered down. In Georgia, companies like Dell and Twitter have condemned a similar bill being debated there.Hundreds of Missouri businesses, faith leaders and local organizations signed a letter last week urging lawmakers not to pass SJR 39. Barnes-Jewish Hospital Foundation, one of the largest employers in the state, has come out against the bill. Dow Chemical and Monsanto are also publicly opposed.Missouri's legislative session runs through mid-May, which means lawmakers have plenty of time to amend the bill or pass it as is. In the meantime, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D), who will play no role in approving or rejecting the bill since it's a ballot measure, has been clear how he feels about it.This story has been updated to include Earnest's remarks."

4,TECH,Yik Yak Introduces Screen Names To Curb Anonymous Trolling,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yik-yak-screen-names_us_56dddca8e4b0000de40568f8,Will niceness follow?,2016-03-08,"Tyler Droll, CEO of Yik Yak (L) and Brooks Buffington, COO of Yik Yak, announced a new feature on the app Tuesday: handles. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56de19a21e0000b300703748.jpeg?cache=FfvXPH3Uo8&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yik Yak on Tuesday began allowing users to choose a screen name, a shift for the social media app known for anonymity that may help reduce trolling and cyberbullying. Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington, who founded the Atlanta-based company in November 2013, told The Huffington Post in an interview that the new feature is designed to increase engagement and attract new users from outside their core base of college students. It also aims to combat trolling, they said.""We're doing this to create these tighter-knit communities, but we still do give users that option to toggle [using their screen name] on and off,"" Droll said. ""It'll help them personalize their community more as they start to recognize people they like or don't like.""Screen names have been a social media mainstay since the heyday of AOL chatrooms and forums. Yik Yak, which uses cellphone GPS locators to allow users to anonymously blog to others within a few miles, had been an exception.It became a huge hit on college campuses with an anonymous platform that allows an unfiltered conversation. However, as anyone scrolling through a Yik Yak comment section can attest, anonymity may not breed a sophisticated community. Protesters on college campuses demonstrating over racial issues frequently cite disparaging posts on Yik Yak as evidence.By allowing users to create screen names -- but not requiring them -- Yik Yak is nudging users to take ownership of their comments. User names alone won't solve problems with trolling. For instance, Twitter, which requires users to have a handle, can be a nightmare (just ask HuffPost reporter Julia Craven). Twitter recently started a ""Trust & Safety Council"" to combat harassment. And people still say offensive things on Facebook all time -- one woman in Texas is on the verge of being elected to the state Board of Education while claiming that President Barack Obama was a gay male prostitute. (He was not.) Droll and Buffington said screen names will add to a sense of community that also has been helped by Yik Yak's recent introduction of icons that track the original poster of a comment and those who join the discussion.""Replies increased two-fold due to the introduction of these icons,"" Buffington said. The company saw a ""hunger from users for deeper-level interactions,"" and ""wanted to make it even easier and more natural for them to bond."" Yik Yak's efforts to combat trolling are similar to what Bored@ has done. Bored@, an anonymous forum that predates Yik Yak, closed its Dartmouth College forum last fall, citing foul speech, but the founder said boards at Columbia University in New York and Carleton College in Minnesota have worked well, in part, because of user personalities.Ninety-eight percent of Yik Yak users are millennials, ages 18 to 34, according to Comscore. A screen name may make for a ""much more comfortable and familiar"" experience to those outside their core user base, Droll said. There can only be one person claiming a YikYak screen name, so Droll will be the only ""Tyler"" on Yik Yak, forcing this reporter to pick ""Tyler88"" or some other variation. But it's one step that may prevent people from trying to pose as someone they are not, and there will be a way to request Yik Yak investigate if a user believes they are being impersonated. Some Yik Yak users have already begun manually adding their names in posts, Buffington said. And some users sign their names on restaurant advice.At this point, YikYak doesn't plan to introduce branded content, Buffington said, ""but I do think it does offer the potential for campus administrators or for a local restaurant.""_______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter based in New York, and covers higher education and millennials, among other topics.

5,POLITICS,"Cities, Counties Enter Supreme Court Fray Over Immigration",Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cities-supreme-court-immigration_us_56ddf8dfe4b0000de4058c21,Local leaders are coming out against their states' governors over deportation relief.,2016-03-08,New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) helped organize an amicus brief in support of the president's deportation relief programs.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56de12151500002a000b157e.jpeg?cache=7SYwtSF76X&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Leaders from nearly 120 cities and counties are backing deportation relief for undocumented immigrants in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court -- many of them in opposition to governors of their states.A coalition of cities and counties, along with the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities, will file a brief on Tuesday urging the Supreme Court to side against states that sued to block President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration. Those policies have been on hold for more than a year, leaving millions of undocumented immigrants unsure whether they will be granted temporary work authorization and deportation reprieve. The Supreme Court is set to hear hear arguments on Texas v. United States on April 18. Texas and 25 other states argue in the lawsuit that Obama overstepped his authority with the deportation relief, which they claim would harm local governments that would have to provide services, such as granting driver's licenses, for more people. Many mayors and city councils disagree, highlighting a schism between governors and local government leaders over immigration in more than half of the states that joined the lawsuit.The conflict is not just governors being contradicted by small-time local leaders. In many cases, it's leaders from their state's most populous cities. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner (D) and Austin Mayor Steve Adler (D) are going against Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), for example, and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed (D) is challenging Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R). In total, 44 of the cities and counties that signed onto the amicus brief are from states that either are plaintiffs on the Texas v. USA lawsuit or support it, according to the pro-immigration reform coalition Cities for Action, which organized the filing. The group said the localities involved in the brief are home to about 15 million immigrants, including more than 1.5 million who could benefit from Obama's programs. Allowing the programs to move forward would make the localities safer and provide them with revenue, they argue.""Immigrants are part of the economic and social fabric of our cities and nation. ... But the long-delayed implementation of the President’s executive action is tearing those families and our communities apart,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said in a statement. De Blasio, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D), and the mayors of Atlanta, Austin and Birmingham, Alabama, organized the brief. More than 70 cities and counties signed onto a previous amicus brief opposing the lawsuit last year, when it was before an appeals court.Others have come to the defense of Obama's plans for the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, or DAPA, and an expansion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Thirty-four Senate Democrats and 184 House Democrats filed an amicus brief in December, and a dozen states filed a previous brief in the lower courts. A number of advocacy groups have organized other actions that argue for deportation relief.The House of Representatives as a whole may go in the other direction, arguing with the 26 states that contend Obama's actions were unconstitutional. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said the chamber will take a ""very extraordinary step"" and vote on a resolution that would allow them to file an amicus brief on behalf of the House. Congressional Democrats, 186 in the House and 39 in the Senate, announced plans Tuesday to file a new brief in the Supreme Court. The brief will argue that ""Congress ... encouraged the Executive to use its resources in a rational and effective manner on cases in which the nation’s interest in removal is strongest, to provide the maximum return on Congress’s sizeable but necessarily limited investment in immigration enforcement,"" according to a press release from Democratic leaders. This piece has been updated with information about the Democrats' plans to file a new brief. "
6,SPORTS,Virginia Just Became The First State To Regulate DraftKings And FanDuel,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/virginia-draftkings-fanduel_us_56de1407e4b03a405679a50b,The new rules will provide at least some oversight of the scandal-plagued daily fantasy sports industry.,2016-03-08,"While Virginia is the first state to regulate DraftKings and FanDuel, it is a relatively small market for daily fantasy sports companies.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56df01001e000087007037d1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) on Monday signed a sweeping package of regulations to govern daily fantasy sports operators, five months after an ""insider trading"" scandal engulfed DraftKings and FanDuel, the two largest companies in the daily fantasy sports industry.Virginia is now the first state to enact new regulations over the industry since the scandal erupted. The regulatory package, called the Fantasy Contest Act, could be a sign of things to come in other states, dozens of which have applied their own scrutiny to the legality of daily fantasy sports, legal experts and industry observers said.""I think it is the start of a major shift in how daily fantasy sports operators are approached on a state-by-state basis,"" said Darren Heitner, a Florida-based sports attorney who has advised smaller daily fantasy operators and closely monitors the industry. ""I don't think we should underestimate the value of Virginia passing the bill and having it signed by the governor, because this is the start and not the end of what I believe will be a state-by-state enactment of these types of laws.""DraftKings, the largest daily fantasy sports web site, hailed Virginia's package of ""thoughtful and appropriate"" regulations in a Monday statement, and indeed suggested that other states should follow suit.""We thank Governor McAuliffe for his leadership and advocacy and are hopeful that other states across the country will follow Virginia’s lead,"" Griffin Finan, DraftKings' director of public affairs, said in the statement. ""We will continue to work actively to replicate this success with dozens of legislatures and are excited to continue these efforts.”Virginia's regulatory law is based partially on model legislation the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, the industry's lobbying arm, has pushed in recent months. It aims to address many of the chief concerns raised in the aftermath of the scandal, which blew up after a DraftKings employee won thousands of dollars in a fantasy contest on the rival site FanDuel. The law will ban employees of daily fantasy operators from playing in contests on rival sites -- a practice DraftKings, FanDuel, and many smaller companies moved to implement in the wake of the scandal -- and prohibits the sharing of proprietary information about contests before it is publicly available.It also sets a minimum age of 18 for entry in daily fantasy contests, and includes potentially major elements regarding the companies' financial practices. The law requires twice-annual independent audits, and mandates that the companies segregate funds used for operational purposes from the money paid out to contest winners. (The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services will oversee regulation of the industry under the law.)How effective those regulations will be in addressing concerns raised by the scandal is ""subject to debate,"" said Marc Edelman, a sports attorney at the City University of New York's Baruch College of Law. ""But even minimal requirements with respect to age participation, geographic locations and segregating of entry fees from other company revenues are incredibly important,"" Edelman said. ""The regulatory requirements are a step in the right direction.""Dustin Gouker, a writer at LegalSportsReport.com, which covers the gaming industry and has followed the scandal's fallout, agreed.""Something is better than nothing,"" Gouker said. ""DraftKings and FanDuel will be regulated at least to some extent.""Still, the industry observers who spoke to The Huffington Post also raised major concerns with the legislation -- especially if other states look to Virginia as an example.The Virginia law, for instance, requires daily fantasy companies that wish to operate in the state to pay a $50,000 annual registration fee, a sizable amount that won't affect lucrative companies like DraftKings and FanDuel but could push smaller operators out of the state altogether. The law McAuliffe signed will not fully resolve all of the legal issues around daily fantasy sports, Edelman and Heitner said. It lacks clarity in some areas, including its definition of fantasy sports contests.The Virginia rules will apply not only to daily fantasy operators, but also to those that operate more traditional season-long fantasy contests. While long-term contests have always been regarded as different from daily ones from a legal perspective, the Virginia law requires the season-long operators to pay the licensing fees.""In essence, the bill is a big win for FanDuel, DraftKings, and perhaps Yahoo, which are companies that can afford the licensing fee,"" said Edelman, who has consulted for fantasy companies and helped full-season fantasy operators draft a letter of opposition to the bill McAuliffe signed. ""By contrast, the bill is a huge loss for almost everyone else in the marketplace, especially season-long fantasy operators ... which likely may not be able to operate without paying that hefty licensing fee.""""It adds a very large monetary obligation for many season-long operators that seemed to have no real cause for concern up until the passing of this law,"" Heitner said. ""With a little more discussion, the state of Virginia would have understood that it's probably improper at this time to include season-long [fantasy leagues] under the same regulations that you impose on daily fantasy sports.""The FSTA said in a statement Monday that it was ""deeply concerned"" with Virginia's ""onerous"" registration fee.That other states will follow Virginia in regulating the industry seems almost certain. Many are weighing similar legislation or regulations, especially in the wake of scrutiny from attorneys general in states like Illinois, Massachusetts and New York. Others, like Nevada, have put the industry squarely under gaming commissions. (In October, the Nevada Gaming Commission ruled that daily fantasy companies needed a gambling license to operate in the state.)In that sense, Virginia may not become a word-by-word model for other states, Gouker said, even as many of them are also operating off of the same FSTA model legislation that helped drive Virginia's effort. New Jersey, for instance, has considered taxing the industry, while Indiana's proposal, which passed the state Senate this week and is expected to be signed by Gov. Mike Pence (R), puts the industry under its state gaming authority.""I think states are coming at it from their own perspectives,"" Gouker said. ""A lot of states are dealing with their own concerns, and each state is making changes as they go.""Virginia, too, is a relatively small market for daily fantasy sports companies, and many observers, and perhaps even the companies themselves, will likely turn to much larger states for a glimpse of what the atmosphere around the industry will look like in the future.""It's definitely a milestone. But it's not like this was a giant market,"" Gouker said. ""Florida, California, Illinois, New York, Texas. Those are the states that are most important. We need clarity in those big markets, and whether progress in the little states translates into the big states remains to be seen."""

9,POLITICS,Obama Could Help Victims Of Rape Around The World With One Simple Move,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-rape-abortion-helms-amendment_us_56ded325e4b0000de405b884,What is he waiting for?,2016-03-08,There is growing pressure for President Barack Obama to change a policy that blocks foreign aid from going toward abortion care for women raped in conflict zones and developing countries.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- On International Women's Day, reproductive rights advocates sharply criticized President Barack Obama for failing to reverse a U.S. policy that blocks abortion care for women raped in conflict. “We know the president understands that women are being raped in conflict, he’s spoken publicly about it five times in the last year and a half,” said Serra Sippel, president of the reproductive rights group Center for Health and Gender Equity. “I do not understand why he would isolate himself on the issue of abortion access in post-rape care -- when there is so much support.""The policy at issue is the Helms Amendment -- a 1973 law that prevents U.S. foreign aid money from providing abortion ""as a method of family planning."" Every White House including the current one has applied that prohibition even to cases of rape, incest and life of the mother, which legal experts say is a gross misinterpretation of the policy. A Nigerian schoolgirl who was kidnapped and raped by the extremist group Boko Haram and needs an abortion, for instance, would not be using the procedure as a ""family planning"" method -- but humanitarian aid organizations that receive U.S. funding are still discouraged from offering her the option to end her pregnancy. Because the U.S. is the largest donor to women's health in the world, the Helms Amendment has a chilling effect on safe and legal abortion care for millions of women raped in conflict zones, developing countries and humanitarian crises. The lack of abortion access pushes these women to seek unsafe abortions, which are a leading cause of maternal mortality around the globe. An estimated 45,000 women die from back-alley procedures each year -- a staggering number that could be significantly reduced by U.S. support for comprehensive post-rape care.There is growing pressure on the White House to change the policy. It wouldn't require an act of Congress -- all Obama would need to do is issue an executive order declaring that his administration interprets the Helms Amendment to have exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders both said they would change the policy if they were elected, and 109 U.S. senators and representatives have written letters to the president urging him to take action. Obama would also have the support of the public in making such a move. Sippel's group, CHANGE, released a new poll on Tuesday that shows a majority -- 55 percent of voters -- favor allowing U.S. foreign aid money to provide safe abortions for women raped in conflict, while 39 percent oppose it. The nationwide survey, conducted in February by the Democratic pollster Lake Research Partners, found that support for changing the Helms Amendment grows stronger after respondents read that terrorist groups like Boko Haram and the Islamic State are increasingly using rape and kidnapping as a tool of war. Fifty-nine percent of voters who received that information said they favor allowing U.S. foreign assistance for safe abortion care in those circumstances, and only 32 percent oppose it. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. But despite Obama's silence on the issue, reproductive rights advocates are not giving up hope that this administration will address the policy before elections in November.""On today of all days, International Women’s Day, one must ask: Mr. President, what are you waiting for?” Sippel said.

Alicia White, according to WBAL.An order issued by Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Barry Williams stating that prosecutors could not call on Porter to testify against Lt. Brian Rice and Officers Edward Nero and Garrett Miller was also struck down. Prosecutors said that they could compel Porter to testify against the other officers since he was being offered limited immunity. His defense, however, maintained that Porter would be in danger of incriminating himself.Porter, who plead not guilty to manslaughter, second-degree assault, misconduct in office and reckless endangerment charges, was the first to be tried in Gray’s death. But, after deliberating for three days, the jury told Williams they could not reach a unanimous verdict on any of the charges. Williams declared a mistrial.During the trial, Porter testified that he told Brandon Ross, a friend of Gray who filmed the arrest, to “take the video to the media.” Porter also claimed that he repeatedly told Goodson that Gray needed medical attention. He also told the jury that he has never discharged his firearm, or used Mace or a Taser while on duty. Gray died in April after sustaining a spinal cord injury while riding in a police van. His death sparked protests throughout the city.All six officers allegedly involved in Gray’s death were indicted in May and each has plead not guilty to all charges. They are facing charges of misconduct in office and reckless endangerment.Goodson was charged with second-degree “depraved-heart” murder, manslaughter, and two counts of vehicular manslaughter and second-degree assault. White and Lt. Brian Rice were charged with involuntary manslaughter and second-degree assault. Officers Edward Nero and Garrett Miller are also facing charges of second-degree assault."

Just before the 2012 election, Romney's favorability rating among Republicans stood at 86 percent. But that number has sunk to 46 percent, according to the most recent poll.Trump, by contrast, garners a relatively healthy 57 percent. Asked which man they'd prefer as president, Republicans choose Trump by a 5-point margin, giving him 44 percent to Romney's 39 percent.A substantial minority of the GOP, like Romney, is concerned about Trump. About one-third agree that Trump is a ""phony"" and a ""fraud,"" and 40 percent call him ""dangerous."" The word more people seem to attach to Trump, however, is ""electable."" Sixty-two percent of Republicans say Trump would have a better chance than Romney of winning this year's general election if he were the GOP nominee. Just 21 percent see Romney, who already lost once, as having a better shot.As other polling has already suggested, Romney's clout is even more limited among Trump supporters. The majority of Republicans who hope to see Trump nominated also say they voted for Romney four years ago. However, just 23 percent of those Trump supporters have a positive opinion of Romney today.Romney's cri de coeur, instead, has played best among a different audience: Democrats. Members of the opposing party prefer Romney over Trump by a 35-point margin, 53 percent to 18 percent. Seventy-one percent agree with Romney that Trump is a phony and fraud, with more than three-quarters calling Trump dangerous. Independents also express overwhelming dislike toward Trump, meaning the nation as a whole thinks Romney has a point. Romney's favorability rating among all Americans is just 27 percent, but a majority believe he's right to consider Trump a phony and a fraud, and 57 percent agree that Trump would be dangerous as a leader.If Trump ends up being the Republican nominee, it's easy to see Romney's denunciation turning into a Democratic attack ad. As a way to change the course of the Republican primary, though, it doesn't promise to be quite as effective.

""The State's trial evidence resembles a house of cards.""Wearry's conviction for the 1998 beating death of a teenaged pizza delivery driver was based heavily on the account of two jailhouse snitches who claimed to have connections to the crime or the victim. But their testimony was so inconsistent and marred by conflicts of interests that the Supreme Court, in its extensive review of the trial record, found it too ""dubious"" and ""suspect"" to credit it.The facts of the case, including an alibi defense that Wearry couldn't prove, are labyrinthine at best. But the court faulted the prosecution for failing to turn over police reports that cast doubt on the credibility of one of these witnesses, plus evidence that the other man simply wanted to testify against Wearry to cut his own prosecution deal.In light of this and other withheld evidence, the Supreme Court ruled that Louisiana's actions violated ""settled constitutional principles"" and that Wearry should be granted a new trial.The decision in the case, Wearry v. Cain, was ""per curiam,"" which means it was unsigned by the justices and issued in the name of the entire court. The ruling also was a summary disposition -- a ruling reached without formal briefs and oral arguments from the two sides. (The court on Monday decided a separate case involving a lesbian mother's parental rights much the same way.)Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, took issue with the court for deciding the Wearry case that way, and argued Louisiana should've been given an opportunity to more fully present its legal arguments. ""Questions that seem quite simple at first glance sometimes look very different after both sides are given a chance to make their case,"" Alito wrote in his dissent. ""Of course, this process means extra work for the Court,"" Alito wrote. ""But it leads to better results, and it gives the losing side the satisfaction of knowing that at least its arguments have been fully heard.""The majority largely brushed aside Alito's concerns, and noted that there was nothing problematic or unprecedented about deciding the case summarily -- especially given Wearry's years as a condemned man for a crime he likely didn't commit. ""The alternative"" to taking the case, the court said, ""is forcing Wearry to endure yet more time on Louisiana's death row in service of a conviction that is constitutionally flawed.""According to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that tracks the application of capital punishment across the country, Louisiana officials have been found to have engaged in misconduct in 10 death penalty cases where the defendants were ultimately exonerated.This story has been updated to include information from the Death Penalty Information Center."

Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) came under fire last year when he suggested that same-sex couples and heterosexual couples be put on different islands with “everything they need to survive” to see which groups die out “in a hundred years.”He reiterated that suggestion at least twice over the course of the year and received criticism each time. Now, in an interview with me on SiriusXM Progress at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) last week, Gohmert said he’s not backing down.“People, when they’re angry, they don’t recognize common sense,” he said, explaining the backlash he's received. “They can’t destroy the example and how solidly that represents common sense and truth. So they attack the giver. Just like one of my friends in Congress says, ‘Louie, you’re basically the Jeremiah of the Congress. You stand up. You call it like it is. You warn us where things are going if we do certain things. And people get mad and figuratively throw you in prison. And then it comes about like you said.’ That seems to be happening a lot. But I’m not backing down from the truth.”As we discussed his views on the dangers of same-sex marriage and the Supreme Court’s 2015 marriage equality ruling, Gohmert once again offered up the island suggestion. “As I told a C-Span interviewer, it just occurred to me as I was asked, but if you want a long-term study on what’s the best building block for the family, you can take couples, man and wife couples, put them on an island where they have everything they need to sustain a society,” he explained. ""Take all male couples, put them on an island, everything they need to survive. Take all women couples, put them on an island, and all they need to survive. Come back in 100 years and see which building block has been most effective in perpetuating their society and I think it’ll tell you all you need to know.""The Republican congressman, who has endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz for the GOP presidential nomination, also offered his theory on why many evangelicals are backing Donald Trump.“Well, being a student of the Bible, I’ve seen this before and it’s understandable,” Gohmert said. “It is basically the same situation that the children of Israel had back when they started asking God for a king and he was trying to make it clear: ‘This is not a good thing,’ [And they replied,] ‘No, we what a protector. We want a king like other people have.’…Christians are being vilified, now being persecuted and prosecuted in this country just for having biblical beliefs. And they are so tired of being beat up that some Christian leaders are saying, ‘You know what? I’m tired of having Christians I get behind… end up turning on us. I’ll be for anybody who will protect us.’ And basically, that’s what the children of Israel said, 'Give us a big warrior, like King Saul.'""He went on to note, ""Americans need to be careful because, just like the children of Israel, they will not like what they get when they ask for a second narcissistic, thin-skinned, basically, monarch."""

In 2014, all federal minimum wage workers in the U.S. combined made less than half of what Wall Street paid its New York City employees just in bonuses.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56df12d61e0000870070380d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wall Street's bonuses were so lavish last year that they doubled the combined annual pay of the nation's full-time minimum wage workers, according to a new report.Securities firms set aside $25 billion for bonuses for their roughly 172,000 New York City employees, the New York State comptroller said Monday.That compares to the estimated $12 billion earned in 2014 by the 895,000 Americans who worked at least 35 hours a week for the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, the Institute for Policy Studies said in a report Tuesday.It's the second straight year that bonuses on Wall Street doubled the combined earnings of the nation's full-time minimum wage workers, the institute said.The report comes as low-wage workers across the country fight for higher pay, and presidential candidates increasingly highlight income inequality on the campaign trail. Sen. Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton's rival for the Democratic nomination, has referred to wealth and income inequality as ""the great moral issue of our time.""The increasing gap in pay helped prompt fast food workers in 2012 to launch the so-called Fight for $15 movement, which advocates for hourly pay of at least $15. The National Employment Law Project reckons that Americans need to earn at least $15 an hour in order to cover basic living costs in much of the country.Some 42 percent of workers earn less than $15 per hour, the employment group estimates.In fact, Wall Street's bonus pool last year would have been large enough to hike hourly pay to $15 for all of the nation's 2.6 million fast food workers, the Institute for Policy Studies estimates. The $25 billion pot also could have been deployed to lift hourly wages to $15 for the 1.6 million home care aides in America, or all 2.6 million restaurant servers and bartenders.The U.S. economy would probably benefit from higher pay for hourly workers than for Wall Street executives, according to the institute. That's because low- and middle-income workers typically spend most of their earnings. Household purchases account for nearly 70 percent of the economy, Commerce Department data show.""The Wall Street bonus season may coincide with an uptick in luxury goods sales, but a minimum wage hike would give America’s economy a much greater boost,"" the institute said in its report.Over the last few years, companies including Walmart, McDonald’s and Aetna have increased pay for their low-wage workers."

He slid all the way down to the final pick of the 2011 draft before the Sacramento Kings finally nabbed him with the 60th pick.Despite earning NBA All-Rookie second-team honors, the Kings shipped him to Phoenix in a sign-and-trade with the Suns. After playing well, Thomas earned a four-year contract, leading him to think he was the Suns' point guard of the future. However, at the trade deadline, Phoenix sent him to Boston in a last-minute deal that left him stunned.And yet, Thomas has found a home with the resurgent Celtics. In this, his first full season with the team, the 27-year-old earned his first All-Star selection. Under his guidance, Boston sits at 38-26 -- good enough for the third seed in the Eastern Conference. Thomas, for his part, is averaging nearly 22 points (which is more than Carmelo Anthony, Kawhi Leonard, Dwyane Wade, John Wall, Chris Paul and Klay Thompson), to go along with 7 assists.Thomas, who recently signed on with Mountain Dew for his first marquee sponsorship, caught up with The Huffington Post to discuss his newfound NBA stardom, why he loves the big shot and his appreciation for Celtics coach Brad Stevens.You weren't 6-foot-6, you weren't a McDonald's All American.

For all the kids out there who may be undersized, what would you say is the number one thing that they should be doing?First off, just working hard. When you’re undersized, you have to outwork the competition and work 10 times harder than a normal guy. For me, I just didn’t let anybody tell me what I couldn’t do. I didn’t care what my reputation was, I just knew what I was capable of, and I always told myself that given the opportunity, I’m going to take full advantage of it, and that’s what happened. That’s how I go about my life, and that’s what I would tell the next small guy out there to do: Take full advantage of every opportunity that you get and be ready when your name’s called.When you came into the league, I’m not sure people realized how good a playmaker you were. How have those skills translated so well to the NBA?For me, it’s just getting better at decision-making. I’ve always been a scorer, I’ve always been a playmaker for the most part -- creating stuff for myself. I think that’s what I’ve gotten better at throughout the years, and I think that’s what made me more of a complete player, knowing that it’s not always about me scoring but it’s about getting the team the best shot possible, whether that’s me coming down every time and shooting and scoring, or getting somebody else the ball. I think I’ve just become a more complete player when it comes to that aspect of the game.The pick-and-roll is crucial for any point guard at this level, and it is something you have significantly improved on during your five years in the league. What has been the key?It’s just something I’ve kind of always been good at, and then being a student of the game and watching film, how certain teams are playing me off the pick-and-roll, and just being able to make decisions and be aggressive. I think that comes with me being a real student of the game and watching a lot of film.What kind of effect did your coach at the University of Washington, Lorenzo Romar, have on you outside of basketball?Growing up, becoming a man. Going from a boy to a man -- taking care of my responsibilities, whether that's schoolwork or working out in the gym, things like that. Being in the weight room on time. He’s a man of his word, and he’s not just a good coach, but he's better person. He’s definitely like a father figure, and everybody who has been through his program would say the same thing.Is there something in particular that your current coach, Brad Stevens, asked you to do from last season to this season that helped you that much more?Be as confident as I can be, go out there and make plays. And that’s what he asked of me from day one after I got traded.With you shouldering so much of the scoring load and becoming such an explosive offensive weapon, have you noticed a difference in terms of how teams are guarding you this year?Teams are really trying to focus in and stop me, and I know great players need to have counters for everything that teams are doing. And I think that’s when my teammates come into play, and that opens it up a lot more for me late in games. You have developed a reputation as a big shot maker. Is there something that happens for you in that clutch moment?Just confidence. I think that comes from being in the gym every morning, late nights, working on my craft and knowing that if I’m anywhere on the floor, then I can knock the shot down. I think the biggest thing is just taking the shot no matter if you miss or make it.In other words, you’ve taken that shot so many times before, that when you’re in the game you feel comfortable?Yeah, 9 times out of 10, I'ma get a shot that I want, so it’s going to be a shot that I’ve worked on. It’s not gonna be something new that I try at the end of a game. I think that’s when a lot people mess up at the end of games, because they do a lot of things they haven’t done before.When you evaluate your team, it seems like everyone has a lot of fun playing together, but what else can we attribute to the Celtics' success?The biggest thing is this team plays for each other and not just with each other, and we play as hard as possible. I think that’s the difference between us and the other teams. We play our heart out each and every game.You don’t see that every game in the NBA because of how long and grueling the regular season becomes.Exactly. I think that’s the difference between our team and everybody else.

He slid all the way down to the final pick of the 2011 draft before the Sacramento Kings finally nabbed him with the 60th pick.Despite earning NBA All-Rookie second-team honors, the Kings shipped him to Phoenix in a sign-and-trade with the Suns. After playing well, Thomas earned a four-year contract, leading him to think he was the Suns' point guard of the future. However, at the trade deadline, Phoenix sent him to Boston in a last-minute deal that left him stunned.And yet, Thomas has found a home with the resurgent Celtics. In this, his first full season with the team, the 27-year-old earned his first All-Star selection. Under his guidance, Boston sits at 38-26 -- good enough for the third seed in the Eastern Conference. Thomas, for his part, is averaging nearly 22 points (which is more than Carmelo Anthony, Kawhi Leonard, Dwyane Wade, John Wall, Chris Paul and Klay Thompson), to go along with 7 assists.Thomas, who recently signed on with Mountain Dew for his first marquee sponsorship, caught up with The Huffington Post to discuss his newfound NBA stardom, why he loves the big shot and his appreciation for Celtics coach Brad Stevens.You weren't 6-foot-6, you weren't a McDonald's All American.

22,POLITICS,What Happened When 2 Black Reporters Attended The Biggest Conservative Conference In The U.S.,Julia Craven and Tyler Tynes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-reporters-cpac_us_56dd6ecae4b0000de4050f42,"A lot of staring, for one thing.",2016-03-08,"Huffington Post reporters Tyler Tynes and Julia Craven are aware that ""Howard"" is different from ""Harvard.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56dda4a61e0000950070f613.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. -- Huffington Post reporter Tyler Tynes was sitting in a corner of the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center transcribing audio when a man walked up to him. The man -- tall, middle-aged and white -- asked Tynes if he'd been the person asking questions at a just-completed panel on how the Republican Party could capture the minority vote.It was Thursday, March 3, the second day of the 2016 Conservative Political Action Conference, and Tynes was nonplussed. Yes, he said as dozens of people walked by him and the man, that was me.The lanky man pressed Tynes on his line of questioning, which he said had left him and others in the room puzzled. Tynes had asked the panel members whether the GOP understood that when Republican candidates make racist remarks, it tends to be off-putting for voters of color. (No Republican candidate has gotten more than 40 percent of the black vote in a presidential election since 1936.)The man told Tynes that he didn't understand how anything this year's GOP candidates have said could be offensive to “the blacks.” Tynes asked the man if he knew anything about Donald Trump. The man responded vaguely that Trump was ""an asshole,"" but insisted there was no way a candidate like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) could be conveying similar messages -- though he added that neither Trump nor Cruz has actually said anything racist. The second time the man said ""the blacks,"" Tynes noted that the term isn't really in fashion anymore. The man then accused Tynes of having “an agenda.""Before we arrived at CPAC, we didn’t have much of an idea of what we were getting into. Within a few minutes, however, we realized we'd stepped into one of those environments. You learn to recognize them pretty quickly -- they're the places where whiteness is the default way of thinking and being. It's not that people of color are met with open hostility if they show up at places like these (at least most of the time). But it always becomes clear, in a million little ways, that we're an afterthought, an Other. In places like these, if someone gets up and makes a speech about ""people,"" they don't always mean ""people."" A lot of the time, they just mean ""white people.""Most of CPAC's 2,600-plus attendees this year were white, and during the two days we were there, we saw maybe 30 black people. At times, it seemed as though people thought we were protesters instead of reporters.During our interactions with attendees, two assumptions kept coming up: that we were writers for HuffPost’s Black Voices team -- who are all great! -- or that we wouldn’t report any story fairly. When we clarified that we are politics reporters, the bemused looks we got seemed to say: Only culture writers write about race. What does race have to do with political coverage? When we said we were with The Huffington Post, that seemed to clear things up for people.Some folks, like the man who spoke to Tynes, took offense at our questions. Some people either didn't understand what we were asking or pretended not to. Michael Nabjer, a Trump supporter from South Texas, seemed confused as to why anyone would think the real estate mogul might be racist. When we suggested some reasons, his answer was a non sequitur.""I don’t think he’s racist,"" Nabjer, who was decked out in ""Make America Great Again"" gear, told HuffPost. ""How did the man become a billionaire if he would treat people disrespectfully?"" He then ended the interview.Some people stared openly at our clothes and our kinky hair. A group of college students laughed at the Howard University hoodie one of us wore. ""That's not Harvard,"" one kid said. (It's not. It's a historically black university in Washington, D.C. Thurgood Marshall went to law school there.) Another student looked one of us up and down and said, ""What is she wearing?"" (Answer: She was wearing a black sweater, black tights and black boots. She looked nice.)We also saw a man in a bright red polo shirt wearing a gold pin that read ""Goldwater for President"" -- a reference to former Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), who died in 1998. Goldwater voted against the Civil Rights Act and was endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan during his 1964 presidential bid.But if many CPAC attendees seemed dismissive of the thoughts, feelings and concerns of black people, they were only following the example of many speakers. During a panel on criminal justice reform, we sat and watched conservatives of all races argue that mass incarceration was not a human rights catastrophe, but rather a sign of how America's war on crime has been a success. And it all came back to ""culture"" -- with the implication that if black people are locked up or dying in poverty or being killed by police at higher rates than white people, maybe it's kind of, you know, their own fault.“Ballooning prison population, that’s a culture issue,"" said Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke during the criminal justice panel. ""It is a behavior issue.""Clarke offered up a tale of a single mom living in the “ghetto,” arguing that mass incarceration, which destroys families and communities of color, was doing a good thing by keeping drug dealers off her block and away from her son.“If you’re a struggling mom living in a slum or ghetto... and you’re doing everything that you can to keep your kid away from that dope dealer who’s standing out there every day and who is an influence -- do you know that to get that guy off the street, for as long is allowed by law, is a big deal to her?"" he said. ""She doesn’t care about statistics.""At one point during CPAC, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was met with raucous applause for dismissing racism within the Republican Party by shouting “all lives matter” and “blue lives matter” -- two phrases that have become stock responses for people who'd prefer not to have a conversation about whether black lives matter.Meanwhile, an NRA ad playing at the conference featured an older black woman talking about the ""gangbangers and drug dealers"" who roam through her ""government high-rise,"" and explaining that she needs a gun to protect herself. In just 60 seconds, the ad managed to hit on tropes of Scary Young Urban Black People while also using a black woman to advance the interests of the NRA, whose board members are mostly white men.We should point out that coded racial language and exploitation of the black experience didn't dominate the conference. Most people in attendance were quite nice and didn't appear to make assumptions about us because of our race, and most of the panels and speakers discussed conservative topics without the uncomfortable racial tinge. We encountered many friendly faces and had polite, pleasant conversations with people of all races, religions and backgrounds.We would love to report on the event again. It was, for better and for worse, a chance to watch democracy in action. A breathtaking energy pulsed through the room. We just wish that all of the people there were like the majority of the people there. And we hope the majority can help the rest get there."

Photographer Katrina Ohstrom documented Philadelphia's school nurse problem in a 2014 photo series (see at end of story).,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56df36d31e0000950070f7f1.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Seven-year-old Sebastian Gerena died in May 2014 of rare congenital heart disease. When he collapsed at his Philadelphia elementary school, there was no school nurse on duty. Eight months earlier in the city, 12-year-old Laporshia Massey died after suffering an asthma attack. When she complained about having breathing problems at her elementary school, once again there was no medical professional available. In Philadelphia public school district's cash-strapped buildings, school nurses aren't a guarantee. As of October 2015, three of the district's schools didn't have any school nurses, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Another sixteen schools only had nurses on certain days of the week or at certain times. A bill introduced in late February by Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) seeks to fill some of these health care holes. If passed, the NURSE Act would allow schools and state agencies to apply for federal grant funds that would cover 75 percent of the cost of hiring a full-time school nurse. The grants would target under-resourced and low-income schools. In the two Philadelphia cases, it is unclear whether a school nurse could have prevented the students' untimely deaths -- a wrongful death lawsuit for Laporshia brought against the city of Philadelphia was dismissed last year. But it's easy to believe that it may have helped.""During times of tragedy, our community should not have to question whether an extra staff member or program would have made a difference,"" Philadelphia Public School superintendent William Hite said after Gerena's death. Tester introduced the bill ""because kids who are sick don’t perform well in school,"" he said. He says that schools now have less access to nurses than they did in previous eras amid budgetary constraints.""It's gone the same way as the arts and physical education and all those kinds of things,"" Tester said. ""I believe in reading, writing and arithmetic with the rest of them but when things get cut these are the kinds of things that go.""Sue Buswell, the Montana director of the National Association of School Nurses, says there has been an increase in students who are diagnosed with chronic health conditions like type 1 Diabetes, as well as students suffering from mental health issues. ""School nurses may be the only source of accessible health care for many of these children who are unable to see providers because they have no insurance or because of social determinants of health that prevent them from getting to health care and health care providers,"" said said. ""A lot of those social determinants include things like poverty, hunger, homelessness, lack of transportation and language barriers.""In Montana, Buswell notes, 26 percent of students don't have school nurses in their district. A 2007 analysis from the National Association of School Nurses found that only 45 percent of public schools have a full-time, registered nurse. ""School nurses provide accessibility for all students to be able to be in the classroom, which is really the bottom line: getting kids in school and keeping them in school,"" Buswell said. ""Schools with school nurses have lower drop-out rates, higher graduation rates, opportunities for parents to be at work and not have to come home to take care of their kids."""
25,BLACK VOICES,No Federal Charges For NYPD Cop Who Shot And Killed Ramarley Graham,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nypd-cop-ramarley-graham_us_56df1d52e4b0000de40641a0,"Federal prosecutors said they lacked proof the officer ""willfully"" deprived the 18-year-old of his civil rights.",2016-03-08,"Frank Graham, the father of slain teen Ramarley Graham, at a march in New York against the city's stop-and-frisk policy in 2012.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_103_214_3749_2593%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Federal prosecutors won't bring civil rights charges against the NYPD police officer who shot and killed Ramarley Graham, an 18-year-old who was gunned down in his own home in 2012.Citing the difficulty of proving intent under federal civil rights law, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement Tuesday that ""there is insufficient evidence"" to prosecute Richard Haste, the NYPD officer who fired the single round that killed Graham.""The investigation revealed no evidence to refute Officer Haste's claim that he shot Mr. Graham in response to his mistaken belief that Mr. Graham was reaching for a gun,"" read Bharara's statement.Believing Graham possessed a firearm, Haste and other NYPD officers followed him to his his family's apartment in the Bronx, where they barged into the unit with his grandmother and 6-year-old brother present. Haste followed Graham into a bathroom, where he shot him dead after he thought the teen was making a move for his waistband. No gun was found on Graham or in the apartment.With the announcement, the federal probe into Graham's death is officially closed. According to the statement, Bharara met with Graham's family to tell them about his office's decision not to prosecute and to offer his condolences. February marked the four-year anniversary of Graham's death, and his family had hoped that the federal investigation would shed light on the many unanswered questions in the case.Constance Malcolm, Graham's mother, called Tuesday's news ""another slap in the face,"" according to The New York Post.""This is sending the wrong message. In your own home, you're not even safe anymore,"" she told a gathering of reporters outside Bharara's office.A Bronx grand jury had voted to indict Haste in 2012, but a judge later threw it out on a procedural error. A second grand jury failed to indict Haste a year later. Because New York law guards grand jury secrecy, it is unknown what the prosecution did or didn't present to grand jurors. Federal prosecutors took up the case after these failed attempts at indicting the officer.Last year, the city settled a federal lawsuit brought by the family for $3.9 million.The NYPD, for its part, had said that the department would not release the findings of its own internal affairs investigation of Haste's role in the killing until after the conclusion of the federal probe. But when asked about it, NYPD Lieutenant John Grimpel demurred.""Now that the federal investigation into the Ramarley Graham case has concluded, the NYPD's internal disciplinary process will move forward,"" he told The Huffington Post in an email.Graham's case was an early catalyst for what would later become the Black Lives Matter movement -- police reform and accountability demonstrations that reached a fever pitch following the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City.Neither of the officers involved in those deaths faced criminal repercussions, and on the whole prosecutions of officers who kill civilians remain rare. Perhaps as a result of increased public scrutiny around police brutality, 2015 saw a slight uptick in officers getting charged. In February, a New York jury broke with convention when it returned a guilty verdict for manslaughter and official misconduct for Peter Liang. The officer was accused in the killing of Akai Gurley, a black man shot dead in a Brooklyn public housing stairwell in 2014.On the three-year anniversary of Graham's death, Malcolm told HuffPost she already sensed she might not ever get justice for her son.""Three years later and we still don't have any answers,"" she said. ""And we might not ever have any answers, the way this system is working against us.""Christopher Mathias contributed reporting."

Jerry Brown's desk for his signature. Brown hasn't commented publicly about whether he'll sign the bill, but NBC analyst Larry Gerston said he thinks there's a very good chance that the governor will sign the legislation.""Brown is a social activist -- there’s no question about it,"" he said.Supporters say raising the smoking age will prevent people from ever picking up the habit. Ninety-five percent of smokers say they started before age 21. A new smoking age in California could have a ripple effect in other states, advocates hope. Hawaii became the first state in the country to raise the smoking age to 21 earlier this year. Yet California's status as the most populous state and its history as a force in the anti-tobacco movement could further nudge other states to introduce similar legislation.""By increasing the tobacco age to 21, the nation’s largest state will provide a powerful boost for similar efforts nationwide,"" said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, in a recent statement.California has ""been a movement leader"" in the anti-tobacco crusade, the American Lung Association's director of national policy, Thomas Carr, told The Huffington Post. ""It was one of the first states to do a lot of the things that we’re now seeing many states take on.""It was the first state to establish a tobacco prevention program in 1989 and the first to ban smoking in restaurants and bars in 1998, Carr said. In 1990, San Luis Obispo, California, became the first city in the nation to ban indoor smoking at all public places.Today, more than 4,510 municipalities across the U.S. have enacted laws that restrict smoking, the American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation reports. ""I think [California's bill] could definitely cause some states to take a look at the issue,"" Carr continued, suggesting that Massachusetts and New York are likely candidates since their biggest cities have raised the smoking age to 21 in recent years. But when it comes to using higher taxes as a way to crack down on tobacco companies, California might not be the leader anti-smoking activists need.""That’s what hurts tobacco, not the age limits; it’s the taxation,"" Gerston added, pointing to California's relatively low tobacco tax rate. According to data released by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in January, New York has the highest cigarette tax rate in the country, while California comes in a distant 35th. This piece has been updated to reflect that the bill passed the state Senate. "

Chris Christie’s endorsement of business magnate and established racist Donald Trump has infuriated his allies in the state’s GOP, emboldened his opposition and sent the state’s political class into a free-for-all.Christie’s enemies in the state told The Huffington Post they weren’t surprised by the endorsement, because the Republican governor is prone to making decisions that don't benefit his constituents. Christie's allies within the higher ranks of the state Assembly and Senate said they understood why Christie would think endorsing Trump was a good idea, but they worry that Christie is already more interested in his next job than he is in governing the Garden State.Trump and Christie have known each other for 14 years, brought together by Trump’s older sister, a federal judge in Philadelphia. Christie met Trump in New York City at Trump Tower, where the business mogul ordered meals for the future governor. Trump sat front row in 2010 at Christie’s inaugural Mass. Both men and their wives frequently had dinner together. Christie -- a political opportunist -- seemed to cling to his last friend in the race.Christie defended his endorsement of Trump in a lengthy press conference in Trenton, New Jersey, last Thursday. He said Trump is the best person remaining to keep former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from winning the White House and dispelled some of the frenzy surrounding his backing of the billionaire.“This is part of the hysteria of the people who oppose my Trump endorsement. They want to read anything into it that can be negative,” Christie told reporters. ""So no, I wasn't being held hostage,"" he added. ""No, I wasn't sitting up there thinking, 'Oh, my God, what have I done?'"" Yet, just weeks after backing Trump, Christie's endorsement appears to be hurting his already dismal popularity ratings. A new poll conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University shows that only 27 percent of registered New Jersey voters approve of Christie’s job performance -- a 6-point dip in approval from voters polled before the endorsement.Krista Jenkins, a professor of political science and director of FDU’s PublicMind, which conducted the poll, said that Christie’s return to the state -- after being away for 72 percent of 2015 -- was an opportunity to re-establish goodwill with voters; the Trump endorsement immediately derailed that.“Joining forces with Donald Trump was hardly a vehicle for getting voters to reconsider their sour mood toward the Governor,” Jenkins said in a statement.Prominent Republicans in the state have also denounced Christie, saying they’d rather vote for Clinton than vote for Christie's pick, Trump. Recently, six newspapers in the state called on Christie to step down from the governorship, citing as reasons his arrogance, the time he's spent away from the state running for president and his support of Trump.None of the New Jersey legislators who spoke to HuffPost supported Trump’s outlandish, xenophobic rhetoric about getting Mexico to build a wall, or deporting nearly 11 million people, or banning Muslims from entering the United States. And many of them questioned how craven it seems that Christie would turn his back on so many of his prior beliefs. “It’s very difficult for me to believe that Christie believes in anything,"" state Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat, told HuffPost. ""When as U.S. attorney after 9/11, you visited mosques to make people feel comfortable, and now you join a campaign that says no Muslims should be allowed in our country?” Jon Bramnick, the leader of the state's Republican Assembly and a potential 2017 gubernatorial candidate, also repudiated Trump's plan to deport undocumented immigrants. ""It’s wrong. In my judgment, I wouldn’t support that. I don’t think Christie supports all of Donald Trump’s policy,” he said. “I don’t know anyone in New Jersey who wants to throw 11 million people out of the country. In politics, man, you don’t agree with your candidates on every issue. That’s an issue he cannot do and will not do. You cannot get it done. It’s impossible to do it.”Other members of the state legislature were shocked at Trump and Christie being linked together in the recent endorsement.“For six months this country has been mired in evading a fantasy about a wall and a 5 million-person roundup,"" state Assembly Judiciary Chair John McKeon (D) told HuffPost.""Gov. Christie is ... a smart man, he knows that can never happen. With someone [like Trump] whose primary tenet is those two issues, I’m astonished.” McKeon also doubts that members of the state GOP will follow their governor's lead. ""I’ll be flabbergasted if a good number of his colleagues on the legislature for the Republican side follow suit,"" he said. ""I know a lot of them personally, a lot better than the governor and for a lot longer, and I know they can’t be in sync with Donald Trump’s ideology.”Some of Christie's colleagues believe that Trump's most openly racist proposals are just gimmicks designed to win over conservative Republican primary voters.""If and when Trump wins the nomination, and I believe he will, he will become more moderate,” said state Sen. Jeff Van Drew, who calls himself the most conservative Democrat in the caucus. Trump ""essentially is a Northeasterner. He’s a New Yorker. Policy-wise [Christie and Trump] will parallel a little bit more, and Trump will come to the middle."" Christie's supporters point to his decision to join the Trump train as evidence of Christie's ability to pick a winner. Christie “jumped on board ahead of time, that’s his style,"" said Ed Kline, a former Republican state assemblyman and mayor, plus one of Christie’s close friends. ""In New Jersey, a lot of people will get behind our governor. Some won’t. But, a lot will.”Legislators on both sides of the aisle pointed to the Trump endorsement as an example of Christie trying to place himself in the running for vice president or attorney general, should Trump win the White House. Some even said Christie could be taking advantage of the chaotic state of the Republican Party as it nears a possible brokered convention in July.Whatever Christie's motives, the most consistent opinion among state politicians of both parties is that Christie needs to attend to the needs of the state more than he's doing right now. The individual legislative districts need their governor. “It seems that the governor left New Jersey in his rearview mirror long ago,"" McKeon said. ""Shortly after he was elected to his second term, and he’s done nothing to change my perception of that. I hope he will.”In the southern part of New Jersey, on the shores of Atlantic City, one legislator thought the governor would be back on board with fixing the state's issues. However, with Christie back out on occasional weekend events with Trump, he said he was mistaken.""We have so many problems in New Jersey that some of us were hoping the governor dropping out of the race [meant] that we’d get some serious conversations,"" said state Sen. Jim Whelan, a Democrat. ""We need to have the governor on board to move those things forward, but we aren’t going to have that."" Ultimately, New Jersey politicians are split on their presidential support, split on their views on the governor and undecided about what will amount from throwing support behind the GOP’s crazy uncle-turned-existential threat. But what they know definitely is that whatever is up Christie’s sleeve is -- purely -- about Christie. “In today’s diverse, complicated world, how can you get behind someone like this man for president of the United States?” Weinberg said. “Unless all you are thinking about is yourself.”Christina Wilkie contributed to reporting.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the Republican convention is in April.

30,IMPACT,"95% Of Domestic Workers Are Women. In California, They're Demanding Better Pay",Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/domestic-workers-overtime-law-ca_us_56ddd53fe4b0ffe6f8ea2bce,"""This is part of the entrenched undervaluing of women's work.""",2016-03-08,"Teresita Villasenor at SB 1015 campaign launch in Pomona on March 4, 2016. She is facing bill author Senator Connie Leyva, as they chant ""Si Se Puede!""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56dddda01500002a000b152b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Teresita Villasenor was working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, for 18 months straight.“I felt like I was a slave,” she told The Huffington Post regarding the job she quit in 2014. Villasenor is from the Philippines and has been working as a caregiver in the U.S. for the past five years. She is one of thousands of domestic workers in California fighting to make overtime laws for caregivers permanent in the state.“I had no days off for 18 months,” she said. “My boss took advantage of me, and I wasn’t getting enough pay. I was working like a horse, I didn’t even have time to read a book. I felt depressed, and oppressed.”The California Bill of Rights currently protects overtime pay for personal attendants, such as nannies and caregivers for seniors or the disabled. But there's a hitch: when the law was passed in 2013, it was signed as a provisional law, which means it will expire in 2017 unless a new law is passed by September. On Friday, the California Domestic Workers Coalition launched a campaign to make overtime pay for domestic workers permanent in the state. “The dignity of domestic workers isn’t a provisional right -- it is something that should be a permanent condition,” said Katie Joaquin, campaign director for the California Domestic Workers Coalition, to the Huffington Post on Friday.The campaign will mobilize domestic workers statewide on a monthly basis to engaged in press activities, rallies and other actions until Gov. Brown signs the new bill, which Senator Connie Leyva introduced last month, to make overtime protection permanent. In California, there are over 300,000 domestic workers, according to a press release from Sen. Connie Leyva. Most of these workers are immigrant women.“This is part of the entrenched undervaluing of women’s work,” said Joaquin. ""These are mothers, aunties, grandmothers, who are breadwinners for their families, and are also supporting families in the country where they come from.”Nationwide, 95 percent of domestic workers are women, according to a 2012 national study of domestic workers. 54 percent were women of color, and 46 percent were immigrants.“Working behind closed doors, beyond the reach of personnel policies, and often without employment contracts, [domestic workers] are subject to the whims of their employers,” the study said. “Some employers are terrific, generous and understanding. Others, unfortunately, are demanding, exploitative and abusive.” In California, 90 percent of domestic workers who worked overtime did not always receive overtime pay, according to a 2007 Household Worker Rights Coalition Survey.“Often there isn’t a clear outline of what work is expected, the amount of time it takes, and that they should be paid for all of it,” Joaquin said. “There’s an unstated expectation that whatever needs arise, it is the domestic worker’s responsibility. When an employer has the power to make requests at whatever time, it feels like a relationship of servitude.”Rather than giving workers a firm schedule, employers will often have an on-call arrangement, particularly for workers who live in the home, elaborated Joaquin. When work expectations are not laid out, workers are not able to live their own lives, be with their families, and do things they want to do on their own time. “We’re watching over people around the clock,” Villasenor said in regard to her previous experience caring for a person with disabilities. “The family of the patient calls to see how he is doing. They aren’t there, the doctor isn’t there, you are there. Even in your sleep, you’re required to get up anytime they need you.”“Before, I was earning 100 dollars a day,” said Villasenor of her previous job. “Now I make 200 dollars a day! I still work 12 hours a day, but I earn more, I work Monday through Thursday and I get overtime pay. I feel like a person now. I got my life back.”Even if the new overtime bill is signed into law, that’s only half the battle.“It’s not just the laws, it’s also getting them enforced,” said Joaquin. “Legislation is a vehicle, to raise consciousness, to assert what are dignified standards on the ground.”After an overtime law took effect in New York state, for instance, just 15 percent of parents surveyed actually paid their nannies overtime, according to the Nation.To enforce the law, a worker would have to bring a lawsuit against their employer or file an administrative claim with the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, according to the California Domestic Workers Coalition.An alarming 91 percent of workers who encountered problems with their working conditions did not complain, because they were afraid they would lose their job, according to the 2012 study. What’s more, 85 percent of undocumented immigrants who encountered problems did not complain because they feared their immigration status would be used against them.“At one of our coalition meetings, I asked ‘When we get a domestic bill of rights, will the abuse end?’” said Joaquin. “There was silence. It’s not like everything will all of a sudden be perfect. It’s a starting point, to create a culture shift around what the value of this work is, and what still needs to change.”California is one of only five states in the country to have passed a domestic workers bill of rights, according to Joaquin, including NY (2010), HI (2013), MA (2014) and CT (2015).

For the new show, Sikes will perform classics like ""Cabaret"" and ""Liza with a Z,"" but he will also incorporate deeper cuts from the Minnelli catalog, such as ""God Bless the Child"" and ""Shine On Harvest Moon.""Sikes, 32, has been steadily making a name for himself in Manhattan's theater circles as a celebrated interpreter of Garland's work since 2014. In fact, ""Seth Sikes Sings Judy Garland,"" which has played to sold-out crowds at Feinstein’s/54 Below, won a 2015 Broadway World New York Cabaret Award for ""Best Tribute Show.""

Like his earlier homage to Garland, however, he said he aims to steer clear of impersonating Minnelli or coming across like a parody act.""Although I am influenced by the singers that I’m paying tribute to, when it comes down to actually performing the songs, it’s my voice, my style and my own personal experiences that I will bring to them,"" he said. ""Seth Sikes Sings Liza Minnelli"" will play at Feinstein's/54 Below in New York on March 12. Check out Sikes performing ""When the Sun Comes Out"" from ""Seth Sikes Sings Judy Garland"" below."
