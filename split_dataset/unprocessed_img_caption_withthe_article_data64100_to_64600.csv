""As household gun ownership has steadily declined and the primary gun market of white males continues to age, the firearms industry has set its sights on America’s children,"" the group said in a statement. ""Much like the tobacco industry’s search for replacement smokers, the gun industry is seeking replacement shooters.""The report, called “Start Them Young,” documents exactly how the gun industry is working to appeal to kids. One company has a friendly cartoon mascot, ""Davey Crickett,” an armed insect that is used to market a beginner rifle. Consumers can also buy the ""Davey Crickett"" beanie baby, replete with fake gun. The gun industry is also marketing firearms in ""child-friendly"" colors, like pink, purple and orange, the reports states, and promotes rifles that incorporate plastic in their designs for young shooters, as they are lighter and easier to handle.""Imagine the public outcry if the alcohol or tobacco industries introduced child-friendly versions of their adult products,"" Josh Sugarmann, the study author, said in a release. ""Yet the firearms industry and gun lobby are doing all of these things and more in their aggressive efforts to market guns to children.""According to research cited in the report, more than 1,300 children under the age of 18 died from firearms in 2014.In its recommendations, the Violence Policy Center said firearms should be treated as an adult product, like tobacco and alcohol.""Just as our society does not condone the use of alcohol or tobacco by minors even with adult supervision, we should prohibit the acquisition, possession, and use of firearms by children,"" the report reads. ""An effective public education campaign should be developed and implemented to warn parents and youth about the dangers associated with the presence and use of firearms.""The organization also recommends that the Federal Trade Commission investigate whether the firearms industry is inappropriately marketing firearms to children. ______Melissa Jeltsen covers domestic violence and other issues related to women's health, safety and security.

1,POLITICS,Elijah Cummings Says Republicans Are Soft On Rick Snyder Over Flint Water Crisis,Tyler Tynes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rick-snyder-flint-cummings-emails_us_56cb3e2ee4b0ec6725e33db7,"There is a major difference between how Republicans and Democrats are treated by the House Oversight Committee, Cummings says.",2016-02-22,Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) asked the Michigan governor to release more emails pertaining to the Flint water crisis.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587412b01700008501929130.jpeg?cache=wFFP3RIlTN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee wants Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) to release more emails pertaining to the Flint water crisis.In a letter Monday, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) asked committee chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) to demand the documents from Snyder. Chaffetz has said he wouldn't request the items because Snyder could claim executive privilege over his communications.“Although I was not a part of your conversation with Governor Snyder,” Cummings wrote, “any claim of executive privilege to withhold documents from Congress would be a surprising turn of events that directly contradicts the Governor’s own promises of accountability to the people of Michigan.”Cummings' letter noted that Chaffetz sent a number of document requests to former Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber (D ) for the committee's yearlong investigation into a scandal involving the state’s health insurance exchange. Kitzhaber's office produced thousands of pages of documents and emails in response. This is Cummings' second attempt to procure emails from Snyder; Cummings and Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) previously emailed the Michigan governor on Jan. 29. Snyder ignored the original request.Cummings said that by not sending any documentation requests to Snyder's office, the committee creates a perception of a double standard by putting pressure on Democratic officials and not Republicans. “There is no legitimate basis for treating governors differently based on their political parties, and I believe the Committee should insist on the same level of compliance from the Republican Governor of Michigan that it has required of the Democratic Governor of Oregon,"" Cummings wrote.Cummings rejected the notion that Snyder's poor or selective responses to public document requests were reason enough not to send requests from the committee.Documents obtained by journalists and activists through official requests have been key to exposing the government's missteps in Flint, where residents have been unable to drink the water because of high lead levels. Michigan law exempts the governor's office from records requests, but Snyder released a batch of emails last month anyway. Cummings said that when the committee fails to send any requests, it undermines their ability to investigate. ""The Committee has never accepted this practice as an adequate standard of investigation, and we should not do so now,"" Cummings wrote. ""Governor Snyder and his staff are central figures in the decision-making process that led to the poisoning of Flint residents, and the Committee owes it to these residents to conduct a comprehensive and bipartisan investigation.”Also on HuffPost:"
2,QUEER VOICES,Picture It: A 'Golden Girls' Coloring Book Is In The Works,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/golden-girls-coloring-book_us_56cb530ae4b0ec6725e355bd,"Get ready to put your own spin on Dorothy, Blanche, Sophia and Rose.",2016-02-22,"Denison's take on 1989's ""Valentine's Day"" episode. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56cb703a1e0000220070e836.jpeg?cache=yvVND1xRKN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There have been a number of memorable ""Golden Girls"" tributes over the years, but this one really takes the (cheese)cake.Boston-based artist Mike Denison is hoping to capitalize on the adult coloring book phenomenon with a self-published edition dedicated to -- you guessed it -- the four women of ""The Golden Girls.""The 40-page, self-published book will re-create many of the classic series' most iconic scenes, including one from the ""Valentine's Day"" episode, in which Dorothy, Blanche and Rose ended up at a nudist camp. There are a few special nods for die-hard fans, too, including an appearance by Coco, a gay cook who was featured only in the show's pilot episode. Denison, who was behind the popular ""Bea-a-Day"" sketches which re-cast ""Golden Girls"" star, Bea Arthur, in hilarious, present-day scenarios, said he originally wanted to create a coffee table book of his drawings. Given the popularity of coloring books for adults, he said, it was a no-brainer to create one of his own. Clearly, ""Golden Girls"" fans are liking the idea, too, as Denison's Kickstarter campaign quickly blew past its initial goal of $1,500, which would have funded the production of 250 books. But the artist has extra special plans for additional funds raised before the campaign concludes on March 9; if he hits $5,000, for instance, he'll double the 40-page count to 80.A self-professed ""Golden Girls"" devote, Denison grew up watching the series during its original 1985-1992 run with his grandmother. ""I instantly fell in love with the comedy on the show, and I feel that some of their snarkiness has rubbed off on me,"" he told The Huffington Post in an email. As far as the show's enduring popularity, particularly among the queer community, he added, ""A lot of the themes on the show dealt with sexuality and equality, and I feel that they have helped plant the seeds in a lot of the progress we see today."" The book will ""riff on the same fabric that made the show what it was,"" he said, before adding, ""I'd just like people to have fun while de-stressing and maybe color together, share a laugh, while enjoying a nice cheesecake.""We'll finally be able to literally ""picture it, Sicily.""

Donald Trump could actually win this thing. Not just the Republican nomination -- the presidency. It would be very nice if a brand of politics built on fear, intimidation, racism and sheer meanness could not succeed in 21st-century America. Most political pundits have spent the past year wishing it to be so, refusing to contemplate the horror of a Trump presidency. And the business mogul may very well end up getting trounced in the general election if he does secure the GOP nomination. But Trump has a perfectly plausible path to the presidency as a Republican. If he makes it to the White House, he'll get there by taking the Upper Midwest back from the Democratic Party.When President Barack Obama was re-elected in 2012, he ran up the score in the Electoral College, winning 25 states, good for 332 total electoral votes. His victory was thorough. He only needed 270 electoral votes to win, and President George W. Bush had taken just 286 in his 2004 re-election. To secure the presidency, Democrats only have to win the Northeast, the West Coast, and the Upper Midwest, including Iowa. Obama did far better, carrying every swing state in the country, including Florida and Virginia in the South, and Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada in the West. But even with that massive margin, Obama could have been undone by victories for Republican rival Mitt Romney in just four states: Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Together, those four Rust Belt states account for 64 electoral votes. Even if Floridians, Iowans, Coloradans and all of the other swing states had gone to Obama, his failure to capture the Upper Midwest would have been enough to hand the White House over to Romney.Beyond demographics, Obama was able to capitalize on his rescue of the auto industry, a major issue in the 2012 race, as well as his opponent's weakness: The Bain Capital 47-percenter made the worst possible candidate for that region.Trump is no Romney. He is running an unsubtle, racist campaign that has particularly targeted Latinos. His chances of winning swing states with significant Latino populations -- Florida, Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico -- are extremely low. But he doesn't need them to win. All he has to do is carry the Rust Belt -- a region perfectly attuned to Trump's fiery denunciations of American trade policy and his angry condemnation of Washington corruption. While Romney hailed free trade, globalization and ""creative destruction,"" Trump rails against the North American Free Trade Agreement and promises to bring jobs back home.Who signed NAFTA into law? That would be former President Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton can't be held responsible for everything her husband did in office. But don't think you won't hear it on repeat this fall anyway.Hillary Clinton's inconsistency on trade has, thus far, only proven to be a liability for her among progressives. Republican leaders have broadly supported the trade policies that began under her husband -- NAFTA, the creation of the World Trade Organization and the establishment of permanent normal trade relations with China. If Trump wins the GOP nomination, he will be the first Republican in decades to challenge a Democratic candidate on trade. And he will. His constant tirades against China and Mexico will go into overdrive, and he will constantly attack Clinton's back-and-forth record. Clinton currently opposes Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact with a host of Asian nations, but she helped negotiate it when she served as secretary of state, and top corporate lobbyists doubt the strength of her opposition. Another fact to consider: The Rust Belt is disproportionately white. While there are pockets of color -- in Philadelphia, Flint, Detroit, Milwaukee -- the states are much whiter than the national average. America is 62 percent white, according to census data. Michigan, by contrast, is over 75 percent white, and Pennsylvania's population is more than 77 percent white. More than 80 percent of Ohio is white, as is over 82 percent of Wisconsin.This doesn't mean that white people in these states will all flock to Trump. Many of them are die-hard Democrats and appalled by his bigoted campaign. But it does mean there are relatively fewer people of color in the Upper Midwest who will feel personally targeted by his message of intolerance, and plenty of white people who feel personally targeted by the last 30 years of U.S. economic policy. Visit a Trump rally or check out the photos and videos of Trump gatherings, and you'll get the idea.Republicans lost Ohio in the last two elections and haven't won any of the other Upper Midwest states since the election of George H. W. Bush in 1988, and they haven't taken Wisconsin since Ronald Reagan's re-election. But in recent years, the GOP has nevertheless secured gubernatorial contests in all four states. The current governors of Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan are all Republicans, and Pennsylvania had a GOP governor until last year. It won't be easy for Trump to run that table, but it's not insane to think that he could do so. Obama won in 2012 by turning out huge numbers of people of color. For clearly different reasons, Trump's candidacy might inspire similar turnout for Democrats in 2016. Clinton maintains a tremendous lead over Democratic rival Bernie Sanders among black voters, and she has consistently carried union households -- a major constituency in the Upper Midwest. But thus far in the primary contest, Clinton and Sanders are not turning out voters to the degree that Obama did in 2008. Democratic turnout in the Nevada caucuses was down by one-third relative to 2008, and turnout numbers in Iowa dropped as well. Despite a crowded Republican field, Trump took more voters in New Hampshire than Clinton did in a two-way race. The combined Granite State turnout for Trump and fellow GOP hopefuls John Kasich, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie was bigger than the collective vote total for Clinton and Sanders. Add in supporters of Republican candidates Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson and Rand Paul, and the numbers look even better for the GOP. That wouldn't be troubling news for Democrats in a state like Alabama, where the party will never be able to pull off a victory. But at the presidential level, New Hampshire is barely considered a swing state anymore. Obama carried the state twice, and former Democratic hopeful John Kerry won it in 2004. (Had former Vice President Al Gore won the Granite State in 2000, Florida wouldn't have mattered.)A study of voters from Cleveland and Pittsburgh conducted by Working America, an offshoot of the AFL-CIO labor federation, should compound those concerns. The union group surveyed working-class households making less than $75,000 a year, 90 percent of which had voted in the 2012 election. Although 53 percent of voters in the December-to-January survey had not decided on a general election candidate, Trump was crushing the competition among those who had. Trump's 38 percent support was stronger than support for both Clinton and Sanders combined. And his backing wasn't simply from hard-line conservatives. One in four Democrats who had settled on a candidate had decided on Trump.Minds change, campaigns change, and times change. Maybe having Trump on the ticket will motivate Democrats to turn out in high numbers just to vote against him. At the moment, Clinton holds a narrow lead over Trump in head-to-head polling, and Trump's numbers may collapse amid a Democratic ad blitz. Republicans have been curiously reluctant to attack their front-runner, but Trump has also spent next to nothing attacking his competitors, relying on media attention that is unlikely to fade in a general election contest. And given Trump's ability to maintain his lead after making comments that would have sunk other candidates, it's not obvious how much attack ads will actually help. Jeb Bush's Super PAC, after all, managed to burn through over $100 million to generate … well, nothing.Seasoned Republicans have spent the past six months with their heads in the sand, hoping Trump would just go away. Democrats can't afford to make the same mistake.Editor's Note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Willenberg, the last survivor of the Nazi death camp, died on Friday at the age of 93.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Samuel Willenberg, the last survivor of Treblinka, the Nazi death camp where 875,000 people were murdered during World War II, has died in Israel. Cause of death was not released. He was 93.Willenberg was one of only 67 people known to have survived Treblinka, a camp designed with the sole intention of killing Jews.In August 1943, Willenberg and about 300 other prisoners escaped the extermination camp in a bold revolt. More than 200 of the fleeing prisoners were later killed by Nazi troops in the ensuing manhunt.In a 2010 interview with The Associated Press, Willenberg recalled the horror of his escape.Shot in the leg, he had to climb “over bodies piled at the barbed wire fence” before catapulting himself over it. “He kept running,” AP reported, “ignoring dead friends in his path.”Willenberg said his survival at Treblinka was “chance, sheer chance.”Born in Częstochowa, Poland, Willenberg was 19 when he first arrived at Treblinka in October 1942. On the advice of an acquaintance, he told Nazi guards that he was a bricklayer. It was a fib that ultimately saved his life. Willenberg, the son of a painter, was the only person who was spared the gas chambers that day.While he was sent to the prisoners’ barracks to do manual labor, “a whole town, three transports of 20 wagons, went to the gas,” Willenberg told the BBC in 2013. The transports had been told that they were at a transit camp, and had to undress and shower before moving onward. The “shower rooms” were gas chambers. At Treblinka, Willenberg’s job was to sort through the belongings of the people who were slain in the gas chambers. One day, he recognized a garment among the possessions: his sister’s coat.“My little sister had a coat she grew out of. My mother had extended the sleeves with green velvet. This is how I recognized it. I can still see it today,” he told the BBC. “It was then I knew my [two] sisters had come to Treblinka. I understood that I no longer had sisters. I looked, but I didn't cry. I had no tears left, just hatred.”Till the end of his life, Willenberg urged the world to never forget Treblinka.“It never leaves me. It stays in my head.

Cause of death was not released. He was 93.Willenberg was one of only 67 people known to have survived Treblinka, a camp designed with the sole intention of killing Jews.In August 1943, Willenberg and about 300 other prisoners escaped the extermination camp in a bold revolt. More than 200 of the fleeing prisoners were later killed by Nazi troops in the ensuing manhunt.In a 2010 interview with The Associated Press, Willenberg recalled the horror of his escape.Shot in the leg, he had to climb “over bodies piled at the barbed wire fence” before catapulting himself over it. “He kept running,” AP reported, “ignoring dead friends in his path.”Willenberg said his survival at Treblinka was “chance, sheer chance.”Born in Częstochowa, Poland, Willenberg was 19 when he first arrived at Treblinka in October 1942. On the advice of an acquaintance, he told Nazi guards that he was a bricklayer. It was a fib that ultimately saved his life. Willenberg, the son of a painter, was the only person who was spared the gas chambers that day.While he was sent to the prisoners’ barracks to do manual labor, “a whole town, three transports of 20 wagons, went to the gas,” Willenberg told the BBC in 2013. The transports had been told that they were at a transit camp, and had to undress and shower before moving onward. The “shower rooms” were gas chambers. At Treblinka, Willenberg’s job was to sort through the belongings of the people who were slain in the gas chambers. One day, he recognized a garment among the possessions: his sister’s coat.“My little sister had a coat she grew out of. My mother had extended the sleeves with green velvet. This is how I recognized it. I can still see it today,” he told the BBC. “It was then I knew my [two] sisters had come to Treblinka. I understood that I no longer had sisters. I looked, but I didn't cry. I had no tears left, just hatred.”Till the end of his life, Willenberg urged the world to never forget Treblinka.“It never leaves me. It stays in my head. It goes with me always,” he told AP.Willenberg lived in Tel Aviv with his late wife, Ada, a Holocaust survivor from Warsaw. He is survived by his daughter, Orit Willenberg-Giladi, an Israeli architect, Haaretz reported."

""I assure you it is only a matter of time before we arrest those who stole the radioactive device.""The material, which uses gamma rays to test flaws in materials used for oil and gas pipelines in a process called industrial gamma radiography, is owned by Istanbul-based SGS Turkey, according to the document and officials.The material is classed as a Category 2 radioactive source by the IAEA, meaning that if not managed properly it could cause permanent injury to a person in close proximity to it for minutes or hours, and could be fatal to someone exposed for a period of hours to days.SGS and Weatherford have both denied responsibility for the disappearance of the material last year.Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was unbowed Saturday after his loss in the Nevada caucuses, saying his campaign still had the momentum and was defying expectations against Hillary Clinton. ""When we began in Iowa, we were 50 points behind. When we began in New Hampshire, we were 30 points behind. And we were way behind here in Nevada. ... We have come a very long way in nine months. It is clear to me, and I think most observers, that the wind is at our backs. We have the momentum,"" Sanders told supporters. Nevada was long considered part of Clinton's firewall against Sanders, a shift from the whiter states of Iowa and New Hampshire. But in recent weeks, Sanders closed the gap there and Clinton aides began to panic. The Democratic presidential candidates face off in South Carolina Feb. 27, where the majority-black electorate leans toward Clinton. But Sanders told his supporters to keep their eye on March 1 -- Super Tuesday -- when a large number of delegates will be at play. He said he believes he has an ""excellent chance to win many of those states.""""I believe that when Democrats assemble in Philadelphia in July at that convention, we are going to see the results of one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States,"" Sanders said to loud applause.Nevada was personal for Clinton. She won there in 2008, even though many people on her campaign doubted that she could defeat Barack Obama in a state with caucuses, where she tended to be weaker. After all, she had just lost to Obama in the Iowa caucuses. The person who ran her Nevada operation was Robby Mook, who is now her campaign manager. Also on HuffPost:"

It also showed Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) with 19 percent and 17 percent support, respectively, among likely caucus-goers. The poll mirrors the current state of the race, nationally and in early primary states like South Carolina, which is transitioning into a long, drawn out race between the three candidates.But there simply hasn't been much polling of the state. One Democratic pollster pointed to problems that cropped up in Saturday's Democratic caucus as a reason why they had not polled Nevada. Add to the mix that officials there do not have a lot of experience with the caucus system -- it was first employed in 2008 -- and you have a recipe for some surprises after the votes are tallied on Tuesday.Nevada journalist Jon Ralston summed up the difficulty by tweeting a comparison of the 2012 race:Trump, however, appears confident in his lead there. The billionaire businessman has not scheduled any campaign events in Nevada this week, nor does he seem to be planning on rallying there this weekend. His only scheduled event, for now, in Nevada will take place the day of the caucuses. “Maybe I don’t even have to go there and campaign,” Trump said bluntly on Wednesday at a rally in South Carolina. He also hasn't spent much money in the state -- committing just $400,000 on TV ads ahead of Tuesday’s Republican caucuses.Rubio's early childhood in Las Vegas and his strong ties to the state's Mormon community (the senator later converted to Catholicism) may give him an advantage over Cruz, who has had more success with evangelicals. The Texas senator, meanwhile, has been making a play for the Cliven Bundy vote -- the Nevada rancher who faces charges relating to his role in a 2014 standoff with federal authorities. In an ad this week, Cruz vowed to sell off or give away all the state’s public lands -- including its national parks, forests and monuments.Cruz has also made an effort to appeal to libertarian-minded voters in Nevada. Earlier this week, he announced the support of Carl Bunce, who previously served as a senior adviser to Sen. Rand Paul's (Ky.) presidential campaign, and as former chair to Ron Paul's presidential bids in Nevada.Given Trump's large lead, however, Cruz and Rubio may be putting more of a focus on the host of primaries that will take place March 1, known as Super Tuesday. Rubio, for example, is still holding rallies in Nevada on Sunday and Monday. But he is also making stops in between in Tennessee and Arkansas.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Then it was Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Now, Donald Trump isn't sure whether Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is eligible to be president.Rubio was born in Miami to immigrant parents. He is eligible to be president.In an interview on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday morning, Trump played down the importance of his tweet -- but he left hanging in the air doubts about Rubio.""It was a retweet. ... I'm not really that familiar with Marco's circumstances,"" Trump said. ""I mean, let people make their own determination,"" he added.Host George Stephanopoulos followed up, asking whether he really wasn't sure about Rubio's eligibility.""I don't know. I really -- I've never looked at it, George. I honestly have never looked at it,"" Trump replied. ""As somebody said, he's not. And I retweeted it. I have 14 million people between Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and I retweet things and we start dialogue and it's very interesting.""But as CNN noted, Trump previously said he had no doubts about Rubio's eligibility to be president.""It's a very different thing,"" Trump said in January. ""He was born here. He was born on the land. Ted was not born on the land, and there's a very strict reading that you have to be born on the land.""Trump has aggressively gone after Cruz on this issue, claiming that because he was born in Canada, he can't be president. Cruz's mother, however, is a U.S. citizen, meaning he is also automatically granted citizenship. According to most legal scholars, he qualifies as a ""natural born citizen.""The issue, however, has continued to dog him. Trump supporters filed a lawsuit in Texas this month challenging Cruz's eligibility to be president.Rubio dismissed Trump's latest birther conspiracy Sunday in a separate interview on ""This Week.""""He says something that's edgy and outrageous and then the media flocks and covers that and then no one else can get any coverage on anything else,"" Rubio said. ""And that worked when there were 15 people running for president. It's not going to work anymore. I'm going to spend zero time on his interpretation of the Constitution with regards to eligibility.""Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c8a3d01500002a000b0696.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The strong showings by both Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) in Saturday night's South Carolina presidential primary give the Republican Party some reason for hope despite real estate mogul Donald Trump's resounding victory in the state.The contest is slowly becoming a three-person race as the campaigns turn to the Nevada caucuses and the crucial Super Tuesday states. Cruz's ""Southern strategy"" showed it had some heft in the Palmetto State -- one he'll look to expand in states across the South. And Marco Rubio proved he was closer than ever to coalescing the establishment wing of the GOP, following the stinging defeat of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.After leading polls in the state by double digits for months, Trump won with a 10-point margin. Due to the way delegates in South Carolina are allocated, Trump is set to win all of the state's delegates. What the reality TV star failed to do, however, is put the race away for good, giving Cruz and Rubio a chance to fight back in coming contests.Cruz's vaunted southern primary strategy is still looking pretty good. As he laid out last year, the Texas firebrand hopes to be the second choice for enough voters that that he can cobble together the broadest base of support at the finish line. Doing so, according to the senator's campaign, involves bringing together conservatives, evangelicals, libertarian-minded voters and the establishment wing of the party.The problem in aiming for second -- other than that strategy's insufficiency to win the nomination -- is Rubio. The Florida Republican has the backing of a large swath of the establishment, in Congress as well as the states. Most recently, he picked up the coveted endorsement of South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R), a popular voice whose nod may have helped turned the tide on Saturday.The phrase “the party decides” may truly come to define his campaign, which has seen sympathetic coverage from the media and demonstrated Rubio's seemingly impeccable ability to play the expectations game. Rubio came in third in Iowa, for example, yet still somehow managed to snatch victory out of the jaws of defeat. His surrogates in South Carolina cleverly laid the groundwork early -- proclaiming a third-place finish as “not bad” following a disastrous performance in the New Hampshire primary.The results in South Carolina are encouraging for both Cruz and Rubio, likely setting up an even uglier primary to come. And the Palmetto State, known for its history of nasty campaign tactics, didn’t disappoint. The two candidates and their campaigns ratcheted up the rhetoric over the last week, each accusing the other of “dirty tricks” in an effort to portray his rival as untrustworthy. Among those tricks were a phony Facebook page that claimed Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) had switched his support of Rubio to Cruz and a photoshopped image put forth by Cruz’s campaign of a smiling Rubio shaking hands with President Barack Obama. On Wednesday evening, South Carolina residents even received a shady Spanish language robocall that tried to make voters believe Rubio was calling Hispanics and promising amnesty. Rubio’s campaign fought back with its own automated call that slammed Cruz’s tactics as “dishonest.”Supporters at Cruz's victory party in Columbia on Saturday acknowledged a big showdown between the two senators wasn't going to help either campaign.""Unfortunately, Cruz and Rubio are splitting the vote between folks who consider themselves conservative,"" said Michael Branch, a Cruz supporter. ""Rubio or Cruz would beat Trump pretty handily but since they're splitting that vote, they're ushering Trump right into the nomination.""The race now turns to the Nevada caucuses next week -- which are notoriously difficult to poll, and where, apart from a Trump lead in some surveys, no one has a really good grasp of the race. Rubio's early childhood in Las Vegas and his strong ties to the state's Mormon community (the senator later converted to Catholicism) may give him an advantage over Cruz, who has had more success with evangelicals.

17,POLITICS,Latino Voters Delivered Some Good News For Democrats In Nevada,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/latino-vote-nevada-caucus_us_56c79a0fe4b041136f170fbc,"We might not know whether Latinos favored Clinton or Sanders, but their participation levels bode well for a Democratic nominee.",2016-02-21,Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won the Nevada Democratic caucuses on Saturday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton easily bested Bernie Sanders in the Nevada Democratic caucuses on Saturday. But whether that was thanks to Latino voters -- or in spite of them -- isn't clear. That's because of contradictory results from the event. Entrance polls found that 53 percent of Latinos were supporting Sen. Sanders (I-Vt.), compared to 45 percent supporting former Secretary of State Clinton. But Clinton won caucuses in heavily Latino areas, casting doubt on whether the polling presented an accurate picture of how Latinos voted. Regardless, the high Latino turnout in the state bodes well for a Democratic nominee come the general election.Latinos made up 19 percent of the caucus-goers, according to the polls -- an even higher proportion than during the 2008 Democratic caucuses, when they made up about 15 percent.That figure could decide the general election in November, when either Clinton or Sanders would stand to benefit from a large turnout of Latino voters, who lean largely Democratic.""Today, we've seen that the Latino vote is going to come out and it's going to come out in great numbers,"" said Jocelyn Sida, Nevada state director for Mi Familia Vota, a nonprofit that encourages civic participation. ""The candidates on both sides of the aisle are going to have to start approaching, even more so, the issues that are important to the Latino community,"" she said.Mi Familia Vota registered 1,000 voters over the course of a month and held mock caucuses for both parties. The group, and a number of other Latino-focused groups, are urging permanent residents who are eligible for citizenship to apply for it so they can vote in November. Latinos make up 28 percent of Nevada's population and 17 percent of its eligible voters, according to Pew Hispanic Center. In the 2012 presidential election, Obama won 70 percent of the Latino vote in Nevada to GOP candidate Mitt Romney's 25 percent. In the upcoming presidential election, Democrats' ability to hold onto that level of Latino support will be pivotal. Republicans will hold their caucuses in Nevada on Tuesday, but are likely to struggle with Latino voters, many of whom view front-runner Donald Trump, who won the South Carolina primary on Saturday, unfavorably.Latinos at the Democratic caucuses seemed to be ""paying attention to the negativity"" of candidates like Trump, said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus' BOLD PAC and was in Las Vegas for the caucuses.Cárdenas endorsed Clinton, but the PAC has not yet made an endorsement. He said many Latino caucus-goers brought up how Republicans ""are bashing on"" Latinos. ""I was saying, absolutely, and thank you for being here because the louder your voice, i.e. the more of us Latinos come out and vote, the less they're going to be attacking us,"" Cárdenas said. ""Because they're going to see that we're making a difference when these people want to run for office.""The Clinton and Sanders campaigns clearly already saw the need to win over Latino voters, a fight that in the final days played out most clearly over the candidates' immigration stance.Nationwide polling has consistently shown that jobs and the economy, education and health care tend to rank higher than immigration when Latino voters are asked about their top issues. Still, immigration is considered important by many Latino voters, and both Sanders and Clinton emphasized their stances on the issue in Nevada.The state has a large undocumented population: about 210,000 people, according to Pew Research Center. Nearly 18 percent of students there had undocumented parents, the largest share of any state, according to the same report.Clinton held her first major event on immigration in May in Las Vegas, where she met with undocumented young people and children of immigrants. At that event, she promised to go beyond President Barack Obama on deportation relief for undocumented immigrants. Sanders has done the same.Clinton made another big promise on immigration in Nevada on Thursday, vowing to begin her push for reform within the first 100 days of her presidency, something Sanders already had said he would do.The debate over immigration has largely been over who can be trusted most, given that both Democrats largely agree on the major aspects of the issue. Clinton backers argue that she has a better record and tout her vote for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007, which Sanders opposed.""I like Bernie. He’s a nice guy. I have no doubt he means well,"" civil rights leader Dolores Huerta, who endorsed Clinton, wrote in a post for Medium Friday. ""Latinos matter in this election, and he knows it. But my question for Bernie is, where the heck was he for the last 25 years?""Huerta said Saturday that she tried to translate for Spanish speakers at a Las Vegas caucus site but was stopped by Sanders supporters, who shouted ""English only.""The Sanders campaign has countered that Clinton is less consistent than she claims and that he has a more complete and detailed platform on immigration. The campaign held a call with reporters on Saturday to push back on the critiques, featuring some of his own high-profile Latino supporters. Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said the Clinton campaign had been working in ""a comfort zone"" by assuming Latinos would not support Sanders. ""Well, the opposite is true,"" he said, according to Politico. He referenced the narrow gap between the candidates in Nevada, adding, ""Latino voters were thinking for themselves and not being herded into any particular direction ... And so now the attacks begin.""In a statement after the caucus, Sanders also highlighted the relatively close race and the entrance poll figures, which were not reflected in the final outcome:After trailing by as many as 50 points in Nevada, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders pulled within 4 points of former Secretary Hillary Clinton in the Nevada caucuses.Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon disputed the idea the Sanders campaign won among Latinos, tweeting that entrance polls must have been wrong given the caucus results.  UPDATE: Feb. 22 -- Clinton's staff has circulated a memo from Latino Decisions, a polling firm that does work for the campaign, questioning the results of the entrance polls on Latino voters.Matt Barreto and Gary Segura of Latino Decisions wrote that entrance and exit polls ""have historically done a very poor job at capturing a representative sample of Latinos, and especially in Nevada,"" and asserted that ""the entrance poll numbers do not mathematically add up."" They added that there wasn't enough information available to vet the methodology of the polls:Often times entrance polls tend to oversample suburban “bellwether” precincts as they improve the reliability of the statewide sample -- however this sampling will badly skew underlying subgroup populations. How many caucus sites were selected that were majority-Latino? How many of the Latino entrance poll questionnaires were completed in Spanish? The Latino electorate in Nevada is 35% foreign born. The entrance poll is reporting that 40% of non-White caucus participants had a college degree. This is off by nearly double (i.e. the actual number should be closer to 20%) What is the geographic distribution of the Latino sample? That is, which caucus sites were Latinos selected from? Were they representative of the actual population of Latino caucus-goers?This article has been updated with the tweet from Fallon and information about the Latino Decisions memo.Also on HuffPost:"

Naturally, the duo sounded great together. Following the performance, the ""Can't Feel My Face"" singer sent a tweet expressing his gratitude toward Hill. He called the performance, the ""most important experience of my life."" Of course, the duet comes just after the two were reportedly set to perform together at the Grammys on Feb. 15. However, Hill pulled out of the performance last minute, with her rep claiming, ""The Grammys announced a performance by Ms. Lauryn Hill prematurely and without approval."" Hill's rep also added: ""Any performance that could have happened was never confirmed, and should not have been advertised as such."" Recording Academy president Neil Portnow refuted those claims, saying Hill was at rehearsals before the show, but ""did not get back in time to make the show.""""I’m sorry, that’s the bottom line,"" he said. ""That’s the truth. That’s unfortunate. I guess those things happen.""What actually happened on Grammys night, we may never know. But at least we've got their great ""Tonight Show"" performance.

But Carson offered some interesting spin to explain the result:Carson's likely right. Republican primary voters don't elect the GOP presidential nominee directly. Instead, they elect delegates, who choose the nominee at the party's July convention. The results aren't final, but Trump is likely to win all 50 of South Carolina's delegates. That means that despite their different vote totals, Rubio, Cruz, Kasich, Bush and Carson will probably all receive the same number of delegates from South Carolina: zero. "

Akins, having heard about an upcoming visit to an American government class by state Sen. David Burke, allegedly contacted the class teacher to offer his services. Akins said that Burke had resigned over an illness and that he was selected as his replacement, making him the youngest state senator ever, authorities said.When the teacher, Henry Stobbs, asked why he hadn’t heard about Akins’ appointment, the teen replied that he was the second choice and that the first choice had declined the offer. He also said that Burke had yet to publicly announce his resignation but would do so in the coming weeks.""Through that conversation, Mr. Stobbs was convinced this was legitimate,” Mohawk Schools Superintendent Ken Ratliff told The Courier.Akins' request to move his visit from January to December was approved and the teen and people posing as his aides secured a car and driver from a local car dealership, according to reports. When he arrived at the school for his visit, he used his own ID card to sign in. He received a tour and went on to give a lecture to the students, authorities said.""The presentation was about being active in politics, political processes,"" Ratliff told the Blade. ""Everyone thought it was legit; bought into it, including the teacher.""It was not until several weeks later -- when Burke showed up on Jan. 14 to give his scheduled class lecture -- that school officials caught on.“This is an extremely elaborate scheme and not as simple as walking through the door,” Burke said in a statement released to the Courier Friday. “When I heard about this, the school and I immediately began working with law enforcement.”Akins said the stunt was part of his research for a paper he was writing on school security in rural communities.“I was duping to prove a point, that these kinds of things can happen. They could easily have Googled me and they didn’t,” he told the Toledo Blade.He was arrested Feb. 10 and faces one count each of impersonating a peace officer and telecommunications fraud, both felonies.“At no point during this process did we feel Mr. Akins was a threat to our students,” Wyandot County Sheriff Mike Hetzel told The Courier Friday.

21,POLITICS,This Cable News Panel Just Dismissed Bernie Sanders' Wall Street Tax Plan,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-wall-street-tax-chris-matthews_us_56c8f8dde4b0ec6725e2e656,"Clinton's ""broccoli"" is apparently better for us than Sanders' ""ice cream.""",2016-02-21,Chris Matthews doesn't think highly of Sanders' proposed financial transactions tax.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c8f9bf1e0000230070e73f.jpeg?cache=FQHNf2pJCj&ops=crop_22_121_5705_2853%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A panel of reporters led by MSNBC's Chris Matthews agreed Saturday that Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan to use a tax on financial transactions to pay for tuition at public colleges is cheap, pie-in-the-sky pandering with little merit as public policy.Their analysis did not mention the credible studies that project a financial transactions tax, aimed at discouraging speculation, would be a major source of revenue for the U.S. government. Nor did they note the many countries where such a tax has already been successfully implemented.Instead, Matthews, MSNBC's Alex Seitz-Wald and Reuters' Luciana Lopez argued that Sanders' plan and its appeal to voters grow out of a kind of childish naivete that fails to acknowledge tough realities. Here is the full exchange:Chris Matthews: Seriously, seriously about this. Bernie says he's going to pay for the free tuitions at all the great state universities with something called a tax on Wall Street speculation. That sounds great. We'll screw the bad guys. To be clear, a disproportionate share of any taxes on securities trades would be paid by the super-rich. The top 0.1 percent of earners took in half of all capital gains in 2011.The panel is right to note, however, that while Sanders frames his tax plan purely as an attack on Wall Street speculators, it would fall on smaller investors as well. But in describing the plan as a short-term buzz that voters would reject if they only understood it, the journalists are missing the sound reasons people are supporting a plan like Sanders'.The Sanders campaign projects that ""imposing a tax of a fraction of a percent"" on financial transactions would raise $75 billion a year.That may actually be on the conservative side. A 2009 report by the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research found that a 0.5 percent tax on financial transactions would raise $220 billion annually. Of course, part of the purpose of the tax would be to discourage speculation such as that practiced by Wall Street banks using computers capable of making high-frequency trades. But even if the tax reduced the volume of trades by half, it would still raise $110 billion a year, according to the 2009 paper.The United Kingdom's 0.5 percent tax on financial transactions has generated a more modest $4 billion a year, but it excludes the large number of derivatives traded in that country. At the same time, the tax has apparently not made the U.K. less attractive to financial firms: London was the financial capital of the world in 2015, according to one global index.Then there is the small matter that Clinton herself has proposed a modest tax on high-frequency trading. It is far narrower than Sanders' proposal. In fact, it is so narrow that many liberal economists and Wall Street reform advocates believe it would be easy for Wall Street to circumvent, doing little to actually diminish high-frequency trades.That is nonetheless a far cry from Sanders serving up ""ice cream"" to Clinton's ""broccoli.""One can also debate the tradeoffs of a financial transactions tax dedicated to paying for tuition at public colleges, as Sanders proposes. But there are many reasons why middle- and low-income Americans might consider it a good deal.First, the picture that Matthews paints of a public that loves playing the stock market is likely an exaggeration.Nearly one-third of workers do not even have access to retirement plans through their jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In total, nearly half of all workers do not to participate in employer-sponsored retirement plans.Less than half of Americans own any stock at all, through a retirement plan or otherwise. And those who have a 401(k) or other kind of employer-sponsored retirement plan might not view it as such a great deal.The rise of 401(k) plans in the past three decades has not left Americans with adequate savings for retirement. The net worth of those nearing retirement -- aged 54 to 65 -- in the middle quintile of the earnings spectrum declined significantly from 1989 to 2013.Meanwhile, the increasing costs of a college education, even at the comparably cheaper state schools that Sanders would make free, have hit people's wallets hard. Some two-thirds of graduates of public colleges graduated with student debt -- $25,550 per graduate as of 2012.Also on HuffPost:"

Ted Cruz speaks with a supporter in Greenville, S.C.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Gulp.That was the collective feeling at Ted Cruz's election night headquarters here in Columbia, South Carolina, after the Texas senator's disappointing finish behind real estate mogul Donald Trump and effective tie with Florida Senator Marco Rubio. It was one thing that Cruz had underperformed relative to Rubio, but to have lost to Donald Trump -- a bombastic, ethically questionable, politically hermaphroditic New Yorker -- that, THAT was almost too much to swallow.""We cannot make sense of it,"" marveled Claude O'Donovan, an older Ted Cruz supporter. ""We all stand around and shake our heads."" ""I don't get it,"" echoed Tony Ewing.Imagine, for a moment, the quiet horror and disbelief Cruz supporters must be experiencing to have their guy lose, in the heart of Republican America, to that abortion flip-flopper, that Bush basher, that ""Two Corinthians"" guy -- that guy who hails from New York City, a Babylon of gays, atheists, multilingual schools, knishes and those promiscuous ladies from that HBO show their kids watch.""It's ignorance,"" an irate Candice Cassim seethed. ""It's the undereducation of our children!""Stupid children aside, Cruz faces a number of obstacles between now and the convention. To come out of a state so tailor-made for his politics only tied for second place does not bode well for his chances in Super Tuesday states like Georgia, Oklahoma and Alabama. This is a state, after all, where there are a bunch of things still named after Strom Thurmond.Donald Trump will almost certainly continue to dominate the news cycle, though whether it's by calling the Dalai Lama a wuss, urging America to bomb Belgium or picking a fight with Fran Drescher, it remains to be seen.And with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush suspending his campaign, stories of Bush surrogates flocking to the Rubio campaign are bound to populate the news cycle in the coming week, providing even more momentum to Marco Rubio, who beat expectations in South Carolina. So, what does Sen. Cruz need to remain viable through Super Tuesday, with a still-dominant Donald Trump and a rising Marco Rubio buoyed by orphaned Jeb Bush supporters -- to say nothing of Ben Carson, Cruz's most likely source of poached votes, vowing not to drop out? ""I honestly don't know,"" fumed Terri Sullivan, another attendee. ""I am so baffled by what South Carolina has done today and what baffles me more than anything are the people who call themselves Christians who voted for someone like Trump.""Added Michael Branch, 41: ""I think we'll know a lot on Super Tuesday."" During his election night speech, Cruz tried to paint himself as the true anti-establishment figure to take on Democrats in November. ""If you believe we need a strong contrast with the Democrats,"" Cruz said, ""then we welcome you aboard our team."" He added that voters have ""a clear defined choice: you can go with Washington dealmakers, or we can stand together with a proven consistent constitutional conservative and bring back Morning in America,"" -- a reference to the famous 1984 advertisement for Ronald Reagan's re-election. But it was clear that Cruz supporters were straining to find a coherent narrative after a disappointing outcome in South Carolina. ""Texas has more delegates than Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, combined,"" Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a Cruz surrogate, said before Cruz took the stage. ""Four years ago, Newt Gingrich won South Carolina,"" State Sen. Lee Bright bellowed to the crowd. ""How'd that turn out?""  ""Ted gets a ticket out of here, regardless,"" said former South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon, who is also a state co-chair for Cruz. ""And Senator Rubio, if he can't win here, where can he win?"" Of course, the same question could be asked of Cruz. Cruz supporters are putting a lot of weight on the candidate's ground game, which propelled him to an upset win in the Iowa caucuses. However, as the campaign shifts to a national scale -- there are 13 Republican contests on March 1 -- ground games will play an increasingly small role, dwarfed by the mass media politics Donald Trump knows so well and that Marco Rubio, with a galvanized establishment behind him, will be financially well-positioned to tackle. One thing's for sure. Cruz supporters Saturday night were angry and even a little bewildered as the prospect loomed that their candidate would be another Rick Santorum, who won the 2012 Iowa caucuses only to rake up a handful of primary victories in deep red states. ""I am extremely upset with [South Carolina] Senator Tim Scott and [Congressman] Trey Gowdy for their lies,"" said Sunny O'Donovan, referring to the two rising star lawmakers who had endorsed Marco Rubio. ""I wrote Tim Scott and said, 'I voted for you. I will not vote for you again.'"" Timothy Kain, who said he liked Cruz's ""Christian values,"" is unsure what he will do if he has to choose between Donald Trump and a Democrat. ""I'd have to hold my nose and vote for Trump,"" said Kain. ""Or maybe it'd be the first time I didn't vote.""Editor's Note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"

And Planned Parenthood says Trump, despite some of his kinder rhetoric, would still be ""a disaster for women's health and rights.""""Just like every other Republican candidate, Trump would block patients from accessing reproductive care at Planned Parenthood, ban safe, legal abortion, and cut insurance coverage of birth control, meaning women would pay an estimated $1.4 billion more a year to cover their birth control,"" Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said Sunday.Trump has also taken heat from Republicans for previously supporting abortion.

Multiple bomb blasts in a southern district of Damascus killed at least 87 people on Sunday, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, and twin car bombs killed at least 59 people in Homs, the monitoring group said.Russian air strikes launched in September against rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad have exacerbated suffering and destruction in Syria, where a five-year-old civil war has killed more than a quarter of a million people.Assad said on Saturday he was ready for a ceasefire on condition ""terrorists"" did not use a lull in fighting to their advantage and that countries backing the insurgents stopped supporting them.The Syrian opposition had earlier said it had agreed to the ""possibility"" of a temporary truce, provided there were guarantees Damascus's allies, including Russia, would cease fire, sieges were lifted and aid deliveries were allowed country-wide.""We have reached a provisional agreement in principle on the terms of a cessation of hostilities that could begin in the coming days,"" Kerry told a news conference in Amman with Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh.""The modalities for a cessation of hostilities are now being completed. In fact, we are closer to a ceasefire today than we have been,"" said Kerry, who was also to meet King Abdullah.He declined to go into detail about the unresolved issues, saying the two sides were ""filling out the details"" of the agreement. And he indicated issues remained to be resolved and he did not expect any immediate change on the ground.He repeated the U.S. position that Assad had to step down. ""With Assad there, this war cannot and will not end,"" he said.Assad's fate has been one of the main points of difference between Washington and Russia, the Syrian leader's main international backer. Russia recently has begun to say Syrians should decide on whether Assad should stay or not, but it continues to support Damascus with air strikes.OBAMA AND PUTIN TO TALKKerry said he had spoken to Lavrov on several occasions, including earlier on Sunday, and that he anticipated U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin would talk in the coming days to complete the provisional agreement in principle.The Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed Lavrov and Kerry had spoken by phone on Sunday about conditions for a ceasefire. It said the discussions were on conditions that would exclude operations against organizations ""recognized as terrorist by U.N. Security Council.""Those groups include Islamic State and the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front.Despite the provisional agreement, Kerry did not see an imminent change in fighting on the ground.""I do not believe that in the next few days, during which time we try to bring this into effect, there is somehow going to be a tipping point with respect to what is happening on the ground ... The opposition has made clear their determination to fight back,"" he said.The car bombs and suicide attacks on Sunday in the Sayeda Zeinab district of Damascus, where Syria's holiest Shi'ite shrine is located, were claimed by Islamic State. Suicide attacks last month in the same district, also claimed by Islamic State, killed 60 people.The car bombings on Sunday in Homs, in which at least 100 were also wounded, were among the deadliest in the city in five years of fighting, the Syrian Observatory said.Kerry said any deal would take a few days to come together, while the two sides consulted with other countries and the Syrian opposition. Russia had to speak to the Syrian government and Iran, and the United States had to speak to the Syrian opposition and its partners, Kerry said.Russia's RIA news agency said on Sunday that Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had arrived in Tehran, quoting a source in the Russian Embassy in Iran. It did not give a reason for the visit.Also on HuffPost:"

John Kasich just signed a bill that strips state and some federal funding from health clinics that perform and promote ""nontherapeutic abortions.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ca14361500002b000b06e8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) on Sunday signed a bill that effectively defunds Planned Parenthood in his state.The bill strips state and some federal funding from health clinics that perform and promote ""nontherapeutic abortions,"" including Planned Parenthood facilities.While the bill grants an exemption to abortions performed in cases of rape, incest and preserving the life of the mother, it jeopardizes the fate of other vital women's health programs.For example, the $1.3 million in state grants that Planned Parenthood is slated to lose was allocated toward HIV testing, cancer screenings and programs that help prevent domestic violence and infant mortality.In a statement, the organization's president, Cecile Richards, denounced the bill, arguing that it would have ""devastating consequences for women across Ohio.""“John Kasich is proudly eliminating care for expectant mothers and newborns; he is leaving thousands without vital STD and HIV testing, slashing a program to fight domestic violence, and cutting access to essential, basic health care,"" she said.""It’s clear Kasich has no regard for women’s health or lives, and will stop at nothing to block health care for the tens of thousands of Ohioans who rely on Planned Parenthood,” Richards added.As HuffPost's Dana Liebelson and Samantha Lachman reported earlier this month, Kasich's decision to sign the bill should not come as a surprise. Although the GOP presidential hopeful has been hailed by many in his party as being moderate, he has long supported abortion restrictions in his state.Just months after becoming governor, Kasich signed a bill banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy unless the fetus is nonviable. In 2013, Kasich signed a budget that stripped roughly $1.4 million in family planning funds from Planned Parenthood, required abortion providers to perform ultrasounds on patients seeking abortions and allowed rape crisis centers to be stripped of their public funds if they referred victims to abortion providers, among other measures. The budget also blocked public hospitals from entering into transfer agreements for medical emergencies with abortion clinics, threatening clinics with closure if they couldn't get a private hospital to enter into those agreements. Because private hospitals often have religious affiliations, this arrangement often wasn't possible.Last year, Kasich also said that he supports a state bill that would ban abortions for Down syndrome. Critics argue that the bill violates the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade ruling, which declared that women can choose to get an abortion at any point until the fetus is viable and that the choice to get an abortion should be a private matter between the patient and her doctor, not determined by the government.

32,POLITICS,What Donald Trump's Win In South Carolina Says About The Republican Party,Igor Bobic and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-south-carolina_us_56c87f72e4b041136f1725b8,Time for a reality check.,2016-02-21,"Real estate mogul Donald Trump, with supporters in North Carolina, enjoys free media coverage and has spent relatively little money on his campaign.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c882c31e0000210070276e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump comfortably defeated his Republican presidential rivals on Saturday in South Carolina's GOP primary.Trump's resounding victory isn’t simply a boon to his prospects for winning the Republican presidential nomination, an outcome once thought impossible that is looking increasingly more plausible. It is also an embarrassing repudiation of conservative orthodoxy that has dominated Republican politics for decades. It suggests that the party's intellectual leaders, who organized the base around the National Review/Weekly Standard consensus -- small government, free trade, pro-Israel, deregulation, low taxes, social conservatism and an aggressive foreign policy -- have been generals of a phantom army.The troops, instead, are marching with Trump, who bested his rivals in South Carolina by campaigning against nearly everything the Bush family, the Republican Party and neoconservatives who supported military interventions advocated for. Among his many breaks with the elite consensus, Trump declared that former President George W. Bush had lied about weapons of mass destruction to march the country to war; blamed Bush for the 9/11 attacks, arguing that he ignored intelligence community warnings; defended Planned Parenthood; boasted that he was the only Republican who would not cut Social Security or Medicare; said he approved of the individual mandate in Obamacare; and promised to slap onerous tariffs on companies who outsource jobs.And where Washington and New York-based GOP leaders pledge outreach to immigrants, moderate Muslims and other minorities, the reality TV star plays more overt racial politics than any national candidate since George Wallace. Trump's brand of nativist, nationalist isolationism marked the path to victory. Rival candidate Jeb Bush is a dead man.Conventional wisdom said that Trump was going to have a difficult time in the Palmetto State. After all, the brash real estate mogul failed to sway evangelicals in Iowa, a key group that is similarly prevalent across South Carolina. The thinking further went that Trump would also face an uphill climb with many veterans in the state, who are drawn to a candidate ready to assume the sober responsibilities of commander-in-chief. More than anything, however, Trump was expected to hit a wall named George W. Bush. The former president remains overwhelmingly popular among the state’s Republican voters, but not even he could convince enough South Carolinians to support his forlorn brother.In the weeks leading up to the primary, Trump incessantly mocked Jeb Bush for relying on the aid of his famous family -- first his mother, Barbara, and later his brother. He gleefully tweeted that Bush “desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS, the Chinese or with Putin.” Bush campaign officials spun the jabs as a personal affront against the former first lady in hopes of winning votes, but Trump kept rising in the polls anyway.During last week’s presidential debate in Greenville, South Carolina, Trump unloaded on George W. Bush’s presidency in a tirade that earned him plaudits from anti-war groups like Code Pink. He insisted that the former president “lied” to America about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in order to start a war there and claimed that he lost “hundreds” of friends during the Sept. 11 terror attacks.""How did he keep us safe when the World Trade Center came down?"" Trump asked, referring to the GOP refrain that “Bush kept us safe” in the aftermath of the attacks, a line that helped him win re-election in 2004. He further stirred the pot after the former president re-emerged on the campaign trail on behalf of his brother, posing the question, “is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco[nomic] collapse? Careful!""The New York businessman had even harsher words for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a defense hawk who is considered a powerful politician on the South Carolina scene, after he endorsed Bush. To Trump, Graham is merely a ""disgrace"" and ""one of the dumbest human beings I’ve ever seen.""""He knows nothing. That’s why we’ve been in there for 15 years,"" added Trump about Graham, in reference to the nation's involvement in the Middle East.The attacks were especially jarring because they didn’t come from a Democrat or anti-war liberal still sore about George W. Bush’s presidency -- but from someone leading the race for the GOP nomination.Beltway pundits confidently projected that Trump’s performance at the debate would cost him votes of South Carolina Republicans still loyal to the presidential family. But once again, his poll numbers held steady, offering up yet another stinging rebuke to the Bush legacy. In the end, Trump capitalized on a structural weakness of Jeb Bush’s campaign that no amount of money could fix -- his last name. It turns out far more Americans are divided on issues like the Iraq War and whether George W. Bush truly “kept us safe” than Republican leaders believed. Trump violated another core Republican Party standard on the eve of the primary when he vowed to stay “neutral” in conflicts between Israel and Palestine, with hopes of negotiating a deal between the two sides during his presidency. “You understand a lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal,"" he said in an interview on MSNBC this week. ""So I don’t want to say whose fault it is -- I don’t think that helps.” That statement was at odds with the rest of the Republican presidential field, and the GOP more broadly, which offers largely knee-jerk pro-Israel rhetoric to appeal to evangelicals across the American South.The businessman followed up on Thursday during a CNN town hall by suggesting that he would preserve a health insurance mandate -- such as the one that's part of the Affordable Care Act -- and then reversing himself on the matter a day later.Added to his promises not to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits, and his populist rhetoric against trade and Wall Street, it's a wonder GOP elites and their wealthy donors haven't done more to stop Trump's rise -- especially now this caucus victory gives him the chance to run the table in coming primaries across the South on his way toward the nomination. In the end, Republican elites found that in South Carolina, they couldn't beat something with nothing.Editor's Note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Sign up to get an email from reporter Ryan Grim when he writes a new story."

35,BUSINESS,Yelp Employee Fired After Public Post To CEO Saying She Can't Afford Food,Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yelp-employee-fired-after-complaints_us_56ca00bee4b041136f1760eb,"""Here I am, 25-years old, balancing all sorts of debt and trying to pave a life for myself that doesn’t involve crying in the bathtub every week.”",2016-02-21,Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman has agreed that the cost of living is too expensive in the Bay Area.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586d65ab1500009206e9e7d2.jpeg?cache=ipHqs6fcIB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Yelp employee who was fired shortly after posting an open letter to the company’s CEO about not being able to afford food with her entry-level salary is sparking an online debate, not only about fair wage but “entitled” millennials.Talia Jane, a 25-year-old recent college graduate, announced her termination shortly after rattling off her complaints Friday in an article posted to Medium titled, “An Open Letter To My CEO.”In the letter, addressed to “Jeremy,” or Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman, Jane blames her daily hunger and the lack of heating in her apartment on the bi-weekly $733.24 wage she earned while working in customer support in the San Francisco Bay Area. The letter also describes Jane’s crushed expectations after learning she wouldn’t be promoted to another department in less than a year’s time.“Coming out of college without much more than freelancing and tutoring under my belt, I felt it was fair that I start out working in the customer support section of Yelp/Eat24 before I’d be qualified to transfer to media,” she wrote. “Then, after I had moved and got firmly stuck in this apartment with this debt, I was told I’d have to work in support for an entire year before I would be able to move to a different department.”Jane states that after earning an English literature degree, she moved to the Bay Area so that she could be closer to her father and because “I like the weather up here."" She found an apartment about 40 miles away from work, but her $1,245 rent gobbled up about 80 percent of her paycheck -- leaving her barely able to afford food or her $11.30-a-day commute. She does note that the company provides “great” benefits, though she says she couldn't afford the $20 copays. ""I haven’t bought groceries since I started this job. Not because I’m lazy, but because I got this ten pound bag of rice before I moved here and my meals at home (including the one I’m having as I write this) consist, by and large, of that,” she wrote. “So here I am, 25-years old, balancing all sorts of debt and trying to pave a life for myself that doesn’t involve crying in the bathtub every week.”Shortly after her post was published, Jane reported that she had been fired. She also posted links to sites where people could send her donations online.“The HR lady & my manager straight up told me that the letter violated Yelp's 'Terms of Conduct' and that's why they had to let me go,” she later tweeted. “My manager wasn't even notified until I called him. this didn't come from my department. this came from................the Big Guy.”Stoppelman personally addressed Jane's letter on Twitter on Saturday, saying he was not “personally involved in Talia being let go and it was not because she posted a Medium letter directed at me.”He did use the letter as an opportunity to address San Francisco’s cost of living, agreeing that it’s too high.“I have been focused on this issue, backing anti-NIMBY group [the San Francisco Bay Area Renters Federation] and speaking out frequently about the need to lower cost of housing,” he wrote. ""The reality of such a high Bay Area cost of living is entry-level jobs migrate to where costs of living are lower. Have already announced we are growing EAT24 support in [Arizona] for this reason.”A Yelp spokesperson reached by The Huffington Post on Sunday backed Stoppelman’s response while calling Jane’s post “an important example of freedom of speech.”""We do not comment on personnel issues. However, we did agree with many of the points in Ms. Jane's post and we viewed it as her real, personal narrative about what it's like to live in the Bay Area,” the spokesperson said in an email. ""We agree with her comments about the high costs of living in San Francisco, which is why we announced in December that we are expanding our Eat24 customer support team into our Phoenix office where [we] will pay the same wage.""Online commenters showed a mixed response to Jane's letter and her termination.""If you wonder why 18 year olds that live with their parents are doing the same job as you, it is because it is an entry level position with minimum wage pay that does not require a college degree,"" reads a post by user Kris Gellci. ""While I think that minimum wage should be higher, that is not what your post was about.""""Talia, I'm sorry there are so many unsupportive garbage-person comments on your post. The way you've been treated at Yelp/Eat24 isn't OK, and it took a lot of guts to write this letter. How can we help?"" wrote Rebecca Searles, who had the top-rated comment as of Sunday afternoon. ""I'm going to be brutally honest. You do in fact, like many others have pointed out, sound like a stereotypical, entitled, and whiny millennial,"" user rileybon commented. ""The reason why you were/are in the predicament you are now is because you put yourself there. You made poor financial decisions because you wanted to live in a fancy apartment that you could not afford.""Also on HuffPost:"

But new research from Stanford University will change your mind (and your attitude).Psychologist Carol Dweck has spent her entire career studying attitude and performance, and her latest study shows that your attitude is a better predictor of your success than your IQ.Dweck found that people's core attitudes fall into one of two categories: a fixed mindset or a growth mindset.With a fixed mindset, you believe you are who you are and you cannot change. This creates problems when you're challenged because anything that appears to be more than you can handle is bound to make you feel hopeless and overwhelmed.People with a growth mindset believe that they can improve with effort. They outperform those with a fixed mindset, even when they have a lower IQ, because they embrace challenges, treating them as opportunities to learn something new. Common sense would suggest that having ability, like being smart, inspires confidence. It does, but only while the going is easy. The deciding factor in life is how you handle setbacks and challenges. People with a growth mindset welcome setbacks with open arms. According to Dweck, success in life is all about how you deal with failure. She describes the approach to failure of people with the growth mindset this way,""Failure is information -- we label it failure, but it's more like, 'This didn't work, and I'm a problem solver, so I'll try something else.'"" Regardless of which side of the chart you fall on, you can make changes and develop a growth mindset. What follows are some strategies that will fine-tune your mindset and help you make certain it's as growth oriented as possible.Don't stay helpless. We all hit moments when we feel helpless. The test is how we react to that feeling. We can either learn from it and move forward or let it drag us down. There are countless successful people who would have never made it if they had succumbed to feelings of helplessness: Walt Disney was fired from the Kansas City Star because he ""lacked imagination and had no good ideas,"" Oprah Winfrey was fired from her job as a TV anchor in Baltimore for being ""too emotionally invested in her stories,"" Henry Ford had two failed car companies prior to succeeding with Ford, and Steven Spielberg was rejected by USC's Cinematic Arts School multiple times. Imagine what would have happened if any of these people had a fixed mindset. They would have succumbed to the rejection and given up hope. People with a growth mindset don't feel helpless because they know that in order to be successful, you need to be willing to fail hard and then bounce right back.Be passionate. Empowered people pursue their passions relentlessly. There's always going to be someone who's more naturally talented than you are, but what you lack in talent, you can make up for in passion. Empowered people's passion is what drives their unrelenting pursuit of excellence. Warren Buffet recommends finding your truest passions using, what he calls, the 5/25 technique: Write down the 25 things that you care about the most. Then, cross out the bottom 20. The remaining 5 are your true passions. Everything else is merely a distraction.Take action. It's not that people with a growth mindset are able to overcome their fears because they are braver than the rest of us; it's just that they know fear and anxiety are paralyzing emotions and that the best way to overcome this paralysis is to take action. People with a growth mindset are empowered, and empowered people know that there's no such thing as a truly perfect moment to move forward. So why wait for one? Taking action turns all your worry and concern about failure into positive, focused energy.Then go the extra mile (or two). Empowered people give it their all, even on their worst days. They're always pushing themselves to go the extra mile. One of Bruce Lee's pupils ran three miles every day with him. One day, they were about to hit the three-mile mark when Bruce said, ""Let's do two more."" His pupil was tired and said, ""I'll die if I run two more."" Bruce's response? ""Then do it."" His pupil became so angry that he finished the full five miles. Exhausted and furious, he confronted Bruce about his comment, and Bruce explained it this way: ""Quit and you might as well be dead. If you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it'll spread over into the rest of your life. It'll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there; you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level.""If you aren't getting a little bit better each day, then you're most likely getting a little worse--and what kind of life is that?Expect results. People with a growth mindset know that they're going to fail from time to time, but they never let that keep them from expecting results. Expecting results keeps you motivated and feeds the cycle of empowerment. After all, if you don't think you're going to succeed, then why bother?Be flexible. Everyone encounters unanticipated adversity. People with an empowered, growth-oriented mindset embrace adversity as a means for improvement, as opposed to something that holds them back. When an unexpected situation challenges an empowered person, they flex until they get results.Don't complain when things don't go your way. Complaining is an obvious sign of a fixed mindset. A growth mindset looks for opportunity in everything, so there's no room for complaints.  Bringing It All TogetherBy keeping track of how you respond to the little things, you can work every day to keep yourself on the right side of the chart above.Do you have a growth mindset? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

Otherwise than this. To begin here in the otherwise, as the otherwise, is to pose a question about tears born in dreams."" -- Ashon Crawley, Otherwise FergusonI am pregnant with a vision of otherwise futures and possibilities. It keeps me up at night and it is kicking hard, reminding me that the free world that must be is yet to be. The doctor says it's not a boy or girl but a dream continuously dreaming. My feet are swelling, I am short of breath, and I am seeing things that I have never seen before. It exhausts and overwhelms me with miraculous joy. And it is moving in me like bodies in water -- like our ancestors trembling and whispering a thousand secrets at the bottom of the Atlantic. This vision, I imagine, is a body of water that will lead us to the other side. See, child, you have to wade in the water if you want to get free. Water reminds us that we have the capacity to expand and adapt; that our survival depends upon it. The movement for Black lives must consider these things. And It must always consider the least of these -- bodies whom are always left behind in the quest for Black liberation: Black fat bodies, Black femme bodies, Black disabled bodies, Black stripper bodies, Black hoe bodies, Black HIV Positive Bodies, Black gender deviant bodies, Black poor bodies, Black unconventional bodies, Black depressed bodies, and Black malnourished bodies. These -- and so many others -- are all aspects of the Black body: messy, complicated, and whole. This is a metaphor for the movement that must be; it must hold all of us. Where is the reflection of the least of these? Why are they perceived a threat? How might body positivity and freedom in our bodies lead us to the other side? I'm posing these questions not as a demand for answers but as an invitation for us all to reckon with what it means to truly get free.Wade in the water. Wade in the water, children. Wade in the water. Freedom...is...in...the...water.Body positivity asks of us to examine our relationship to our bodies, the spaces it occupies, and the worlds around it; it asks of us to wade in deep, angry, and cleansing waters and to wash ourselves free of bias, shame, and enslaving silences. Body positivity taught me how to see myself and not be afraid of what I saw. It taught me how to look inward -- a soft, tender place we're often taught to be afraid of -- and spend time familiarizing myself there. It's where I first felt free, like being washed anew, in the Jordan, on Sunday morning, dressed in all white, immersed in a body outside of and bigger than my own. Body positivity is, too, movement work. And it is important to remember this because the physical labor of movement work tends to push us away from our bodies so much that we forget who we are, how to feel, how to take care of our body and our most erotic selves; the selves we've allowed ourselves to silence and not listen to.We must also remember that it is not only systemic/state violence and overlapping oppressions that distance us from our bodies, but we ourselves interpersonally and inter/intra-communally, especially when we're not honest about things we often deem as trivial: desire. Liberation Theory 101 says that when we center those closest to the margin we all get free, not those closest to our beds, our erections, and our notions of desirability as informed by white imaginations and insatiable cravings for white validation. In the words of sister-warrior Audre Lorde, ""Our erotic knowledge empowers us, becomes a lens through which we scrutinize all aspects of our existence, forcing us to evaluate those aspects honestly in terms of their relative meaning within our lives. And this is a grave responsibility, projected from within each of us, not to settle for the convenient, the shoddy, the conventionally expected, nor the merely safe.""  In my personal work, I deeply value and make use of the erotic--the power to deeply feel in our bodies. It requires me to consider my deepest and non-rational knowledge and to always think about simultaneity and intentionality -- to think about both what I do, why I do it, how I do it and how I feel while doing it. In my forthcoming documentary, No Fats, No Femmes, I am attempting to theorize and do work around the politics of desire. I am daring to say that whom we are attracted to, and whom we fuck and love in our bedrooms deeply informs how we move throughout the world, particularly Black publics, including but not limited to: the Black press, the Black church, Black academicians, the Black literati, and the Black left. We cannot relegate the erotic to the bedroom only. We cannot. We must recognize how personal preferences are connected to how bodies are often policed outside the bedroom. We must resist and undo homo/hetero-normative impulses, and the masks of racial, sexual, and class respectability that limits our capacity to stretch and swell abundantly like the water. We have nothing to lose in this way.Freedom is not yet here. It is imperative that we always remember this. Black futures depend upon it. Black futures demand that we're not content with loving our black lives without question; that we always question and consider who is left behind. We don't have the luxury of parsing out race, from class, gender, size, dis/ability, and sexuality. It is critically imperative that we approach movement work through an intentional -- perhaps, proactive -- intersectional lens because it is vital that we expand and shape a movement that is all-body loving and all-gender honoring. And this is not to tokenize or exceptionalize people in spaces but to push us to be as abundant as the water -- to soft river and vogue our way to freedom, following in the Black radical footsteps of Harriet, leaving no one behind.Illustration by Sharee Miller.This post is part of the ""Black Future Month"" series produced by The Huffington Post and Black Lives Matter Network for Black History Month.

While there's no ""Question Authority"" T-shirt under my blazer, I still question and push back on (and sometimes get arrested by) the authorities. Still, when younger Americans look at my generation and how we've fallen short on important issues of opportunity, equality and justice, I find myself on an unfamiliar side of a generational divide.Who can blame younger Americans -- millennials, in particular? They're the most educated generation to date, but they're drowning in student debt. Many entered the workforce during the Great Recession and its long hangover -- and economists say they, as a group, may never fully recover. No wonder they're anxious and angry -- this generation may be the first in recent history to do worse than their parents. It's now about freelancing and the sharing economy -- not home ownership and job security. No wonder only eight percent of millennials have much confidence in Congress -- type ""do-nothing"" and ""Congress"" into a Google search, and you'll get 51 million hits.

Photo by Michael C. CampbellThat number may rise after last week, when congressional Republicans and Republican presidential candidates put politics above principle and laced their ""condolences"" upon Justice Antonin Scalia's death with defiant refusals to consider any candidate President Obama would nominate to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. How ironic for so-called strict constructionists to decide that, in an election year, they can flout Article II of the Constitution, which requires the president to nominate and the Senate to confirm Supreme Court justices.It's a reminder that for progressives' fights against injustice and intentional polarization to be effective, they must transcend generations. Take the civil rights movement, which at the height of its strength was a cross-generational movement. Ministers and rabbinical students, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters -- young and old, of many races and backgrounds, pushed toward justice.We must keep pushing toward justice together. Standing up against unequal and inadequate education is all our fight. Eliminating crushing college debt is all our fight. Confronting discrimination, and making the economy work for everyone, is all our fight.America's labor unions wage these fights. Millennials understand that -- a strong majority of people aged 18 to 29 surveyed by the Pew Research Center holds a favorable view of labor unions. Rightly so -- union members earn better wages and benefits than nonunion workers. Unions allow workers to have a say in the workplace. And, where union membership is higher, children are better off.Millennials are helping to shape the AFT, and the AFT is working to give this generation a leg up. The AFT has the longest-established graduate teaching and research assistant local unions in the country, and the leaders of those locals are among the youngest elected leaders of unions in the United States today. The AFT has an array of teacher leader programs, including the Florida Education Association's FYRE (Florida's Young Remarkable Educators) program, which taps promising young educators and provides them with opportunities for mentoring and leadership roles in the union, and to connect with others interested in driving change in the profession.The AFT also is working to make college more affordable. Some AFT affiliates are using tools developed by Jobs with Justice to offer online guidance and workshops to help people pay off student debt, which grows by an estimated $2,726.27 every second, according to MarketWatch. One workshop participant cut $600 from her monthly loan payment.Both Democratic candidates for president also have proposals to address college affordability. We favor Hillary Clinton's New College Compact, which translates the value of affordable college to a sustainable plan that allows students to attend a four-year public college without taking out loans for tuition or to attend a community college tuition-free, encourages states to invest in higher education, and reduces interest rates for people with student loans.Bridging generational divides takes giving people voice and listening to things that might be hard to hear. My generation hasn't left the world in such great shape, though not for lack of trying.

While there's no ""Question Authority"" T-shirt under my blazer, I still question and push back on (and sometimes get arrested by) the authorities. Still, when younger Americans look at my generation and how we've fallen short on important issues of opportunity, equality and justice, I find myself on an unfamiliar side of a generational divide.Who can blame younger Americans -- millennials, in particular? They're the most educated generation to date, but they're drowning in student debt. Many entered the workforce during the Great Recession and its long hangover -- and economists say they, as a group, may never fully recover. No wonder they're anxious and angry -- this generation may be the first in recent history to do worse than their parents. It's now about freelancing and the sharing economy -- not home ownership and job security. No wonder only eight percent of millennials have much confidence in Congress -- type ""do-nothing"" and ""Congress"" into a Google search, and you'll get 51 million hits.

CampbellThat number may rise after last week, when congressional Republicans and Republican presidential candidates put politics above principle and laced their ""condolences"" upon Justice Antonin Scalia's death with defiant refusals to consider any candidate President Obama would nominate to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. How ironic for so-called strict constructionists to decide that, in an election year, they can flout Article II of the Constitution, which requires the president to nominate and the Senate to confirm Supreme Court justices.It's a reminder that for progressives' fights against injustice and intentional polarization to be effective, they must transcend generations. Take the civil rights movement, which at the height of its strength was a cross-generational movement. Ministers and rabbinical students, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters -- young and old, of many races and backgrounds, pushed toward justice.We must keep pushing toward justice together. Standing up against unequal and inadequate education is all our fight. Eliminating crushing college debt is all our fight. Confronting discrimination, and making the economy work for everyone, is all our fight.America's labor unions wage these fights. Millennials understand that -- a strong majority of people aged 18 to 29 surveyed by the Pew Research Center holds a favorable view of labor unions. Rightly so -- union members earn better wages and benefits than nonunion workers. Unions allow workers to have a say in the workplace. And, where union membership is higher, children are better off.Millennials are helping to shape the AFT, and the AFT is working to give this generation a leg up. The AFT has the longest-established graduate teaching and research assistant local unions in the country, and the leaders of those locals are among the youngest elected leaders of unions in the United States today. The AFT has an array of teacher leader programs, including the Florida Education Association's FYRE (Florida's Young Remarkable Educators) program, which taps promising young educators and provides them with opportunities for mentoring and leadership roles in the union, and to connect with others interested in driving change in the profession.The AFT also is working to make college more affordable. Some AFT affiliates are using tools developed by Jobs with Justice to offer online guidance and workshops to help people pay off student debt, which grows by an estimated $2,726.27 every second, according to MarketWatch. One workshop participant cut $600 from her monthly loan payment.Both Democratic candidates for president also have proposals to address college affordability. We favor Hillary Clinton's New College Compact, which translates the value of affordable college to a sustainable plan that allows students to attend a four-year public college without taking out loans for tuition or to attend a community college tuition-free, encourages states to invest in higher education, and reduces interest rates for people with student loans.Bridging generational divides takes giving people voice and listening to things that might be hard to hear. My generation hasn't left the world in such great shape, though not for lack of trying. So I'm asking my fellow baby boomer idealists to understand millennials' frustration, to tap into their incredible energy and to recognize their passion and altruism. Maybe if we work across generations, together we can create a better America that ensures opportunity, equality and justice for all."

Bushâs brother. âNo longer being related to his brother is a key step to clearing Jebâs path to the nomination,â an aide said on New Yearâs Day. âWe expect his poll numbers to soar on this.â According to the aide, the former Florida governor resigned his post as brother in a ten-minute phone call with George W. Bush, after which he blocked the former Presidentâs phone number and e-mail address. In an official statement, George W. Bush said that he âunderstands and supportsâ his former brotherâs decision. âIf I were him, I would no longer be related to me either,â he said.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb93326200000070201ed22.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Only a few months ago, CNN touted a poll showing George W. Bush's popularity exceeded Barack Obama's. But you wouldn't know that on February 20, 2016, as Hillary Clinton engineered a great comeback by linking herself to Obama, while Jeb's campaign flopped as he joined himself at his brother's hip. Only Hillary is still in the race now.Though Jeb Bush didn't always campaign next to George W. Bush, the former president was never far from his brother during the campaign. One of Bush's campaign spokesmen, who once worked for ex-House Speaker John Boehner, touted Dubbya's approval rating among Republicans at 77 percent. ""He kept us safe,"" Jeb would often say when asked about his brother, or terrorism, at debates.If that's true, then either: (a) Jeb Bush is the worst candidate in the history of American elections, or (b) George W. Bush's numbers weren't so great. It's probably some of both. That's because Jeb got nowhere near 77 percent in state. He was lucky to get more than 10 percent, if he ever did. Those ""Miss Me?"" signs with Dubbya's face really aren't a big seller for someone who left office with a 22 percent approval rating, still better than Jeb's numbers in the primary.These days, President George W. Bush draws interesting art, goes to Selma, Alabama for a civil rights march and helps Bill Clinton raise money for good causes. His numbers haven't been so bad, because he's not really involved in government. However, when push comes to shove, even Republicans clearly cringe at the thought of another Bush in the White House.Regardless of whether or not you like George W. Bush, ""He kept us safe,"" is a factually incorrect statement. Whether you completely blame Bush for 9/11, the Hurricane Katrina, the intelligence findings and the invasion of Iraq, it clearly was anything but a safe eight years. Donald Trump simply reminded GOP voters what the rest us knew, and was unafraid to publicly point out each of George W. Bush's significant errors. And Jeb subsequently suspended his campaign.Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton found herself reeling from a big loss in New Hampshire after the narrowest of victories in Iowa. At the next debate, with Sanders having all the momentum, Hillary Clinton pointed out her support for Barack Obama, and how her opponent was less than supportive of the president.Sanders backpedaled, angrily denying the charges. But his written foreword of Bill Press' book critical of Barack Obama, and revelations that he was open to a primary competitor to Obama in 2012 undermined his argument. Saying that Hillary Clinton opposed Obama in 2008 was an ineffective response, given her loyal service to the president as Secretary of State. Now she appears to have pulled out another win in a caucus, a format where she doesn't thrive, in another neutral region. Sanders can only point to a win in a state next to his home state.  A second look at the June 2015 CNN poll reveals that Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush had the highest approval ratings (at 64 percent), along with Jimmy Carter (56 percent approval), and George W. Bush sporting the lowest approval rating of a living ex-president (52 percent). Jeb's embrace of his brother cost him dearly, while Hillary's support of Obama helped her campaign recover. Such a move will likely demonstrate Democratic unity, while it's back to the drawing board, or painting easel, for ex-President George W. Bush.John A.
