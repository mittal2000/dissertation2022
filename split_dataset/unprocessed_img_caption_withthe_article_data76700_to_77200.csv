Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) is planning to run for the House speaker post, according to Politico.The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will challenge House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for the post, sources told Politico.McCarthy is the favorite to replace outgoing House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), but has come under increased scrutiny from members of the party after praising the Select Committee on Benghazi for hurting Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton's poll numbers. Chaffetz would be a long-shot candidate for the position, but may be able to woo conservatives within the party, who are skeptical about McCarthy being speaker. Chaffetz told CNN this week that McCarthy should apologize for his comments about the Benghazi Committee, which is tasked with investigating the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.Chaffetz's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), chairman of the bipartisan Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. ""No legislation will stop every tragedy, but passing commonsense gun laws will at least stop some.""The letter is signed by 147 lawmakers, most of them Democrats. Five Republicans signed too, including Reps. Peter King (N.Y.) and Robert Dold (Ill.).A Boehner spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Thompson has filed legislation that would expand criminal background checks to all commercial gun sales. He has another bill that would give grants to states to strengthen gun safety laws that prohibit gun sales to individuals with certain risk factors, such as a history of dangerous mental illness, substance abuse, and violence. Other lawmakers have also proposed new gun safety measures. Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) introduced a bill that would require gun owners to carry liability insurance. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) filed legislation that prohibits the sale of guns to people who have been convicted of certain crimes, including stalking. ""Every single time a mass shooting happens we go through the same routine. Thoughts and prayers are sent. Statements are made. Stories are written. And nothing changes,"" Thompson said in a statement. “Let’s have this time be different. This time, let’s actually pull together and do something to make our country safer.”"

Thirty agonizing minutes passed before he was able to contact his daughter by phone, he said.Ten people were killed in the violence, and another nine were wounded, though authorities have not yet confirmed whether the death toll includes the shooter.Despite their fear, Taylor and her father were humble and proud, surrounded by their peers. The community college is much-loved in the area, evidenced by the number of people wearing their UCC sweatshirts to the vigil.They huddled together, embracing one another and holding candles high above their heads or arranging them to spell out the school's letters on the ground. A man played ""Amazing Grace"" on the bagpipes while people in the crowd sobbed. There was also anger, as one mourner cried out for “change,” as well as general disbelief that this could happen in their community. Also at the vigil was Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D), who arrived to make a short, heartfelt speech: “In our sorrow, we will remember and honor those lost today ... And they will forever be in our hearts. May peace be with you.”As of Friday morning, many questions remained unanswered. Who are the victims? Most of the victims haven't been named, but one of them, Chris Mintz, has been identified as an Army veteran who reportedly charged the shooter before being shot. Ana Boylan, a student at UCC, was hit near her spine but is expected to survive. Her parents spoke to CNN on Thursday, retelling her account.Who is the shooter? Not much is known about the gunman-- even his connection to the school is unclear. According to neighbors, he was quiet and reserved, with no girlfriend and not many friends. Still, many of them expressed shock at the news. Perhaps no one was more shocked than Mercer's father, though. Ian Mercer spoke out late Thursday, telling reporters that he was ""devastated.""Meanwhile, police have refused to confirm the shooter's identity.""I will not name the shooter,"" Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told reporters on Thursday. ""I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act."" How will the community begin to heal?It’s a question that may take some time to answer. There have been 45 shootings at schools in 2015, each one leaving a devastated community in its wake to make sense of what had happened.Thursday was chaotic and exhausting for residents of Roseburg. Media poured into the small town, following locals to a fairground near the school where they were searching for their friends and loved ones, knocking on doors surrounding Mercer’s apartment, staking out Mercy Medical Center and then tailing mourners to the vigil.​This article has been updated with revised casualty figures for Thursday's shooting.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has tapped Arturo Carmona as his Latino outreach director.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560eeba61600002e00037efa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) presidential campaign announced on Friday that it has hired a veteran Latino rights activist as its Latino outreach director, marking an escalation of the campaign’s efforts to shore up a constituency that has yet to warm to his candidacy.Arturo Carmona, who was executive director of Presente.org, a Los Angeles-based online Latino advocacy group active in the immigration reform fight, will also serve as Sanders’ Southwest political director.“I am going to work hard to build a strong team that can connect Bernie’s campaign with Latino families,” Carmona said in a statement released by the Sanders campaign. “As the son of an immigrant, his story resembles that of millions of Latinos in the U.S.” Carmona said that Sanders’ positions on economic inequality, climate change and criminal justice policy -- not just immigration reform -- will resonate with Latino voters. “Latinos need to be part of the political revolution that Sen. Sanders is calling for,” Carmona said. Sanders is ahead of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton in some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, and now rivals the Clinton campaign in fundraising, but he has struggled to attract the support of African-Americans and Latinos. Clinton enjoys the support of 57 percent of black and brown Democrats nationwide, according to a Sept. 14 ABC News/Washington Post poll, while Sanders has the backing of just 13 percent.Sanders drew criticism from immigration reform activists in July with comments implying that expanding some forms of legal immigration would threaten American jobs. (None, however, denied Sanders’ support for comprehensive immigration reform, which he voted for in 2013.)Carmona’s hiring is the latest in a series of moves by the Sanders campaign aimed at assuaging Latinos’ concerns and winning their support. Sanders told the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Thursday that he supports granting some undocumented immigrants eligibility to purchase health care coverage on the Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges.Sanders hired Lilia Chacon, a former press secretary to the Chicago city treasurer and the daughter of two immigrants from central America, as his Iowa press secretary, in September.Sanders’ Latino outreach efforts mirror attempts to address African-American concerns about his candidacy. Sanders hired African-American criminal justice organizer Symone Sanders as his campaign press secretary in August, after Black Lives Matter activists argued that Sanders was focusing on economic equality to the exclusion of racial justice.Also on HuffPost:"

On Friday, Pelosi called on House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to create a committee to investigate the ""crisis"" of mass shootings.""The epidemic of gun violence in our country challenges the conscience of our nation,"" Pelosi wrote to Boehner. ""As we pray for those who lost their loved ones at Umpqua Community College, we must address the tidal wave of grief  guns have caused to so many families.""In her letter, Pelosi challenged the common response from politicians when confronted with questions about what should be done to stop gun violence.""As Members of Congress, how can we in good conscience engage in moments of silence to honor these victims of gun violence, if we refuse to take action? We take a solemn oath to protect and defend the American people,"" she wrote. ""We must not accept the horror of gun violence as routine.""Pelosi said the House should first pass a bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) and Pete King (R-N.Y.), which would expand existing background checks to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the Internet or in classified ads.""But we should not stop there,"" she wrote the speaker. ""I urge you to create a Select Committee on Gun Violence to confront this crisis and report back common sense legislation to help end it. The bipartisan committee would be charged to present its recommendations to the House within 60 days -- in time for a vote before the third anniversary of the Newtown shooting this year."" Thursday's attack by the lone gunman on Umpqua Community College campus in Roseburg, Oregon, came nearly four months after a mass shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, which left nine people dead. In 2015 alone, there have been 45 mass shootings at schools. "
5,IMPACT,Meet Two People Who Are Addressing The Cause Of Teen Stress,Sasha Bronner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/identity-teen-stress_us_560c7b2ce4b076812700c9f8,"""It’s hard to lead others if you can’t lead yourself first.""",2015-10-02,"Caroline Jones performs on stage with her guitars, banjo and piano.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560db49b1600002d00037dae.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Generation Z has more access to information, technology and entertainment than any group of humans before. But why are stress levels in these teens and college students higher than ever?Musician Caroline Jones and best-selling author and leadership expert Stedman Graham have come together to offer a one-word answer: identity. And to explore this, they've taken this concept of the personal journey on tour. To help students discover their identities, Jones and Graham work with high school students to tackle questions including, ""Who are you?"", ""What are your core beliefs?"" and ""What do you dream of doing?"" Self-awareness is at the key of their message.Next week, the two will embark upon their second year of the Live Somina Tour -- a full-day workshop for students that focuses on self-empowerment and the cultivation of identity through performing arts and character development.This year, they will travel through 12 cities and reach approximately 65,000 high school students at 100 different schools along the way. The two-part program first features a mix of Jones’ acoustic music performances and her inspirational storytelling sessions, which help urge kids to pursue their talents and passions. This is followed by Graham’s identity workshop.Jones, 25, studied classical music growing up and attended NYU before embarking upon a career as a singer-songwriter. She performs for students on stage with an acoustic guitar, banjo and piano. Graham has written 11 books about identity development and is convinced that a lack of identity and self-awareness is what’s behind youth stress today.The two spoke with The Huffington Post about the growing beast that is technology, where the education system is failing and how kids can develop a stronger sense of self despite it.The Huffington Post: Caroline, you started bringing your music to boarding schools, high schools and colleges about five years ago while you were still in college yourself. In what ways do you think your musical program has resonated with students who are around your age?Caroline Jones: My show is acoustic -- it’s just me up there with my guitar, banjo, piano and some other instruments. I think it’s the artist in me, but I focus very heavily on storytelling in between songs. I talk about the inspiration behind my songs and my journey as an artist. I am a very spiritually and emotionally curious person. At a young age, I amassed this wealth of spiritual and philosophical knowledge that has helped me live a fulfilling and self-empowered life. I just can’t help but talk about that. It fulfills me and it seeps into my show.If a kid asks me about stage fright and says he’s scared to perform in front of people, the answer is almost entirely emotional. It’s as much about technique and craft as it is about how do you get yourself to a place where you can be in deep feeling of the song -- independent of how other people are going to think about it (which you can’t control)? That’s more important than making sure you have good breathing technique.This will be the second year of the Live Sonima Tour and this time around, you guys are going big. You have rented out bigger venues -- some which seat between 2,000 and 5,000 students. What are some of the biggest themes you touch on in your program?Jones: In between our two sessions, Stedman and I talk on stage to tie everything together. We talk about topics like self-reliance, happiness and fulfillment, the true purpose of education and what education actually should do for you. Like how you can empower yourself to make your education work for your dreams and your goals -- instead of just thinking about what job to get when you finish your education.Stedman Graham: The school system often teaches you how to take tests and repeat the information back. You get labeled with a grade and two weeks later, you forget the information. It’s limited learning for students. But it’s never too early to get students to decide what they love, what they are passionate about and what they want to focus on. You want to teach them how to focus on the self and create leadership skills around the self first. It’s hard to lead others if you can’t lead yourself first. Stedman, you have been teaching identity workshops to students for nearly 20 years now. What are the biggest changes have you noticed in teens over the past two decades, especially with rapid advances in technology?Graham: They have less control over their lives. They are not able to make good decisions about what they want to do in their lives. There’s so much information and so much confusion. They’re not as focused as they should be in school and I would say a lot of them just aren’t prepared to compete globally.Jones: The Internet and the technological revolution of the past decade has made it so that information is no longer in the hands of a few people. Information and knowledge is power. Now everyone has the information literally at their fingertips at all times. We really need to make sure that our education system is preparing people to be innovative, creative and self-reliant. Those are the things that are going to make you successful. It’s not about memorizing information anymore.Graham: Technology is changing everything. What they learn is not enough to prepare them for the jobs coming up. Things are constantly changing and courses and information become outdated quickly. It’s hard to keep up. They can be taught the basics in the traditional learning environment, but the basics just aren’t enough anymore.How else do you think technology is affecting Generation Z?Graham: The students come in with an entitlement attitude because they are empowered by the technology. They are empowered to think that they are ‘all that.’ But then the rude awakening comes when they can’t afford to go to college or they have to go back and live at home as adults. They have wasted a lot of time on their smartphones talking about nothing. There is a lack of focus. If you don’t know who you are, you can’t source the right information and apply it to your development -- so there’s no growth. The school system is set up for people to be average, not to be exceptional. It’s a cookie cutter.Jones: I can say that this generation, more than any other generation, has an awareness and a hunger to empower themselves. I think people misread it as entitlement. Entitlement is a misunderstanding of power. And I think a lot of kids are ambitious and have big dreams. They have grown up in a world where all of the information in the world is at their fingertips. I think the reason that so many feel stressed or lost or overwhelmed is because they don’t have a strong sense of self to apply all of that to.We are telling the kids that we know you have all this information, we know you’re overwhelmed and stressed and that you have people telling you what to do. But you need to have a core sense of yourself -- whether it’s a creative outlet like writing or sports or music or your own personal philosophy and beliefs. That’s why I call my program The Heart Is Smart. If you can just get in touch with your heart, yourself and identity, then almost anything is possible. There are infinite possibilities for what you can achieve.What do you feel are the biggest causes of such high stress levels in high school students today?Graham: There is so much information coming at you. A smartphone allows you to look at any movie or research anything you want at any time. You can Google anybody and find out who they are and what they’re doing. You never had that much access to information before. There’s so much noise. We aren’t focused on things that matter and we haven’t prioritized the things that are important. Our brains can’t handle so many things at a time.Jones: Stress stems from a disconnect between who you are now and who you believe you should be. Self-love, fulfillment, passion, joy, creativity, excellence, effectiveness -- these states represent the opposite of stress. The best way to soothe stress is to evoke these positive emotions, and for me, music is that avenue.Graham: It all comes down to having a stronger sense of identity. What we are trying to do is keep you focused on who you are and help you organize all of the things that are happening in your life. If you organize everything around you, you can empower yourself.Jones: In the grand scheme of things, if we look at the previous generations, it’s actually a huge step forward that this generation even recognizes that stress is optional -- and can recognize that they’re stressed.How are you able to get these really important themes across in a one-day workshop?Graham: I try to give them some awareness, to raise their consciousness, to let them know it’s about self-development. It’s about what you do extra. It’s about excellence -- not only in school, but everywhere you go. Take charge of you and don’t fall into the habit of mimicking everything you see around you.Jones: It reminds me of a Buddhist quote that talks about how you climb up a mountain to see the view from the top. When you climb down, you can’t see the view anymore -- but having seen it is infinitely beneficial because you’ll always have it in your mind. These kids have such impressionable minds. If they are able to be inspired, even for one day, by someone who knows who they are and is offering their gifts to the world, then I think that is really powerful. Even if it’s one hour or one moment where they felt really inspired and heard -- or we helped reveal something within them that they didn’t know they had -- that’s the lasting impression we are going for.The Live Sonima Tour kicks off on Oct. 6 in Memphis, Tennessee. Other cities this fall include Beaufort, South Carolina; Charlotte, North Carolina; Miami and Daytona Beach, Florida."

To use his name, the sheriff said, ""will only glorify his horrific actions and serve to inspire future shooters.""Hanlin had made similar comments on Thursday night.Mercer also died at the small, rural college, though authorities haven't said if he turned a gun on himself or was shot by police.Hanlin said he expects the medical examiner's office to officially identify the shooter. Often, after a mass shooting, victims' advocates urge the media to avoid using the gunman's name, photo and manifestos. These groups, like Hanlin, argue that shooters crave this very attention and that the media coverage could encourage other individuals to carry out attacks. Friday's press conference also noted that 14 guns have been linked to the shooter. Celinez Nunez, an assistant special agent-in-charge with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said that investigators recovered six guns at the scene of the shooting, seven in the shooter's home and one that had been traded in to a gun dealer.The press conference didn't resolve questions about the shooter's motives. Kortney Moore, an 18-year-old student, had told the local News-Review that the gunman asked students about their religious faith before he fired.Officials have stayed tight-lipped about Mercer, even as his former neighbors described him as reclusive and awkward to The New York Times. He had recently moved to nearby Winchester, Oregon, from Torrance, California.Media coverage of the Umpqua shooting has also revealed that in 2013, shortly after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, Hanlin wrote a letter to Vice President Joe Biden opposing new gun control laws. On Friday, the sheriff deflected a question about his views on firearms. ""Like I've said numerous times already this morning,"" Hanlin answered, ""my focus is on getting this investigation completed and taking care of the victims and the families of victims.""This article has been updated with revised casualty figures for Thursday's shooting."

The suit alleges that the Kenton County Sheriff's Office violated the constitutional rights of the children who were handcuffed, as well as their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act.In a statement of interest on Friday, Justice Department lawyers said the court needs to decide whether ""handcuffing two elementary school children with disabilities, behind their backs and around their biceps, for failure to follow instructions"" was ""objectively reasonable.""While the statement does not take a position on the merits of the particular case, it notes that the ""significant size discrepancy"" between the officer, ""a fully grown man,"" and a ""52-pound third-grade boy"" and ""56-pound fourth-grade girl"" weighed against an ""objective reasonableness"" finding. The Justice Department also urged the court to consider whether the officer's decision to handcuff little kids was ""punitive, rather than necessary to ensure safety."" It pointed out that the officer had told the child ""to behave the way you’re supposed to or you suffer the consequences,"" a statement that indicated the handcuffing was punitive.The department also said that an ""improperly implemented [school resource officer] program can unnecessarily exacerbate the school-to-prison pipeline and cause significant harm to students.""School resource officers, DOJ lawyers wrote, ""must respect the constitutional and statutory rights of the citizens they serve. This is particularly critical in the school context, where the impact of a police interaction on a child can last a lifetime.""DOJ encouraged the court to ""consider whether an objectively reasonable SRO would have handcuffed elementary school students in school under the circumstances presented here, after the children exhibited misbehavior arising out of their disabilities. Further, the Court must apply the ADA and evaluate whether Defendant Sumner should have reasonably modified his policing procedure instead of handcuffing the children, and whether the Sheriff’s Office’s handcuffing policies and methods of administration discriminate against children with disabilities."""

In other moments, she spoke as an angry American, demanding to know what it will take for Congress to do something, anything, about gun violence.""I just don't understand, what is it so hard for them to do?

I just don't understand anymore,"" Eaddy said through tears.Jonathan's killer was able to obtain a gun because of the so-called gun show loophole -- something the Senate tried to address in 2013 but ultimately failed to get the votes to do. Congress has done nothing since.""You know, I had all confidence in America and Congress. I've always been a law-abiding citizen and everything. Now that I'm looking at the way this is happening, it's making me lose faith,"" Eaddy said. ""I'm just getting really, really aggravated. Just tired. Just weary. And hopeless.

14,SPORTS,9 Reasons Why The Dodgers Will Definitely Win The World Series,Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dodgers-world-series-nine-reasons-cmon-kershaw_us_560c1d66e4b0768127003364,Do you believe in Magic?,2015-10-02,Dodger pitching greats Sandy Koufax (left) and Don Drysdale in October 1965.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s been 27 years since Los Angeles has seen its Boys in Blue take part in baseball’s biggest spectacle, the Fall Classic.Marred by mismanagement  and kicked down (repeatedly) by the Cardinals, the Dodgers have been stuck in a state that has fluctuated between disappointment and mediocrity for nearly three decades. Remember when Kirk Gibson reached across home plate and sent a two-out pitch into the grandstands, limping around the bases to the tune of a 1-0 World Series lead? Yeah, that was during the Reagan administration.While the Dodgers won the title in 1988 thanks in large part to Gibson’s heroics, it’s been a slow ride to get back to baseball’s center stage. But this year is different! This will be the year that Los Angeles won’t get derailed by St. Louis or by its own star pitcher, by San Francisco or by its own dearth of power hitting. The ball club’s fans believe -- nay, know! -- that this is the year that they will see the blur of Dodger Blue in the outfield and on the diamond come late October once more. And we have nine reasons why. 1. They have the best pitcher of the last five seasons on their team.Clayton Kershaw was selfish last year -- he wasn’t satisfied with simply winning his third Cy Young Award, but had to grab the National League’s MVP trophy, as well. He went 21-3 on the mound in the regular season, becoming the first player ever to notch four-straight ERA titles, giving up only 1.77 runs per nine innings pitched. His 2014 campaign landed him smack dab in the center of the greatest-hurler-in-history debate, somehow finishing the year with a higher on-base percentage than the batters he faced.And after an un-Kershaw-like beginning to the 2015 season, the reigning MVP is back to form. As of Sept. 30, Kershaw’s ERA is sitting pretty at 2.16, his third best ever, the third best in the majors right now and a vast improvement from the 4.26 mark he posted through his first 44 1/3 innings pitched this year. 2. And they have this season's best pitcher in their dugout, too.Incredibly, Kershaw hasn’t even been the Dodgers’ most reliable pitcher this summer. That title goes to 31-year-old Zack Greinke, who has amassed an 18-3 record in 2015 despite the Dodgers’ sporadic struggles putting runs on the board. Moreover, Greinke’s 1.68 ERA is one of the 10 best since 1920.While Kershaw put together a run of 37 consecutive innings pitched without giving up a run, Greinke eclipsed that mark, holding opponents scoreless for 45 2/3 straight innings. And on it went, with two of the best pitchers in recent memory doing record-breaking things one night after the other.So imagine facing that two-man punch in the NL Division Series, when teams have to win only three games to advance. Or imagine having to go up against each of them multiple times in the longer seven-game affairs that make up the League Championship Series and the World Series. Kershaw has gone 11-1 in his last 15 starts, while Greinke has gone 12-1 in the same span of time. As the Dodgers are likely to earn the W whenever either of their two aces has the ball in his hand, opposing teams face an uphill battle whenever they stare down the pitching mound.3. Their bet on rookie Joc Pederson has paid enormous dividends.The Dodgers brass did anything but play it safe last winter. With an abundance of skilled outfielders on their hands -- Carl Crawford, Andre Ethier, Yasiel Puig, Matt Kemp and an untested Joc Pederson, to name a few -- Los Angeles decided to gamble, effectively dealing former MVP runner-up Kemp to the Padres in order to give rookie Pederson room to develop his promising power swing.Months later, Pederson trails only fellow All-Star Adrian Gonzalez in Dodger home runs hit on the year, tallying 25 thus far (despite recent struggles at the plate). In July, he competed in the Home Run Derby during the MLB's All-Star festivities -- and did a hell of a job against the league's best bats. He cruised through the first two rounds, and lost by just one in the finals, to home crowd favorite Todd Frazier.  4. The other fresh faces in the dugout have lit up Dodger Stadium, too.On it goes: As of the beginning of October, Howie Kendrick, whom the Dodgers acquired in a deal with Anaheim, is boasting the second best batting average on the team (out of players who have competed in over 80 games). Jimmy Rollins made the move out west from Philadelphia, and is now second -- again behind Gonzalez -- in runs scored. Corey Seager, a rookie shortstop, came into the Sept. 29 game against San Francisco having gotten on base in each of his 20 starts, totaling a .342 batting percentage, three home runs and 14 RBIS in just the 22 contests he had played up to that point, per the Los Angeles Times.In the many close games the ball club has sweated out this year, the bats of these newly knighted Dodgers have come up huge. This -- in theory -- should continue into postseason play.5. A-Gon is still A-Gon, year after year.Adrian Gonzalez is a gem. He's knocked in 100+ RBIs seven different times in his 12-year career. He's hit 30+ home runs in a total of four seasons, and he'll come close to doing the same again this year. It took him only half a week of the 2015 season to break a major league record, punching in five home runs in just the first three games of the year. Gonzalez has shirked the spotlight for years, but if there's anyone Dodger fans want in the lineup when it really counts, it's No. 23: The first baseman with the golden swing and the (four) Gold Gloves.6. Yasiel Puig is trying to tone down his showmanship.One bat flip at a time. In April, Puig stated that he “want[ed] to show American baseball” that he isn’t “disrespecting the game” by limiting how often he unleashes his trademark bat flip following big hits. Sometimes, though, he just can’t help it .7. This year is the 50th anniversary of another Dodgers title.Exactly half a century ago, LA snatched the World Series from the Minnesota Twins in a seven-game thriller. If the expression is correct and history really does repeat itself, surely this anniversary means good things are coming for the Dodgers in October this year??8. They have Magic on their side.Spoiler alert: Magic exists. And, as a part-owner of the team, he is unabashedly rooting for Dodger Blue to go all the way.If worse comes to worst for the Dodgers, they can just have Magic Johnson play every position down the stretch as he did in a certain other Los Angeles team’s championship-clinching contest a few decades ago. 9. Kershaw's postseason woes have to end at some point ... right?   He's the best pitcher in the game. So there's no way that he'll break down in the playoffs for the third year in a row. Right?  Right!?!?After drawing the loss in the Dodgers' elimination game against St. Louis in 2013, Kershaw blooped and bled against the Cardinals in 2014. In the two NLDS games he started last season, he pitched nearly immaculate games until the seventh innings. Then, like clockwork, he fell apart. His fastballs had no zing, his curveballs had no drop. While St. Louis hit only .079 against Kershaw through the games' sixth innings, the Cardinals connected 81.8 percent of the time in the seventh, going 9-of-11 over both contests.He has undeniably, unequivocally, unimaginably fallen apart the past two years as soon as the calendar has shifted to October. So he can't possibly do that again this year. Or at least, Dodgers fans hope he can't. Also on HuffPost:"

Mercer, 26, was a student in the class where the killings occurred, CNN reported Friday. Williams said authorities have uncovered ""documents that expressed the philosophy of hate."" At an evening news conference on Thursday, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin refused to confirm the name of the shooter. ""I will not name the shooter,"" Hanlin told reporters. ""I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act."" Hanlin said an official identity will come from the medical examiner's office.Meanwhile, authorities taped off a Winchester, Oregon, apartment complex that was listed as Mercer's address. Bronte Hart, 21, told HuffPost Mercer may have lived above her unit. ""I don't want to believe there's a guy like that living here. I have kids,"" said Hart. ""I think he lives above me. The guy lives here. It's so messed up.""She said she began to cry when police started taping off the complex, assuming the shooter lived alongside her.At 7 p.m., law enforcement officers with K-9 units began searching cars in the cordoned off parking lot. Mercer's father, Ian Mercer, addressed reporters late Thursday.""It's been a devastating day, devastating for me and my family,"" he said. ""Shocked is all I can say.""Before moving to Oregon, Mercer lived with his mother in Torrance, California, old neighbors told HuffPost. They described a reserved young man who did not appear dangerous. Brian Clay, who lived across the pool from their apartment, said the Mercers lived there for about a year, and moved away around 2011. Mercer's mother seemed ""happy to move,"" Clay said, although he did not know the reason they left. ""Chris was kind of reserved, kept to himself mostly,"" Clay said. ""Sometimes I would see his mom come out and complain about kids playing outside.""Clay described a routined man who did not appear dangerous. ""The way Chris carried himself was like ex-military almost -- combat boots, camo pants, white shirt, brown shirt. Every day it was the same thing. ""He never showed guns or talked about guns,"" Clay said. ""[There was] no fear of him when he was here. He was just our neighbor."" Another neighbor, Derrick McClendon, said he was shocked to learn of Mercer's alleged involvement in Thursday's shooting.McClendon described the Mercers has having ""kept to themselves."" ""I didn't speculate any danger with them,"" he said. ""We are all shocked around here, comes definitely as a surprise. I'm still in disbelief. I did not pick up that kind of behavior from him to just pick up and kill somebody.""Chris told me he was over 20 years old when we talked, but his mindset was like a teenager -- no girlfriend no friends. That was the only thing that was a concern to me, but that's his business,"" McClendon said.Unconfirmed social media accounts tell a different story. Profiles of Mercer contain photos of the Irish Republican Army, a revolutionary group that has historically been rooted in acts of violence.Police shot the gunman to death on Thursday morning after he entered an English classroom and opened fire, then moved to Snyder Hall, killing 10 and wounding nine more.An unidentified law enforcement official told CNN that three pistols and a rifle were recovered at the scene, and appear to have belonged to the gunman. It's unclear if the guns were obtained legally.A comment on the web bulletin board 4chan warned of a school shooting in the Northwest on Wednesday, but authorities appear to be unconvinced that the message portended the attack.“I was in the classroom right next door to the shooter, and I … heard a popping noise, almost like a balloon popping,"" student Cassandra Walker told CNN in an interview Thursday afternoon. ""We got underneath the tables, one of my fellow classmates went to see what was going on … and the gunman shot her. We locked the doors, turned off the lights, and were pretty much in panic mode. We called 911 and called our loved ones.""Walker estimated Mercer fired 35 to 40 shots. President Barack Obama offered his thoughts and prayers to the families affected by the shooting and pushed for ""common sense"" gun laws.""We don’t yet know why this individual did what he did,"" Obama told reporters. ""It’s fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds, regardless of what they think their motivations might be."" ""But we are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people,"" the president added. ""We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.”This is the 45th shooting at a school so far in 2015.This article has been updated to note that the gunman was enrolled in a class where the killings occurred, and to revise casualty figures.Matt Ferner and Andy Campbell also contributed to this report.

Mercer, 26, was a student in the class where the killings occurred, CNN reported Friday. Williams said authorities have uncovered ""documents that expressed the philosophy of hate."" At an evening news conference on Thursday, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin refused to confirm the name of the shooter. ""I will not name the shooter,"" Hanlin told reporters. ""I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act."" Hanlin said an official identity will come from the medical examiner's office.Meanwhile, authorities taped off a Winchester, Oregon, apartment complex that was listed as Mercer's address. Bronte Hart, 21, told HuffPost Mercer may have lived above her unit. ""I don't want to believe there's a guy like that living here. I have kids,"" said Hart. ""I think he lives above me. The guy lives here. It's so messed up.""She said she began to cry when police started taping off the complex, assuming the shooter lived alongside her.At 7 p.m., law enforcement officers with K-9 units began searching cars in the cordoned off parking lot. Mercer's father, Ian Mercer, addressed reporters late Thursday.""It's been a devastating day, devastating for me and my family,"" he said. ""Shocked is all I can say.""Before moving to Oregon, Mercer lived with his mother in Torrance, California, old neighbors told HuffPost. They described a reserved young man who did not appear dangerous. Brian Clay, who lived across the pool from their apartment, said the Mercers lived there for about a year, and moved away around 2011. Mercer's mother seemed ""happy to move,"" Clay said, although he did not know the reason they left. ""Chris was kind of reserved, kept to himself mostly,"" Clay said. ""Sometimes I would see his mom come out and complain about kids playing outside.""Clay described a routined man who did not appear dangerous. ""The way Chris carried himself was like ex-military almost -- combat boots, camo pants, white shirt, brown shirt. Every day it was the same thing.

20,POLITICS,Treasury Department Narrows National Default Date To Nov. 5,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/treasury-moves-up-deadline-for-national-default_us_560da07ae4b0768127015a15,"""Without sufficient cash, it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations for the first time in our history.""",2015-10-01,"Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew told Congress in a letter on Thursday ""to take action as soon as possible and raise the debt limit.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560da3301700002c005c6308.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department on Thursday narrowed the date of a potential national default to Nov. 5.Earlier estimates for when the nation will hit its legal borrowing limit had been broader. Many lawmakers on Capitol Hill -- who must raise the limit -- had suggested in recent days that it would be closer to Thanksgiving.The new outlook dramatically raises the pressure on Congress to act. The current borrowing cap stands at $18.1 trillion, and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew had previously warned that the country was already technically at the limit. He had been using certain ""extraordinary measures"" to keep paying the bills for months.In a letter to Congress, Lew warned that on or about Nov. 5, the cash on hand in the department's accounts would be down to about $30 billion -- when daily expenses are often around twice that.""Without sufficient cash, it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations for the first time in our history,"" Lew wrote.He also noted that his estimate was not set in stone, and the country could default even earlier than that. Congress has flirted with defaulting on the debt twice in recent years. The U.S. was placed on credit watches in 2013 and its credit rating was actually downgraded in 2011, largely because many Republican lawmakers wanted to use the limit as leverage to cut spending.The cap does not, however, do anything to curtail spending. It merely sets how much the Treasury Department can borrow under law to pay the bills that Congress has already racked up through the legislation it passes. Some in the GOP have argued that rather than raise the borrowing cap, the Treasury Department should pick and chose which bills to pay, and favor paying back the debt and interest on bonds held by foreign and domestic creditors before other items, except Social Security. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) recently advanced a bill in his Ways and Means Committee that would do just that.But Lew and others have repeatedly warned that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to do this. And, in any case, there would still be obligations the government could not meet.Democrats have repeatedly criticized the GOP's approach to the debt, saying a bill such as Ryan's would only encourage right-wing lawmakers to flirt with disaster.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Lew's warning should prompt Republican lawmakers to reconsider, and raise the ceiling soon.“The credit rating of the United States is not a hostage to serve Republicans’ toxic special interest ideology,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""Yet time and again, the crisis-addicted Republican majority has threatened to shatter the foundation of our economy to advance their destructive partisan agenda.""“The House Republican majority is now on the clock, and there is no time to waste,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). ""The full faith and credit of America is hanging in the balance.""Here is Lew's full letter:I am writing to follow up on my previous letters regarding the debt limit and to provide additional information regarding the Department of the Treasury's ability to continue to finance the government."
