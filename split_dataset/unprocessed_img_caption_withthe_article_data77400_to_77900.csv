Whether or not he had a weapon is unclear from the video.The Wilmington Police Department said that at 3 p.m. Wednesday their officers were dispatched to a parking lot to respond to a 911 call because a man was reportedly suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and was still armed. The man was later identified by police as Jeremy McDole.Police said that they observed McDole holding a revolver-style handgun and repeatedly ordered him to drop his weapon.""He's over here!"" an officer shouts in the video, uploaded to YouTube this week. ""Show me your hands!"" After that, a single gunshot rings out.""Show me your hands! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun!"" the officer continues.Quickly, several other officers rush to the scene in the video. ""Hands up! Hands up! Put your hands up!"" one officer shouts.McDole is seen adjusting his body and lifting himself slightly from his wheelchair before sitting back down. He briefly rubs his legs and adjusts his pants and then lifts his upper body up from his wheelchair once more. As his hands appear to move toward his waist, officers immediately open fire.Wilmington police Chief Bobby Cummings said McDole's movements indicated he was about to ""remove the weapon from his waist.""At least 10 gunshots are heard in the video, as McDole lifts his leg momentarily, slumps and falls out of his wheelchair to the ground. It's unclear in the video if McDole is reaching for a weapon -- no gun is visible -- and his family disputes that he was armed. Police say they recovered a .38 caliber weapon at the scene, found at McDole's side.“This was murder,” McDole's mother, Phyllis, said before a Thursday police press conference about the shooting, Delaware's News Journal reported. “He shot my son like he was roadkill.”She's calling for a federal investigation into the incident. Delaware's NAACP chapter is also calling for an independent investigation.Wilmington Mayor Dennis Williams said that there will be a thorough investigation into the incident. ""We don't have anything to hide,"" Williams said. ""We are very open.""""I assure you that not one of those officers intended to take anyone's life that day,"" Cummings said at the press conference. ""They came out here because they wanted to help our community."" The four officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave, as is standard department policy.Cummings and Williams both apologized to the McDole family.The Wilmington police are aware of the cell phone video that appears to show the incident.""The video looks like it depicts our officers, but we have not authenticated the video at this time,"" Sgt. Andrea Janvier, with the Wilmington Police Department, told The Huffington Post. ""It does not show a complete incident.""WARNING: Graphic video"

Did the pope uncover some kind of double standard about which lives matter more to lawmakers?Preserving the death penalty is part of the GOP platform, and 76 percent of Republicans say the practice is morally acceptable, as opposed to 43 percent of Democrats, according to Gallup.In his speech, the pope urged lawmakers to recognize prisoners' humanity. ""I am convinced that this way is the best, since every life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes,"" he said.""Recently, my brother bishops here in the United States renewed their call for the abolition of the death penalty,"" he continued. ""Not only do I support them, but I also offer encouragement to all those who are convinced that a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation.""Watch a clip from Pope Francis' address below:"

""We don't want anarchy. And I don't think people here want anarchy.

10,ENTERTAINMENT,Tribes Of New York: Trump's War On 'Hedge Fund Guys' Has Deep Roots,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-hedge-fund-guys_us_5602a5c8e4b00310edf93edc,"Donald Trump is a ""cartoon character,"" one hedge fund manager said.",2015-09-24,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that ""hedge fund guys are getting away with murder,"" but they aren't too fond of him, either.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586483f91500002c009163ce.jpeg?cache=VzPOOoQv9Q&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump doesn’t like a lot of people -- losers, Mexican immigrants and hedge fund managers.With his unique blend of populism and a willful lack of self-reflection, the Republican presidential hopeful says hedge fund managers are just lucky financial speculators whose taxes should be raised because they add little real value to the economy. “The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder,” he said on Aug. 23.Trump has pledged to do away with the carried interest tax loophole, which allows wealthy fund managers to avoid billions of dollars in taxes by treating their income as capital gains rather than salaries.But hedge fund managers who spoke to The Huffington Post don’t seem to be holding back their support for Trump because his tax policy would cost them. It’s his personality, and the rest of his policies, that they can’t stand.“I don’t have anything against the guy,” a West Coast hedge fund manager told HuffPost on background, so he could speak candidly. “I think he’s a cartoon character.” He went on to call Trump ""a complete phony -- a made-up sitcom character. He could be on 'Modern Family.'""“The misogynist, racist, anti-environmentalist, and foreign policy and trade issues aside, he just isn't presidential,"" said a proprietary trader, also speaking on background. Trump's campaign, he said, is entirely about himself and not the American people. “The only thing I do like about him is that he wants to eliminate the carried interest loophole.”""I don't know anyone who is a Donald Trump supporter,” a Wall Street CEO told Politico’s Ben White.In substance, Trump isn’t wrong to point out that the carried interest tax loophole is unfair and bad public policy. New York University economics professor Paul Romer told HuffPost that it's a bad idea to use the tax code to reward behavior that society wants to encourage. It’s unclear if tax breaks are actually worth the lost revenue, he said, and often, tax breaks get expanded and exploited in perverse ways over time.Trump is less credible in singling out hedge fund managers’ tax breaks, though, because he’s personally benefited throughout his career from a variety of other tax incentives. Indeed, Cliff Asness, co-founder of AQR Capital Management, which has $136 billion in hedge fund and conventional assets, attacked Trump in a Sept. 22 column for not talking about ""how tricky tax arguments, and a fair amount of cronyism, have motivated so many big real-estate transactions."" Real estate developers like Trump may argue that, unlike hedge fund managers, they conduct activity that has some social value.""I’m not sure that people outside of the real estate business would necessarily agree with that,"" said Romer.Trump’s own career has been made by a series of debt-fueled, tax-break enabled speculative bets on cyclically volatile assets, and he's filed for bankruptcy four times. But he would probably argue that he built things with his tax breaks, while hedge fund managers -- ""a lot of them,"" he said -- ""it's like they're paper pushers.""Like a lot of Trump's opinions, that’s a characterization rooted in resentment that the proper distribution of economic entitlement has been upended. To Trump, it is the vigorous, victorious businessman (and in his mind, it's always a man) who erects the city and deserves the tax breaks he gets, while the nebbish, desk-bound investor in financial assets destroys the American middle class. While Trump believes he got his tax breaks through hard work -- The New York Times’ Josh Barro documents him cajoling public officials into granting “tax abatements and zoning variances” one building at a time -- he thinks investors enjoy a too-easy, blanket exemption. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.“Hedge funds are an easy target,” and always have been, said Mitch Ackles, CEO of Hedge Fund PR. That’s largely because most people lump hedge funds in with big banks and other financial institutions.“The term ‘hedge fund guys’ is kind of an empty vessel. I’m not quite sure what he means by it. I just sort of take that as ‘generic rich guy from New York,’ which is what I think its meaning is, really,” said Ryan Ellis, tax policy director at Americans for Tax Reform.Hedge funds aren’t even the businesses that use carried interest the most -- that's private equity firms. For now, the private equity world is waiting for Trump to actually release a tax plan before reacting. “We look forward to reviewing Mr. Trump’s tax plan,” said James Maloney of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council.Politically, Ellis said both Trump and his GOP rival Jeb Bush -- who also supports ending the carried interest tax loophole -- are “doing something that isn’t very intelligent: they’re taking a tactical call of the Democrats, who have a very different policy objective than what they have, and they’re adopting it as their own, which is kind of silly if you’re in a shooting war.”As a policy matter, Ellis argued that the fees investment managers receive are indisputably capital gains, and says treating them like regular income is “not serious tax policy.”Culturally and socially, Trump has been isolated from, and by, the elite circles his wealth should qualify him to be a part of. “Trump has never really been part of the New York City business community or particularly engaged with the real estate community,"" Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, told Politico. ""There’s certainly no close set of relations there. He’s really a lone wolf.""“I think he’s a little bit at risk here,” Romer said of Trump’s carried interest proposal. The point of taxing capital gains at a lower rate, he explained, is to spur entreprenuership and investment in new businesses, and “once people start to look carefully at what real estate developers do compared to what Steve Jobs does, people may say, 'Wait we wanted it more like Steve Jobs. We didn’t want more Trump Towers.’""That risk assumes Trump has a sense of shame or a propensity for self-criticism that he has never demonstrated. But Trump has always presented himself as a businessman beyond criticism -- energetic, ""a winner,"" to use his vocabulary. It's an image he's successfully created and maintained for decades.Trump's disdain for hedge fund managers may be part of his populist plutocrat posturing, but his tax policy is not that radical anymore.There is an increasing consensus on his specific point about ending the carried interest loophole. Bush belatedly announced he agreed with Trump two weeks ago, and Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama have both been in favor of ending it since 2007. Romer noted that this mood strikes American politics periodically, as it did under President Ronald Reagan, when Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986. “It could be that what’s emerging is a consensus from various parts of the political spectrum ... that the complexity and special treatment and special favors have just gotten to be too much,” he said.Also on HuffPost:"

But she’s different from most: The African-American woman will get to meet him, along with six children from the New York Catholic school where she leads a student body that is 91 percent black and 27 percent Catholic.“To have the opportunity to meet with the pope,” the cradle Catholic said, “and to show him that black Catholics, we’re a very vibrant, active part of the church, we carry out the same mission that he has in store, to serve — it means a lot to me.”The principal of St. Charles Borromeo School and the students — three African-Americans, one African, one from Yemen and one biracial — intend to share their arts and crafts project on “gifts of our Earth” with the pope. The five Catholics and one Muslim will join her in telling the pope what they’ve learned about land, air and water when he visits another Catholic school in Harlem, Our Lady Queen of Angels School, on Friday (Sept. 25).Experts say black Catholics have been a stable 3 percent of U.S. Catholic membership for decades. But in the three archdioceses the pontiff will visit, the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate reports higher percentages: 12.5 percent in Washington, 7.4 percent in New York and 5.1 percent in Philadelphia.“Black Catholics are more engaged in their faith,” said Deacon Bill Bradley, director of the Philadelphia Archdiocese’s Office for Black Catholics. “They’re not just there to pass through and say, ‘My 45 minutes is up and I did my duty.’”The 2011 National Black Catholic Survey found that they are more likely to attend church weekly, participate in Bible studies and traditional Catholic devotions and be satisfied with their parish than white Catholics.Black Catholics also will be involved with activities related to the pope’s visit in all three U.S. metropolitan areas.In Philadelphia, about 200 African-Americans from black Catholic parishes are scheduled to attend the World Meeting of Families that will feature Pope Francis. The Philadelphia Catholic Mass Choir, with more than 115 black Catholic singers, will be reconstituted for a revival that will kick off the meeting. And members of the Knights of Peter Claver and its Ladies Auxiliary, the largest black Catholic organization in the U.S., have planned a Mass on the night before the pope arrives in the city.Black Catholics worshipped in the 1700s in the earliest Catholic churches in Philadelphia, though they were not fully welcomed and met in separate rooms and at separate times until they had their own churches, Bradley said. Now, predominantly black Catholic churches have dropped from 23 to 16 as the archdiocese closed many urban congregations, and black Catholics often worship in multiracial parishes. More white parishioners also have joined the predominantly black congregations.Ann Batiste, a 40-year member of predominantly black St. Teresa of Avila Church in Washington, hoped for a glimpse of Pope Francis while he is in the nation’s capital.“I personally am very much in tune with this particular pope,” said Batiste, 74, whose family’s connections to her parish date to the 1800s. “Francis is a progressive and many black Catholics think very highly of him.”Like other black Catholics, she appreciates the range of opportunities to worship — whether in a black cultural setting with gospel music, drums and dance, or not.“I am a Catholic and I will go to Mass anywhere, whether it’s culturally based or culturally laced or not,” she said. “But I most enjoy being at my church and any other church that has that same kind of Mass.”Also on HuffPost:"
