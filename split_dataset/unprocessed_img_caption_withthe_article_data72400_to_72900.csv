In October, the Interactive Advertising Bureau, the industry's largest trade group, announced an initiative to make ads more user-friendly. ""We messed up,"" wrote Scott Cunningham, senior vice president of technology and ad operations at the IAB, in a post last month announcing the LEAN initiative, which stands for ""light, encrypted, ad-choice-supported and non-invasive.""""As technologists, tasked with delivering content and services to users, we lost track of user experience,"" Cunningham wrote.One way of making ads less disruptive, Murdoch said, is to seamlessly include products and brands within a show rather than promote them explicitly during commercial breaks. He cited Pepsi's recent ad campaign in Fox's hit show, ""Empire,"" as an example. A number of upcoming ""Empire"" episodes will feature character Jamal Lyon filming a Pepsi commercial, which Murdoch says embeds advertising seamlessly into the content rather than disrupting it.“It’s a really exciting thing that came from a creative collaboration between creators of the show and the network, to bring Pepsi on board and put Pepsi into the show,” Murdoch said. “Obviously, it is a music show -- and remember the faces of Pepsi, from Michael Jackson to Britney Spears? Well, why wouldn’t it be Jamal Lyon?” Another topic Murdoch addressed on Thursday was the role that streaming services like Netflix and its rival, Hulu -- which 21st Century Fox owns a stake in -- will have in the future of content distribution.He said that if you give customers the option to pay extra for an ad-free experience, they tend to complain less about ads because they are given a choice. He said this is why Hulu offers its regular subscriptions at $7.99 a month, while customers can now select an ad-free subscription for an additional $4 a month. Murdoch also humorously objected to the term ""binge-watching"" to describe the act of watching Netflix or Hulu for an extended period of time. ""I prefer calling it 'marathons,'"" he said. ""That way, you’ve accomplished something at the end. Whereas, a binge is something you feel guilty about -- I don’t think you should feel guilty about it.""Also on HuffPost: "

Perhaps they are familiar with the Socratic statement, from which the course takes its name, that ""the unexamined life is not worth living.” But familiarity with this single sentence doesn't tell you much about what Socrates had in mind. In any case, the course does not aim to develop a single, prescriptive view of the examined life. Instead, we want to show students that a great many works, from different times and places, and occupying different genres of writing, are expressions of self-examination.So our syllabus ranges over ancient texts such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and selections from the Hebrew Bible, to writings of Greek and Roman philosophers, to early modern political and social texts (Rousseau's “Discourse on the Origins of Inequality,” which begins with a shout out to the Delphic Oracle's command to “'know thyself”), to Jane Austen's novels, and many more. Along the way, we consider works of art and architecture as expressions of self-reflection. The Parthenon, for instance, can be investigated as 5th century B.C.E Athens' civic self-portrait. The manuscript illustration of early medieval Benedictine communities, likewise, can be seen as an exercise in spiritual meditation.Against this diverse history of self-reflection, we then ask students to reflect on what counts as self-examination in the current day and age through a series of assignments called ""Experiments in Self-Examination.” On one hand, the students are given opportunities to try out some of the practices we encounter through our reading. So, they have a chance to ""live like a Stoic"" for a week, through a program created at the University of Essex. Alternately, after studying renaissance self-portraits, we ask them to rethink selfies, and to create a more deliberate selfie. Finally, they have the opportunity to try out and report on a reflective practice current today, such as yoga or meditation, or even biometric analysis.In essence, we're trying to bridge the gap between something people do frequently and quite naturally -- self-examination is not idle, it is something we live, and live through every day -- and the tradition of more developed forms of self-reflection on offer in philosophy, literature, art, and other forms of human inquiry. Is “the examined life” the same as “the good life?”That's not at all a simple question. Socrates thinks so. Rousseau, at least in the “Discourse on Inequality,” has his doubts. How important is a developed self-understanding, a rich and engaged intellectual life, central to living well or happily?Our course focuses on the many ways human beings seek to understand themselves, their place in the cosmos, their relations to their fellow human beings, and themselves. In many cases, the pursuit of this self-understanding is closely connected to an attempt to say what the best life is for us.One reason for this is that you can't say how we should live unless you understand what we are. Conversely, asking how we should live is a pretty central part of a meaningful self-examination. But human beings seem to pursue self-understanding before they are sure that it will benefit them, and sometimes in spite of evidence that it won't. On one reading, Oedipus the King illustrates this very point. We want to be aware, it seems, even if it has no clear beneficial consequence. Even if it hurts.How do students change through the course?That's another hard question to answer, if only because I don't know them very well when we start. But from what I've observed, it seems that at least some students come away with three important lessons.First, they appreciate much more deeply the value of hoary, ancient texts that might previously have seemed inaccessible or formidable. Part of what they learn is about themselves -- that they can engage with and learn from these texts. At the same time they learn that these far off authors and texts are dealing with the very same concerns that confront them, questions of who they are, what has shaped their identities, what they do and should value, and which sorts of relationships to pursue, how to confront death. Second, (at least I hope), they appreciate their academic study in a new light, seeing that their college education holds personal and intellectual benefits far, far beyond the acquisition of a professional credential or training.Third, they are able to assess contemporary forms of self presentation and self-reflection more critically and independently. For example, our study of self-portraiture clearly opened students' eyes to just how much can be communicated in seemingly trivial details of visual self-representation. They have to rethink what they are saying about themselves, even accidentally, in their selfies.Why study “the examined life?”Look, I'm a true believer, so I think Socrates said it best: ""the unexamined life is not worth living."" That's not because there's some big payoff at the end of one's self-reflection. It's just because living as a reflective, self-aware, intellectually active person is an immeasurably valuable way of being in the world, even if it involves confusion, uncertainty, and the encounter with unpleasant realities.So I think it's important for everybody to ask these questions. As an educator, I think these questions are especially urgent because so much of what gets said about higher education calculates its value only in terms of career benefits, and these only in terms of salaries ... [Return on investment] is as poor a measure of educational value as Fitbit data is a measure of personal well being.The problem is that our students come to college steeped in this approach to their own education. And, since they're young and intelligent people, they are naturally drawn to big questions, but they don't always feel like they have permission to ask them. But if they don't, an enormous opportunity will be wasted. Many of my colleagues are delighted that the course is being taught, and have expressed interest in becoming part of the Examined Life team. But it's not for everyone, and that's fine.This interview has been edited for clarity."

3,POLITICS,Federal Student Aid Office Calls Failure A Success -- And Hands Out Big Bonuses,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-federal-student-aid-office_us_564cf60ae4b00b7997f91428,"House Republicans blasted the ""performance-based"" office for lousy work.",2015-11-19,"Rep. Virginia Fox (R-N.C.) speaks to the media following the House Republican Conference meeting in the Capitol on Wednesday, Nov. 28, 2012. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564d5dc81600002d0026dbb8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 1998, the Republican-led Congress and President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration decided to give the U.S. Department of Education's financial aid office more freedom to run the student loan program in exchange for it committing to measurable goals.It may have been a huge mistake.That's the takeaway from a congressional hearing Wednesday that featured blistering criticism from government watchdogs, House Republicans and higher education experts directed at the Office of Federal Student Aid and its chief, James Runcie, for what they described as sloppy oversight of loan contractors and for-profit colleges, inconsistent and poor communication to schools, and an agency culture that chafes at criticism and oversight and seemingly rewards failure.Late payments on student loans have risen in recent years despite generous repayment options, lower joblessness, higher wages and an improving U.S. economy. Federal regulators have found evidence that some of the Federal Student Aid office's loan contractors have misled borrowers. State attorneys general and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have sued FSA-overseen schools for allegedly swindling students, conduct that FSA missed or ignored for years.""It is clear that FSA can not administer this program,"" said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.). She told Runcie: ""You are harming the people you are supposed to be helping, and that has to stop.""Meanwhile, FSA senior officials continue to give themselves rich salaries and bonuses as the agency in its own reckoning continues to exceed its performance goals. The top bonus last year was $75,000, a 96 percent increase from three years earlier. More than 100 of FSA's roughly 1,300 employees in the 2014 fiscal year had salaries above $150,000, according to an online database maintained by the Asbury Park Press. The typical FSA employee is paid more than $100,000 a year, about 33 percent more than the typical federal employee, according to separate data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.""I am concerned about the culture being fostered at FSA,"" said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.). Justin Draeger, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, said the agency needs ""cultural changes."" Outgoing Education Secretary Arne Duncan appointed Runcie to lead FSA.FSA was the federal government's first ""performance-based organization,"" a concept championed by former Vice President Al Gore as a way to bring private sector expertise and management practices into government. The office was given wide latitude in contracting and personnel practices so long as it set quantifiable goals and committed to improving on them every year.Congress designated the office as a performance-based organization to improve its customer service, reduce costs, and increase accountability. The move was a rebuke to the Education Department's management of the student loan program.The problem, experts say, is that FSA largely sets its own goals and defines success without considering the views of others.Take how it judges progress toward reducing distress among student debtors. Last year, in its annual report to Congress, FSA said 8.1 percent of borrowers were at least 90 days late on their student loans. This year, it was 9.8 percent. But FSA changed how it calculated the delinquency metric, and revised up the 2014 figure to 9.9 percent, allowing it to claim success this year. FSA said the new metric was a ""better measure.""""The problem with self-assessment is even when the department fails they deem it a success,"" Draeger said.Former senior Education Department officials have complained about an inability to get basic information out of FSA. Current officials at various federal agencies have said that they have had difficulty getting data on the performance of federal student loans. FSA doesn't make public the number of borrowers who annually default on federal student loans. Americans with federal student loans who have complained about various issues to the FSA office tasked with advocating for them would probably concur. Debtors gave the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman, an office Congress created to assist borrowers, abysmal ratings in a customer satisfaction survey in the last fiscal year, according to the agency's annual report.Borrowers gave the ombudsman group a score of 41 out of 100 on the American Customer Satisfaction Index, a widely used gauge that measures customers' satisfaction.FSA encourages its loan contractors to maintain scores in the low 80s. The national average across all economic sectors is 76.The ombudsman group explained away its atrocious customer satisfaction score in its annual report to Congress by arguing that the survey data suggests that borrowers are rating the ombudsman not on the quality of service, but on the outcome of their case.The ombudsman tried to present a better picture of its horrendous customer satisfaction score by removing its zero ratings from borrowers. That only raised its score to 63. All of FSA’s loan contractors received higher ratings from borrowers this past year.Before Congress on Wednesday, Runcie defended his organization by citing data showing that the agency has reduced waste, cut costs, and reduced the time needed to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA.Congressional Democrats praised the agency for ensuring that students have their loans and grants in time for the start of classes. They also noted that FSA has had to contend with a significant transformation of the federal student loan program from a bank-based system to one in which the government makes all new loans. And more students are taking out more loans and grants from the department, perhaps straining resources.Ben Miller, a former Education Department official who now is senior director for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, told Congress on Wednesday that FSA had done good work on loan delivery and easing the FAFSA-filing process for students. But he criticized the agency for poor oversight of for-profit colleges and loan contractors whose past performance requires ""significant scrutiny."" Oversight in higher education overall appears to be minimal. Meadows, the North Carolina Republican, acknowledged that Congress itself has failed to hold FSA accountable. The head of FSA has testified before Congress just three times since 2010, he said. ""We created this thing and then walked away,"" Meadows said."
4,SPORTS,What's Wrong With James Harden?,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-is-wrong-with-james-harden_us_564cbccce4b031745cef27ee,He needs to get back to doing what he does best.,2015-11-19,"While he's averaging a career-high 29 points per game, Houston's James Harden is shooting just 37 percent from the floor and 26 percent from 3.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564defc21600002e0026dc33.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When you're an elite NBA player, subpar play and losing aren't supposed to be par for the course. And earlier in James Harden's career, both of these things would have seemed inconceivable. The 26-year-old bearded genius has a history of being a scoring machine. He's fresh off the best season of his life, during which he averaged a stellar 27.4 points while earning first-team All-NBA honors for the second consecutive year. The Houston Rockets, led by Harden's dynamic play, won 56 regular season games en route to its first playoff series win since 2009. Although Harden suffered a wretched series against eventual champion Golden State in the conference finals, he was partially exonerated after totaling 45 points in a crucial Game 4 victory.Harden’s 2015 campaign, however, is off to a shockingly poor start. The Rockets fired head coach Kevin McHale, who, despite his often curious substitution patterns, gave his star combo man the keys to the entire offense. While the team has limped to a 5-7 start, Harden has endured perhaps the least efficient shooting stretch of his career, converting a putrid 37 percent from the floor and 26 percent from the 3-point line. To be perfectly clear, Harden's woeful shooting this year has nothing to do with his talent -- as I examined in 2012 -- but everything to do with his overzealousness to shoot 3-pointers and Dwight Howard's inability to command any attention from defenses in the half-court.Harden's ball-handling creativity has long stymied even the best of defenses, but what has gotten him in trouble is an outrageous 9.8 3-point attempts per game, nearly three more than his career high and second only to Golden State’s top sniper, Stephen Curry. The difference is that Curry has quickly become one of the game's all-time greats and Harden -- even at his best -- has never been a pure knockdown shooter. The tricky part is Harden's navigation of an offense that relies heavily on 3-pointers and very little on the mid-range game. For such a predatory scorer to be hoisting so many triples, Harden is legitimately bailing out defenses who no longer have to worry about his influx of driving forays to the basket. Sure, he's taking an average of 12 free throws per game, but he's requiring an all-time high in shot attempts to do so.The other component to Harden's struggles has been Howard's pitiful play. The $88 million center possesses little feel with his back to the basket -- hardly a surprise -- and his ineffectiveness on the low block has enabled teams to guard him straight up, without help. Realistically, Houston didn't sign Howard to be an isolation scorer, but he needs to be a threat, and he simply isn't one right now. Opposing defenses will downright abandon him if he’s not near the low block. The 29-year-old ranks just 36th in Player Efficiency Rating -- the overall rating of a player's per-minute statistical production -- while posting the lowest scoring clip (14 points) he's had since his rookie season. Moreover, Howard's career-low 4.4 free-throw attempts -- a stunning number for what we'd expect to be a physical presence in the paint -- show a general lack of assertiveness in the half-court.Remember, it wasn't that long ago that Howard was widely considered to be the premier center in the league. His inflated contract may say he's still that guy, but both the eye test and the numbers tell a different story. Furthermore, Howard's decreased offensive productivity has made Harden's life more challenging. The court shrinks because the lanes aren't as wide while the pick-and-roll game -- a longtime staple of Howard’s game -- loses its luster. At some point, you have to wonder if that has contributed to Harden's reliance on the 3-pointer.Harden will long remain one of the game's top-notch scorers -- he tossed in 45 points Wednesday night on 11-29 shooting and is averaging 29 points -- and a lethal late-game player. Last year, he ranked fourth in ""clutch"" scoring, according to 82games.com.What remains to be seen is whether he can make it through a noticeable shooting slump and change in attacking nature. And can he revert back to becoming a more efficient all-around offensive weapon alongside newly minted point guard Ty Lawson?It would behoove Harden to continue employing the pick-and-roll, but also to force defenses to make a decision aside from merely going under or over the screen. If Howard wants to suddenly show up and assert himself more in the half-court, that would be immensely helpful as well, but like the truly great combo guards before him -- think Jordan and Kobe -- sometimes you simply have to force the issue yourself.

The 29-year-old ranks just 36th in Player Efficiency Rating -- the overall rating of a player's per-minute statistical production -- while posting the lowest scoring clip (14 points) he's had since his rookie season. Moreover, Howard's career-low 4.4 free-throw attempts -- a stunning number for what we'd expect to be a physical presence in the paint -- show a general lack of assertiveness in the half-court.Remember, it wasn't that long ago that Howard was widely considered to be the premier center in the league. His inflated contract may say he's still that guy, but both the eye test and the numbers tell a different story. Furthermore, Howard's decreased offensive productivity has made Harden's life more challenging. The court shrinks because the lanes aren't as wide while the pick-and-roll game -- a longtime staple of Howard’s game -- loses its luster. At some point, you have to wonder if that has contributed to Harden's reliance on the 3-pointer.Harden will long remain one of the game's top-notch scorers -- he tossed in 45 points Wednesday night on 11-29 shooting and is averaging 29 points -- and a lethal late-game player. Last year, he ranked fourth in ""clutch"" scoring, according to 82games.com.What remains to be seen is whether he can make it through a noticeable shooting slump and change in attacking nature. And can he revert back to becoming a more efficient all-around offensive weapon alongside newly minted point guard Ty Lawson?It would behoove Harden to continue employing the pick-and-roll, but also to force defenses to make a decision aside from merely going under or over the screen. If Howard wants to suddenly show up and assert himself more in the half-court, that would be immensely helpful as well, but like the truly great combo guards before him -- think Jordan and Kobe -- sometimes you simply have to force the issue yourself.

What-if plots were a staple of ""The Twilight Zone"" and are pretty much the whole point of ""Doctor Who."" But in those two long-running series, each speculative scenario would be established, and concluded, in an episode or two. They were quick little thought experiments. In and out. Not so with the upcoming Hulu miniseries ""11/22/63,"" produced by J.J. Abrams and starring James Franco. Like Amazon's critically acclaimed ""The Man in the High Castle,"" which is set in a world where the Axis won World War II, the entire series is built around one big idea. Franco plays Jake Epping, a high school history teacher in present day who travels back to 1960 to prevent JFK's assassination.Hulu released the first teaser trailer for the series, which is based on a 2011 novel of the same name by Stephen King, today. It's above. Though brief, it quickly explains Epping's task and gives a few glimpses of Franco in ""Mad Men""-era garb.The staggeringly prolific Franco has been a fairly regular presence on TV in recent years, with guest spots on shows from ""30 Rock"" to ""General Hospital,"" but ""11/22/63"" will be his first starring TV role since ""Freaks and Geeks.""

Dianne Feinstein of California and Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona told reporters they plan to introduce a bill on Thursday that would limit the visa waiver program, which allows citizens and nationals of certain countries to enter the U.S. without a visa for 90 days or less. The bill would disallow anyone from those countries, many of them in Europe, from coming to the U.S. without a visa if they had been to Iraq or Syria within the past five years. Most of the Paris attackers were citizens of France or Belgium -- visa waiver-eligible countries. ""That's of much more concern, frankly, than refugee vetting,"" Flake said after exiting a closed-door briefing with Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson. Flake said to ""stay tuned"" on details. Feinstein said data chips in passports would allow authorities to detect who has been to Syria or Iraq.""Let's say France has had 2,000 people leave to go and fight,"" Feinstein told reporters. ""They're a visa waiver country, so people come back to France and then they come into the United States. So the bill we would propose would strictly limit that."" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said the briefing with Johnson was dominated by concerns over the visa waiver program, much more than the administration’s vetting of refugees.""It's clear that the biggest exposure to the U.S. doesn't come from highly vetted Syrian refugees. It comes from individuals who can come here with very little check through other existing immigration pathways,"" Murphy said. He added that administration officials in the meeting ""expressed an openness to changes that would tighten up the visa waiver program.""Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the Senate's third-ranking Republican, said he doesn't see the GOP moving on a legislative response until after the Thanksgiving break. He wouldn't say if he thought the House bill went in the right direction by putting further restrictions on admitting Syrian and Iraqi refugees. ""You know the House is going to do their thing on this,"" Thune said. ""This was important to have this briefing so everybody could get more information that I'm sure will shape some of the ways we look at the issue over here and how we might respond to it legislatively.""What that would look like, Thune said, won't be decided until Senate leaders take the ""temperature"" of members. Some Republicans said they were still interested in looking at the refugee resettlement process, and would support a ""pause"" to ensure it's safe. But the visa waiver program may be a bigger target. ""I think that what's emerging as a centrality of thought is that the visa waiver program potentially is the place where there's greater gaps, possibly, than the refugee program itself,"" Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told reporters. The bill to change the visa waiver program will be one of many introduced in the wake of the Paris attacks. Other Republicans are still pushing to block Syrian refugees entirely, although GOP presidential candidate and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has proposed continuing to admit Christians. Another Republican candidate, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, plans to introduce a bill to block new refugees from certain countries from taxpayer benefits. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), another 2016 contender, signed onto legislation that would extend a broad National Security Agency phone data-collection program in response to concerns that terrorists used encryption technology to carry out the Paris plot.Democrats have proposed other responses. Feinstein separately plans to introduce a bill that would ban members of terrorist organizations from buying or possessing guns, but she said it has no Republican co-sponsors.Also on HuffPost:"
9,POLITICS,FDA Approves Nasal-Spray Version Of Overdose Drug Naloxone,Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fda-naloxone-heroin-overdose_us_564dec69e4b031745cf008ec,Advocates have already been using the drug.,2015-11-19,Because Most Americans Are Unenthusiastic About It,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559de2b71700002600325e03.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it approved a nasal-spray version of naloxone, a drug that can reverse the effects of a heroin overdose. The new version will make it easier to administer and less intimidating than the previously approved injectable form. Commonly sold as Narcan, the drug has been widely viewed as an essential method of reducing overdose deaths that have spiked across the country in recent years.“Combating the opioid abuse epidemic is a top priority for the FDA,” said Stephen Ostroff, M.D., acting FDA commissioner, in a press release. “We cannot stand by while Americans are dying. While naloxone will not solve the underlying problems of the opioid epidemic, we are speeding to review new formulations that will ultimately save lives that might otherwise be lost to drug addiction and overdose.” Advocates fighting the epidemic had already seen the value of a nasal-spray model and had been using them, even without FDA approval. For example, doctors operating a volunteer clinic in Kentucky had been handing out kits with a nasal applicator.“It’s nice that [the FDA] are catching up with this,” said Dr. Mina Kalfas, a doctor who has worked with the naloxone clinic.In June, a pharmacist in Boston offered a reporter working on a naloxone story a kit with the nasal spray. Tutorials for how to use the product can be found online.In its press release, the FDA acknowledged the issue: “There has been widespread use of unapproved naloxone kits that combine an injectable formulation of naloxone with an atomizer that can deliver naloxone nasally. Now, people have access to an FDA-approved product for which the drug and its delivery device have met the FDA’s high standards for safety, efficacy and quality.”Jason Merrick, board president of People Advocating Recovery, says the FDA-approved spray is an important step. The previous versions still had to be assembled, which might be difficult in an emergency.“It’s all in one contained unit,” he said. “It’s more practical. I hope and pray it will be more affordable.”Merrick said the cost of naloxone has skyrocketed along with demand. He had been paying $1 per kit just a couple of years ago. Now, those same kits are upward of $50, he said. Other versions are even more expensive.Robert Childs, executive director for the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition, says price has been an issue. Since August 2013, Childs says his organization has passed out 18,680 two-dose naloxone kits and had more than 1,350 confirmed overdose reversals. The group could have passed out triple the number of kits, he says, if they were more affordable.""The problem is the ability to buy it in bulk,"" he said. ""Ideally, naloxone would be incredibly cheap.""But Childs says the the new nasal-naloxone model could be a ""game changer for overall access."" It's being offered to public interest groups at a cheaper price ($37.50) than what is currently on the market. At a congressional hearing in April, Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas) wondered why the FDA hadn’t approved the medication for over-the-counter use.“Right now, it’s hard to get,” Burgess said. “If it were available at a 24-hour pharmacy, not saying it could save every life at risk, it could save some. The downside of having it available is what?”The hearing’s panelists of doctors and academics didn't reject Burgess’ idea. Dr. Marvin Seppala, the chief medical officer at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, said he’d support the move. “We should have over-the-counter naloxone,” he said. “It’s a very innocuous drug.”States such as Ohio and Kentucky have passed legislation that has cleared the way for pharmacies to sell the medication over the counter.Also on HuffPost:"

The plaintiffs are former Illinois residents.People who live in U.S. island territories don't have the right to vote in elections for president and Congress, even though those same residents serve in the military at high rates. “So long as you are a U.S. citizen, where you live shouldn’t have anything to do with whether your fundamental right to vote is protected,” veteran Anthony Bunten, a plaintiff in the lawsuit, told the Pacific Daily News.For more than a decade, islanders from U.S. territories as well as U.S.-affiliated Micronesian island nations have been joining the military at high rates and suffer a significantly higher percentage of casualties than any U.S. state. Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are overrepresented in the U.S. Army by 249 percent, compared with 43 percent of blacks, 44 percent of whites and 53 percent of American Indians/Alaskan Natives, according to a White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders fact sheet.Comedian John Oliver took on the voting rights issue in his March 8 episode of ""Last Week Tonight"" on HBO, saying, ""More than 4 million people live in U.S. territories, more than 98 percent of them are racial or ethnic minorities, and the more you look into the history of why their voting rights are restricted, the harder it is to justify.""Denying voting rights to residents of America's island territories stems from a series of Supreme Court decisions in the early 20th century. The decisions, as Oliver pointed out, found the territories were inhabited by ""alien races"" who may not understand Anglo-Saxon laws.""There are a lot of complicated issues surrounding what the precise status of all the U.S. territories should be and what the people who live there would prefer, but surely, when it comes to denying Americans the right to vote, we have to find a better reason than citing a 100-year-old legal decision written by a racist that was always supposed to be temporary,"" Oliver said.H/T Honolulu Civil BeatAlso on HuffPost:"
11,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Attacks Bernie Sanders’ Progressive Agenda,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-sanders-taxes_us_564bcbbfe4b06037734ba1bd,Why is she talking like a Republican?,2015-11-18,Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has attacked her main opponent's plan to pay for his domestic agenda.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564bcc271f00002500f3d081.jpeg?cache=8Qrn53BBtj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This is why Hillary Clinton makes so many progressives queasy.The former secretary of state and front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination has launched a new attack on her chief rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The subject is taxes and Sanders' apparent willingness to raise them, even on the middle class, to pay for his ambitious domestic agenda. Sanders has proposed a variety of new programs designed to help Americans pay for everything from child care to college tuition. Most famously, Sanders is also a longtime proponent of “single-payer” health insurance -- in other words, expanding Medicare so everybody, not just the elderly, could enroll in it. While Sanders has supported the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, he has described the legislation as merely a first step toward guaranteeing that every American has health insurance. He has said that creating a single-payer system, similar to the schemes that now operate in countries such as France and Taiwan, would achieve that goal. Such a large expansion of government programs would inevitably require raising trillions of dollars in new revenue. The health care plan alone would require something like $15 trillion over 10 years, according to estimates that have appeared in the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post.In the past, Sanders has proposed financing a single-payer scheme with a payroll tax that would affect everybody, including the middle class. On Monday, that possibility drew a sharp attack from Brian Fallon, Clinton’s chief campaign spokesman.“Bernie Sanders has called for a roughly 9-percent tax hike on middle-class families just to cover his health-care plan,” Fallon told Politico, “and simple math dictates he'll need to tax workers even more to pay for the rest of his at least $18-20 trillion agenda. If you are truly concerned about raising incomes for middle-class families, the last thing you should do is cut their take-home pay right off the bat by raising their taxes.”Fallon’s comments were neither offhand nor off-script. On the contrary, they were part of a rhetorical campaign that began during Saturday’s Democratic presidential debate, when Clinton stated that ""hard-working, middle class families need a raise, not a tax increase."" Shortly after the debate was over, Jennifer Granholm, the former Michigan governor who is a senior adviser to a pro-Clinton organization that coordinates with the official campaign, reinforced that argument with a tweet: Fallon on Tuesday piled on with more tweets, including this one:The question of who would pay for Sanders' agenda is certainly fair game. On the campaign trail, Sanders has stated that he could finance his new initiatives with taxes that would fall almost exclusively on the wealthy, not on the middle class -- a point that one of his senior strategists made again on Monday. Budget experts such as Austan Goolsbee, a University of Chicago economist and former Obama administration adviser, are extremely skeptical of such claims. As Goolsbee wrote in a recent blog post:Mind you, Sanders is not fiscally irresponsible the way the R tax plans are. He doesn't deny basic arithmetic and he has proposed ways of paying for what he wants to do. The point is that the magnitude of the spending will require a lot of revenue and it's not easy to get it without hitting the middle class.But when Clinton and her aides talk about the Sanders agenda, they always leave out some critical context. The proposals on health care, college tuition and the like would yield benefits that, in many cases, would flow to the middle class and offset the impact of those new taxes.In a single-payer health care system, for example, government insurance largely displaces private insurance, which means that taxes go up but premiums go down. For any individual, the effects would depend on a bunch of variables -- like how much that person pays now, the precise contours of the new taxes and whether employers pass along unspent premiums as higher wages. Ultimately some would pay more, but others would pay less. People who have private insurance now would have to give it up, but they'd get something like Medicare, which is both more secure and more popular than private insurance.A similar logic applies to the rest of Sanders’ agenda. If somehow his plans became law, working parents would have an easier time finding and paying for child care. Kids going to college wouldn’t struggle with crippling tuition bills. Would every middle class American feel better off? No. Would many? Yes. Clinton and her advisers, who know domestic policy as well as anybody in Washington, are well-aware of this.In short, the Clinton campaign has made a conscious decision here. It is not merely criticizing Sanders for suspicious math. It is suggesting the test for any proposed initiative is what taxes it imposes, regardless of what benefits it might bring. This is the kind of argument that conservatives make. It might or might not help Clinton win in November. It’s hard to see how it can help progressives win in the long run.Also on HuffPost:"

We have the ability to be a great team, but right now, we're not a very good team.”While Cleveland currently sits atop the East’s standings, it hasn’t won a game by double digits in two weeks, as it continues to tiptoe around lesser teams rather than sweep by them as it has done in the past. In James' view, the reason for this backslide is a lack of passion -- a complacency that is missing entirely from the reigning champs, the Warriors.""We haven't done anything,"" James said. ""We didn't win anything [last year]. We lost. We lost in the Finals. So that's enough motivation for myself … And the team that beat us looks more hungry than we are. So it shouldn't be that way."" ""You can't play down to the competition at this point, because we're not better than no one in the league,” he added. “We’re not entitled to win … and until we figure that out, we're going to continue to put ourselves in positions to lose basketball games.""Starting forward Tristan Thompson and head coach David Blatt each echoed James’ words on Tuesday, citing Cleveland’s need to step up its physical game.""Teams think they can beat up on us, and that's not acceptable,” Thompson said. “We got to play tougher and meaner … Anything short of that, we're wasting our time."" Blatt, for his part, said that the “toughness” the Cavs showed in their 2014-2015 campaign has been missing as of late. And he’s right. Detroit big men Andre Drummond and Ersan Ilyasova combined for 45 points on 16-of-25 shooting Tuesday, and Drummond alone grabbed nearly as many rebounds (18) as the Cavaliers’ entire front line (21). ""We're too relaxed and too nice,"" James summed up. ""We're just too nice.""For years, the main critique of James was indeed that he was too nice -- that he lacked the killer instinct that drove players like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. If this reared-up James is here to stay, verbal lashings and all, then the rest of the Eastern Conference better brace itself for a nightly fight whenever it takes on the King.Also on HuffPost: "

On Tuesday, Robert Ward, chief executive of the Massachusetts-based drugmaker Radius Health, said the company would delay submitting a new drug application to U.S. regulators so as not to rush employees during the holiday season. ""Part of our assessment was -- is this the time to ask everyone in our supply chain to work on an accelerated basis over a period of time when they all had personal plans?"" Ward said in an interview with Bloomberg. ""Or was it better for us to pick a timeline that was more respectful for what the overall work-life balance might be across our whole supply chain?""Investors didn't like the decision. Radius' stock took a dive on Tuesday. By Wednesday, it had inched back with a gain of more than 3 percent to $59.20 -- still below its Tuesday high of $65.29.It's becoming increasingly fashionable to consider workplace wellness, as more and more companies adopt wellness programs and forward-thinking policies about work-life balance. A cynical investor might suspect that Radius is just cloaking a hurdle in the drug's production by tapping into the zeitgeist. Plus, the drug in question -- Abaloparatide-SC, which treats the bone disease osteoporosis -- is Radius' first. Until it comes to market, the company has no revenue. Thus, the cynic might say, Radius has an extra incentive not to rush the process, because so much depends on this drug's rollout.""The cycle is typically linked to patient safety and reported outcomes of the drugs, or to the balance sheet and the capital that a company has,"" John Eade, president and senior analyst at the market research firm Argus, told The Huffington Post on Wednesday. ""That's the first time I've heard that particular rationale for a delay.""Radius did not respond to a request for comment. But in the end, the intention here may not matter. Radius has set a public precedent in an industry where competition for exclusivity can result in vicious races to rush drugs to market. Its move could clear the way for future companies to do the same. Besides, it will have a manifestly positive outcome. Employees at the fast-growing company -- Radius hired 30 more drug development researchers in the past year alone, according to its most recent quarterly earnings report -- will get to spend their holidays not working. ""When we think about the agency today we want a chance to dot every i and cross every t and take our time,"" Ward told Bloomberg. ""It’s the holistic element, right -- so it’s individuals in the company who just completed a huge milestone of submitting our [application] -- did we really want to ask them to skip Thanksgiving and Christmas this year?""Stress from work, particularly in an age when workers can be contacted almost any time by phone or email, is epidemic. According to the American Institute of Stress, 80 percent of workers feel stress on the job and nearly half say they need help learning how to manage stress. Plus, around the holidays, people's stress levels tend to rise, according to a 2006 study commissioned by the American Psychological Association. It shouldn't take a pharmaceutical researcher to realize that's not a healthy combination. "

A new report suggests that just might be a bad idea.That's because the best deals for this year aren't necessarily the best deals for 2016, according to a Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. In almost three-quarters of the counties across more than 30 states that use the federal HealthCare.gov system to apply, the lowest-price ""silver"" insurance plan is a different policy, and maybe even from a different insurer, than it was last year. For a 40-year-old, that could mean the difference between paying 15 percent more and 7 percent more next year, on average.The third year of health insurance enrollment on the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act began Nov. 1 and runs until Jan. 31, and there's been a lot of changes in the plans available and their premiums. Across the country, rates on these marketplaces are going up an average 7.5 percent compared to this year. Some insurers instituted huge increases, while others actually reduced their prices.The cheapest silver plan is different in 73 percent of counties in HealthCare.gov states than it was for the 2015 sign-up period. The Kaiser Family Foundation looked at these mid-level plans because they're the most popular compared to bronze, gold and platinum plans and the bare-bones ""catastrophic"" plans available to people under 30. Nationally, more than two-thirds of those who signed up for insurance through the federal exchanges or those run by states like California and Colorado selected silver plans during open enrollment for 2015.HealthCare.gov customers will be automatically renewed into their current plans -- if they are still available -- on Dec. 15, although they can change to other policies until the end of open enrollment.There's one big potential trade-off to bargain hunting, however. Consumers who give up their current policies and sign up for a new plan to spend less money may lose access to the doctors, hospitals and other medical providers or prescription drugs covered by their existing insurance plan. And price isn't the only factor to consider, because insurers structure deductibles and cost-sharing requirements for services and medicines differently.Health insurance marketplace customers faced a similar dynamic a year ago. Exchange officials and consumer groups urged policyholders to look for alternatives that saved money, and the campaign was partially successful: Slightly more than half of returning customers actively shopped for plans rather than allowing automatic re-enrollment to take effect, which was more than experts expected.This year, the stakes may be higher, and not just for the consumers themselves. Premiums are rising faster than they did last time around, leading to concerns that coverage won't be affordable. Exchange enrollment declined over the course of this year, and federal officials expect it to grow slowly during this sign-up period, so encouraging current enrollees to find plans at prices they can manage could be key to making these still-new marketplaces thrive.By automatically renewing or by actively keeping the same plan for next year, a 40-year-old would pay $304, on average, per month, not including any tax credits that reduce the cost, which is a 15 percent increase from this year's average price. But by switching to the lowest-cost silver plan for 2016, the cost would be $283 a month without subsidies, which is 7 percent higher than the price of the cheapest silver policy this year, according to the report.The Kaiser Family Foundation analysis uses a 40-year-old as an example, but premiums vary by age, so younger and older people would see different prices. Prices also are based on geographic location.And the actual cost varies a lot by income, because there are tax credit subsidies available to people who earn between the federal poverty level -- about $12,000 for a single person -- and four times that amount. The price subsidized enrollees pay is based on a percentage of their incomes and on the premium for the ""benchmark"" plan, which is the second-lowest-cost silver policy in their local markets. The value of the credit is smaller for those on the higher end of that income scale, who also must pay a larger share of their earnings on the insurance. Eighty-seven percent of those who signed up during the 2015 enrollment period received these tax credits. People with incomes below 250 percent of poverty also must choose a silver plan to qualify for extra subsidies that reduce their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs, which the majority of enrollees get.Also on HuffPost:"

They wouldn’t say if data on the phone was encrypted. Still, senators on Capitol Hill are moving forward with a review of encryption use, and are weighing whether to pursue legislation to weaken it.“Encryption is used by terrorists to communicate and we have no insight even with a court order,” Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said on Wednesday.Burr told The Huffington Post that the Intelligence Committee, which he chairs, plans to take a thorough look at encrypted data in the coming weeks.“The fact that we didn’t pick up any communications is probably a pretty good indication that it was used,” Burr said when asked if there was any evidence that the Paris attackers used encrypted channels to plan the deadly strikes.A day earlier, after the Intelligence Committee held a closed-door briefing on the attacks, Burr said terrorism suspects in Belgium, France and Syria likely used encryption.“It’s a wake-up call for America and our global partners that ... we need to begin the debate on what we do on encrypted networks, because it makes us blind to communications and to the actions of potential adversaries,” Burr said.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, joined Burr in arguing that encrypted technology limits the amount of “good intelligence” government officials are able to access. “And only good intelligence is going to keep people safe,” she said.Burr and Feinstein both clarified that they aren't yet pursuing legislation on encryption, but want to explore the issue more. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), meanwhile, is pushing for a new measure to extend a sweeping National Security Agency telephone data-collection program that is set to expire on Nov. 29.Due to mounting privacy concerns, the administration had all but given up on forcing tech companies to decrypt data for law enforcement. Silicon Valley and Washington have recently been locked in a back-and-forth struggle over security and consumer protections as lawmakers considered a cybersecurity sharing bill and the renewal of NSA’s bulk data collection under the USA Freedom Act, first passed in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Late last month, the White House abandoned its attempt to get Congress to pass legislation requiring companies to hand over decoded communications.Still, Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris have enabled lawmakers concerned about encryption to assert their views more forcefully.“It’s just astonishing to me how those advocates of ridding us of any government involvement in our lives have now become strangely quiet,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Wednesday, taking a jab at some libertarians within the Republican conference who had opposed renewing the NSA bulk data collection program and argued for more privacy.The events in Paris, McCain argued, have proven privacy advocates “wrong.”In its review of encryption use, the Senate should also determine “whether there should be a key or not that’s held by the government that only through a court order the government could use,” he added. A key, or a backdoor, is an opening that companies build into products, such as computers or phones, to be able to get through encryption software easily and gain access to information about cyber or terrorist threats when needed.Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the second ranking Democrat in the Senate, also blamed encryption for hindering officials' ability to track terrorist plots.“We are told by the major agencies that are in charge of domestic security that encryption is now a major problem in terms of following the communications of those who would be terrorists and harm the U.S.,” Durbin said when discussing the Paris attacks. “I want to know what we can do to give [government officials] access.”Tech companies will likely fight such efforts. Creating a master key, or backdoor, for encrypted apps and devices would only make everyone less safe, and could potentially backfire if hackers exploit it, critics say. It’s unclear if weakening the strong default encryption now provided on all Apple iPhones -- and soon, on Androids -- would prevent terrorism at all.“My view is it’s important to be very careful about some of these knee-jerk approaches that don’t give you more security and put at risk your liberty,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a staunch privacy proponent. “Requiring U.S. companies to weaken encryption when terrorists can fairly easily obtain advanced encryption products around the world doesn’t make much sense to me.”Durbin, among others, wasn’t convinced. “There are things that are more important than the profitability of a private company,” Durbin said. “I think the security of the U.S. is.”Also on HuffPost:"

Federal law contains a provision aimed at shielding borrowers from making payments on federal student loans granted on fraudulent conditions.The Education Department said it found startling discrepancies between what Corinthian reported about former students' employment and the truth. For example, at the Everest location in West Los Angeles, the school told prospective students of its associate-level paralegal program that 60 percent of former students got jobs in their fields. The actual rate was 0. Harris sued Corinthian in 2013.But Education Secretary Arne Duncan isn't automatically discharging defrauded students' debts, despite pleas from some prominent state and federal officials, including Harris. Instead, the Education Department is requiring defrauded students to complete application forms.Department officials promised an expedited process for these 85,000 borrowers, but it made a similar promise earlier this year to the roughly 40,000 former Corinthian students who attended the company's Heald schools. Those students allegedly were systematically misled about Heald's job placement rates. The Education Department has made ""significant progress"" in reviewing borrowers' debt relief claims, Undersecretary Ted Mitchell said.Lawyers for some low-income borrowers have said the process penalizes those who either don't know they're eligible for debt relief or lack access to computers or lawyers. In situations where the Education Department has ample evidence of fraud, such as in the Corinthian case, Duncan should simply use his authority to dismiss borrowers' obligation to repay, advocates say.""Our goal is to ensure that every eligible student receives every penny of the debt relief they are entitled to as efficiently and easily as possible,"" said John B. King Jr., who will take over as education secretary when Duncan steps down next month.The Education Department's refusal to automatically cancel debts allows it to save a portion of the $690 million that it would have to write off. It also makes defrauded borrowers more reliant on the Education Department's loan contractors, which counsel borrowers on repayment options and collect their monthly payments.Loan servicers such as Navient Corp., the student loan giant formerly known as Sallie Mae, are borrowers' primary point of contact when they have issues with their federal student loans.The Education Department is doing a terrible job overseeing them and making sure they're not misleading borrowers, according to prepared remarks an official at the U.S. Government Accountability Office plans to deliver to Congress on Wednesday.Federal Student Aid, the Education Department unit responsible for the $1.2 trillion federal student loan program, doesn't adequately monitor how its loan servicers interact with borrowers, according to prepared remarks by Melissa Emrey-Arras of GAO.Reviews of random call recordings are often incomplete or contain inaccurate information, according to Emrey-Arras. Reports on the reviews don't routinely detail the severity of servicers' errors or make clear whether servicers gave borrowers false information about loan repayment plans. The reports also ""do not reflect the actual prevalence of particular problems in the calls the agency monitors."" FSA doesn't even verify that its servicers actually hand over a random sample of calls for it to review, according to Emrey-Arras.""FSA is missing opportunities to target its oversight and improve services to borrowers,"" Emrey-Arras said in the remarks.Kathleen Tighe, the Education Department's inspector general, plans to tell Congress that after years of her investigators repeatedly discovering failures in how FSA oversees schools and contractors that participate in the federal student aid program, it may be time for Congress to beef up its own requirements of FSA.Corinthian Colleges had been under the Education Department's close watch since August 2012, the department said Tuesday. Yet the government missed Corinthian's alleged deceptions for years.Also on HuffPost:"

The fallout continues to unravel some murder cases, they wrote: All 250 prosecutors with in the OCDA office were booted from a mass murder case earlier this year; a court found that at least one prosecutor had given less than credible testimony under oath; more recently, multiple sheriff’s deputies refused to testify in various criminal cases.“It is fair to say that the criminal justice system in Orange County is in a state of crisis,” the letter reads.Multiple national and state civil rights groups signed onto the letter, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Constitution Project, as did several highly regarded members of the legal community, such as the current dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law, former Los Angeles DAs and a former prosecutor of international crimes at the Hague. The seriousness of the alleged violations was illustrated in March, when Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals ejected the entire OCDA office from a high-profile mass murder case.Goethals said at the time that the government had committed “significant” violations of due process and called certain aspects of the office’s behavior a “comedy of errors.”The defendant in that case, Scott Dekraai, pleaded guilty last year to shooting and killing his ex-wife and seven other people in a hair salon in 2011, in what remains the largest mass murder in Orange County history. Dekraai’s attorney, Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders, unearthed violations within the county’s secret jailhouse informant program, as well as internal records from the program that may have been improperly concealed for over 30 years.It’s common for law enforcement authorities to enlist informants to help bolster a case ― the tactic is perfectly legal, even when the informant receives something in exchange. But Sanders argues that in some Orange County cases, the jailhouse informants, at the direction of sheriff’s deputies, held recorded and unrecorded conversations with inmates who were already represented by lawyers, which is a violation of an inmate’s right to counsel. Prosecutors allegedly presented damning evidence gathered by the informants in court, but withheld evidence that could have been beneficial to the defense, a violation of a defendant’s right to due process. “More troubling still, this all appears to be the tip of the iceberg,” the experts write in their letter.“Given this state of affairs, as well as the scope of the misconduct at issue, the Department of Justice is the only entity with the capacity to conduct the investigation required,” the letter goes on to state. A brief Sanders filed in October in a separate double-murder case in the county produced a pile of documents indicating that state prosecutors told Orange County DA Tony Rackauckas that his office may have had a jailhouse snitch problem since 1999.The OCSD has acknowledged “deficiencies” in the policies and protocols involving jailhouse informants. Lt. Jeff Hallock, spokesman for the sheriff’s department, told The Huffington Post earlier this year that the department has already taken steps to create more robust ways of documenting inmate handling.“We are fully cooperating with the current and ongoing California Attorney General’s investigation into the issue and believe it would be prudent to wait until their findings are published; however, we would cooperate with any additional investigation or inquiry as a means of resolving the issue,” OC Sheriff Sandra Hutchens told HuffPost Wednesday in an emailed statement.And despite calls for a sweeping federal investigation ― including a September New York Times editorial on the subject ― Rackauckas and California Attorney General Kamala Harris remain defensive. Rackauckas’ office has assembled its own commission to investigate claims of prosecutor misconduct, but the DA has maintained that no one in his office intentionally behaved inappropriately.“Our position has always been that we would welcome any scrutiny from any law enforcement agency that wants to come and review all of the matters regarding this issue,” Susan Schroeder, OCDA chief of staff, told HuffPost.Harris is seeking a reversal of Goethals’ decision to boot the DA office from the Dekraai case, and her office has also launched an investigation into the allegations. Kristen Ford, press secretary for Harris’ office, said that investigation is “ongoing,” but declined to comment further on the letter.The investigation by Harris’ office is criminal in nature and looks specifically at the allegations of misconduct in the Dekraai case. A federal investigation by DOJ ― which could happen at the same time as one run by the state ― could be broader in scope and could include a civil rights investigation.This article has been updated with statements from the OCDA, the sheriff’s office and Harris’ office.Read the full letter below: More on HuffPost:"
25,POLITICS,"Hillary Clinton's Pot Proposal Is Popular, But It Probably Won't Help Her Win",Samantha Lachman and Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-marijuana_us_564cb3b2e4b08c74b7339bb4,How to loosen marijuana restrictions is a key policy difference among the Democratic presidential front-runners.,2015-11-18,Clinton has said more research needs to be done into marijuana's medicinal properties.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564cb53e1600002e0026daa1.jpeg?ops=crop_33_538_5727_2732%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's proposal this month to loosen restrictions on marijuana and spur more research into the drug’s medicinal benefits wasn't especially surprising or daring, given 58 percent of Americans support legalizing it. But it begs the question of whether voters take into account a candidate’s stance on marijuana before heading to the polls.Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act, alongside heroin, LSD and ecstasy. That means the federal government considers it a drug with “no currently accepted medical use” and “a high potential for abuse.” On Nov. 7, Clinton said marijuana should be downgraded to Schedule II, the category under which Schedule II substances including cocaine, methamphetamine, oxycodone, Adderall are listed, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, are still considered “dangerous.”Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical pot, while recreational marijuana is legal in four states, plus D.C. Clinton has said more research needs to be done to determine how best to help those who use marijuana for medicinal purposes.""Because it's considered what's called a Schedule I drug and you can't even do research in it,"" she said. ""If we're going to have a lot of states setting up marijuana dispensaries so that people who have some kind of medical need are getting marijuana, we need know what's the quality of it, how much should you take, what should you avoid if you're taking other medications.""Clinton has also embraced the criminal justice aspect to the issue, saying ""We have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana.” A new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds that most Americans share Clinton's stance on marijuana research stance on research -- three quarters of Americans, including 81 percent of Democrats, say they'd support the federal government conducting research about medical uses for marijuana.Just 4 percent of Americans think that marijuana should be regulated more strictly than Schedule II drugs. A 59 percent majority that includes 65 percent of Democrats thinks it should be less restricted than those drugs. That’s the stance taken by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Clinton’s chief rival for the nomination, who introduced a bill Nov. 4 to strike marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act altogether. Sanders’ bill would allow states to decide whether they want to legalize marijuana for recreational or medical use without any federal intervention. (Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who trails Clinton and Sanders in the polls, called for marijuana to be downgraded from Schedule I to Schedule II in September.)Democrats are nearly four times more likely to say they'd prefer a candidate who supports fewer marijuana restrictions to one who supports more regulation.The issue, however, isn't at the top of most people's minds as they weigh their choices in next year's election. Just 14 percent of Democrats, and 15 percent of Americans overall, say that marijuana legalization will be a very important issue in their vote for president next year. For comparison, 52 percent of Americans in an earlier poll said their personal finances would be a very important factor.Even younger Americans, for whom the issue might be expected to hold special appeal, aren't especially interested. Those under 30 aren't any more likely than their older compatriots to say that they'd prefer a pro-legalization candidate, or to say marijuana will be a very important factor in their vote.One group does consider the topic a little more urgent: the 14 percent of Americans who say they've used marijuana in the past year. Among that group, 41 percent of Americans say that the issue is very important, with 60 percent saying they'd be more inclined to vote for a candidate who promised to ease restrictions.Even though marijuana doesn’t appear to be a major voting issue, the topic may continue to arise in Democratic primary debates because it marks a significant policy difference between the candidates. Moreover, it intersects with criminal justice reform, a subject that's led Black Lives Matter activists to push Sanders and Clinton to describe how they’d address mass incarceration, race-based discrimination and police brutality. Though whites and blacks use marijuana at similar rates, a report from the American Civil Liberties Union found that blacks are 3.7 times more likely than whites to be arrested for possession. This formed the basis for Sanders to argue that Clinton’s proposal doesn’t go far enough to protect people of color from race-based disparities in marijuana arrests. “I am glad to see Secretary Clinton is beginning to address an issue that my legislation addressed, but her approach ignored the major issue,” Sanders said in a statement. “If we are serious about criminal justice reform and preventing many thousands of lives from being impacted because of criminal convictions for marijuana possession, we must remove marijuana from the federal Controlled Substances Act and allow states the right to go forward, if they choose, to legalize marijuana without federal legal impediments.”Marijuana advocates argue that Clinton's proposal is mostly symbolic because downgrading marijuana to Schedule II won't prohibit the Drug Enforcement Agency from intervening in states that have legalized marijuana for medicinal use.

But the 40-year-old Ethiopian immigrant and father of two, who works as an Uber driver in North Carolina, says he was the victim of Islamophobia this weekend when a passenger threatened his life before violently attacking him during a late-night fare.Woldemichael says he picked up his assailant, a white man in his 30s, a little before 2 a.m. Sunday outside an Irish pub in Charlotte. The ride started out normally enough, with the two men making small talk. But Woldemichael says when he arrived at what the passenger gave as his home address, the man started to threaten him. ""He told me he was going to shoot me right in face or strangle me,"" Woldemichael told The Huffington Post. ""He used a lot of bad words... really dirty words, and said I was a Muslim."" Woldemichael says that even after he told the man he wasn't a Muslim, the man continued to threaten him. ""He was telling me he was going to kill me right there, next to his residence.""At that point, Woldemichael says, he asked the passenger to get out of the car. The passenger, in turn, asked Woldemichael to get out. Woldemichael says the two stared into each other's eyes for a few tense seconds, and then he decided to start driving again.""I started driving because I didn't feel safe anymore to park there,"" he told WBTV this week.Woldemichael says he drove halfway around the block before the passenger ""hit me so hard on the forehead with his bare hand.""""He then choked me with one arm,"" Woldemichael added, ""and started hitting me with the other one. I couldn't move. The only thing I could do was step on the brake, and then I was honking on the horn continuously.""Woldemichael told WBTV the man then got out of the car, ran a short distance away and then turned around and launched into another tirade, this time keeping his hand behind his back as though he were armed.That's when Woldemichael says he drove away and called 911. The cops, he said, arrived within a few minutes, but by that point his assailant had disappeared into the night.Woldemichael says he suffered two bruises to his head.The Charlotte-Meckleburg Police Department didn't respond to multiple requests from comment, but it told WBTV Tuesday that police are investigating the case and that no arrests have been made.""Yeah, he should be arrested,"" Woldemichael told HuffPost. ""I don't care about myself -- I don't want revenge -- but he should be educated. He's a dangerous guy and there's no reason he's not gong to do it again to another guy. He's full of hate to a certain group."" In the meantime, an Uber spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the company has been in touch with Woldemichael to offer him any assistance he needs, and ""will work with local law enforcement in every way we can to assist their investigation.”Every trip on Uber can be traced by GPS, and every passenger can be identified by their account and credit card information.""First and foremost, we're relieved the driver is ok and was not seriously injured,"" the spokesperson wrote. ""Discrimination of any kind is unacceptable and is not tolerated on the Uber platform. As soon as we were made aware, we permanently removed the rider’s account.""Woldemichael's assault is one among a rash of reported anti-Islam incidents across the United States since the Paris terror attacks last week by Islamic State operatives that killed at least 129 people and injured another 350.On Saturday, there were reports of gunshots fired at a mosque in Meriden, Connecticut. Nearby, at the University of Connecticut, the words ""killed Paris"" were found scrawled on the door of an Egyptian student's dorm room.In Nebraska, someone spray-painted an image of the Eiffel Tower on the side of the Omaha Islamic Center.In Texas, someone threw feces and torn pages of the Quran outside the Islamic Center of Pflugerville. Also in Texas, a man was arrested for making a terroristic threat after writing on social media that he was going to ""shoot up a mosque.""In Florida, a man was arrested after calling in bomb threats to two mosques. And in Oklahoma, cops shot a man after he threatened to fire at ""anything that looks like a Muslim."" In the U.S., hate crimes against Muslims were already on the rise this year before the Paris attacks, according to the FBI -- even as the number of hate crimes against other minority groups has fallen.""The picture is getting increasingly bleak,"" Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told the Associated Press. ""There's been an accumulation of anti-Islamic rhetoric in our lives and that I think has triggered these overt acts of violence and vandalism."" Woldemichael told HuffPost that he never thought there were people in America who could ""hate some group like this."" He said his assailant ""was talking to me as a group, not as a person.""If Woldemichael could send a message to that man, he said, it would be this: ""Don't generalize. It's a mistake to generalize a group of people, including Muslims.""Woldemichael is a leader at his local church, where, he said, ""with God's grace I'm trying to be a dedicated Christian."" He also pointed out that many Muslims in this country are immigrants just like him. Woldemichael said he came to the United States nine years ago for a shot at a better life for him and his wife and two children. "

During their eight-year relationship, the two decided to have a child together, with Sutton as the biological mother.Earlier this year, the Oklahoma County District Court dismissed Ramey's case for a temporary order granting custody of the couple's child on the grounds that she was not the biological parent, was never married to Sutton and did not have a written co-parenting agreement in place that could be enforced.In Tuesday's decision, the Oklahoma Supreme Court dismissed the lower court's claim that Ramey was an interloper and explicitly acknowledged family decisions made by same-sex couples before the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark ruling this year that legalized gay marriage nationally.""Ramey is not a mere 'third party' like a nanny, friend, or relative, as suggested by the district court,"" the ruling states.""On the contrary, Ramey has been intimately involved in the conception, birth and parenting of their child, at the request and invitation of Sutton,"" it said adding Ramey has been a parent to their child and always been referred to as ""Mom"" by their child.Last year, the court upheld the rights of another non-biological mother in a similar situation, but who had a written co-parenting agreement in place with the custodial parent.

28,COLLEGE,Hundreds Of Occidental College Students Demand The School's President Quit,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/occidental-college-occupy_us_564b9d99e4b045bf3df18456,"The president said last week, ""I'm happy to resign.""",2015-11-18,"Occidental College students have occupied the administrative building since Nov. 17 to demand, among other things, the resignation of the college president.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/564cde571600002e0026db3d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of more than 400 students have taken part in an ongoing occupation of an administrative building at Occidental College in Los Angeles to demand, among other things, the resignation of the school president, Jonathan Veitch.The student activists issued a list of demands at a rally Thursday in response to the treatment of minority student groups on campus. Other demands include the demilitarization of the campus police, the creation of a black studies major, and the immediate removal of the Los Angeles Police Department from campus. Activists have given the administration a Friday deadline to meet these demands.The students' occupation of the Arthur G. Coons Administrative Center began on Monday, and has involved about 100 students at any one time, according to activists involved. They estimate a total of more than 400 students have participated in the occupation, going to classes during the day while others remain in the building. ""There are no plans to force students to leave the building,"" Jim Tranquada, Occidental spokesman, told The Huffington Post. ""They have not been asked to leave the building. We have kept the heat, lights and power on, and the bathrooms open.""[RELATED: Students Share Harsh Truths About Being #BlackOnCampus]Earlier this week in a campus-wide email Veitch said that he would try to set up ""group meetings with various stakeholders"" about the demonstrations. The student organizers said they haven't had any conversations with senior administrators yet. Tranquada said the student activists declined the offer of a meeting on Tuesday. ""At the demonstration on Thursday, I witnessed the pain and feelings of marginalization that many in our community feel,"" Veitch said in his email. ""You spoke eloquently and honestly, and I thank you for that. I will continue to listen and learn from you, and I ask the entire community to help me make Occidental a better place for everyone.""Activists have noted that Veitch also told students at the rally that he would be willing to step down. ""I do not cling to this job, I'm happy to resign,"" Veitch said. The activism at Occidental, a well-regarded liberal arts college, follows a wave of demonstrations nationwide over how students of color are treated at institutions of higher education.Criticisms of Veitch -- whose current contract expires in 2020 -- precede the current turmoil, however. Students have said there's a cloud of distrust around the administration's approach to sexual violence, which is currently the subject of a federal investigation. Faculty voted ""no confidence"" in the college's handling of such cases two years ago. Protesters say that Occidental's handling of sexual assault cases in recent years plays into their activism.""The president has not been addressing numerous concerns over the years properly,"" said Diamond Webb, a senior. ""Marginalized students have not felt safe, women have not felt safe, women of color have not felt safe on this campus. So the president has not been doing his job.""Veitch also angered some students last week when he left the rally as some female students began discussing their experiences of sexual assault on campus.[RELATED: Campus Racism Protests Didn't Come Out Of Nowhere, And They Aren't Going Away Quickly]Whereas institutions like the University of Missouri and Yale University have smaller numbers of students of color on campus, nearly half of Occidental's student body is not white. The college's promotion of the diversity of its student body, in light of its inadequate responses to previous requests for more support for minority students, feels ""exploitive,"" said sophomore Chance Ward. They put the onus on the administration to work with students to implement changes to better serve those groups.""We can't do it on our own,"" Ward said. ""When we try to do it on our own, bureaucratic things get in our way, so we need them.""Below is a list of student activists' demands:Tyler Kingkade covers higher education and is based in New York.

In exchange for the honor, Brady was supposed to give reporter Chuck Klosterman a 60-minute face-to-face interview. He didn’t. Instead, Brady gave Klosterman a call while he was behind the wheel, allotting only 45 minutes to chat. Those 45 minutes marked what should be considered the GQ Awkward Interview of the Year. Klosterman tried and tried to get the controversial New England Patriot to talk about the biggest scandal of the year: You know, that time he may or may not have encouraged a team staffer to deflate footballs prior to last season's AFC Championship Game.What ensued was a 746-word chunk of the interview that can be summed up in just nine letters: No comment. Klosterman warned Brady that if he didn’t give him anything more meaty, “the fact that [he] refused to talk about it [would] end up as the center of the story.” It seems that Brady really didn’t care about that, and that Klosterman wasn't bluffing.Here are some choice quotes from their chat.There’s one element of the Wells Report that I find fascinating: The report concludes that you had a “general awareness” of the footballs being deflated. The report doesn’t say you were aware. It says you were generally aware. So I’m curious -- would you say that categorization is accurate? I guess it depends on how you define the word generally. But was that categorization true or false?Unfortunately, it doesn’t get much better from there.Also on HuffPost:"
