0,POLITICS,"Officials Worry About Briefing Trump, Fearing Spilled Secrets",,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-spilled-secrets_us_5750646ee4b0ed593f138f3d,"""I would be very concerned with Mr. Trump's ability to know what he can and can't discuss.""",2016-06-02,"U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne, Indiana, U.S., May 1, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575065e41200002e008952e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some U.S. intelligence officials are concerned that Donald Trump's ""shoot from the hip"" style could pose national security risks as they prepare to give him a routine pre-election briefing once he is formally anointed as the Republican presidential nominee.Eight senior security officials told Reuters they had concerns over briefing Trump, whose brash, unpredictable campaign style has been a feature of his rise as an insurgent candidate. Despite their worries, the officials said the ""Top Secret"" briefing to each candidate would not deviate from the usual format to avoid any appearance of bias.Most of the officials asked for anonymity to discuss a domestic political issue. Current and former officials said that the scandal over Hillary Clinton's use of emails also raises concerns about her handling of sensitive information. The likely Democratic nominee is facing an FBI probe into whether security was compromised and laws were broken by her use of a private email server for government business while she was Secretary of State.""The only candidate who has proven incapable of handling sensitive information is Hillary Clinton,"" said Michael Short, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ""If there is anyone they should be worried about it is Hillary Clinton."" But Trump's lack of foreign policy experience, his volatile style, and his little known team of foreign policy advisers make him a unique case, the officials said.""People are very nervous,"" said one senior U.S. security official.Intelligence and other security and foreign policy officials are also trying to determine ""who on (Trump's) team are trustworthy, the official added. ""We've never had a situation like this before. Ever.""A spokesperson for Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Other officials downplayed such worries, noting that the traditional briefing, while classified as Top Secret, is mostly a broad overview of national security issues and does not include the most sensitive government secrets about intelligence sources and operations.In the post-Second World War era, confirmed U.S. presidential nominees have traditionally received the briefing from intelligence officials -- including spy agency chiefs -- covering a broad range of national security issues.The nominees are usually briefed shortly after their party nominating conventions, and are allowed to include one or two aides who must undergo security checks. Current and former officials say the nominees are explicitly warned not to share the contents of the briefing, which includes detailed intelligence assessments.After election day, presidents-elect receive the same Presidential Daily Brief, or PDB, that the sitting president gets, complete with material on the intelligence agencies' sources, methods, and covert operations.Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told Reuters that he shared some of the concerns over how Trump, who has never held public office, might use information from the briefing.""I would be very concerned with Mr. Trump's ability to know what he can and can't discuss"" publicly about the contents of an intelligence briefing, said Schiff, who has endorsed Clinton for president.Schiff said one consequence of intelligence agencies' worries about Trump's reputation as a loose cannon could be that briefers circumscribe some of the information they provide to Trump and Hillary Clinton, his prospective Democratic opponent.Trump has tended to make broad-brush statements on foreign issues rather than delve into policy nuances. He drew criticism from some former national security officials last month when, without evidence, he quickly tweeted that the downing of an EgyptAir flight appeared to be a terrorist attack.Clinton is honing in on national security as a key potential weakness for Trump, and is set to deliver a foreign policy speech on Thursday designed to portray the billionaire businessman as unfit for the White House.SAME BRIEFING FOR BOTH?Officials familiar with the views and policy of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's Office, which will give the in-person briefings, say it will do its utmost to avoid any suggestions of political favoritism or bias.Officials say the spy agencies' intend to follow past practice and give identical briefings to both nominees.One former intelligence official said Clinton could have an advantage in the briefing because she would likely ask more probing questions than Trump, a newcomer to foreign policy.The briefings provide an ""overview of pressing issues and hot spots around the world,"" said former CIA officer David Priess, who briefed attorneys general and FBI directors, but not presidents.One U.S. intelligence official said that Trump's style may not be such a risk because the briefings are general in nature and often track publicly available information.""If he reads the papers every day, he won't hear much that will surprise him,"" the official said.Current and former officials said that covert operations and the intelligence agencies' ""sources and methods,"" which are among the nation's most tightly guarded secrets, are never discussed in the pre-election briefings.(Reporting By Mark Hosenball; Additional reporting By John Walcott; Editing by John Walcott and Stuart Grudgings)"

For Guttman, religious holidays often carried the burden of dressing up in traditionally feminine outfits. ""I never felt more like I was lying than [on Yom Kippur], the day of atonement, when I needed to be unmistakably feminine to be respectful,"" Guttman wrote in a Facebook post on May 28.The resolution acknowledged the struggle of transgender Jews and the broader discrimination that exists toward transgender people in society -- particularly in the realms of health care, employment and retirement benefits. It called upon synagogues to adopt certain accommodations that will protect the rights of all people regardless of gender or sexuality.""The Rabbinical Assembly encourage all Conservative Movement synagogues, camps, schools, and affiliated organizations to work toward becoming explicitly welcoming, safe spaces for transgender and gender non-conforming people and evaluate their physical site needs, workplace needs, and language that impact gender and gender expression,"" the resolution states.In November, Guttman received a new religious name in honor of being trans -- just one example of how synagogues may choose to embrace their trans members.""Being renamed was one of the most important moments of my life: one in which my family, Rabbi, Cantor and community told me that to be all of my names, to be trans, is a mitzvah—that to be who I am is to fulfill commandments, not break them,"" Guttman wrote. ""Today, the Rabbinical Assembly of the Conservative Movement affirmed this in a statement that embodies tikkun olam in each paragraph.""Debate surrounding transgender rights has erupted in recent months largely over bathroom access, leading the federal government to issue a directive to public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice.""Due to recent events in the United States, and the emerging issue of transgender persons' rights, members of the Rabbinical Assembly felt it was time to deal with the issue of transgender persons or gender non-conforming persons exclusively,"" Rabbi David Baum and Rabbi Edward Bernstein, chairs of the resolution committee, told The Huffington Post.With the resolution, the Conservative branch of Judaism -- the second-largest in the U.S. -- follows the larger, more liberal Reform movement which passed a similar resolution last year.“Since Talmudic times, our people have recognized that the human condition is not just binary,” said Rabbi Gil Steinlauf, senior rabbi of Adas Israel Congregation in Washington, D.C. who came out as gay in 2014, in an interview with LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign. “I hope this resolution will go far in promoting this deep truth of our religion in our society and in the world.”"
2,WOMEN,In Defense Of 'Petty',Zeba Blay,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-defense-of-petty_us_5734dd7de4b077d4d6f2768c,How women are reclaiming a word once used to diminish them.,2016-06-02,"Some ""petty"" merchandise from gossip site The Shade Room. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574f25bb12000025008950ea.png?ops=crop_0_0_463_339%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"When news of Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian's budding romance first came to light, there was one word that kept appearing on Twitter, on Tumblr, and in the comments sections of tabloid Instagram accounts: petty. The fact that Chyna had managed to win the affections of the only Kardashian son, much to the dismay of her ex-BFF Kim Kardashian and nemesis Kylie Jenner seemed like a Machiavellian stroke of pure genius.What Chyna had pulled off was petty, and the pettiness of it all turned her into a kind of folk hero, a figure to be celebrated for the unapologetic spitefulness of her move. But social media's celebration of Blac Chyna's pettiness is just a small part of an overall renaissance of petty, one that has really bloomed over the past year. The word petty has become part of the vernacular of Twitter and Tumblr, used liberally on black gossip sites and message boards like The Shade Room and Lipstick Alley. The Shade Room even has its own #PettyWap tag, used to highlight the week's most delicious moments of petty, be it Candace Parker demanding and getting $109k a month in alimony from her cheating ex-husband, or Chyna and Rob announcing their own Kardashian-style show on E!. Today, pettiness can mean throwing perfect, scathing shade (see: almost everything Mariah Carey says), or deftly turning the tables on an unpleasant person or situation in order to get ahead (a la Blac Chyna). But when did petty, especially in respect to women, become an almost positive concept, a badge of honor, something women across social media proudly and gleefully declare about themselves through memes, T-shirts, and tweets?Pettiness has traditionally had negative connotations. It's one the many less-than-desirable traits that has been coded female, right up there with cattiness, manipulativeness and bitchiness. Like ""bitchy,"" men are almost never described as petty. It's a word that has primarily been used to devalue the actions and motivations of empowered women; a word even used to belittle feminists and feminism on the whole.The textbook definition of petty is ""trivial"" and ""insignificant,"" and thus the word has long been used as a dismissal of the supposedly insignificant ambitions and emotions of women. Women ""pick petty fights,"" live for ""petty drama,"" and play up their ""petty victim-hood"" whenever they call out sexism. Over the last decade, there has been a movement to reclaim ""bitch,"" and now it seems that ""petty"" has been reclaimed, too. There's a whole group of women who are owning up to the fact that they have the capacity for pettiness, and they are unapologetic about it.This isn't to say that the new conception of pettiness is always positive or always ""feminist."" But there's something deeply compelling about the idea that a woman like Blac Chyna can be celebrated for her petty, and that Beyonce's groundbreaking ""Lemonade"" album can be praised with memes and headlines like ""Fresh-Squeezed Petty."" Perhaps there's a kind of power in being willing to be the ""bad guy,"" to be uncompromising, to be a little messy or crazy, and not worry about how that makes you look -- because at the end of the day, you still slay. Perhaps there is, in fact, a power in pettiness. "

He also warned that ""it may not be pretty.""Speaking on his ""Gun Owners News Hour"" radio show, Pratt and guest Robert Knight, a senior fellow at the ultra-conservative American Civil Rights Union, discussed how the upcoming election could change the Supreme Court. Knight warned that a liberal Democrat president could appoint ""two, three, four justices"" who would limit gun rights. ""I think the Second Amendment would be in great peril if that happens,"" Knight said. That's when Pratt implied that gun owners could resort to violence. He said:""The courts do not have the last word on what the Constitution is. They decide particular cases, they don’t make law. Their decisions, unlike the Roe v. Wade usurpation, don’t extend to the whole of society, they’re not supposed to. And we may have to reassert that proper constitutional balance, and it may not be pretty. So, I’d much rather have an election where we solve this matter at the ballot box than have to resort to the bullet box.""""Well, there's impeachment, too,"" Knight suggested.Pratt's organization is considered even more extreme than the National Rifle Association. The Southern Poverty Law Center claims Pratt has ""ties to the militia movement, white supremacist organizations and Christian theocrats.""In the past, he has warned that politicians should have a ""healthy fear"" of being shot. ""You know, I’m kind of glad that’s in the back of their minds,"" he said in 2014, according to Right Wing Watch. ""Hopefully they’ll behave.""(h/t Raw Story)"

While he tweets ""great"" more than any other single adjective, insulting words like ""dumb,"" ""crooked, ""crippled"" and, yes, ""lyin'"" appear more often overall.Vox's analysis looked at the 2,000 most recent tweets from Trump and his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. The media outlet found that Clinton is more likely than Trump to use ""policy-related"" words like ""equal"" and ""progressive."" In general, 20 percent of her adjectives were deemed ""negative.""It also appears that Clinton is more likely than Trump to shake her language up. None of her most-tweeted adjectives appeared more than 81 times in those 2,000 tweets, while Trump tweeted ""great"" 329 times, ""new"" 186 times and ""big"" 120 times.Trump is also more self-promotional on the platform, with his most-tweeted phrases including ""self funding my campaign,"" ""I will beat Hillary,"" and ""I am signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA."" In contrast, Clinton tweets phrases like ""we need to..."" ""we have to..."" and ""find your polling place.""Of course, further evidence that Trump's campaign is a self-promotional hate machine is unlikely to change anyone's mind come election season. Recent reports from The New York Times and The Atlantic suggest that his supporters might love him precisely because he's not ""politically correct.""Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S. "
5,POLITICS,The Libertarian Party Barely Takes Itself Seriously. Why Should We?,Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/libertarian-party-never-trump_us_575083f1e4b0eb20fa0d34f3,They're busily blowing their big chance this year.,2016-06-02,"At least, Vermin Supreme (left) and others seemed to enjoy themselves at the Libertarians' convention.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5750849a1200002e0089534d.jpeg?cache=WzlotN7dkz&ops=crop_25_13_2962_2024%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"ORLANDO, Fla. -- As Libertarian Party officials converged on the Rosen Centre Hotel this past weekend to nominate former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson and former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld as their presidential standard-bearers, an equally curious spectacle was transpiring next door.Hundreds of individuals were wandering about the nearby convention center dressed as sci-fi characters such as Kylo Ren from ""Star Wars,"" sweating the 85-degree weather in Gandalf costumes and answering the age-old question of what it would look like if Lara Croft ordered a Grand Slam breakfast at Denny's. They had come to Orlando for Megacon, one of the year's biggest comic book, fantasy and sci-fi conventions.But for all the escapism displayed by those avid cosplayers, it was unclear who had a better grasp of reality: the Megacon attendees or the Libertarians. The Libertarian Party -- or the ""LP"" as it's known among activists -- has never had a better chance of advancing its anti-government, socially liberal agenda, as dissatisfaction with the two major parties' presidential picks hits an all-time high. But you wouldn't have known that at the Libertarians' convention. No serious attempt was made to mask, much less downplay, the party's more extreme elements this weekend.Indeed, even as the Democratic and Republican parties gear up for the general election, the Libertarians are still debating whether they want to be a national political party or simply an ideological movement.Consider the convention's presidential debate, in which Johnson's chief rival for the nomination, activist Austin Petersen, was jeered for supporting legal restrictions on the sale of heroin to children. Or consider the delegate who urged the convention not to pledge allegiance to the flag because ""libertarians pledge allegiance to principles, not flags."" Or consider the vote cast by a delegate for Vermin Supreme, a performance artist known for his rubber boot hat and his prankish appearances at political gatherings. ""The LP has always been split along [purism] and pragmatism,"" said Robert Clarke, a volunteer with the Youth Caucus of the Libertarian Party. Clarke, who supported the Johnson/Weld ticket from the outset, thinks the party needs to stomach a little heresy.""In life, you need to compromise with people,"" he said.Most party conventions are filled with head-scratching pageantry and aimed at firing up the base. So maybe that excuses some of the weekend's eccentricities: conservative thinker Ayn Rand's name being invoked with the same regularity that Republicans namecheck Ronald Reagan, the young attendee who jokingly labeled his companion a ""stateist"" for stealing his lunch, and a long-shot presidential candidate who cheekily reiterated his support for legalizing drugs by saying that ""crystal meth should be as legal as tomatoes.""But in the end, the party's moderating influences couldn't temper its more ideological members. As Johnson and Weld conducted TV interviews from the convention's main hall, assuring news networks that they would provide an attractive alternative to the Democrats and Republicans, the delegates in the same room were debating whether to enfranchise children of all ages and whether U.S. military intervention was acceptable in any circumstance whatsoever. Ultimately, Johnson and Weld won their nominations with barely 50 percent support from the delegates.Thus far, power players within the larger conservative movement seem mostly unconvinced by the Libertarians. Although the party's chairman, Nicholas Sarwark, has said the group was engaged in back-channel talks with the Koch brothers, representatives for the business magnates and other conservative megadonors have said they have no interest in backing a third party.Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform and creator of the tax pledge, framed the Libertarian Party as more of a venue for ideological activism than an agent of direct political action. It's the ""North Star"" of the ""liberty movement,"" he told The Huffington Post.Had the Libertarians had more time to prepare for the rise of Donald Trump and the frantic search by ""Never Trump"" adherents for alternatives, it's possible that things might have been different. Instead, the party will likely end up political rubbernecking this summer and fall, slowing down to gawk at the destructive clash between Republicans and Democrats, but making no real attempt to remedy the situation. ""We are going to have a hard time with a Johnson/Weld ticket,"" said Daniel Craig, a national chairman of the party's Radical Caucus, which terms itself the ""Libertarian wing of the Libertarian Party."" Craig said that while his members would vote for the ticket, they would likely spend their time and energy working on down-ballot races.""We don't give in just to get votes,"" he added.""We welcome former Republicans,"" one party member angrily noted during convention proceedings -- a pointed reference to Weld, who in 2012 served as a state co-chair of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. ""We do not welcome Republicans.""John McAfee, the antivirus software executive who was also running for the party's presidential nomination, summed up the mix of realism and extremism that defined much of the convention.""Let's be honest with ourselves -- there's not a Libertarian [here], myself included, that's going to be elected president,"" McAfee told HuffPost. ""Cool! That's perfect!""Asked what the party will do to raise its stature over the next two, three or even four presidential elections, McAfee's response was, to put it mildly, skeptical of any such effort.""Do you believe that America will survive 16 years out?""

Sommer said that she would take those days off during the week so that she could be at Trump U events over the weekend. Her reservist commitment amounted to two days a month, she said.Her supervisors at Trump University wrote that she was a ""weekend warrior"" on her performance review, according to Sommer. She considered that term ""derogatory ... especially when I'm an Iraq veteran.""The Huffington Post left messages for Sommer at her home and Highbloom at his workplace. Neither of them returned calls.According to the deposition, Trump University would claim that Sommer was fired for poor performance. But she said the company was pushing her to work even more hours just before they fired her. She refused and returned home from a vacation trip to learn that she didn't have a job anymore.In her employment lawsuit, Sommer recalled, she accused Trump University of firing her because of her military commitments and of discriminating against because of her age (she was in her early 20s at the time).She said she ""won"" her case when the company agreed to settle with her, rather than go to trial. ""They found that there was probable cause enough to settle,"" she said. The exact resolution of the case is covered by a ""confidentiality provision,"" Trump U's lawyer noted in the deposition.A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization told HuffPost, ""While we do not comment on the circumstances surrounding the termination of employees, the allegations in Ms. Sommer’s lawsuit were completely meritless and Trump University in no way admitted the allegations in settling the dispute.""Trump University, which closed down in 2011, is now facing fraud charges in multiple states. Thousands of former customers and staff, including Sommer, contend that the real estate seminars were little more than a two-bit scam. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump has sought to defend those seminars while also downplaying his involvement in the company.The class action lawsuit in California alleging fraud by Trump is moving forward, and is expected to go to trial in late November.This story has been updated with a comment from the Trump Organization.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

""Imagine going to sleep listening to explosions going off around you. Imagine walking to chow and listening to a whizzing of mortars overhead, and thinking, oh God, don't let it hit me. Imagine listening to your friends tell stories how they were hit by an IED and the pure terror they felt. And then imagine your friends who were not so lucky to tell that story.""Three years after she returned home, Sommer started working for Trump University.There, she said in her 2012 deposition, her boss David Highbloom ""complained when I would take days off to do my military service."" Sommer said that she would take those days off during the week so that she could be at Trump U events over the weekend. Her reservist commitment amounted to two days a month, she said.Her supervisors at Trump University wrote that she was a ""weekend warrior"" on her performance review, according to Sommer. She considered that term ""derogatory ... especially when I'm an Iraq veteran.""The Huffington Post left messages for Sommer at her home and Highbloom at his workplace. Neither of them returned calls.According to the deposition, Trump University would claim that Sommer was fired for poor performance. But she said the company was pushing her to work even more hours just before they fired her. She refused and returned home from a vacation trip to learn that she didn't have a job anymore.In her employment lawsuit, Sommer recalled, she accused Trump University of firing her because of her military commitments and of discriminating against because of her age (she was in her early 20s at the time).She said she ""won"" her case when the company agreed to settle with her, rather than go to trial. ""They found that there was probable cause enough to settle,"" she said. The exact resolution of the case is covered by a ""confidentiality provision,"" Trump U's lawyer noted in the deposition.A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization told HuffPost, ""While we do not comment on the circumstances surrounding the termination of employees, the allegations in Ms. Sommer’s lawsuit were completely meritless and Trump University in no way admitted the allegations in settling the dispute.""Trump University, which closed down in 2011, is now facing fraud charges in multiple states. Thousands of former customers and staff, including Sommer, contend that the real estate seminars were little more than a two-bit scam. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump has sought to defend those seminars while also downplaying his involvement in the company.The class action lawsuit in California alleging fraud by Trump is moving forward, and is expected to go to trial in late November.This story has been updated with a comment from the Trump Organization.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
9,TECH,Thiel Shows Why Tech Billionaires Are The New Robber Barons,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-robber-baron_us_57503617e4b0ed593f135989,"Destroying Gawker is not just revenge or a kind of political act, it’s in Thiel’s words “philanthropic.”",2016-06-02,"Peter Thiel, partner of Founders Fund, takes part in a panel discussion titled ""When Past Performance Is a Guide: Using History to Make Sense of the Post-Crisis World"" at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California May 1, 2013.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575037b11200002e00895258.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Throughout history, wealthy industrialists have engaged in vendettas. The venture capitalist Peter Thiel, we now see, is no different. What’s different is Americans’ expectations.What the public is seeing is the disruption of the belief in Silicon Valley exceptionalism -- that, unlike Gilded Age robber barons, 21-century digital plutocrats are transparent in their dealings while building and using their great wealth.Thiel did not cause the growing public disillusionment with Silicon Valley. But his secret funding of the privacy lawsuit of Hulk Hogan, the former pro wrestler, against Gawker may help accelerate it.Silicon Valley has been distinguished, the entrepreneur and investor Michael Lazerow writes, by core principles of trust and openness. Many business analysts agree. But people are starting to look at Facebook and Google and wonder how they are more trustworthy or transparent than Standard Oil or U.S. Steel, the Gilded Age corporate behemoths.Thiel appears to have a political and social viewpoint grounded on a subversion of libertarian principles, in which what’s good for him, or his companies, is, by extension, a public good. Hence, destroying Gawker is not just revenge or a kind of political act, it’s in Thiel’s words “philanthropic.”Regardless of what you think of the Bollea v. Gawker case, it stretches the idea of what people usually think of as charity. Litigation finance is typically a business venture. It doesn’t become charity because a wealthy person uses it as a template for a personal crusade and then insists he’s doing everyone else a favor.John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, plutocrats of the Gilded Age, used their money against their enemies, to be sure, enemies that included newspapers and magazines that disagreed with them for all sorts of reasons.They also engaged in philanthropy and public works. Carnegie, for example, funded and built the New York Public Library system. Unlike Thiel, the Gilded Age robber barons knew the difference between their businesses and charitable endeavors.In this way, Thiel epitomizes why polls show people losing trust in Silicon Valley. Many are growing disillusioned because they bought what Silicon Valley sold them: an idealistic and almost utopian vision in which the technological advances of the Information Age would change the world -- or at least the Western world -- for the universal good.Instead, what they see is powerful corporations and billionaires acting like -- lo and behold -- powerful corporations and billionaires. Critics see the realized visions of powerful Silicon Valley companies benefiting mostly those companies and their executives.This may not be fair. After all, the public has benefited quite a lot from Silicon Valley’s technological advances. Google has allowed us to travel the world and get almost any information while sitting at our desks. Thiel’s PayPal helped democratize currency and commerce, and also made it easier to donate to charity. But it’s easy for people to forget how far they’ve come. Especially when measured against the virtual utopia that they were sold with almost religious fervor by Silicon Valley.The tech billionaires didn’t make their money by founding public institutions; indeed, some of them look more like the new robber barons. Maybe it’s time for Silicon Valley to tone things down. To admit that, no, the Valley can’t solve all human problems -- not even close -- and never will. That may actually help rebuild some of the lost trust between it and the public.As for Gawker, it disseminated a sex tape of a retired pro wrestler. Let’s not pretend that the website did it as part of a great journalistic mission. Gawker did it to lure eyes to its website while smugly saying the First Amendment sheltered it.But at least Gawker did this openly. It didn’t post the sex tape on another website that it was secretly backing because of something Hogan did to upset it 10 years ago. Gawker didn’t call it philanthropy.The Gawker litigation will stand, or be struck down, on its constitutional merits. Thiel is right when he said it’s not for him to decide the fate of Gawker -- that if people want to see more of the Gawker brand of media, they’ll rally around Gawker.The problem isn’t the way Thiel used his money. It’s his pretensions about it.But most of all, the problem is that we expected anything different.(Keith Emmer is an attorney and media consultant.)"

Essentially, Trump got angry at journalists for doing their job.Rather shared his thoughts Wednesday on Facebook:It's no surprise to see the 84-year-old news icon take a stand against Trump and defend the need for a free, thorough and critical press.Rather himself was a reporter embroiled in conflict during an election season. During the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, he was punched after attempting to question a Georgia delegate about police riots and Chicago Mayor Richard Daley's war on antiwar protesters.Rather and Trump have a somewhat contentious past, as the real estate mogul in 2008 called the anchor a ""loser"" with ""low ratings.""Rather's post about Trump's ""personal and vicious"" rhetoric serves as a reminder to the press that they should keep asking the tough questions, regardless of Trump's insistence otherwise.

Nichols was practically canonized for not allowing NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to give inadequate answers to her questions about Ray Rice's domestic violence. Her integrity and talent, combined with her industry-wide respect, caused ESPN, her employer from 2004 to 2013, to lure her back from CNN, where she had worked the past three years. ESPN offered Nichols an opportunity to help design and host their new weekday NBA show, ""The Jump."" She'll be traveling for the next few weeks as the show follows the Finals, but something at ESPN's home base has caught the her eye: new faces at the anchor desk.

Their diversity policy is outlined in detail online, and a 2012 study by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport found that ESPN is, in fact, leading the way while many other sports outfits continue to employ an overwhelming amount of white men (this in and of itself can cause serious editorial flaws). Speaking to Nichols over the phone a few days before the NBA Finals, she explained how ESPN has and hasn't changed since she left in 2013, why the NBA is such a progressive league and much more. The Huffington Post: Why did you go back to ESPN after a successful run at CNN?I came back because I had such a great offer to start this show and be a part of designing what it will be like. And to be able to talk about basketball for a half hour every day on TV -- it’s a great feeling, and I’ve been thrilled with the decision. You’ve covered many different sports, leagues and competitions over your career. But your new show, “The Jump,” is exclusively about basketball. Why hone in on one sport?The nice thing about the NBA and covering it is it’s such a fun sport and there’s always so much going on. It’s also a lens to talk about a lot of other stuff. The NBA had the first active gay player in a men’s professional sport. The NBA had the first female assistant coach — the first woman on a professional men’s sports coaching staff in the four major sports. They have so many smart, interesting athletes and the league is very progressive, and that’s important to me.There are so many issues that sort of cross through the NBA lens. Yes, it’s a basketball show, so we get to talk about really fun, goofy basketball stuff, we talk about hardcore-type stuff, but also a lot of big picture issues too. It’s all of that. I sometimes say that the show feels like a podcast on TV. It’s not a lot of people presenting points to each other. It’s more of a conversation you might have with your friends in a group text or a podcast, but you happen to be having that group text conversation and Tracy McGrady is one of the guys having it with you.In the past year or so, there’s been a lot of high-profile talent that’s exited ESPN. There’s been layoffs in other parts of the company. But from your perspective, what's changed at ESPN since you left the first time? I know it’s everybody’s job in the media to create these big narratives, but I think the pillars of ESPN are kind of still the same. It’s by far the most popular place to go on TV if you want to watch sports and talk about sports and hear about sports. In its simplest terms, the biggest thing about ESPN is sort of still the biggest thing about ESPN. A lot of the faces changed during the entire time I worked at ESPN. And what I’ve noticed the most are the faces that are coming to the forefront now are newer and more diverse. If you look at the afternoon, where I’m hosting a half-hour show, Michelle Steele hosts a half-hour show after me, and then Dan LeBatard and his Spanish-speaking dad and Bomani Jones have a half-hour show after that. So you’re talking about a 90-minute block in the heart of the afternoon of ESPN where the anchor of each show is not a white male over the age of 45. Is that a talent drain, or is that a change-up of some of the faces that you see on ESPN? You have a more diverse group of faces. We still have so many talented people there, and a lot of them are white males over 45. Don’t take this as, “Oh, I hate” — we have some great white males over the age of 45. It’s not an endangered species by any stretch. We’re getting a few new, diverse faces in the mix. I think that’s a good thing.With your Roger Goodell and Floyd Mayweather interviews as perhaps the best examples, your work has been highly praised for holding men accountable when domestic violence and sports becomes intertwined. Why do you put your neck out and ask the hard, but necessary questions when some reporters just won’t go there? To me, asking fair questions has never seemed scary. I’m never a big fan of the “gotcha” style of questions. I think questions are supposed to be a quest for information, so the best questions aren’t the ones that make some big point in the question. The best questions are the ones where you’re really trying to get to the truth. If that’s what you’re doing — I think there are a lot of journalists out there who do that kind of thing, and I’ve always felt that’s the job. I’ve never felt bad about [asking hard questions].Nichols pressed Mayweather on his history of domestic abuse, and didn’t relent when he ducked her questions.It’s upsetting to think about, but public perception of these domestic violence cases involving beloved athletes seem to hinge on photo or video evidence. Why is that?It comes down to really simple, fair stuff. We don’t want the people we cheer for to be athletes who beat their wives and girlfriends and beat their kids. These aren’t things that are okay. And asking the people who are in charge of those sports leagues — or the athletes themselves — to be held accountable for that doesn’t seem to me to be some big monumental thing to ask. What’s it like being one of the most recognizable women — a celebrity, even — in sports media? I’m always psyched when people seem to care about the things I care about. If someone is excited to come up and talk to me about the NBA, I like talking about the NBA! If someone wants to come up and talk to me about the NFL and how it holds its players accountable or what it does with this immense public trust that we’ve given it, then I’m interested in talking about that stuff. Those are the topics that interest me. It’s funny how you brought up two different sports leagues in separate lights. The NFL is often criticized for its lack of transparency. With the NBA, however, they’ve been very transparent with player discipline and refereeing. How do you feel about these leagues and how transparent they are with their operations?As a journalist, I’m a pretty big fan of transparency. [Laughs.] I love the way the NBA does business. I think it’s really smart. I think recognizing that we live in a time where information is so readily available is operating in a way that is forward-thinking. If you’re talking about something as simple as the referee reports, I know that there are some former players, current players and even coaches who aren’t crazy about them. They feel like, “Oh gee, what good is this now to tell me that I was right?” But I think at home, you have access to 14 different camera angles and we all know whether they made the right call or not. So for the NBA not to sit there and pretend that they made the right call if they didn’t, all that helps build trust with them. Instead, I think them coming clean, as a viewer, I feel better about the fact that they’re being straight with me. As a viewer, did you think the Golden State Warriors could climb back from the 3-1 deficit? I said after the team went down 3-1, the fun of the NBA playoffs, especially when you get to this level, is that you don’t know what’s going to happen. There’s a reason we watch sports: We want to be surprised. You know in a movie, Will Smith is gonna win and the aliens are gonna lose, right? In the Conference Finals, you don’t know which team is Will Smith and which team is the alien. Do you have any predictions for the NBA Finals?I don’t, because I don’t make predictions.

15,POLITICS,This Puerto Rico Debt Commission Could Be The Island's Trump Card,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-debt-audit-commission-interim-report_us_57504ab2e4b0eb20fa0ceadb,Now the panel just needs the funding to complete its investigation.,2016-06-02,"The La Perla shanty town is seen in the Old City of San Juan, Puerto Rico. A debt crisis has strangled the island's economy.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57504c04130000fb073835f6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Much of Puerto Rico’s debt may have been issued illegally and requires further investigation, a territory government-sponsored commission report released on Thursday finds.The Puerto Rico Commission for the Comprehensive Audit of the Public Credit announced its initial conclusions in an interim report that functions as an application for the government funding needed to perform a full audit of the island’s unpayable $70 billion debt.The preliminary inquiry's recommendations could affect the debate in Congress over how best to assist the island, bolstering progressive criticism of bipartisan aid legislation and the fiscal oversight board it would create.If a complete audit of the island’s public debt concludes that portions of its arrears were unconstitutionally issued or involved other legally dubious accounting techniques, Puerto Rico could, in theory, claim it has the right to nullify those obligations. Such a development would greatly strengthen the U.S. territory’s bargaining position with its creditors.That is precisely why the commission’s members, which include 17 Puerto Ricans from different backgrounds, are so anxious to finance a full investigation. (Although a 2015 Puerto Rican law created the commission with the goal of unearthing the financial and political origins of the island’s debt burden, it currently lacks any official funding.) “To get a search warrant you need probable cause. We have identified probable cause,” said Roberto Pagan, president of the debt audit commission and head of the Puerto Rico chapter of the Service Employees International Union.With in-kind labor contributions from economists, SEIU and other stakeholders, a “methodology and planning committee” established by the commission was nonetheless able to conduct a limited review of some of Puerto Rico’s recent bond issuances for the purposes of the interim report.The “probable cause” the interim report established is primarily its identification of various constitutional clauses that it suspects the two 2014 and 2015 debt offerings it examined have violated, based on its examination of two 2014 and 2015 debt offerings.The Puerto Rican constitution bars the territory from taking on debts that make its high-priority general obligation bonds amount to the equivalent of 15 percent of internal revenues, according to the commission. It estimates that Puerto Rico is spending between 14 and 25 percent of its revenues on debt.Among the commission’s main arguments for greater funding of its work is that it would like to explore whether recent debt issuances have violated the constitution as a result.If the commission determined that some debts were illegally issued above a limit, and Puerto Rico tried to nullify them, the island could face paralyzing litigation from bondholders.But the interim report cites Detroit’s 2013 bankruptcy as evidence that there is legal precedent in the U.S. for a dramatic write-down of debts issued above a legal limit. Judge Steven Rhodes, who presided over the Michigan city's bankruptcy, did not directly rule on the nullification of a certain class of debts that Detroit argued were issued illegally, but he said its claims had “substantial merit.” Rhodes ultimately greenlit a settlement between the city and its creditors that severely limited that particular tranche of debt that creditors could recover.“It is the experience in Detroit, combined with the observations that were observed in the finances of Puerto Rico that lead the Methodology and Planning Committee to recommend further investigation of this matter to the commission,” the interim report states.Other questions the interim report raises include whether the island and the financial professionals that enabled it to borrow for so many years adhered to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s financial disclosure rules. The report notes that six weeks after Puerto Rico issued the 2014 General Obligation bond, the island announced that it would not be able to provide updated financial disclosures in a timely fashion. If lenders knew how financially precarious Puerto Rico was it would not have lent to it as freely, the report implies.The pre-audit report was released Thursday in order to meet the commission’s obligation to communicate with the public frequently and transparently, according to SEIU’s Pagan.But the commission’s members also worry that the PROMESA (Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability) Act making its way through Congress will supercede them, Pagan said. The draft legislation appears to make no distinction between debt issued legally or illegally, he noted, and its establishment of a seven-person fiscal oversight board could render the commission’s authority moot.Progressive critics of PROMESA may find that the commission’s recommendations heighten their concerns about the legislation.Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), among the most vocal opponents of the Puerto Rico act in Congress, cited the illegality of some of the island’s debt in his initial call to kill the bill in April.“If any of Puerto Rico’s debt was incurred in violation of its Constitution it must be immediately set aside,” Sanders said in a statement."

Several polls show the race tightening and Clinton is hoping to stave off an embarrassing loss in California, where Sanders has been vigorously campaigning. On Thursday, he planned a rally with actress Susan Sarandon in Modesto, California.Clinton has already delivered several speeches on foreign policy and national security. Her address in San Diego will not break new policy ground, but will mainly respond to Trump's recent comments, her campaign said. The former U.S. senator from New York will argue that Trump's statement that he would be willing to talk to Kim Jong Un, made in a Reuters interview in May, has only emboldened the North Korean leader, Sullivan said.A column this week in DPRK Today, one of North Korea’s state mouthpieces, described Trump as a ""wise politician"" and Clinton as ""thick-headed Hillary.""""Donald Trump’s statements about North Korea show that he has more interest in making Kim Jong Un like him than backing up our friends and allies in the region,"" Sullivan said, noting that South Korea has worked with the United States on missile defense.Trump's remarks on the decades-old NATO alliance of 28 nations will also elicit a response from Clinton, Sullivan said. The New York businessman has said member nations should pay for their own defense to ease the U.S. financial burden and that the alliance itself needs reconfiguring.Sullivan, who worked with Clinton at the U.S. State Department, said burden-sharing is ""not a novel point"" within NATO and that Clinton will highlight her record of getting allies to “step up” and share defense costs.Clinton, however, would not walk away from the alliance, which coordinates with the United States on counterterrorism, nuclear proliferation and other issues, Sullivan said.Other states holding nominating contests on June 7 are Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota.California Governor Jerry Brown this week endorsed Clinton in the Democratic contest, saying she was the “only path forward” to “stop the dangerous candidacy of Donald Trump.”(Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Leslie Adler)"

Subtract $2,400",Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/veterinary-salary-calculator-women_us_574dea67e4b0757eaeb0e328,Why a salary calculator upset an awful lot of women.,2016-06-01,Here's the full explanation that's been added to the calculator.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574debc81600002a00f94e59.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The American Veterinary Medical Association, a professional association that represents most of the country’s animal doctors, apologized last week for posting a salary calculator that assumed female vets would make $2,400 less than their male counterparts in their first job out of school.The group clarified that, of course, it doesn’t believe that men should make more than women, but was merely trying to give students an accurate picture of what to expect in the job market.“You should be upset over the gender disparity in starting salaries, just as we at the AVMA are upset by it. Unfortunately, it’s a reality, and one we have reported on in the past, just never in calculator format,” the group said in a lengthy statement. “The AVMA actively encourages students who use this calculator to run a few scenarios and then utilize all the information gained to strategically advocate for themselves during salary negotiations.”The pay disparity is particularly galling, considering that a majority of veterinarians -- 58 percent -- are women, according to the association's own data. Indeed, about 80 percent of the students enrolled in veterinary school are women.Intended to help veterinary students hone their career choices, the association's calculator was devised by four economists -- two of them women -- using statistics from the organization’s salary surveys dating back 10 years. Their calculations consider, among other things, whether you will specialize in pets versus “food animals,” or if you’ll work for the government or private industry. (The group said that race and ethnicity did not statistically affect pay, according to its data, but age did.) The calculator also considers where the vet would be practicing -- as pay goes up in bigger urban centers.These are all rather run-of-the-mill factors that would raise or lower a new doctor’s pay, according to the data. Gender unfortunately also plays a role in how much veterinarians make, the organization’s CEO, Ron DeHaven, told The Huffington Post. “We think it’s totally unfair,” he said. “On average women makes $2,400 less in starting salary than men.”Still, when students used the calculator it was hard to tell whether or not the group was endorsing the pay gap. The reaction was pretty hostile. In response to a Facebook post about the calculator, commenters were bewildered and angry.“This took us by surprise,” DeHaven said.DeHaven said the group initially unveiled the calculator at a student symposium, where they could explain its context. “We’re not advocating women should accept less, we’re saying historically that’s what happened,” he said. “When we presented it, the [crowd] thought it was great.”The group has since updated the calculator with an explanatory box offering more context. “Knowledge is power,” the box says, in part.Like pretty much all women in nearly all professions, veterinarians face a pay gap throughout their careers. Female vets in private practice had a median income of $88,000 in 2011, according to a report the AVMA released in 2013. Men had a median income of $112,000. It may be that women who run their own practices are working fewer hours, or taking more time with each animal, the authors of a piece on the veterinary pay gap speculate in an article in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Gender bias also plays a role, the authors said. And finally, more older vets are male and are the ones pulling in more money.Women outside of private practice (working for government or companies) made $112,000 compared to $136,000 for men. Veterinarians also face some unique challenges -- the cost of going to veterinary school is as high as medical school, but animal doctors don't make the same kind of money as human doctors. The average starting salary for a vet is about $70,000 a year, DeHaven said. But the average student graduates with about $140,000 in debt. The idea that if women know about the gender gap, they could negotiate their way out of it, seems fairly dubious. First, there's evidence that women do negotiate just as much as men. Second, studies have also shown that women who push for higher pay are not often perceived as well as their male counterparts. Third, a high percentage of veterinarians work in private practice -- i.e., for themselves.DeHaven emphasized that the calculator was also meant to draw employers' attention to the issue.There are myriad complex reasons for the gender pay gap -- a supposed difference in negotiating tactics is just one factor. Women also may choose lower paying jobs or work reduced hours in order to carve out more time for themselves at home. Also jobs that attract more women tend to pay less well. DeHaven didn't offer reasons for the pay gap in his field. ""I hesitate to speculate why."" "

""It's time we finally made Social Security more generous and increased its benefits so that today's retirees and future generations get the dignified retirement that they've earned,"" Obama said during a speech in Elkhart, Indiana. ""And we can start paying for it by asking the wealthiest Americans to contribute a little bit more,"" Obama said. ""They can afford it. I can afford it."" The announcement represents a major evolution in the president’s public position on Social Security and a coup for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, which increasingly views benefits expansion as a core element of its agenda.Obama has previously supported cuts to Social Security retirement benefits as part of an elusive legislative ""Grand Bargain,"" which he sought in negotiations with congressional Republicans during key moments of budgetary brinksmanship. The proposed deals would have supposedly paired the cuts with revenue increases favored by liberals.Support for increasing Social Security benefits for vulnerable groups has sometimes been part of broader proposals to reform the program -- proposals that also include cuts. In response to pressure from Sanders and progressive groups, Clinton clarified in February that she both supports increases and would not agree to cuts elsewhere in the program.It is not clear whether Obama’s Wednesday speech means he would likewise rule out cuts in all circumstances.Obama did not address specific changes to the program, but his remarks about the wealthy indicate he might support lifting the cap on earnings taxable for Social Security. Currently, only the first $118,500 of payroll income is taxed for Social Security benefits. Although the cap rises annually to keep pace with average wage growth, proposals by liberal Democrats have focused on lifting the cap so that it captures a greater share of income, because the percentage of earnings subject to the tax has declined in recent decades.Obama expressed support for lifting the cap as part of a solution to the program’s long-term funding shortfall during a Democratic presidential debate in September 2007, but not in the context of increasing benefits.Richard Fiesta, the executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, a group of union retirees, praised the president's speech Wednesday.“The Alliance advocated the expansion of Social Security benefits for years and we are pleased that the President agrees with us,” Fiesta said in a statement. “It’s time for Congress to pass one of the many bills that has already been introduced to make a more secure retirement for current and future retirees.”This article has been updated to include Sanders' statement."

Starr said he left his new post as a ""matter of conscience,"" according to the outlet. ""I have to and I willingly do accept responsibility,"" Starr exclusively told ESPN in an interview that aired Wednesday. ""The captain goes down with the ship."" He will, however, continue as a law professor at his “beloved Baylor Law School,"" he said.Prior to his tenure at Baylor, the world's largest Baptist university, Starr served as an independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton. His scrutiny of Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky made Starr a household name in the mid-’90s. Starr and other members of Baylor leadership were sharply criticized for failing to seriously investigate reports that male athletes were raping female students.In the interview, Starr acknowledged that per NCAA bylaws, as president, he is ultimately responsible for the football program's failures. But he told ESPN he was unaware of the massive, systemic failures within the program regarding allegations players had sexually assaulted women. Starr repeatedly said he was “behind a veil of ignorance” with regard to the sexual assault problems. He also highlighted Baylor’s status as a dry campus and insisted that most of the attacks occurred off campus.The university's failure to investigate sexual assault allegations was made public last week in a report by the law firm Pepper Hamilton, which was tasked with conducting an independent investigation into Baylor's practices. Moments after the report was released, Baylor removed Starr as president and made him chancellor. Football coach Art Briles was also removed and is expected to be fired.Among the most damning findings were that Baylor's football coaches put the safety of women on campus at risk, worked to discredit the women who accused players of sexual assault and reinforced to the players ""an overall perception that football was above the rules.""When asked on ESPN if sexual violence was an issue at Baylor, Starr said it ""really hasn’t been, to my knowledge, until August 2015,” when former football player Sam Ukwuachu was convicted of rape.In 2012, Ukwuachu was accused of raping a female soccer player and was found guilty last year of one count of sexual assault. In March, a former Baylor student filed a negligence lawsuit in federal court accusing the school of ignoring her rape and acting ""indifferently."" The lawsuit claims both Briles and the athletic director, Ian McCaw, were informed of the accusations and made no efforts to investigate. McCaw has since resigned.Baylor released a statement Wednesday afternoon thanking Starr for his service and expressing regret for the university's role in the sexual assault scandal:As we move forward, we will continue to take the actions that progress the university and its leadership toward an environment of resolute accountability and responsibility as we relentlessly pursue the mission of Baylor University.This article has been updated with a statement from Baylor University. Language has been amended to reflect that Starr's investigation initially focused on the Clintons' Whitewater real estate venture and later pivoted to the president's involvement with Monica Lewinsky."

Citing his own research, actor Mark Ruffalo has said Flint residents shouldn't trust earlier government assurances that the water is safe for washing because of chemicals like chloroform, which is a byproduct of chlorine disinfection. ""The news is pretty good when it comes to disinfection byproducts -- they're really not all that high,"" said David Reckhow, a water expert and professor of civil engineering with the University of Massachusetts Amherst, at a press conference in Flint on Tuesday.Reckhow joined Wayne State University's Shawn McElmurry and Virginia Tech's Marc Edwards and Amy Pruden in Flint to publicize their analysis of water samples their teams had recently taken from local homes.Some residents say the water is causing rashes and hair loss, but the scientists said their data shows that the amount of disinfection byproducts in Flint's water is comparable to that of other cities. Yet the water still has too much lead, a deadly neurotoxin used in water pipes in Flint and hundreds of other American cities. When Flint changed its water source from Detroit to the Flint River in 2014, it failed to treat the new water to prevent it from corroding the pipes, resulting in more lead in the water and in Flint children's bodies.Lead exposure at a young age can cause permanent brain damage and lifelong behavioral problems, though exposure hasn't been associated with skin problems. The city switched back to using Detroit's water system in October, but lead levels haven't declined enough yet. Some Flint residents have continued to say the water is hurting their skin. Water Defense, a nonprofit Ruffalo founded that usually focuses on groundwater contamination, came to Flint in January and said it had detected dangerous levels of disinfection byproducts in Flint bathtubs -- chemicals the group claimed the government had missed because it was overly focused on lead. (The government does, in fact, require water systems to test for disinfection byproducts like chloroform.) Water Defense's Scott Smith claimed the WaterBug, a sponge product he invented using his own proprietary foam technology, could better detect the contaminants in Flint's water. The company that makes the foam previously told The Huffington Post that Smith gets royalties on sales of the material.Reckhow said WaterBugs were ""not vetted at all"" prior to their introduction in Flint, and also questioned Water Defense's sampling methods, saying the contaminants detected by WaterBugs could have come from household air rather than water.""In order to do due diligence as a scientist, you really need to have a control,"" Reckhow said, adding that the nonprofit should have devoted a separate sponge to test the air. Virginia Tech's Edwards helped expose the Flint water crisis last year by independently testing water samples for lead with a team of grad students and local volunteers. He has harshly criticized Ruffalo and Water Defense on the blog he set up to post sample results last year. If Flint residents don't want to use their water for bathing, Edwards said, they should make that decision independently of anything Water Defense has claimed.""You have to look at the credibility of the people making these claims,"" Edwards said. ""They don't have a science background.""Ruffalo and Smith did not respond to a request for comment. We discuss the safety of the water in Flint, Michigan on the So That Happened podcast this week.

The shooting left two people dead, including the gunman, and another six wounded.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574f0161120000250089504f.jpeg?cache=xNlSIKHLgg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Army veteran suspected of going on a shooting rampage Sunday in west Houston was able to fire off 212 shots before a SWAT sniper killed him, authorities said Tuesday.Dionisio Garza III, 26, fatally shot his first victim, 56-year-old Eugene Linscomb, with a pistol, before picking up an AR-15 assault-style rifle and spraying bullets into responding police cruisers and a Houston Police Department helicopter, officials said at a press conference.By the time the mayhem ended, Garza had shot and injured six people, including two officers. All six are expected to survive.The tragedy was among the more than 150 mass shootings that have occurred in the U.S. so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people -- not including the shooter -- are shot and/or killed in a single event, at the same general time and location. Other media outlets use a stricter definition of mass shooting, only counting higher profile, less common episodes in which three or more victims are fatally shot in a public space.Regardless of how we characterize this outburst of gun violence, the incident again highlights problems in our mental health care system and easy access to the military-style firearms used in a number of recent deadly massacres.It's still unclear what led Garza to travel from his home in California to Texas, but authorities say he arrived in Houston on Saturday with plans to meet friends. Police believe he may have camped out overnight at Memorial Auto and Tire before ambushing Linscomb shortly after he arrived at the shop.Houston Police Lt. John McGalin said at a press conference Tuesday that he thought Garza had chosen his specific location because it offered a tactical advantage to shoot at responding officers.""He had access to three corners. He was backed up against a fence, so he didn't have to worry about anyone getting behind him,"" said McGalin.Garza opened fire on the first responding officer, forcing him to retreat and call for backup.""Our primary responding officer is lucky to be alive and ... unhurt,"" the Houston Police Department wrote in a Facebook post.In the nearly hour-long firefight that ensued, Garza shot two constables, hitting one's bulletproof vest and the other in the hand. Another bullet struck a gas pump at a nearby station, starting a fire.A civilian later identified as John Wilson, 30, also reportedly attempted to stop the shooter with his own firearm, but, like police, appeared to be overpowered by Garza.“What he did was very brave, but officers are trained in these active shooter situations, and obviously he wasn’t able to engage,” said acting Houston Police Chief Martha Montalvo. “He was outgunned and probably outmaneuvered, and as far as his tactical training, wasn’t at the same speed as our suspect. Just call the police and let us do what we have to do, and [do] not put yourself in a situation where you become a victim.”Wilson was shot in the leg but survived.A SWAT sniper was able to get a clear shot at Garza after a local resident let officers enter a house that overlooked the location.Garza's family members believe he suffered from PTSD after returning from active duty in 2013, and say that something in him ""snapped"" in the weeks before the shooting.""He did two tours in Afghanistan. I think he was proud to be in the military, but I know he went through a lot,"" Garza's stepmother told ABC 7. ""I think he was always haunted by everything that happened, what he saw.""When Garza returned from duty, he began posting anti-Islamic comments on social media, his cousin, Ahmad Alkuteifani, told ABC 13. In recent months, Garza had tweeted comments condemning Muslims, touted conspiracy theories about the end of the world and expressed support for presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.Alkuteifani also suggested his cousin may have chosen to carry out his attack in Texas because of its loose gun laws, which allow people to openly carry firearms like the AR-15 he used. Authorities have not yet said how Garza obtained his guns. But semi-automatic weapons like the ones used by mass shooters in San Bernardino, California, Newtown, Connecticut, and Aurora, Colorado, are widely available across the U.S., except in a few states that have passed legislation restricting certain types of assault weapons.AR-15s are modeled off the standard-issue U.S. military rifle that's been in use since the Vietnam War. Their magazines typically hold 30 rounds, but can be legally outfitted with high-capacity magazines in most states. They're accurate at a range of hundreds of yards, making them a preferred firearm for sport shooters and hunters. In fact, they're the ""most popular rifle"" in the U.S., according to the National Rifle Association.With millions of AR-15s in civilian hands and hundreds of thousands of new military-style rifles flooding the market each year, according to recent manufacturer reports, the overwhelming majority of these weapons will never be used in a crime. But when they are, it's clear that their firepower can make the results especially devastating. If more bullets had found their targets in Houston on Sunday, that reality would be even more tragically evident."
25,POLITICS,Here's The Truest Thing Donald Trump Has Said This Election,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-financial-disclosures_us_574f058ce4b0eb20fa0c642f,Disclosure laws in this country really do suck.,2016-06-01,"Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump has five liabilities above $50 million. At least two of those $50 million loans are to foreign-owned Deutsche Bank, which has tried to work around U.S. banking regulations. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574f08751200002500895060.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has lied so many times this presidential election campaign that the very value of truth in politics seems meaningless. But there’s one thing the presumptive GOP nominee and his campaign have said with uncharacteristic correctness: Candidate financial disclosure laws suck.By law, candidates for federal office and members of Congress have to file a financial disclosure detailing their assets and liabilities. It’s a key element of transparency that helps prevent politicians from pushing policies that further their own pecuniary interests.But don’t believe for one second that these disclosures really tell you anything about a politician’s wealth. What’s required in these documents sheds little light, the loopholes so egregious there’s hardly any reliability and the ways to mislead so numerous that it all amounts, basically, to a blind-faith, best-guess.It was in that spirit that Trump released his own financial disclosure last month, providing a picture of his wealth consistent with what he’s said all along -- namely: I get to be worth whatever I say I’m worth.So bad are the financial disclosure laws that, according to the documents, Trump’s net worth is somewhere in between the billions he claims and the hundreds of millions he may be in debt.The biggest problem with the businessman's disclosure is perhaps the biggest problem overall. The ranges in the disclosures start between $1 and $1,000. But they soon grow exponentially from those small differences to ranges as broad as $5 million to $25 million, $25 million to $50 million, then finally $50 million and above. It’s in that last category where you’ll find Trump Tower, which the reality TV personality claims would fetch $2 billion on the open market, but is counted as $50 million.“This report was not designed for a man of Mr. Trump's massive wealth,” his campaign said in a press release last July, unintentionally reaching the zenith of truth in a campaign marked by falsehoods.It’s undeniable that the ultra-rich seem to be a second thought in these disclosures, but perhaps even more troubling is how unconcerned the law seems to be with someone like Trump taking out massive loans.He has five liabilities above $50 million. Two of those (at least) $50 million loans are to foreign-owned Deutsche Bank, which raises its own set of thorny ethical issues, as Mother Jones points out. The man who could potentially be the next president could owe $100 million -- almost certainly more, in fact -- to a bank that has tried to work around U.S. banking regulations. We don’t know how much Trump actually owes. And because we don’t know the extent of those liabilities -- or his assets -- there’s no way to reliably determine his net worth from these documents.Trump claims his net worth is greater than $10 billion, while the respected business magazine Forbes, who devoted unprecedented resources to the question, says it’s closer to $4.5 billion. (Forbes, for the record, says Trump Tower, after the $100 million loan on it is paid off, has a net value of roughly $530 million.)Whatever the real worth, Trump is right; these financial disclosures don’t provide an accurate picture of wealth -- not when someone like him or Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) have multiple assets and liabilities in those max categories.At those top levels of wealth, where precision in a politician’s finances probably matter more than nailing down whether a Congressman has a credit card with a balance of less than $1,000, the disclosures are wholly inadequate.But there are plenty more problems with personal financial disclosures. For House lawmakers and candidates going for that chamber, one notable issue is that bank accounts not gathering interest aren’t required to be disclosed. A member could potentially put millions in a non-interest account and never tell anyone, functionally meaning a food stamp recipient goes through more stringent financial accounting than a member of Congress.In the Senate and for executive branch employees, you only need to disclose a bank account if it has more than $5,000 in it or generated more than $200 in income, which is still more lenient than the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.Members of Congress also don’t need to disclose their personal residences as assets -- or their mortgages as liabilities. They don’t even need to disclose a vacation home, if they’re not renting it out.All these loopholes make it impossible to actually know where a politician’s money comes from. Take, for example, the case of 27-year-old congressional candidate Justin Fareed. The Republican was aged 25 when he first ran for Congress last cycle and loaned himself nearly $200,000. Fareed had only been in the workforce for a couple of years and had made less than $100,000 in total income over that period.The “third generation rancher” reported in 2014 that he had six assets with a minimum worth of $153,006 and a maximum value of $396,000. After loaning himself the money, Fareed reported in 2015 that his assets had appreciated to between $217,006 and $581,000. This was while he was making $5,000 in all of 2014 and $25,000 as of May 2015.That may raise some questions, but within the broad ranges of financial disclosure, Fareed could come close to covering the expenses of his campaign, though his campaign told The Huffington Post that the money came from regular disbursements out of his ""intergenerational trust fund."" That’s presumably listed on his financial disclosure as “Northern Trust,” but the disclosure doesn’t designate what exactly the trust is and Fareed doesn’t break out what investments are contained in that asset.That may raise some questions, but within the broad ranges of financial disclosure, Fareed could come close to covering the expenses of his campaign, though his campaign told The Huffington Post that the money came from regular disbursements out of his ""intergenerational trust fund."" That’s presumably listed on his financial disclosure as “Northern Trust,” but the disclosure doesn’t designate what exactly the trust is and Fareed doesn’t break out what investments are contained in that asset.There may be some clarity in Fareed's 2016 disclosure, which was due May 15, but he hasn't filed it. The late fees on blowing off the disclosure will come to a whopping $200.While such finances might raise some eyebrows, there are plenty of possible explanations that make it impossible to know where Fareed's money came from. He co-owns a home with his parents, so he could have taken out a home equity line of credit on his personal residence, which he is not obligated to disclose. Candidates can also take loans out from a retirement account, which does not need to be disclosed and, miraculously, does not lower the reported value of the asset.If the point of these disclosures is to give the public a broad picture of a politicians investments, that’s one thing. Generally, the public can get a sense of someone’s financial interests through these documents. But it’s impossible to really know anything.“The truth is the public can’t make a complete judgment with incomplete information,” Adam Rappaport, the chief counsel and assistant director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told HuffPost. “And that’s what we have. We have some information, but not enough, and not enough precision.”Trump’s latest financial disclosure is full of incomplete accounting, as Politico noted this week. Getting him to his self-estimated 11-figure net worth requires the sort of blind faith Trump demanded from the press on Tuesday.In response to a number of questions about Trump’s financial disclosure, campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks told Politico, “The report speaks for itself.”As the campaign noted in July, it doesn’t.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S. "

An alien planet, that is.A new theory published this week suggests that the much-debated ""Planet 9"" isn't just a new member of our solar system, but rather an exoplanet. There is evidence that Planet 9 -- if it exists -- was kidnapped by the sun from its original host star.As indicated by a new computer simulation developed by astronomers at Lund University in Sweden, our sun may have pulled the exoplanet from its host star as the two passed each other. ""Planet 9 may very well have been 'shoved' by other planets, and when it ended up in an orbit that was too wide around its own star, our sun may have taken the opportunity to steal and capture Planet 9 from its original star,"" researcher Alexander Mustill said in a news release. ""When the sun later departed from the stellar cluster in which it was born, Planet 9 was stuck in an orbit around the sun.""Earlier this year, researchers discovered the presence of a ninth planet by studying the orbits of icy objects beyond Neptune. They noticed anomalies in the objects' orbits and tracked them -- leading them to the gravitational pull of Planet 9.The existence of Planet 9 is still unproved, and images have ""remained elusive."" But astronomers haven't been twiddling their thumbs. They have come up with a few hypotheses for what the planet may look like.There's much more work to be done to figure out if this is just a theory or the real deal. So, until we know for sure, we'll just keep thinking our solar system is a master thief. "
