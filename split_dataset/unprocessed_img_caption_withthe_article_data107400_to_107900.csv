Frieden urged hospitals to watch for patients with Ebola symptoms who have traveled from the tree Ebola stricken African countries.

Available as an app from iTunes, it has been dowloaded 25 million times. Now, with Ebola, Plague Inc., as it is called, appears to have morphed from virtual into actual reality. ""I will say that in the thirty years I've been working in public health, the only thing like this has been AIDS, and we have to work now so that this is not the world's next AIDS."" After they showed Dr. Thomas Frieden, former NYC Dept of Health Commissioner (2002-2009) and now Director of CDC, making this statement on the evening news, my life partner Arnie and I just looked at each other. Clearly, the spread of Ebola is already a public health catastrophe. Meanwhile, too much of what we're still hearing from public health officials is weak reassurances and advice to stay calm. It put into relief my own advisories to the gay community to try to stay calm and avoid panic in the earliest period of AIDS. Though panic is never a good thing, I was wrong then to be so cautious, and the health care officials who keep telling us to keep calm now are similarly wrong. With AIDS, only Larry Kramer somehow gleaned the true measure of what was happening, and the alarm he raised pulled out all the stops. CDC quickly called the emerging epidemic ""the most important new public health problem in the U.S."" Simultaneously, however, CDC AIDS Task Force reps balked on issuing stronger advisories. In the absence of certainty of the cause of the epidemic, and to avoid political and civil liberties confrontations and panic, they retreated from more substantial leadership. Alas, too many of us in the gay community took our lead from CDC. The resulting excessive caution and inadequacy in issuing tougher guidelines based on probabilities, like the sluggishness of the New York Times in giving the epidemic priority coverage, is well-documented in Randy Shilts's And The Band Played On as well as in Kramer's own The Normal Heart and Reports from the holocaust.So what's to be done for Ebloa? Airports have begun screening international passengers for fevers. That's like the advice we were giving early on for what was later identified as HIV and AIDS, to limit the number of different sexual partners and try to make sure those partners were healthy. Vastly inadequate. Consider the case of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, who traveled to the U.S. from Liberia to Texas and is now dead. He would not have been detected either in Africa or the U.S. because he was not exhibiting fever or any other signs of the virus when traveling here.U.S. public health officials shy away from infringements of civil liberties and rightly so. I'm certainly glad they never did what Cuba did to contain HIV/AIDS -- put gays into camps. Civil liberties concerns are extremely important, but they do not always supersede much bigger life-and-death concerns. When and where quarantine needs to be implemented for Ebola, it must not be evaded but must be transparent and to the greatest extent possible implemented with the participation, cooperation and support of the individuals and communities involved. We keep getting reassurances that if the procedures that are currently in place are stringently followed, containment will be secured. Yet that security appears evermore fragile and elusive. As UN Deputy Ebola Coordinator Anthony Banbury admitted, ""We need to [contain Ebola] within 60 days from 1 October. If we reach [this target], then we can turn this epidemic around ... We either stop Ebola now or we face an entirely unprecedented situation for which we do not have a plan.""  Drug and vaccine trials are happening but not aggressively enough. As with AIDS, all experimental approaches in the pipeline need to be financed and expedited the way they were in the heyday of ACT UP's responses to the spread of AIDS. Crucially, medical activists need to find out what drugs and vaccines are in various stages of research and testing, and then put pressure on the FDA and drug companies to finance and speed their development. AIDS activists sensed that gays were considered an expendable population, alongside drug addicts and (later) African nationals, and that the resulting indifference and silence from governments and society were tantamount to genocide. It isn't a big stretch to see that same history repeating itself when it comes to the black populations most affected by Ebola. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is ""unquestionably the most severe acute public health emergency in modern times,"" Dr. Margaret Chan, the director general of the World Health Organization, said. ""When a deadly and dreaded virus hits the destitute and spirals out of control, the whole world is put at risk ... The rich get the best care. The poor are left to die.""  For the moment, one can only hope that these statements of candor from Drs. Frieden, Chan and Banbury will set the stage for subsequent responses. While we may not need an ""Ebola czar"" per se, remember how hugely important Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's voice was as the AIDS crisis unfolded? At present, however, the U.S. has no Surgeon General. The president's candidate, Dr. Vivek Murthy, has been stalemated by Republicans not only because he was selected by Obama and was a supporter of Obamacare but because he supports gun control. So as we face a plague that could spread with the scale and devastation of AIDS, Congress is once again playing partisan and petty politics. The NRA's defense of its mass-murderous policies has now taken a quantum leap in its interference with the nation's health, from being accessory to the unnecessary deaths of thousands to potentially much greater numbers.Lawrence D.

1,ENTERTAINMENT,Why Is Everyone Treating Amanda Bynes Like A Spectacle?,Lauren Duca,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/covering-amanda-bynes_n_5973736.html,,2014-10-16,"UNIVERSAL CITY, CA - JUNE 05: Actress Amanda Bynes arrives at the 2011 MTV Movie Awards at Universal Studios' Gibson Amphitheatre on June 5, 2011 in Universal City, California. (Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb480d9200000e500007775.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Amanda Bynes was placed on her first psychiatric hold in September of 2013, there was no longer a question about the mental-health issues inherent to her narrative. But the way that reality has been ignored since Bynes reemerged over the last couple of weeks is a reminder that mental health is often misunderstood. In hopes of removing ourselves from this trend, HuffPost Entertainment made an editorial decision to not cover Bynes outside of news concerning hospitalization or arrest. With the help of psychiatrist Dr. Paul Puri, we set out to answer some FAQs about mental health in specific relation to Bynes, with a broader goal of countering the stigma surrounding these issues. (Dr. Puri has not treated or interacted with Bynes, and is basing his comments on observations of her public behavior.)So what if people are interested in Amanda? Maybe they just really like her and want her to get better.Sure, there are probably a few concerned folks amid the rubber-necking masses. But take a look at the fact that after she tweeted claims of molestation on Friday, she gained 10,000 followers. When these kind of behaviors are covered, it perpetuates an unhealthy voyeurism surrounding a young woman who would best be removed from public scrutiny.What about last year, when she was calling people ugly and stuff. Didn’t HuffPost cover all of that? We did. At that moment, concerns about Bynes' mental health had yet to emerge in an official capacity. When she was placed on psychiatric hold in September of 2013, it was clear that this was not a simple case of a child star acting out. As Dr. Paul Puri told HuffPost Entertainment, mental illness can be difficult to spot in public figures. ""Many celebrities will engage in outlandish behavior for the purpose of attention,"" he said. ""Trying to understand where that boundary is and when it crosses a line that might be an illness can be hard to identify.""But didn't HuffPost also just report on her recent hospitalization?Yes. What we are avoiding is the sort of norm-defying behavior that is being commodified as spectacle. It's a difficult line to draw. We feel it's important to share the stories that provide awareness of the origin of her actions, in hopes of reducing the idea that any of this has just simply been ""for attention."" As Puri put it, ""Trying to understand what’s happening may be less important than recognizing that their behavior is not fitting the norm and impairing them in some way, and thus wanting them to get some help or care.""What about the story about her getting engaged! That's a big deal, that's not norm-defying or whatever you just said.Whether or not she is actually engaged, the announcement was made in a harried interaction with a reporter. Ultimately, covering this type of thing results in Bynes' struggles becoming a product.Oh, that makes sense. Kind of like what happened with Britney Spears in 2007, right? In a way. Bynes is surely not the first to go through this “fallen starlet” pattern. Over at The Guardian, Jill Filipovic posited that watching pop and movie stars go through this undoing is satisfying because it breaks such strict standards of beauty. “Aesthetically, we gravitate toward culturally-agreed-upon beauty, but perfection slashed through with hideousness can be particularly compelling,” she wrote. “When we're used to seeing actresses, pop stars and models as part of an assembly line of real-life Barbie dolls, it becomes all the more interesting to see one go by with her head popped off.”What about all the other celebrities who have mental-health issues that we don't know about. Why is HuffPost covering them?As Puri said above, it can be hard to tell, because so much outlandish celebrity behavior is ""for attention."" Mindfulness is not omniscience. We'll do our best and if something like this emerged about another star, we'd make a similar decision.Fine, but what is the takeaway about mental health here? I thought it was stigmatized. What does that mean?The stigma surrounding mental health comes from a fear of the unknown. ""People may fear that all people with mental illness are inherently dangerous or risky, because they fear the unknown. What happens in someone else's brain seems a mystery, and when someone acts erratically, all those fears can get lumped together. We fear the unknown, because it's scary or because it's foreign to us,"" Puri said. We also tend to foster an inherent dislike of that which is different. ""It is the people who don’t fit with the mainstream that we end up pushing to the side,"" he explained. ""When there’s a problem like this, there are many people who have never had a mental health problem, so they can’t relate to it. They have no way in to understand it, and so it just seems all the stranger for it.""What does that have to do with the lack of sympathy you keep talking about?The lack of sympathy surrounding mental health may be due to the way we conflate mental illness with personality. ""Mental health problems involve something wrong with the brain, even if you think of it as the mind, it’s incredibly tied into somebody’s character or how we see them,"" Puri said. ""It’s hard to distinguish that person from their brain or their illness. Them being ill ends up becoming coloring how we can see them at all, and we only see this problem as being who they are."" On some level, that also has to do with the fact that Bynes is a celebrity. As her friend Nick Cannon told HuffPost Live last week, ""If this was a person who was in a mental hospital, would you do the same thing? But just because she's someone that is a public figure, we feel like it's fun to [make fun of her]. But no, this is someone who needs help ..."" So, what is the best way to counter this stigma so we don't all turn into insensitive monsters?It's important to address these issues by being as informed as possible. Much of the stigma of mental health comes from our lack of understanding, but that's fairly easy to combat. ""I would love to see general informational topics going out there, to help people understand certain types of behavior that is otherwise stigmatized or misunderstood,"" Puri said, ""So, anything from people who talk to themselves to people who have paranoid delusions or anything else. That would help people to maybe understand, when you see people on the street or in the headlines, what might be happening. So they can draw their own conclusions, but from a more informed place.""Dr. Puri is a psychiatrist and writer on the faculty of the UCLA Department of Psychiatry. He specializes in psychotherapy treatment of complex psychiatric conditions including personality disorders. You can find his website here."

(AP Photo/Kim Raff)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f0ee26000030018371d0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What do you think you know about Mormons? Big families, Utah, (polygamy?), Osmonds, clean living, Mitt Romney? First released in theaters October 10, Meet the Mormons is an 80-minute infomercial produced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the full name of the Mormon church) highlighting a diverse cross-section of church members. This includes profiles of a black lay clergyman in Atlanta, the coach of the football team at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, a female professional kickboxer in Costa Rica, the famous ""Candy Bomber"" of the Berlin Airlift, a humanitarian in Nepal, and a Utah mother sending her son on a mission. The entire story is hosted by New York comedian and former employee of The Daily Show Jenna Kim Jones, (who may be the best part of the film), she introduces the film from the streets of Times Square, where she asks people on the street what they know about Mormons. Interspersed with pop culture references including clips from The Simpsons, 30 Rock, Fletch and South Park (yes, South Park!), it sets the stage quite well: unless you actually have LDS friends and family, you might be unfamiliar with what the church is actually all about.Light on church teachings, it's less an attempt to proselytize and more an attempt to introduce people who may be less familiar with it to the often-misunderstood church. And in that sense, it is successful. Similar in tone and message, but much broader in scope, to the ""I'm a Mormon"" ad campaigns of the past few years, this doesn't really qualify as a ""documentary"" in the traditional sense. Instead, this is excellent advertisement and public relations for the church. And to top it all off, the film ends with the premiere of American Idol David Archuletta, recently returned from an LDS mission himself.It's not that it's a bad movie, but most of its content will likely be preaching to the choir. Given the other movies it's competing with, it's unclear whether paying audiences outside of the most faithful of the LDS will flock to see this. Church leaders have stated that they hope to have a strong showing opening weekend, which will allow the film to stick around in theaters and eventually find its way onto streaming platforms where it can find its true target audience.It's well-made, but it feels more like a video Pfizer, Goldman Sachs or Exxon would put out about how great their corporation is than an actual documentary. It's got a lot of passion put into it, but the point of view is already set and only interested in telling one story: toeing the corporate line of happy Mormons who love their families and find fulfillment in the gospel of Jesus Christ. But that's not a documentary.A good documentary will hold up the lens of truth to any subject and show all of the nooks and crannies -- because those are the most interesting, real parts of life. This is too glossy for its own good.However, in the ongoing struggle for the church to redefine their own image and engage in the missionary work for which it is often recognized, it will probably help. For those who haven't yet Met the Mormons, this is an innocuous taste of a richness of diversity the church is all-too-willing to celebrate but does little to cultivate in its largely homogenized church culture. Walk into any random LDS meetinghouse this Sunday and you are unlikely to find anything resembling the folks in this film. Hopefully, the LDS faithful who see this movie will reflect on this and begin to welcome those diverse voices within their own flock that have recently been more marginalized. While the church celebrates and places its members of African descent out front here, it was not all that long ago that the church did not allow them to hold the priesthood. There is no mention of this, leaving you wondering just how authentic this is. But again, this is corporate PR, not actual documentary filmmaking, where a topic like this might actually be discussed with honesty and clarity.It's also impossible to mention the LDS church this week without discussing this week's Supreme Court decision, paving the way for marriage equality to continue in Utah (among other states). The LDS church has received a great deal of criticism for its involvement in Calfironia's Prop 8 and other marriage equality fights. But, again, this controversy is glossed over.But before we get too cynical, all of the profits from the theatrical release are being donated to the Red Cross. So, regardless of the outcome, there is a positive end to this story. You can find a theater playing Meet the Mormons here if you are really committed to seeing it. If you go in expecting a well-produced, entertaining but ultimately too fluffy of a story and not much more, you won't be let down. But if you expect more than that, you will.  2 stars."

At 9 years old, she became a household name as the youngest actress ever to receive an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for her role as Hushpuppy in the 2013 film, ""Beasts of the Southern Wild."" Now, at age 11, she's set to star as the titular character in a remake of ""Annie,"" the iconic 1982 movie adapted from the Broadway musical by the same name.

And 2014 is keeping up with that trend. Although the Supreme Court blocked key parts of Texas' harsh anti-abortion law just yesterday, in this year's midterm elections, Colorado, Tennessee and North Dakota will have constitutional amendments on their ballots that could effectively eliminate -- or at least significantly chip away at -- abortion rights in those states.Two states, Colorado and North Dakota, will have personhood measures on their ballots. This type of legislation seeks to legally define life as starting at conception, thus extending legal rights to fertilized eggs. Advocates of personhood legislation claim that the laws are intended to protect women and their babies. ""You know, the 14th Amendment requires equal protection under the law for everybody,"" Personhood USA representative Jennifer Mason told NPR in November 2013. ""And so we believe that every human being, regardless of their location, whether they're in the womb or out of it, deserves those protections and those rights.""In Tennessee, an amendment on the November ballot would allow the state legislature to pass anti-abortion legislation more easily.Women's reproductive health advocates point to the impact these measures could have on the rights guaranteed by Roe v. Wade. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opposes personhood measures, stating that they ""erode women's basic rights to privacy and bodily integrity; deny women access to the full spectrum of preventive health care including contraception; and undermine the doctor-patient relationship."" ""The goal of all of these measures is to ban abortion and to restrict access to contraception, and to essentially put politicians between women and doctors,"" NARAL Pro-Choice America Political Director Erika West told The Huffington Post in a phone interview.Here are the states where anti-abortion constitutional amendments will be on the ballot this November:Colorado: Amendment 67 What It Says: The measure states that, ""In the interest of the protection of pregnant mothers and their unborn children from criminal offenses and neglect and wrongful acts, the words 'person' and 'child' in the Colorado Criminal Code and the Colorado Wrongful Death Act must include unborn human beings.""What Proponents Claim It's For: In August, Mason told The Washington Post: “Amendment 67 corrects the loophole in Colorado law and ensures that those criminals can be charged with killing a child in many different scenarios, whereas previous personhood amendments didn’t address the criminal code.”What Opponents Say It Could Mean For Women: Those who oppose the bill say that by changing the definition of personhood in Colorado's criminal code, the amendment could effectively criminalize abortion. It could also call into question the legality of certain types of birth control, including the pill, intrauterine devices and emergency contraception. Opponents also worry that the amendment could have even further-reaching consequences for women who miscarry or deliver a stillborn child, as well as their doctors. ""The language of Amendment 67 is so broad and far-reaching that it would make pregnant women and their doctors criminally liable for any pregnancy that does not result in a live birth, regardless of the stage of pregnancy,"" reads the FAQ section on the website of NO67, a campaign that opposes the measure. North Dakota: Measure 1 What It Says: The measure would add the following to Article 1 of the North Dakota state constitution: ""The inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected.""What Proponents Claim It's For: Personhood USA's website says that the measure is meant to ""ensure that mother and baby are both treated as medical patients."" And in February 2013, Republican state Sen. Margaret Sitte, the sponsor of the personhood initiative, told HuffPost's Laura Bassett: ""We are intending that it be a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, since Scalia said that the Supreme Court is waiting for states to raise a case.""What Opponents Say It Could Mean For Women: West said that the North Dakota measure, like the Colorado amendment, could lead to an abortion ban and have negative implications for the legality of certain types of birth control and IVF procedures. Other opponents of Measure 1 point to its confusing language. ""Because Measure 1 is so vague and poorly-worded, it will lead to so many legal battles,"" Karla Rose Hanson, spokesperson for North Dakotans Against Measure 1, told Cosmopolitan in September. ""It could lead to court battles on a variety of fronts -- how it applies to end-of-life situations, how it applies to IVF, how it applies to abortion.""Tennessee: Amendment 1 What It Says: The amendment would add the following language to Tennessee's constitution: ""Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion. The people retain the right through their elected state representatives and state senators to enact, amend, or repeal statutes regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest or when necessary to save the life of the mother.""What Proponents Claim It's For: The group Yes On 1 says that Amendment 1 would pave the way for the Tennessee legislature to ""enforce common sense protections for abortion-vulnerable women or unborn children."" Since a 2000 state Supreme Court ruling that a woman's constitutional right to privacy included the right to terminate a pregnancy, the Tennessee legislature has not been able to pass broad anti-abortion legislation.What Opponents Say It Could Mean For Women: If the amendment passes, it will effectively invalidate the earlier state Supreme Court ruling, and allow Tennessee's Congress to pursue -- and pass -- more aggressive anti-abortion legislation. According to West, the amendment would allow the legislature ""to appeal every measure that protects abortion rights.""""We’ll see an immediate barrage of legislation that mirrors what we’ve seen in other states where clinics have closed en masse, like in Texas and Virginia,"" West added.

Although over half of the French favor legalization and almost two thirds have a positive image of gestational surrogates (women who carry other women's embryos), France's political leadership attempts to distract its public from economic malaise by demonizing surrogacy. The latest missive comes from Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who argued a few days ago that ""France is opposed to surrogacy because she is opposed, in the name of her values, in the name of progress and humanism, to all forms of commercialization of human beings and experimentation in this area."" Surrogates are ""slaves"" with wombs for rent, they argue, exploited by the infertile. France's leadership hides the many happy U.S. surrogacy stories, featuring instead some of Asia's forced baby factories that ensnare poor women. Children of surrogacy who are born in the U.S. attain U.S. citizenship but not that of their intended French parents. France insists that children conceived in this way should not be recognized as French because of how they came into life. However, in June 2014, a brave decision by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ordered France to reverse course and recognize children born of surrogacy despite the French ban. ""Liberté, égalité, faternité"" seem to be values in short supply for Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who proposes to class children by their parents' conception decisions. A patent violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and many other international commitments, France's official policy turns it into a national orphanage, putting these children in an almost stateless limbo without the citizenship of their parents who raise them, and without any legal status in their French home. In light of this deliberate cruelty, one might ask whether France's human-rights commitments are in fact empty promises.In the wake of the ECHR ruling, France must balance banning surrogacy while recognizing the children born of it. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius arrogantly proposes to demand that other countries ban surrogacy for intentional parents who happen to be French. For the U.S. this is particularly inconceivable given that the federal government has no power over such state-based rules. As if Fabius could persuade President Obama to accommodate France's bizarre stance on this ""slavery"" and force 45 U.S. states to bend to France's will. France's leaders must stop playing political games with children's lives and reverse their vindictive policy. Alexandre Urwicz is President of ADFH, the leading French LGBT parents' group.

(Blue light, with its very short wavelength, allows information to be stored more densely than other colors, hence the blue lasers used for Blu-ray discs.) But Akasaki, Amano and Nakamura are far from the first ones to have operationalized the density and intensity of blue. The color has more than held its own on the ROYGBIV spectrum from ancient times up to the present. The Nobel Prize-winning breakthrough actually represents a discovery of what was ""always-already"" (Karl Marx's term, via Kant; another way of putting it is, as the song from All That Jazz goes, ""Everything old is new again."") I don't mean to diminish the import of the physicists' technological ""capture"" and ""framing"" of blue, but they provide an opportunity for us to reflect back on the cultural potency of blueness, which existed resplendently long before they engineered it in their laboratories.In Judaism, the blue of the Mogen David on the Israeli flag is a modern incarnation of the color whose splendor dates back to biblical times: The ceremonial robes worn by high priests are described by the Hebrew word ''tekhelet,"" used dozens of times in the Bible to characterize the color featured on the robes of the high priests, the fringes of the tallit (prayer shawl), and the tapestries in the Tabernacle. Both Islamic and Jewish culture use an amulet of blue (a ""hamsa"" in Hebrew, ""khamsa"" in Arabic, ""nazar"" in Turkish) to ward off the curse of the ""evil eye."" In many Middle Eastern countries, the color is thought to have a protective force, which is why doors and shutters are often painted blue.In Christianity, the Virgin Mary is frequently depicted cloaked in blue, perhaps most gloriously in the famous Chartres Cathedral window known as ""La Belle Verriere."" The formula for making the blue glass used in this window has supposedly been lost to humankind, and the exact composition of tekhelet, too, has been debated for centuries, though an Israeli chemist recently claimed to have found and analyzed an original sample of the dye. The Nobel laureates are in good company as they work to create (or recreate) the color blue.As far back as the Neolithic Age, the blue of lapis lazuli was one of the first aesthetic commodities to generate global trade, and a millennium ago, Chinese cobalt blue porcelain similarly mesmerized people around the world with its stately hues. Picasso's blue period and the musical genre of the blues are two of many examples that illustrate how the emotional condition of depression is ""inscribed"" in the color blue. Picasso's paintings from 1901 to 1904 depicted tawdry subjects -- lonely, damaged, emaciated, beaten-down figures -- wrapped in a smothering, deadening haze of blue. In blues music, by contrast, while there's often an underlying resonance of suffering that emanates, fundamentally, from the indignities of slavery and its aftermath, there's also a kind of energetic musical catharsis and transcendence: turning lemons into lemonade, to use a banal (and inappropriately yellow) cliché. For Picasso, perhaps simply the fact that his blue period ended -- he finally painted his way through it and returned to a more varied palette -- represents a comparable kind of emergence. Another depressing incarnation of blue appears in Toni Morrison's 1970 novel, The Bluest Eye, where the title image symbolizes a racist standard of beauty that oppresses, in its elusiveness, the young black protagonist Pecola Breedlove.The color's bleak associations long predate the 20th century, though. The idea of a ""blue devil"" as a harmful or malignant demon that causes melancholy dates back to the 17th century, according to the Oxford English Dictionary; the blue devil induces low spirits and despondency. ""Laughter is a more powerful Exorcism of those blue Devils, which too often possess our poor mortal Fabric,"" a writer explained in the Publick Register in 1741, ""than what can be perform'd by a Conclave of Cardinals.""At the extremes of either exaltation or gloom, blue has always glowed with intensity, embodying an energy that is reaffirmed by the LED technology that was celebrated this week.Blue skies, blue oceans, the ""blue marble"" photograph of Earth from Apollo 17 that changed the way we saw our planet in the universe: All these suggest how our visual and artistic sense of the color draws on its omnipresent natural majesty. No offense intended to red, orange, or violet, which are all lovely colors and may someday generate their own Nobel-worthy discoveries, but blue, clearly, takes the prize. In his poem ""High Windows,"" Philip Larkin magisterially describes the ineffable vastness that this color imaginatively evokes:""Rather than words comes the thought of high windows:  The sun-comprehending glass,  And beyond it, the deep blue air, that shows  Nothing, and is nowhere, and is endless."""

To find out, HuffPost Science reached out to experts in the ""science of fear."" Here's what we learned:""For many people everyday life can feel overly routinized and even boring,"" Dr. David H. Zald, a psychiatry professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., told The Huffington Post in an email. ""By contrast, when scared we are fully aware, conscious and in the moment. We are not preoccupied thinking about what happened yesterday or what we have to do tomorrow.""Being scared activates our ""fight-or-flight response,"" which prepares our body to respond to a perceived threat. And that can feel good.""Our arousal system is activated and triggers a cascade of 'feel good' neurotransmitters and hormones like endorphins, dopamine, serotonin, and adrenaline that influence our brains and our bodies,"" Dr. Margee Kerr, a Pittsburgh-based sociologist and self-styled ""scare expert,"" told HuffPost in an email. When we know we're safe, she said, we interpret this state of arousal as a positive experience.""All it takes is a moment (even less than a second) to realize we’re safe and switch over to laughter and joy,"" Kerr said adding that this is why ""people scream and laugh in haunted houses, and why ‘make-up sex’ is often reported as being so good.""Going through a scary experience can make us feel proud of what we've accomplished, according to Kerr.""Psychologically when we make it through a safe yet scary activity, it results in feelings of confidence, competence, accomplishment, and success--it’s a real self-esteem boost,"" she said. ""There’s nothing quite like defeating a hoard of zombies in a haunted house or jumping out of a plane to make you feel like you can take on the world. ""The rush of those chemicals can make us feel so good that we want to seek out that ""high"" all over again.""If it accompanied or followed by relief or success (such as when accomplishing something despite danger), it can lead to the so-called adrenaline rush, which is experienced as positive and may even have an addictive quality, as people will actively seek experiences that can lead to this rush,"" Zald said.Being scared can also make us feel closer to one another. ""Haunted houses and amusement parks are inextricably linked to friends and family,"" Kerr said. ""We’re taking on these challenges together and in doing so creating stronger bonds, stronger memories, and feelings of closeness. If you watch people coming out of a haunted house you’ll see lots of hugs and high fives.""Some scientists say sharing a thrilling experience may even make us more likely to be attracted to someone, because we ""misattribute"" our arousal from a scary situation to our romantic partner."
10,COLLEGE,Sexual Assault Will Not Be Solved by Public Relations,"Sofie Karasek, ContributorUndergraduate, University of California, Berkeley",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexual-assault-will-not-be-solved-by-pr_b_5979860.html,"After survivors filed federal Title IX and Clery Act complaints against UC Berkeley for sweeping cases under the rug to the U.S. DOE, spearheaded state and federal legislation and created a national dialogue about campus sexual assault, how does UC Berkeley respond?

By hiring a few people, making a website and creating posters. That should solve the pesky rape problem, right?If you've hit the gym, had an appointment at the Tang Center or happened to stop by Calapalooza back in September, you've probably seen the colorful, eye-catching ""Stop Sexual Violence"" signs. While they might seem like an encouraging symbol of change, the posters were created after students left for the summer, and neither public survivor activists nor student government representatives were consulted about the campaign.More importantly, the posters do not educate students about consent, bystander intervention or available resources for survivors. Although it may seem easy to dismiss, education is critical to shattering the myth that only a violent attack perpetrated by a stranger counts as a sexual assault. Beyond education, UC Berkeley must hire additional staff to ensure all reported cases are fairly and thoroughly investigated. Instead of taking action, UC Berkeley used valuable resources to solely appear to care about sexual violence, effectively avoiding having to seriously address it.It's not only students who think this facade is problematic. Several weeks ago, four state legislators came to campus to interrogate administrators on how they're responding to a recent state audit critical of UC Berkeley's responses to sexual violence cases. Multiple times, Assemblymember Das Williams asked variations of the question, ""Why doesn't UC Berkeley educate its students on the sanctions for perpetrating sexual assault?"" He was met with silence. While administrators couldn't answer the question, the answer comes all too easily to survivors: Because serious punishments for rape and sexual assault do not exist at UC Berkeley. Disciplinary probation, semester-long suspensions or ""reflective writing assignments"" are not appropriate responses to sexual violence.You might be tempted to think, ""But the university cares about sexual violence because they said so in an email!"" Sure, it's easy to make a few public changes and act like it's revolutionary. But when it comes down to the important, private meetings where investigators meet with students, nothing is changing. At the roundtable, survivors spoke of mistreatment from the university as recently as this summer. On multiple occasions, administrators failed to give timely case updates, refused to allow survivors to appeal inadequate disciplinary sanctions and did not enforce the existing affirmative consent policy. On a more basic level, administrators could not even be bothered to treat survivors with compassion and respect.It's particularly interesting that throughout the Title IX complaint, nearly all of the survivors who went through the reporting process cited issues with the university's lead sexual assault investigator, Denise Oldham, of the office for the prevention of harassment and discrimination. Students have voiced concerns about her conduct for over a year. Although Oldham has denied saying this, survivors wrote in a Title IX complaint that they recall her saying, ""We see over 500 cases every year but are only able to seek formal disciplinary resolutions in two cases the previous year."" That statistic was referenced multiple times in the complaint; yet despite this discrepancy, she is still employed here.Like the administration, the Greek system is also being scrutinized. While sexual assault is not limited to fraternities and sororities, it's important to be critical of how CalGreeks, specifically the Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Council, are addressing this pervasive problem. The common refrain ""it happens everywhere"" is not a valid excuse -- it only deflects the responsibility to end it.Out of 64 members of the Greeks Against Sexual Assault coalition, only 10 are from fraternities. IFC members, including those in leadership positions, frequently deflect responsibility by claiming that only their guests and not their brothers commit sexual assault. Although non-Greek-affiliated people have sexually assaulted others at fraternity parties, we personally know of assailants from at least 12 different Berkeley fraternities.Fraternity men are 300 percent more likely to be perpetrators than nonfraternity men, and sorority women are 74 percent more likely to experience sexual assault than nonsorority women. The trend is clear: The Greek system has a serious sexual assault issue, and some banners and the support of a few IFC allies will not change this. If it's hard to picture that a brother could be an assailant, chances are that he probably doesn't recognize it either. Research from David Lisak, a prominent scholar of criminology and campus rape, has shown that most perpetrators normalize predatory behavior and do not identify as assailants. If we are to eradicate campus sexual violence, we have to stop normalizing the attitudes that allow it to persist. And that starts by taking tangible steps, not just hanging up a seemingly supportive sign.Surprisingly, sororities are also contributing to this issue. Last week, a sorority woman publicly expressed her anger about a sexual harassment incident that happened in her house. But instead of responding with concern for her well-being, her chapter's president -- and several other sisters -- immediately reprimanded her for jeopardizing the house's reputation. Why does a house's reputation take precedence over stopping sexual harassment?This was not an isolated incident. The few survivors who speak out about sexual assault and harassment in the Greek system are often silenced by other members. Some sorority leaders warn survivors that the chapter will be punished for it, through severed social ties with the perpetrator's fraternity, reputational damage or a fear of sanctions from the school. Meanwhile, two-thirds of these assailants who are often viewed as ""nice guys"" will continue to prey on others.The administration, CalGreeks, Berkeley Student Cooperative, other student organizations and the entire campus community must take responsibility and adequately prevent and respond to sexual violence. We all need to support survivors, educate each other about consent, change inappropriate behaviors and hold perpetrators accountable.Sofie Karasek is the co-founder of End Rape on Campus and Meghan Warner is the director of the ASUC Sexual Assault Commission.

The pain on the outside reflecting the tense churning and discomfort underneath. A differentness I knew would keep me permanently locked out of their circle, disconnected from everyone else who seemed so in tune with one another. They had best friends. I never did. There was no chance I'd ever pop, just be forever weird. I recently posted an article on my high school alumni Facebook page written just after my childhood crush died suddenly at 49. The essay discussed how awkwardness and lack of confidence prevented me from ever speaking to this sweet, handsome boy, seemingly far above my social standing, for the six years I spent sneaking glimpses of him from junior high through high school. The comments that followed from my 1983 alumni clearly showed how much everyone feels like that same raw pimple, no matter how popular or beautiful on the outside they appear. One woman, who'd been overweight in high school, said the boy who died had been one of the few to talk to her like she was an actual person and not just a thing to be ridiculed. When I wrote about a college rape experience, several women I'd gone to school with offered up their own, very personal experiences with sexual assault. For me, there's been something deeply re-affirming about a renewed connection with this group of people with whom I spent most of my time feeling like an open wound. Speaking openly with these former high schoolers now approaching 50 has made crystal clear how alike we were then and still are now. And how much fear we lived with while teenagers and continue to struggle against. What we fear most is each other. But when we open up about our greatest weirdness or hurt, the world opens up with us. A woman leading a seminar I took said that while as a gay Hispanic, she may be more obviously different, but that the blondest, whitest person in this room of hundreds thinks she's the weirdest. Tragically, once we start learning to speak, we're taught to hide that difference. We put ourselves into a cocoon of our own making, and by resisting it further, we magnify our difference, convinced it's a secret to be hidden from view of everyone else.It's why I wish there were less posts on Facebook of vacation highlights and more that displayed the vulnerability of parenthood. Where are the photos of the kids smacking each other over invisible boundaries in the back seat? To me, ""Fakebook"" represents the façade we're taught to keep up, but it's the cracks that show our sameness and humanity.A brave Facebook friend recently wrote about her 12-year-old son being un-invited to a birthday party because the party mom discovered her son has is going through the transgender process. The kid was in tears after finding out he was no longer invited. Kids inherently know that's wrong, but they have to live by adults' rules. And that's how and when they learn to hide themselves.As adults, we've often had the drum of intolerance beaten over our heads since childhood. It's scary to be the first one to peak out of the foxhole. Who knows what's just beyond the pass that may shoot you down?If we don't value our weirdness as kids and are consistently taught to squash it as a means of protection, we'll continue to live as the zombies we are, forever divided and fearful. Fly that freak flag. You may be surprised by how many people share your colors. And you'll be inspiring the next generation to stay out of their own foxholes.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"
