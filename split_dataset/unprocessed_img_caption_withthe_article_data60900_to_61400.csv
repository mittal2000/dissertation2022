0,POLITICS,Asylum Seekers To Hillary Clinton: Don't Let Us Be Deported To Our Deaths,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bangladesh-asylum-seekers-hillary-clinton_us_56fa9f32e4b0143a9b494691,"At least 100 asylum seekers could be deported next week to Bangladesh, where they fear they could be killed.",2016-03-30,"From left to right, Saiful Islam, Kamran Ahmed, MD Rashadul Hasan, Sujon, Mohammed Aminul Hosen, Jahed Ahmed, and Mahammad Rahman stand outside Hillary Clinton's Brooklyn campaign headquarters.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fad8fe1e0000b300705989.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Seven asylum seekers and their supporters gathered outside the Brooklyn campaign headquarters of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Tuesday with one message: If the United States deports us back to Bangladesh, we could be killed. Please help us. Saiful Islam, 26, is one of the asylum seekers. Over a year ago, he booked a one-way ticket from Bangladesh to Bolivia. From Bolivia, he says he embarked on an arduous, four-month journey on foot through a dozen or so countries until finally crossing the Mexican border into the U.S. At last, Islam thought, he was safe. Instead, Islam, who says he fled political persecution in Bangladesh and wanted to seek official asylum in U.S., was arrested by immigration officials and sent to a detention center in Orange County, California. There, he says he languished behind bars for seven months and 19 days. Islam and about 1,000 other detainees at Immigration Customs Enforcement facilities across the country, many of whom were Bangladeshi, participated in a massive hunger strike near the end of last year. The protest was meant to draw attention to their prolonged detention and to what they said was discriminatory treatment in their bids for asylum. Islam says he didn't eat for four days.Many of those hunger strikers are scheduled deported back to Bangladesh soon. They could face violent political reprisals upon their return, according to South Asian-American advocacy group Desis Rising Up and Moving. The group said the U.S. provided Bangladesh's government with not just the identities of the people set for deportation, as is standard practice, but also information on who had sought asylum, which could put those people in even more danger.Advocates with DRUM said guards are now telling detainees that a mass deportation of over 100 Bangladeshis is scheduled for Monday. Dozens of other deportations to Bangladesh could happen in the near future, DRUM said.While Islam is no longer detained by ICE and has a pending asylum application, he understands the fears of those facing imminent deportation. ""Because the political situation in Bangladesh is extremely bad, it is guaranteed when I go back home that someone will kill me,"" Islam told The Huffington Post through a translator at Tuesday's rally.Like many of his fellow asylum seekers, Islam is a member of the Bangladesh National Party, the country's second largest political party. The U.S. government has designated it as a Tier III terrorist organization, which some advocates and immigration lawyers have strongly contested. Members of the BNP often face arrest, ""incidents of enforced disappearance, extrajudicial killings, shooting in the legs and torture"" by the ruling Awami League party, according to a report from the human rights group Odhikar. During one six-month span last year, 19 of the 104 people killed ""extrajudicially"" in the country were ""leader-activists"" of the BNP. ""If returned, [Awami League opponents] face serious and severe harm to themselves,"" human rights lawyer Chaumtoli Huq told VICE News in November.And according to a report in The Nation, Bangladesh has ""among the highest numbers of asylum claims outside the Western Hemisphere — more than doubling from 2013 to 2014 to about 580. Granted claims have dipped slightly from 63 to 52.""Demonstrators on Tuesday, most affiliated with DRUM, held cut-outs of tombstones with the names of Bangladeshi detainees scheduled for deportation. Other signs read ""#Deported2Death"" and ""Democratic Party = Deportation Party = Death party."" Three of the seven asylum seekers at the rally have pending asylum applications, and four face imminent deportation. DRUM claims the U.S. asylum process has doomed many Bangladeshi asylum seekers to be deported. Adequate translation services weren't provided to Bangladeshis in court, DRUM says. Furthermore, the group says it's a tough task when you're in jail to track down lawyers who are both affordable and who understand the complicated political situation in Bangladesh. DRUM also claims the asylum seekers face horrible conditions during their detainment, often being subjected to solitary confinement, intrusive strip searches and poor medical care.ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “We have seen the Central American refugees, including women and children, be deported back and killed,"" Islam said to the press at Tuesday's rally. ""The same thing will happen to us if these deportations are not stopped.”Roksana Mun, the director of strategies at DRUM, talked about the 2 million immigrants deported under President Barack Obama's administration.""While media attention has focused on [Donald] Trump's virulent anti-immigrant rhetoric, mass deportation of Muslims is already a reality sanctioned by Democratic Party-backed policies for many refugees and migrants,"" Mun said.Demonstrators called for Clinton to say whether she'd continue a policy of mass deportations, and asked her to use her power as former secretary of state to pressure the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to halt the scheduled deportations of Bangladeshi asylum seekers. Clinton campaign staff members Xochitl Hinojosa and Mini Timmaraju met with the protesters for about 15 minutes. ""The campaign listened to their stories and their concerns,"" Hinojosa said in a statement after the meeting. ""Hillary Clinton supports a system that is humane and ensures the dignity of every human being,"" Hinojosa continued. “While Republicans continue to promote policies that tear families apart, Hillary Clinton remains consistent in her positions to defend President Obama’s executive actions and to push for a comprehensive solution that includes a pathway to full and equal citizenship at the heart of any immigration reform plan.""The statement did not say whether Clinton would pressure the State Department or Department of Homeland Security to stop the scheduled deportation of Bangladeshis next week. During the hunger strike last year, Clinton and her main opponent in this year's Democratic primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), both said that as president they would limit immigrant detention and end contracts for private prison companies to run immigrant detention centers.But while Clinton's campaign hedged over whether it supported the hunger strikers, Sanders' campaign expressed explicit support. “These aspiring Americans should not be criminalized, subjected to dehumanizing solitary confinement or indefinitely detained,” Sanders’ Latino outreach director, Arturo Carmona, said at the time. “The United States must meet our international responsibilities to families seeking refuge.”Erika Andiola, a press secretary for Sanders' campaign, said Tuesday in an email that Sanders ""has always called for the United States to be a welcoming country to those who are the most vulnerable."" Andiola said Sanders has called on the president reassess his immigration enforcement policies, and to extend Temporary Protected Status to families fleeing violence in Central America. "

3,SPORTS,Here's The NHL Privately Discussing The Concussion Problem It Has Publicly Denied,Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nhl-emails-link-enforcers-concussions_us_56fa9328e4b014d3fe241f44,"It took just eight words: ""Fighting raises the incidence of head injuries/concussions.""",2016-03-29,"NHL commissioner Gary Bettman addresses the media on April 26, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fa952b1e000095007118cd.jpeg?cache=FS93uFwG93&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Time after time, the NHL has been asked about and proceeded to deny the link between on-ice fighting, concussions and long-term health consequences. In 2015, commissioner Gary Bettman even claimed that there was “no evidence” of that connection -- no “statistical correlation” between the fracases in the NHL’s rinks and degenerative diseases like chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) that have been found in the brains of some of its deceased players.But emails recently unsealed by a U.S. federal court and published by CTV W5 on Monday indicate that, at least as far back as September 2011, several of the league’s senior officials believed that such a link likely does exist.One such email, written on Sept. 3, 2011, by NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly to Bettman along with another high-up official, frames the issue as a chain reaction of sorts -- a domino-like series of events that begins with on-ice trauma and ends with serious mental illness.""Fighting raises the incidence of head injuries/concussions, which raises the incidence of depression onset, which raises the incidence of personal tragedies,"" he wrote.Daly’s causal clauses were in response to a message sent 16 minutes earlier by Bettman, who appeared to be more skeptical of the connection. Discussing a then-recent news article on “enforcers” -- NHL players whose job is effectively to start fights and instigate chaos on the ice -- and specifically three enforcers who, tragically, all died in the summer of 2011 (two by suicide), Bettman raised the question of whether “being an NHL fighter does this to you (I don’t believe so) or whether a certain type of person (who otherwise wouldn’t be skilled enough to be an NHL player) gravitates to this job (I believe more likely).”Significantly, Daly’s 2011 emailed answer -- ""I tend to think its a little bit of both"" -- marks a strong divergence from what Bettman told the media just last May.Asked about the discovery of CTE in a deceased player’s brain, Bettman made the comment, which one Los Angeles Times reporter called “stunningly irresponsible,” that “there’s no evidence yet” that CTE can be traced back to concussions: “I know there are a lot of theories, but if you ask people who study it, they tell you there is no statistical correlation that can definitively make that conclusion.”Given the commissioner's recent sharp, stark stance -- he made the above claim just 10 months ago -- even an implied causal connection four years back from the lips of a senior league official seems worth noting. Whether the organization believed the science and the statistics or not, the NHL had a responsibility to all of its players to do whatever it could to guarantee their safety and health -- even if just an inkling of a connection between concussions and long-term repercussions was suspected.It’d be a tragic day indeed if we discovered that the league ignored telltale signs of danger and brain damage in order to continue the game’s tradition of “enforcers,” and all the unnecessary violence and chaos that those enforcers signify. And even if NHL officials continue to publicly refute this increasingly apparent link, it is notable -- and it is telling -- that, behind the curtain, they too have been struggling with the same questions as us."

While the outbreak is still ongoing in parts of West Africa, the World Health Organization declared that the virus is no longer an international health emergency. ""Ebola transmission in West Africa no longer constitutes an extraordinary event,"" the organization's emergency committee said. ""The risk of international spread is now low, and... countries currently have the capacity to respond rapidly to new virus emergencies."" It's a major and welcome development in a health care crisis that has killed more than 11,000 people worldwide and infected more than 28,000, almost all of them in the West African nations of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. But it will almost assuredly not register strongly among the U.S. press corps. Reporters have long since moved off the story. Which is odd, considering how completely panicked the country was for a period of time. Though Ebola killed just one person on U.S. soil -- and though that person hadn't even contracted the disease in America -- there was a collective freakout that the disease would bring about an apocalyptic nightmare here.Travel bans were demanded, talk of Ebola becoming suddenly airborne was rampant and people started worrying about eating certain kinds of chocolate. Some schools closed their doors because of the presence of children from Africa (not any of the affected countries, mind you -- just the continent). This, despite repeated assurances from public health officials that while the disease was very deadly, it was not very contagious in a country like ours. (Also, like, where was all the concern and alarm about Ebola when it was decimating communities in Africa but hadn't yet arrived in the U.S.?)Anyway, in light of Tuesday's good news, we thought it would be helpful to offer a reminder of those frantic, harrowing months before the 2014 campaign. So we are re-posting this timeline we created for the one-year anniversary of the day America lost its mind over Ebola. Enjoy."

They can also encounter longer-term challenges such as impaired vision, hearing, and cognitive skills as well as social and behavioral problems.The U.S. preterm birth rate declined to 11.4 percent in 2013 from a peak of 12.8 percent in 2006 but remains far higher than in other developed countries, Trasande and colleagues report in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.Approximately 3 percent of preterm births in the U.S. can be attributed to air pollution, the researchers conclude, based on data from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Institute of Medicine.Air pollution may contribute to the problem, because a buildup of toxic chemicals in the blood can cause immune system stress that weakens the placenta and shortens the amount of time the baby can remain in the womb.Preterm births linked to air pollution were higher in urban counties, primarily in Southern California and the Eastern U.S., the analysis found.One limitation of the study is that it can’t prove pollution causes preterm births, or why these two things may be connected, the authors note. The analysis also lacked data on individual exposure to air pollution that might influence how much toxins impacted pregnancy outcomes.Previous research has linked air pollution to preterm births even after controlling for other factors that often coincide with living in areas with bad air, such as poverty or tobacco smoke exposure, noted Dr. Bruce Lanphear, a researcher at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia who wasn’t involved in the study. But toxic air is just one of many variables that can influence pregnancy outcomes.“Preterm birth, as well as other diseases and disorders, are due to the cumulative impact of various risk factors and it isn’t constructive to continually pit one risk factor over another,” Lanphear added by email.Limiting the effect of air pollution on preterm births requires improved air quality, which might be achieved through efforts such as cleaner energy technology, more public transportation, improved paths for cycling and walking, and positioning schools and daycare centers far from highways, Lanphear noted.Women should also seek prenatal care early in pregnancy, particularly when they have had miscarriages or preterm births before, said Dr. Shruthi Mahalingaiah, a researcher at Boston University School of Medicine who wasn’t involved in the study.Social, economic, emotional and medical issues all may come into play with preterm births, particularly because women who live in areas with worse air may also be in communities where people have fewer financial resources or less access to quality medical care, Mahalingaiah said by email.“Preterm birth is a multifactorial issue,” she said.SOURCE: http://1.usa.gov/1pHVqHq Environmental Health Perspectives, online March 29, 2016."

Andrew Cuomo (D) cited New York's proud history of fighting for LGBT rights dating back to the Stonewall Riots in his announcement of an executive order prohibiting use of state funds for nonessential employee travel to North Carolina. Cuomo temporarily issued a ban against Indiana in 2015 after it passed similar legislation that was later amended.""In New York, we believe that all people -- regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation -- deserve the same rights and protections under the law,"" Cuomo said in a statement accompanying his executive order.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) announced his decision to enact a city employee travel ban at a press conference on Monday, warning that the country’s largest city would enact the same policy for travel if Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal's veto Monday of a similar bill in his state ends up being overridden.Though Deal said he would not be influenced by “insults or threats,” warnings from Salesforce and Disney, among other major business, that they would leave the state if Georgia passed the law are widely believed to have played a role in his decision.“I think it’s quite clear that voices of conscience all over the country are expressing outrage at these decisions which are re-instituting discrimination against the LGBT community,” de Blasio said, according to Politico. “My hope is that both these states will relent, but we certainly are not going to have any non-essential travel to those states if these laws do continue in effect.”Seattle Mayor Ed Murray (D) rolled out a ban on city-funded employee travel to North Carolina on Monday with an executive order laying out the reasons for the new policy.“It is my hope for our nation that we do not allow issues of discrimination to divide us,” Murray said in a statement about the executive order. “Our union is only made stronger when all Americans are treated equitably.”North Carolina has drawn a major backlash from a growing number of governments and businesses in response to HB 2, a controversial new law it passed on Wednesday. In addition to prohibiting local laws against LGBT discrimination in the state, the legislation implemented a new statewide anti-discrimination policy that specifically excludes lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from protections against discrimination.North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) remained defiant about the law on Monday, dismissing criticism of it as “political theater.”Clarification: Language has been amended to more accurately describe the legislation."

The letter is currently up for sale at Nate D. Sanders Auctions.While Lee's letter was penned just a few months after the casino opened, Trump's Taj Mahal filed for bankruptcy the following year.

The Emmy-nominated narrator is currently working on releasing a motion comic -- or what he describes as ""a hybrid between an audiobook and animation""-- titled “Mike Tomb” that is inspired by his own life. Much like the comic’s protagonist, Mendez also comes from a family of Dominican-American headstone makers and felt pressured at a young age to continue within the family business instead of following his own dreams.“I’m the only one in the family who is not running the headstone business at this point,” Mendez told The Huffington Post in a recent phone interview. “I’ve always wanted to write about that but I always thought that I would bore people if I did an autobiography. So what I did was I took elements that were inspired by my experiences growing up in the headstone business and kind of injected it in this supernatural thriller kind of story.”Anthony Mendez had a long career narrating on-air promos and movie trailers before his big break as the ""Latin Lover"" narrator on ""Jane."" But the Bronx-born Dominican voice actor says it's actually always been a life-long dream to create a comic book franchise. He initially wrote ""Mike Tomb"" as a screenplay before adapting it into a graphic novel, now Mendez is hoping to transform it into a motion comic to be released this December.

The Emmy-nominated narrator is currently working on releasing a motion comic -- or what he describes as ""a hybrid between an audiobook and animation""-- titled “Mike Tomb” that is inspired by his own life. Much like the comic’s protagonist, Mendez also comes from a family of Dominican-American headstone makers and felt pressured at a young age to continue within the family business instead of following his own dreams.“I’m the only one in the family who is not running the headstone business at this point,” Mendez told The Huffington Post in a recent phone interview. “I’ve always wanted to write about that but I always thought that I would bore people if I did an autobiography. So what I did was I took elements that were inspired by my experiences growing up in the headstone business and kind of injected it in this supernatural thriller kind of story.”Anthony Mendez had a long career narrating on-air promos and movie trailers before his big break as the ""Latin Lover"" narrator on ""Jane."" But the Bronx-born Dominican voice actor says it's actually always been a life-long dream to create a comic book franchise. He initially wrote ""Mike Tomb"" as a screenplay before adapting it into a graphic novel, now Mendez is hoping to transform it into a motion comic to be released this December. He will be narrating the project as well as voicing Mike Tomb and one or two other character.

The ordinance passed 6 to 1, according to Councilman Sam Liebert, one of the authors of the measure. It provides protections to residents in public accommodations and employment on the basis of 17 categories, including race, religion, military service, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity. The measure also specifically would allow transgender people to use a public restroom based on the gender they identify with, rather than the gender on their birth certificate. ""Local cities know what is best for their residents, and the Janesville council members did the right thing by passing protections that ensure none of their constituents can be denied a job or refused services because of who they are,"" said Matt McTighe, executive director of the pro-LGBT rights group Freedom for All Americans. ""This measure will improve the lives of countless people and their families, and will hurt no one.""Liebert said he and another member of the council spent months working on the ordinance, looking at the three other cities in Wisconsin with similar measures. They knew that some conservatives in the community would specifically object to the bathroom issue, so they made sure that the other cities hadn't had any issues. ""Our congressman is also the speaker of the House. It would be nice to see him on the right side of history, being in support of these types of protections on the federal level as well. That doesn't hurt to let him know that his hometown overwhelmingly supports these types of protections,"" Liebert told The Huffington Post Tuesday.Ryan's office said it had no comment on the local ordinance. Wisconsin was the first state to pass nondiscrimination protections for lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals, but it still lacks the same rights for transgender people. There are no sexual orientation and gender identity protections at the federal level, although legislation has been introduced to provide them.North Carolina passed a law last week that bars localities from passing LGBT-inclusive ordinances, such as the one the Janesville city council approved. Donald Trump has a rally scheduled in Janesville on Tuesday. Dozens of protesters showed up Monday night in advance of the event, previewing the opposition the GOP presidential front-runner may face when he arrives.

13,POLITICS,House Conservatives Are Trying To Kill The Lame-Duck Session,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-conservatives-lame-duck_us_56fad472e4b0143a9b49802f,"The Republican leading the charge says that when Congress comes back after November elections, ""the American public gets screwed.""",2016-03-29,Rep. Paul Gosar is leading the charge against a lame-duck session. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fad57b1e0000950071198a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The House Freedom Caucus has already changed the direction of Congress this year, derailing -- at least temporarily -- a House GOP budget that conservatives argue spends too much. Now they have a new target in sight: the lame-duck session.When the House returns from a two-week recess on April 12, a small group of members are gearing up to stop GOP leadership in both chambers, if they have their way, from holding a legislative session after the November election.It’s not that the members are lazy, though doing away with the postelection session would mean the House would be in just 17 days for the rest of the year after July 15 -- and zero past Sept. 30.Conservative members say they are trying to stop Congress from doing anything after the November election because Congress does some of its most slapdash lawmaking once the public has voted. The group of lawmakers, anchored by the House Freedom Caucus, doesn’t want to take any chances that the Senate confirms a Supreme Court nominee or that Congress rams through the expansive Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal or a big budget agreement that raises spending.“If you look at these lame ducks, you know, the American public gets screwed,” Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), the Freedom Caucus member leading the charge against the postelection session, told The Huffington Post last week. “Increased spending, all these favors that we got to do for people -- it’s got to stop.”Gosar said he’s pitched the idea to the House Freedom Caucus of trying to find a way to kill the lame-duck session, “and everybody agrees.”While they don’t seem to have a clear plan yet on how exactly they would prevent GOP leadership -- particularly in the Senate -- from not holding a lame-duck session, the Freedom Caucus and its nearly 40 members have the power to block procedural votes. And Gosar told HuffPost that he’s already spoken to a number of outside conservative groups who have told him, “Count us in.”“Here’s the story,” Gosar said. “We’re not going to do the appropriations process. We’re going to make the valiant effort, if we can even get this budget out.”And once it’s clear that Congress can’t actually do appropriations bills because of a disagreement over how much the government should spend, Gosar continued, GOP leadership in both chambers will “throw their hands up” and Congress will pass a bill to keep government agencies running at their current levels. Government funding runs out on Sept. 30, so Congress will at least need a short-term spending bill -- a continuing resolution, or CR, in congressional parlance -- if lawmakers can’t get spending legislation out of both chambers and signed by the president.At this point, a CR is looking likely. But what remains unclear is for how long. Gosar and other conservatives want it to go until at least March.“Give the new Congress and the new president a chance to get a budget done,” he said.But even if the CR goes until March 2017, conservatives worry about leaders finding other ways to use must-pass pieces of legislation. One Freedom Caucus member recently told HuffPost there was a lot of concern that a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization could be used for something else, which is why the HFC has been pushing to kick the FAA bill into next year -- a timeline that lawmakers privately say is picking up steam.“The word out of our committee is it probably doesn’t have long legs, and so it’s just going to be a reauthorization, like a temporary reauthorization,” one Transportation Committee member told HuffPost last week, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private committee deliberations. “I think it’s going to be next year until there’s a real FAA reauthorization.”But the two real concerns for conservatives are the Supreme Court and TPP.While the House doesn’t get a vote on a Supreme Court nominee, members recognize that, for better or for worse, shutting down the lame-duck session in both chambers would prevent the Senate from confirming Merrick Garland.HFC member Scott Perry (R-Pa.), who told HuffPost that he leans toward the no-lame-duck position, said his only concern with killing the postelection session is that, if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, she would probably nominate someone more liberal than Garland.“So you got to be careful what you ask for here,” Perry said. But for HFC board member Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), legislators don’t get to “pick and choose.” “The principle’s the principle, right?” Mulvaney told HuffPost last week. “Which is that the new president gets to nominate the nominee. And if that’s the principle, well, then you got to stick with the principle.”Mulvaney said people know what a lame-duck session is really about. “It’s a bunch of people who have already either quit, retired or been fired by their constituents decide they still want to vote on major stuff,” he said.“It’s the least accountable time for Congress,” Mulvaney continued. “It’s an accident of history. We should probably think about getting rid of it entirely.”Asked about how it would look for Congress to do so little in the last half of the year, Mulvaney mentioned that lawmakers are supposed to be working in their districts during that time, but he agreed “the optics are bad.”Still, what Congress could do in the postelection session scares Mulvaney more than a public relations issue.“When you’re one of the people who tends to think most of what we do here is screwed up in the first place,” Mulvaney said, “then the less we do, maybe the better.”That seems to be the position that most Freedom Caucus members take on TPP.With the heated campaign still going on, GOP leaders look to be holding off on the trade legislation until at least the election. At this point, the trade deal seems to have a real vote problem. But some conservatives think TPP is only a matter of time.“TPP is like Ex-Im Bank: You can get excited about it not happening, but it’s going to happen,” said Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who was against the Export-Import Bank and is unlikely to support TPP.“I mean, I don’t think it’s not going to happen,” Massie said of TPP. “I just don’t see it.”Massie, who is not in the Freedom Caucus, has been working closely with Gosar on trying to end the lame-duck session, and he said he doesn’t see anything good coming out of Congress after November.When asked about the optics of members essentially packing it up for the year in July, Massie thought about the question for a moment, then offered a response fitting with the let’s-not-take-any-chances strategy.“I’ve been doing pretty good the last three to six months not doing any press,” he said. “Got to stay out of trouble.”"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) does. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fae8e91e000095007119ad.jpeg?ops=crop_0_34_3500_1872%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton has improved her fundraising performance with small-dollar contributors by drawing attention to how her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has raised more money from that class of donors.Clinton’s fundraising emails increasingly attempt to galvanize her supporters by mentioning reality television star Donald Trump, the likely Republican presidential nominee. But a more sustained trend is her fundraising team’s use of Sanders’ success with small donors, or those who give less than $200, to encourage potential Clinton contributors to chip in.While Clinton posted a much-improved small-donor number in February, Sanders’ near-total reliance on small donors is unprecedented. The senator had raised nearly $140 million by the end of last month, with two-thirds of that haul coming from small donors. Clinton, in contrast, raised just $19 million from small donors last year.“Bernie raised $4 million in 48 hours,” noted a fundraising email sent Monday signed by Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook. Another email from Mook had a similar subject line, after Sanders won the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary: “Bernie raised $6 million yesterday.” Ahead of the last debate between the two candidates earlier this month Dennis Cheng, Clinton's national finance director, warned her supporters in an email that Sanders would likely announce that he has received five million contributions to his campaign onstage, (which he did mention).Her campaign announced that it had reached the milestone of 1 million individual donors on March 18: the Sanders campaign, however, has nearly doubled that number. Clinton’s touting of her increased haul from small donors has led to rebukes from fact-checkers. Politifact, for instance, debunked her claim from earlier this month that her campaign “depends on small donors for the majority of our support.”Clinton’s team has both highlighted and denied the disparity in small-dollar fundraising between her campaign and Sanders’. Multiple emails suggest that her donors “haven’t gotten as much credit as [they] deserve,” and that “the Sanders campaign continues to … act like you don’t exist.” But other emails implicitly chastise her supporters for not contributing the way Sanders’ have. One email from February signed by Mook said “more of [Sanders’] team has stepped up to own a piece of their success -- and I need everyone here to do the same.”Clinton’s campaign has claimed to its supporters that reaching milestones with small-dollar donors is only symbolically important -- “This isn’t about the money” -- while also writing “The resources we bring in before [the next fundraising deadline] will determine how strong we will be going into” upcoming primaries. (The latter message would seem to contradict the former.) The rhetoric behind these emails has a dual purpose of convincing supporters and non-supporters alike that Clinton still needs small-dollar support to wrap up the primary, even as a super PAC backing Clinton, Priorities USA, is “waiting in the wings,” as Sanders’ campaign has put it, to unleash the millions it has raised. Sanders’ emails tell his supporters they are part of a movement, highlighting attendance numbers from rallies and fundraising records they have shattered. He frequently brings up the millions Clinton earned in speaking fees from financial services firms after she left the State Department, and her support from the fossil fuel industry.While Clinton’s fundraising emails argue she’s the underdog in the primary when it comes to small donors, Sanders has tried to de-emphasize his dominance. An email from last week signed by his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, noted that Clinton and Priorities USA took in almost $35 million in February -- without mentioning that his campaign out-raised hers that month.

15,POLITICS,New Trump Aide Likes Strongmen For Clients,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-paul-manafort-jr_us_56fafbaae4b083f5c605f304,Remember the corrupt pro-Putin president of Ukraine? An early Reaganite outsider turned wealthy D.C. lobbyist was his campaign adviser.,2016-03-29,Donald Trump's new campaign addition has a history of advising controversial clients.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fb07411e0000b3007059ca.jpeg?cache=XAXrlzRjdS&ops=crop_0_197_1946_1517%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Paul Manafort Jr. is almost eerily perfect for the role of Donald Trump’s Republican convention master.Manafort’s last major political consulting job was handling the 2010 campaign of Victor Yanukovych for president of Ukraine. Yanukovych won, but was ousted in a coup four years later after he had expanded his $75 million mansion, suppressed rival political parties and freedom of the press, and undermined Ukrainian independence by cozying up to Russia’s Vladimir Putin on trade, energy and security.Now Manafort’s job is to make sure that Trump -- who lives in a $300 million mansion, disdains the press and admires Putin -- can translate his primary and caucus victories into the Republican nomination in Cleveland in July.Trump realized that he needed a seasoned pro to identify, woo and keep track of trustworthy convention delegates. If he falls short of the majority needed to win in the primaries and caucuses, his foes will try to fill those delegate slots with disloyal “Trojan horses” or use rules and floor tactics to deny him in the nomination.That’s where Manafort comes in.“He’ll do more than just count delegates -- he will get the data, get to know everyone, and run much of the operation from here on,” predicted Roger Stone, a longtime Trump associate and a former business partner of Manafort.Starting with the College Republicans and Young Republicans in the 1970s, moving through many GOP conventions, the 66-year-old Manafort has amassed deep experience in the care, feeding and disciplining of delegates.His main work over the years has been to run consulting firms that advised controversial clients ranging from the late Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines to leaders in Russia, Nigeria, Burma, Kenya, Angola and the Bahamas.(Manafort could not be reached for comment; the Trump campaign did not answer a request for comment on their adviser's foreign work.) Insiders of other campaigns agree that Manafort is a formidable addition. “He doesn’t know all the players but he knows the game,” said Charlie Black, an adviser to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and another former Manafort business partner.Manafort’s return is part of a remarkable re-emergence -- and probably the last hurrah -- of a group of GOP operatives who started as teenage devotees of Barry Goldwater in the 1960s. Besides Black, Manafort and Stone (the original name of their first consulting firm in the 1980s), the list includes Karl Rove, George W. Bush’s campaign manager and now an undeclared leader of the movement by party insiders to stop Trump in his tracks.In an ever-shifting series of alliances, these four (plus the late Lee Atwater, who ran George H.W. Bush’s campaign in 1988) rose to power, prominence and wealth in Washington in the name of the anti-Washington Ronald Reagan.Black, who began as a volunteer for right-wing TV essayist Jesse Helms in North Carolina in 1972, is now a key figure at Burson-Marsteller, the global public relations firm.Stone, who as a Goldwater fan volunteered for Nixon in 1972 while a student at George Washington University, has handled casino lobbying for Trump, among other lucrative gigs.Rove, who also worked for Nixon in 1972 and became an earlier pioneer in GOP “direct mail” consulting, has become a cottage industry of column and book-writing in D.C.Then in their early 20s, the four men first joined in politics together in 1973, as Rove was running for the job of president of the College Republicans. His key aide was Atwater; Black, Stone and Manafort all backed another candidate, Terry Dolan.Rove won, but Dolan, Stone and Black went on in 1975 to form the first independent Reaganite “attack” PAC, called the National Conservative Political Action Committee.NCPAC was part of a rising Baby Boomer tide on the right, as a new generation inspired by Goldwater, Reagan and William F. Buckley challenged the more moderate Republicanism of Eisenhower and the Eastern Establishment.Having grown comfortable, and rich, in the corridors of power, they are not as doctrinaire as their once were, and now find themselves working either for Kasich, who himself began as a Reagan acolyte in 1976 (working for Black, in fact, in that campaign), or Trump, who arguably is as much of a Democrat by background as he is a Republican.Although the Trump and Kasich factions have no great love for each other, they both have an enemy they truly loathe: Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.The 45-year-old Cruz would say that is because he represents a new generation that is a true revival of Reagan and Reaganism. Cruz wears the denim cowboy shirts to try to prove it.But the older “boys on the right” perhaps see a measure of their own naked ambition in Cruz. “He’s a product of Princeton and Harvard and his wife works for Goldman Sachs,” said Stone. “He’s would be TOTALLY Establishment if he could be. It’s just that nobody can stand him as a person.”That never stopped Stone, Black, Atwater, Rove or Manafort."

The announcement comes following InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times reporting that found Exxon’s scientific experts knew about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, but the company worked publicly to undermine climate science. Other AGs said they would also get involved in investigations and enforcement actions against the fossil fuel industry, without specifically citing the Exxon example.""Certain industries may not have told the whole story,"" Healey said at a press conference with six other attorneys general on Tuesday. ""Companies that deceived investors and consumers about the dangers of climate change should be, must be held accountable.""Claude Walker, the Attorney General for the U.S. Virgin Islands, also said his office is investigating another, unnamed company over similar allegations.Suzanne McCarron, ExxonMobil's vice president for public and government affairs, put out a statement Tuesday afternoon calling the AGs' effort ""politically motivated and based on discredited reporting funded by activist organizations.""""We are actively assessing all legal options,"" she said.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has already subpoenaed Exxon for internal documents related to climate change.

""You have to tell the truth,"" he said. ""You can't make misrepresentations of the kind we've seen here.""Schneiderman pointed to his office's settlement last fall with coal company Peabody Energy over allegations that it had misled investors and failed to disclose the risks it faces due to climate change-related regulations.

17,POLITICS,Obama Administration Offers Desperately Needed Help For People Addicted To Opioids,Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opioid-addiction-patient-limits-suboxone_us_56f9aa0be4b0143a9b491020,HHS lays out its plan to raise the patient cap for doctors prescribing addiction medication.,2016-03-29,HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell has pushed for an evidence-based response to the opioid epidemic.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f9d6c7150000ad000b3560.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a proposed rule on Tuesday to double the number of patients a doctor can treat with an opioid addiction medication that public health officials consider essential. The change could help alleviate the long waiting lists in places hard hit by the opioid epidemic and tilt the U.S. drug treatment system toward a more evidence-based approach.“This is an important step and I think it’s a very public signal of how we think about it and what we believe,” said HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell in an interview with The Huffington Post. She said she expects the rule to go into effect before President Barack Obama leaves office.When the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of buprenorphine in 2002 to treat opioid addiction, public health officials saw it as a huge victory. Combined with counseling, this kind of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is seen as the standard of care by public health entities all over the world. With the FDA's clearance, opioid addiction in the U.S. could be treated like any other chronic disease -- with visits to a primary-care doctor. Except there was a catch: patient limits.Under the current regulations, doctors can treat only 30 patients at a time in the first year they're certified to prescribe buprenorphine. They can receive authorization to go up to 100 patients in subsequent years. If the proposed rule goes into effect, certified doctors could treat as many as 200 patients at a time in their third year.The possible expansion of buprenorphine prescribing is one of several initiatives the Obama administration has recently announced. Earlier this month, HHS awarded $94 million to 271 health centers in an effort mainly to increase access to medication-assisted treatment. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration will be awarding another $11 million to as many as 11 states to help provide MAT as well.In comparison, the new patient-limit rule may seem like a minor technical fix. But it’s a fix on which public health advocates and addiction medicine specialists have been lobbying for a decade. The number of doctors who choose to prescribe buprenorphine has been lower than hoped or anticipated. Inevitably, they've maxed out the number of patients they can treat.“This has been an ongoing issue for years,” said Dr. Kelly Clark, the American Society of Addiction Medicine’s president-elect. “People are on waiting lists and dying.”Even in cities like Baltimore, where there has been public policy support for buprenorphine, access to MAT is still an issue. “The need for additional capacity in the system is absolutely real,” said Yngvild Olsen, medical director of the Institutes for Behavior Resources in Baltimore.The recent and alarming rise in overdose deaths across the country has exposed the need for more doctors to treat addiction and for expanded prescribing capacity for the ones that already do. In January of last year, a Huffington Post investigation found that without access to MAT, people with opioid addiction were struggling in traditional, abstinence-only treatment centers, which tend to shun the use of medications like buprenorphine (commonly sold as Suboxone) and methadone. A follow-up story showed how rural areas in particular are failing to meet demand for those medications, with patients having to travel hundreds of miles to find a doctor willing to treat them.“The acceptance of medication-assisted treatment -- there has been an evolution,” Burwell said. “We’re getting to a place where it’s much more accepted.” But she cautioned there are still too many affected families and treatment facilities that aren’t informed about MAT. “I think we have more work to do to make sure that people know that this is an evidence-based tool.”The patient limits were originally set out of a fear that buprenorphine, a semi-synthetic opioid that can produce a high if used incorrectly, would be diverted to the black market. But studies have shown that the vast majority of those buying the medication illegally are doing so to self-treat their addiction. In other words, the lack of legal access has actually helped spur the black market.When Burwell visited Congress before her confirmation in 2014, the patient limits came up in conversations with lawmakers. “The buprenorphine cap was something that was brought to my attention in a number of different ways,” she said. ""Sen. [Carl] Levin, who is no longer a senator, handed me a number of pieces of paper and articles about this issue -- I still remember, I came into the meeting to talk about my confirmation and this was the issue he wanted to focus on,” she recalled.Last September, Burwell announced that reforms were coming before a conference of the country’s treatment system administrators and doctors meeting in Northern Virginia. When she broke the news, the room erupted with applause.Officials within HHS then began meeting with everyone across the federal government who had a stake in the opioid crisis, from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, to figure out just where to establish the new patient limits. The DEA offered no resistance to expanding access to buprenorphine, Burwell said. That response suggests a thawing of the relationship between the two departments. “In general, the history has not always been a smooth and easy one between HHS and DEA, but you couldn’t have asked for better partners than them this time,” said Richard Frank, HHS’s assistant secretary for planning and evaluation. “I think people have figured out that we’re not going to arrest our way out of this problem, and I think there’s been sort of a change in leadership and attitude from bottom to top.”The question that officials discussed wasn’t whether to expand the patient limit, but by how much. “Nobody knows, like, the magic number here, right?” Frank told HuffPost. “We were sort of balancing two principles: We wanted to do something that we thought would meaningfully expand access, but we wanted to move cautiously because there are risks of diversion.”Under the proposed rule, a certified doctor who wants to go to 200 patients must also provide those patients with access to behavioral health services and have a plan in place to prevent diversion of the medication to the black market. Frank said HHS would be evaluating the impact of increased patient capacity as well.If the 200-patient limit proves not to be high enough to meet demand, he said, HHS can propose further adjustments.The American Society of Addiction Medicine, for example, had wanted to phase in a 500-patient cap. The Senate health committee recently passed an amendment that recommended a similar increase.The amendment also called for nurse practitioners and physician assistants to be able to prescribe buprenorphine. Frank said HHS doesn't have the authority to include such medical personnel in its proposed rule. But it hopes to do a large-scale pilot program with nurse practitioners and physician assistants.Besides allowing currently certified doctors to treat more patients, the rule may help spur others to get certified and start their own MAT practices. After Burwell made her September announcement that reforms were coming, Dr. Clark McCoy, who runs a clinic for people addicted to opioids in Fort Collins, Colorado, started taking Medicaid patients. He figured that with the potential to add more patients, he could afford the lower reimbursement rates.McCoy said he is disappointed with the proposed 200-patient limit. He estimates that his practice could responsibly handle 300 patients, with 30-minute doctor visits.“No one should die waiting for this treatment, and unfortunately it’s happened a lot,” he said. “The main roadblock has been lack of providers offering the treatment.”Alan and Sheryl Walters, who live in Northern Kentucky, know the agony of being turned away by a doctor who is at the patient limit. Their son Taylor had been through detox and a three-month outpatient program. None of it worked. His mother tried to find a doctor who could prescribe him buprenorphine. But the one doctor she found had no openings. Taylor died of an overdose two weeks after completing a 45-day rehabilitation program in February 2013.""It’s a long time needed,” said Alan Walters of the proposed higher patient limit. “I think for the families that are struggling with it now, I think they will benefit from it.”Walters still remembers how hard it was to hear his wife on the phone begging doctors for help. “It was as tough as hearing her in the emergency room when she saw Taylor for the first time dead,” he said. “She was screaming, begging for Jesus Christ to come back and resurrect him. When she was calling around places for Taylor, just the desperation in her voice … it was incredibly hard to hear Sheryl in desperation, trying to save our son’s life, trying to get him in to see a doctor.”Ryan Grim contributed reporting."

Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she would meet with President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, although many of her Republican colleagues said they would not.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fac4831e00009500711960.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans' reasoning for not considering President Barack Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court holds ""no basis"" in fact, according to Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).Arguing that the next president should nominate the next Supreme Court justice, Republican leaders have said they will not meet with nominee Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, let alone hold hearings or a vote on his appointment. Collins broke with her party and immediately said she would meet with Garland after Obama nominated him to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. She's continued to be vocal about her split in the weeks since, telling Maine's Newsradio WGAN on Tuesday that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) isn't pleased with her dissent. ""The leader's not real happy with me,"" Collins said, adding that she even reread the Constitution to make sure she was remembering it correctly. ""I knew there was no limit on when during a president's term he appoints nominees to the court, but I wanted to make sure I really understood the exact wording,"" she said. While Collins says she understands why a majority of her colleagues are opposed to holding hearings to consider Garland, she disagrees with their logic.""The president, whether Republicans like him or not, is our president until next January, until Inauguration Day, and it just seemed to me that there was no basis for saying that no matter who the president nominates, we were not going to consider that individual,"" she said. ""I don't know how exactly this decision was made.""Collins faulted both parties for jumping straight into an ""inappropriate"" political scuffle before Scalia's body had even been removed from the ranch where he died. The fight over Scalia's replacement has become a central talking point on the campaign trail. Democrats are hoping it will hurt Republicans' chances of maintaining control of the Senate. Collins mused that Garland would likely be a more appealing nominee than anyone former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or GOP front-runner Donald Trump might appoint if one of them is elected president. ""If the next president is a Democrat, then the balance could be tipped way further than Judge Garland,"" Collins said of the court. ""If the nominee is Mr. Trump, and he becomes the next president, who knows who his nominee would be. He’s rather unpredictable."""
19,POLITICS,"The Sanders-Clinton Debate Flap, Explained",Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sanders-clinton-debate_us_56fab426e4b0143a9b49561f,"Or, ""How to avoid a dumb two-day media flap: The super-easy guide for idiots.""",2016-03-29,"Bernie Sanders wants more debates with Hillary Clinton, which makes sense because he's currently losing. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56faf3d6150000ad000b371f.jpeg?ops=crop_177_29_2503_1680%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In the primary season thus far, the Democratic candidates have debated on nine occasions, some of which -- the ones not scheduled on weekends, or holidays, or staged within Schrodinger's Box -- you may have seen. There could be two more, one in April and one in May, but they're pending.Bernie Sanders would very much like to debate Hillary Clinton in New York before that state's April 19 primary. Clinton, on the other hand, would prefer not to. But the Clinton campaign bungled its refusal, turning the situation into a Thing that has drawn criticism from all directions. So before we get too far down the Thinkpiece Road, let's demystify all of this with a little real talk.During the primary season, the debate schedule is mostly decided by party elites who like to wrest control over the primary process and keep it from going off the rails. The efforts exerted by the GOP, in this regard, made a small amount of news last year. On the Democratic side, the decisions made about the debates have mostly centered on the aforementioned odd scheduling of those events and a follow-on critique from some in the Democratic Party that the debate schedule was largely designed to benefit Hillary Clinton, the party's leading institutional choice for the nomination.That critique is absolutely true, by the way. Nevertheless, it is arguable that there have now been an adequate number of debates to discern the philosophical and policy differences between the two Democratic candidates. So, why have more?It's simple really. There is only one type of candidate who demands additional debates: a candidate who is losing that election. This is axiomatic. It is equally axiomatic that there is only one type of candidate who declines the opportunity to debate: the candidate who is winning. Right now, Hillary Clinton is winning the primary and Bernie Sanders is losing. Both campaigns are, by and large, behaving precisely how you'd expect them to behave.(Before ardent fans of these candidates get up in my grill, please note that I've used the terms ""winning"" and ""losing,"" and not ""won"" and ""lost."")See, there is only one reason you'd want to keep debating after you've already debated nine times: If you're the candidate who's running behind, you can receive the benefit of a free media appearance, which could theoretically be leveraged to reverse your electoral fortunes. Otherwise, you wouldn't do it. Debating is an arduous and stressful process that you have to devote resources to -- resources that could otherwise be spent elsewhere. It's only candidacies that need to use a debate as a Hail Mary play that get strenuously worked up about demanding additional debates.Candidates who are winning, or who have the inside track to winning, prefer to eliminate variables and keep a good thing going. They don't hand their opponents an opportunity to get a leg up. Offering additional debates when you are ahead is like a football team passing on first down with a lead late in the fourth quarter -- a stupid thing to do.Back in the 2012 primary season, Newt Gingrich famously challenged President Barack Obama to debate him, in the baroque style of the Lincoln-Douglas debates. He did this because he was losing, and also because he is a thorough-going egomaniac. Obama, as you might expect, refused Gingrich's request, correctly recognizing that debating Gingrich during the GOP primary that Gingrich was losing was an insane idea with absolutely zero upside for him. Gingrich's challenge was accepted by Herman Cain and Jon Huntsman, both of whom were also losing the race and desperate for a ""game-changing"" gimmick.Of course, if you cast your mind back four years earlier, guess who you'll find saying, ""I just believe that this is the most important job in the world, it's the toughest job in the world ... you should be willing to debate anytime, anywhere""? Just guess!That's right! It was Hillary Clinton.Is Clinton thus being hypocritical? I suppose it's a fair charge if today is your introduction to American politics. Otherwise, no. As stated above: Losing candidates demand additional debates and winning candidates decline them. At the time of this video, Clinton was losing the primary. She's not now. Her actions are therefore consistent. You might think it more sporting for her to participate in additional debates, but I'd call it the actions of an erratic and deeply weird campaign.But having said that, the Clinton campaign's response to Sanders' demand for an additional debate in New York was erratic and deeply weird.The challenge you face, if you find yourself up in a primary with your competitor nipping at you to agree to additional debates, is that when you decline to do so, your competitor is going to dine out a little on your refusal and categorize you as a coward. It's a bit of bitter fruit, but it's best to digest it quickly and skip to the part where your opponent's repeated demands start making them look desperate. The best way to dodge additional debates is simply to cite scheduling difficulties and move on, optimistically, to your own campaign events.This is a feat that Clinton campaign strategist Joel Benenson almost managed in an interview with CNN's Kate Bolduan, before he totally cocked it all up. As Politico's Nick Gass reported:CNN's Kate Bolduan then inquired why the campaign would not agree to debate in New York despite agreeing in January to more debates. Benenson responded, “Because we agreed to debates up to a certain point. We’re now out campaigning in these states.”See? That's fine. Fine. The campaign fulfilled their obligation, and now has a busy schedule of campaigning. Nothing more needs to be said, just stick to that.Unfortunately for Benenson, in an earlier part of the interview, Bolduan asked him to respond to ""a Washington Post story in which Sanders' campaign discussed possible efforts to sharpen rhetoric against the former secretary of state."" Benenson responded archly, noting that Sanders, who'd previously suggested that he'd not run negative ads, was now doing so and planning to continue.So when Bolduan's follow-up question about Sanders' debate demand inevitably came, rather than stick to his ""we're now out campaigning"" talking point, Benenson attempted a hybrid response that recalled his critique of Sanders negative tone, and got it all wrong:""What's the risk?"" Bolduan asked.And that's just ridiculous. In the first place, there is absolutely no way that a change in Sanders' campaign tone might open the door to an additional New York debate. To suggest that the Sanders campaign could merit itself another debate if it would start behaving to the liking of the Clinton campaign is false on its face. Come on, man.But more to the point, suggesting that it's Sanders' critical tone that's driving the Clinton campaign from agreeing to an additional debate might be the daffiest thing I've ever heard. What is a debate if not an opportunity for the debaters to raise criticisms of each other? For Clinton's campaign strategist to suggest that Sanders hasn't earned the right to criticize Clinton on the debate stage because he keeps criticizing her off the debate stage is a contention that demands mockery.The truth is that the only one with a tonal problem here is Benenson, who easily could have set aside Sanders' request with a little optimistic talk about a successful campaign with a packed schedule of campaign stops. Instead, he boofed it, creating a completely needless news cycle distraction, and reminding us once again that the Clinton campaign team strangely treats the actual process of campaigning as an unnecessary hardship that's been somehow foisted upon them unfairly.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits ""Eat The Press"" for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast ""So, That Happened.""

Colorado-based startup Boom Technology is developing a prototype of a plane that flies at more than twice the speed of sound, capable of making the trip from New York City to London in just 3.4 hours. Last week, Virgin Galactic signed on to help develop and build the plane, meaning a better era of supersonic air travel could be just around the corner. The Concorde was the last commercial airplane that beat the speed of sound, before services were retired in 2003. While round-trips on the Concorde cost an average of $12,000 at the time, according to Air & Space, round trips from New York to London with Boom are projected to cost $5,000.“We are talking about the first supersonic jet people can afford to fly,” founder Blake Scholl told The Guardian. The planes should be able to complete trips from San Francisco to Tokyo in 4.7 hours and L.A. to Sydney in 6 hours, Boom says on its website. Virgin Galactic intends to help engineer, design and manufacture the supersonic Boom plane. The prototype is not operational yet and Boom is still seeking more funding, but the project is a promising step toward an era in which extra-speedy air travel could become the norm.Other concept jets like Skreemr, which could fly from London to NYC in just 30 minutes, have been proposed by engineers and inventors looking for the next leap forward. Hey, a little healthy competition never hurt... right?"

He believes in not only erring on the side of life, but also minimizing any pain that may be caused to an unborn child,"" a spokesman for Republican Governor Gary Herbert said in a statement.Supporters of the bill and anti-abortion groups say that around the 20th week of pregnancy a fetus can feel physical pain, and anesthesia can eliminate discomfort.Reproductive health advocates, including Planned Parenthood of Utah, told the Tribune the position is scientifically unproven and lawmakers have inserted politics into a private medical matter.Under the new law, doctors performing abortions would be required to administer anesthesia to women seeking an elective abortion around 20 weeks. Previous state law gave women the choice whether or not to opt for anesthesia.Abortions are prohibited in Utah after the point when the fetus is viable, which is around 22 weeks.The law will not affect a large number of women, the Tribune reported, with 17 women in Utah receiving abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy or later in 2014, it said.Republican state Senator Curt Bramble, who sponsored the bill, had originally wanted to ban abortions after 20 weeks but was told the move would be unconstitutional, the Salt Lake Tribune reported."

On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission will consider a proposal that would subsidize broadband Internet for low-income households. If it's adopted, eligible Americans could receive $9.25 a month to help pay for online access. The measure would update the decades-old Lifeline subsidy, which provides discounted phone service for poor Americans.This could be a boon for the estimated 5 million American families who still lack Internet access. Groups who support the subsidy say it will help reverse inequalities in Internet use. But for many poor Americans, getting by in an increasingly digitized world will require more than cheap Internet, experts say.""There's a whole range of other factors that determine whether you benefit or not from Internet access,"" Blanca Gordo, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, told The Huffington Post. More than half of low-income Americans with Internet access complain that it's slow, and a quarter say they share a computer with too many other people, according to a recent study. In addition, some people have no computer access at all. For many poor Americans, a cell phone is their only portal to the Internet, according to Laura Robinson, an assistant professor of sociology at Santa Clara University. That puts them at a serious disadvantage, she said. ""Think about typing your resume on a smartphone and trying to get a job with it,"" Robinson told HuffPost ""You can update your linked in page, but can you update your cover letter?""People with low incomes also tend to lack experience using the Internet, according to Gordo.""We take for granted how much time it has taken for us to learn [how to use the Internet],"" Gordo explained. ""If you entered this system the '90s, you have developed some awareness of how it functions. But if you’re a new entrant, there’s a lot to learn.""Without the knowledge that comes from experience, it's difficult for people to develop the confidence and skills needed to use the Internet effectively, Robinson said. Having access without experience is like having car keys but not knowing how to drive, Robinson explained. You might technically be able to get behind the wheel, ""but you expend so much emotional energy to operate the vehicle, that you can’t look out the window,"" she said. For Robinson, experience and confidence are more important than the quality of one's Internet connection. ""If you take someone who is confident [in their ability to use the Internet] and say, 'You have dial-up for the day,' they would say, 'Gee, that sucks,' but they would know how to optimize,"" Robinson said. For someone who hasn't spent much time on the Internet, she said, ""they might do just as badly with all of the resources in the world.""Not being able to use the Internet effectively comes with financial and social costs. Products often cost more in stores than online, and a growing number of basic activities, including applying for jobs and signing up for government services, require people to use the Internet, according to Gordo. ""I cannot believe that in 2016 we’re still wondering if Internet access is a need, when everyday, everywhere you’re required to go online,"" Gordo said. The government's proposed broadband subsidy is a necessary step toward greater digital equality, Gordo added. ""But this should have happened long ago.""Robinson agrees. The stakes are high, she said. ""For poor families, it's still 'We can’t eat if we’re paying for Internet.'"" CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated that the FCC's proposal would allow low-income people to pay $9.25 a month for Internet access. In fact, the program would give $9.25 to help cover the cost of access. "

People assume that women and minorities go out of their way to hire people like them -- but who might not be the best candidates for the job. The only kind of person who can hire a woman or person of color and not face negative consequences at work is a white man, according to the study.“Basically everyone [surveyed for the study] got penalized for hiring somebody who looked like themselves -- except white guys,” said David Hekman, an associate professor of management at the University of Colorado-Boulder's Leeds School of Business who coauthored the paper.That’s because white males are unconsciously and consciously still considered model leaders and workers -- they get more leeway, he explained to The Huffington Post. And no one minds much if you hire white guys.That's partly the reason that a stunning 85 percent of top executives and board members on the S&P 500 are white men, Hekman and co-athor Stefanie Johnson, also a Leeds professor, point out in a piece they wrote for the Harvard Business Review.This is not a case of the most qualified candidates rising to the top, they said. It's a case of unconscious bias in favor of white men. ""You don’t assume that a white guy hires a white guy because they're a white guy,"" Johnson said. That's because they're de facto, unconsciously considered the best candidates. And now we know, based on this research, that you'll be judged in the best light as a leader if you hire white men.Hekman and Johnson surveyed 350 executives, asking whether they respected cultural, religious, gender and racial differences. Those executives were then evaluated by their peers and bosses, who judged women and minority executives as less competent when they hired candidates who looked like them.The researchers also conducted a lab study to gauge what people thought about minorities hiring other minorities. The results were the same: Minorities and women were judged unfavorably for hiring diverse candidates.You can also look to the real world for examples. Sam's Club CEO Rosalind Brewer was called a racist for explaining to CNN last year that she is committed to hiring diverse candidates for her team, the researchers point out.The study comes at a time where more and more companies and executives are committed to hiring for diversity. Hekman and Johnson emphasized that the results shouldn’t discourage these efforts. Indeed, the research highlights the urgency with which organizations need to figure out how to hire and promote all kinds of people.The key to doing this, Johnson said, is to figure out ways to remove unconscious biases from the hiring and promotion process. Organizations that do this will end up with more women and minorities. You want to make the pathways to hiring and promotion very clear and objective, removing the possibility that these decisions are made based on any reason besides competency. So you don’t promote people for being a “cultural fit,” an ambiguous term that often winds up meaning “guy who looks just like me and also likes beer and golfing.” Instead, you promote the person who increased profits or had the best code. “This way every player has an equal chance,” Johnson said."
24,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Takes A Stand Against 'Subminimum Wage' For People With Disabilities,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-subminimum-wage-people-with-disabilities_us_56faf630e4b083f5c605ef20,Some disabled workers are being paid pennies per hour under a 78-year-old loophole in federal wage law.,2016-03-29,Hillary Clinton backed ending the subminimum wage for workers with disabilities.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56faf7e81e000095007119c1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton expressed support for eliminating the “subminimum wage” for people with disabilities employed in specialized workplaces, a major coup for disability rights advocates who argue that the little-known loophole is discriminatory and harmful.The subject came up Monday in a question-and-answer session at a campaign event at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison. An attorney in the audience, who described herself as being on the autistic spectrum, asked Clinton about the lower minimum wage for workers with disabilities at employers like Goodwill Industries and how she would “create jobs for the disabled population.”“When it comes to jobs, we've got to figure out how we get the minimum wage up and include people with disabilities in the minimum wage,” Clinton responded. “There should not be a tiered wage.""That extends beyond people with disabilities, Clinton said, and includes the minimum wage exemption for tipped workers, typically in the food service industry. The federal minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 an hour. While employers are required to top it off if tips do not bring hourly pay to $7.25, that has proven difficult to enforce.""So I want us to take a hard look at raising the minimum wage and ending the tiered minimum wages, whether it's for people with disabilities or the tipped wage,"" Clinton said. ""You’ve got millions of people that are totally dependent on tips that may or may not make up a minimum wage, let alone beyond.""Clinton supports raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour. Her campaign didn't respond to a question asking whether she would extend that minimum to workers with disabilities and to those whose pay includes tips. While Clinton’s endorsement of ending the tipped minimum wage is notable, her support for lifting the exemption that applies to workers with disabilities made greater waves because it addresses a priority of disability rights advocates rarely discussed on the national stage.Ari Ne’eman, a co-founder of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, one of 81 disability rights groups opposed to the practice of paying workers who have disabilities a lower minimum wage, applauded Clinton’s remarks as “game-changing.”“To see a major presidential candidate take a stance on this is a very significant step,” Ne’eman said. “We call on other candidates in the race to match Secretary Clinton’s commitment.”Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind, thanked Clinton in a statement ""for stating boldly and unequivocally that she rejects the discriminatory practice of paying workers with disabilities subminimum wages.""Clinton would do away with the practice of paying a subminimum wage for workers with disabilities, which dates to the 1938 law that created the first federal minimum wage.The provision allows employers recognized by the federal government for hiring workers “whose earning or productive capacity is impaired” by a mental, physical or developmental disability to pay workers based on individual productivity, according to the Department of Labor, even if it is less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. There is no legally mandated wage floor for people with disabilities employed in such circumstances; it is at the eligible employer’s discretion.The law was intended to encourage employers to hire people with disabilities, since they might otherwise lack the incentive to do so. People with disabilities, the thinking went, might then develop skills that would allow them to move into jobs where the regular minimum wage applied.Today, however, the subminimum wage allowance is more likely to lead to exploitation and isolation for people with disabilities than to independence and dignity, advocates say.“It is a relic -- it reflects a 1930s set of assumptions about people with disabilities,” Ne’eman said.There were 228,600 workers with disabilities earning a subminimum wage in fiscal 2013, according to the Department of Labor.The vast majority of those workers with disabilities toil in what are known as “sheltered workshops”: mainly nonprofit institutions that have built their business model on meeting federal guidelines for the subminimum wage -- and that employ those workers exclusively. These employers typically become certified as job-training service providers for people with disabilities as well, enabling them to pick up added revenue through Medicaid reimbursements.But that revenue rarely gets passed onto the disabled workers in sheltered workshops.In fact, the workers sometimes earn wages that would embarrass even some sweatshop owners in the developing world. A June 2013 investigation by NBC News found that Goodwill Industries, one of the country’s largest sheltered workshops, paid workers in some states as little as 22 cents an hour as its executives reaped six-figure salaries.Rose Sloan, a government affairs specialist for the National Federation for the Blind, said she has seen certification forms from the Department of Labor showing that some employers pay these workers ""pennies"" per hour.According to a 2001 Government Accountability Office study, just 5 percent of workers employed in sheltered workshops went on to find jobs in the mainstream economy. Ne’eman attributed the poor results to the isolation of workplaces that wall off workers with disabilities, and to employers that invest minimal resources in training. Ne’eman maintained that people with disabilities would be as productive as anybody else if given the same job training, work environment, and access to effective support services. The Department of Justice is encouraging states to adopt this egalitarian, integrated workplace model by cracking down on sheltered workshops that do not meet training requirements. And it may be catching on. Maryland passed a bill earlier this month abolishing the subminimum wage for people with disabilities.“Performance can be equal, given the proper training and proper support services, and what we have seen is that states that have moved away from subminimum wage and sheltered workshops” have had success, Ne’eman said."

In contrast, only 22 percent of Republican seniors (age 65 or older) believe that recent immigrants strengthen American society, compared to 61 percent who say they are a threat…'While the campaigns of the leading Republican presidential candidates have been fueled by antipathy toward immigrants, these views are not reflective of the general public’s mindset and may not resonate among younger Republicans and white evangelical Protestants,' said Dr. Robert P.

Around the world, there are about 9 million new cases a year and around 2 million deaths, according to the World Health Organization.In Tanzania, people in communities where TB is most common, including prisons, often fail to show up for screening because of lack of money or awareness, creating a huge burden for health authorities trying to tackle the disease, health officials said.Because existing systems lack the accuracy, speed and cost-efficiency required to scale up screening of the highly contagious disease, many TB cases go undiagnosed, they said.APOPO, with funding from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID,) plans to recruit and train more rats to carry out prison screening that it expects to be faster and more reliable than existing methods.""We believe our unique TB Detection Rat technology will prove itself as an effective mass-screening tool,"" said APOPO's U.S. director, Charlie Richter.""We then aim to expand the programme to all prisons, shantytowns, factories and other settings in Tanzania, Mozambique and other high TB-burden countries, as well as in high-risk groups such as those individuals living with HIV/AIDS. This will improve and save lives all over the globe at a low cost,"" Richter said.Though data from African jails is hard to come by, studies from Tanzania, Malawi and Ivory Coast show that TB rates are 10 times higher in prisons than in the general population, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.TRAINING STARTS AT FOUR WEEKS OLDAPOPO says the rats undergo a rigorous training process that begins when they are four weeks old. As soon as the rats open their eyes, they are introduced to various stimuli and learn how to socialize and interact with people.The rats learn to recognise the presence of TB in samples of sputum, mucus that is coughed up from the patient's lower airways, and rewarded when they succeed.The testing process starts when a rat is presented with a row of 10 sputum samples, and when it detects TB the rat hovers over the sample for 3 seconds, Richter said.The rats' accuracy at detecting TB is almost 100 percent, but they cannot distinguish between normal and drug-resistant strains, APOPO scientists say.The APOPO system is fast, cheap and has the potential to greatly lower screening costs in poor countries, Richter said.While a laboratory technician may take four days to detect tuberculosis, a trained rat can screen 100 samples in 20 minutes, and a rat screening can cost as little as 20 US cents when APOPO operations are running near capacity, he said.APOPO's current programmes have screened more than 340,000 TB samples, halting over 36,000 further infections, and increased detection rates by over 40 percent in several partnered clinics, officials said.Khadija Abraham, an expert at Tanzania's National Leprosy and Tuberculosis Programme, said trained rats had a great ability to detect a wide range of strong-smelling molecules that could help tracking down undiagnosed TB cases, especially in rural areas.""Training an animal with a strong and reliable sense of smell to help detect disease in a vast country like Tanzania could potentially offer a valuable solution to help detecting the disease,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Training pouched rats requires little human skill since they only have to be exposed to the smell they need to recognize, Abraham said.""Experiments show that these rats can detect a sample with TB parasites in a second and evidence has shown that they are able to sniff out even those with very minimal parasites,""she said.TB cases are normally detected by sputum smear microscopy, a slow and costly process that has not changed for years and is not very accurate. The WHO insists that one lab technician should not test more than 20 patients a day, and says the chances of misdiagnosis are high if this exceeded.

Tension rose at the site when police attempted to evacuate railway tracks that migrants and refugees had occupied for the past 11 days as an act of protest against the closure of the border.Macedonia sealed its borders earlier this month, leaving around 12,000 migrants and refugees stranded on the Greek side. Overpopulation and squalid conditions in the camp, in addition to uncertainty about what lies ahead now that the European Union and Turkey have agreed on measures to curb the migrant influx, have resulted in mounting frustration among those in the camp.Despite calls from Greek authorities to relocate migrants and refugees to reception centers, many have remained in Idomeni, hoping that the border will reopen.But Macedonia’s parliament on Monday voted to keep the country’s borders with Greece closed until Dec. 31. Macedonian soldiers will patrol the border to prevent people from crossing. These measures follow the construction of a metal fence along the border nearly 13 miles long last November to deter the passage of migrants and refugees.When Greek police on Tuesday morning forced the migrants and refugees to leave the railway tracks, they responded by throwing stones at officers. According to the Greek media, police tried to detain a female protester, but were unable to after other protesters came to her aid.

Tension rose at the site when police attempted to evacuate railway tracks that migrants and refugees had occupied for the past 11 days as an act of protest against the closure of the border.Macedonia sealed its borders earlier this month, leaving around 12,000 migrants and refugees stranded on the Greek side. Overpopulation and squalid conditions in the camp, in addition to uncertainty about what lies ahead now that the European Union and Turkey have agreed on measures to curb the migrant influx, have resulted in mounting frustration among those in the camp.Despite calls from Greek authorities to relocate migrants and refugees to reception centers, many have remained in Idomeni, hoping that the border will reopen.But Macedonia’s parliament on Monday voted to keep the country’s borders with Greece closed until Dec. 31. Macedonian soldiers will patrol the border to prevent people from crossing. These measures follow the construction of a metal fence along the border nearly 13 miles long last November to deter the passage of migrants and refugees.When Greek police on Tuesday morning forced the migrants and refugees to leave the railway tracks, they responded by throwing stones at officers. According to the Greek media, police tried to detain a female protester, but were unable to after other protesters came to her aid. Refugees reoccupied the railway track soon after.The Greek government said on Monday that it was making efforts to convince those at the border that rumors about the reopening of the Greek-Macedonian border are false and that refugees and migrants should move to the appropriate accommodation facilities built across Greece.

The film aims to deter potential migrants by showing them difficulties they may experience during the journey. The movie, called ""Journey,"" was filmed in Afghanistan, Malaysia and Indonesia. It follows a group of Afghan asylum-seekers as they encounter smugglers, dangerous waters and inhumane detention conditions while trying to reach Australia. The film was shown in Afghanistan for the first time on Friday. It had previously been screened in Pakistan, Iraq, and Iran, and will be shown in a number of languages, including Arabic, Farsi, Pashto and Urdu. Afghans make up the largest percentage of asylum-seekers arriving in Australia by boat. According to data published by Australia’s Parliament, many Afghans’ asylum application is approved. More than 7,200 Afghans resettled in Australia from 2008 to 2013. Australia in recent years has tightened asylum policies to discourage migrants. The government also has distributed ads carrying harsh warnings. The Australian Department of Immigration has argued that “telemovies are a proven way to reach and influence the target audience.” But the idea has received fierce criticism. The president of The Refugee Council of Australia, Phil Glendenning, said last year, after the film was announced: “I don't think the government understands why people are on the move if they think a TV drama will be a deterrent.”The project has also been criticized for its cost. The Age reports that the department paid more than $4 million to have the movie produced, and an additional $1.6 million to have it promoted and advertised. Put It Out Pictures, the production company behind ""Journey,"" said on its website that the film “aimed to educate and inform audiences in source countries about the futility of investing in people smugglers, the perils of the trip, and the hard line policies that await them if they do reach Australian waters.”"

But moments in, it’s clear that these dark stories out of Syria won’t have a happy ending.Five years into Syria’s civil war, the world is well-versed in the figures. The conflict has produced more than 4.8 million refugees and over 2 million of them are children, according to UNICEF. These kids are braving life-threatening waters to escape and residing in refugee camps where they often struggle to communicate and get access to basic needs. In an effort to unpack the headlines around the crisis, UNICEF, together with ad agency 180LA, recently released three animated shorts titled, ""Unfairy Tales,"" that put the stories of refugee children against a cartoon backdrop.Syrian refugee children narrate each of their stories and remind viewers of the worlds they once knew. Before the war, they were like other children -- consumed with toys and fairytales. Now, they’re living with the reality of bombs, treacherous journeys and divided families.In “Mustafa Goes for a Walk,” for example, a 13-year-old boy shares how he once enjoyed a normal family life before his brothers were taken away. He ultimately leaves his toys and relatives behind for a refugee camp where he can’t speak the language.“Who would I make friends with?” questions the real Mustafa, whose face is revealed at the end of the film. “There is no one.”The goal is twofold -- to help the world understand who these kids are and how much of their childhood has been taken away.""Everybody seems to know what's happening in Syria. But, do they know what's happening to Malak, Ivine Mustafa and the other 8 million children affected by the war?” Eduardo Marques, executive creative director at 180LA, said in a statement. “We needed to tell these stories and make everyone rethink it.""Learn more about the “Unfairy Tales” here and how you can help Syrian refugees in need here.

44,BUSINESS,The World's Largest Renewable Energy Developer Could Go Broke,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sunedison-bankruptcy-threat_us_56fab6e9e4b014d3fe2439dd,"Blame the ""hyper-growth"" strategy.",2016-03-29,Solar panels that SunEdison installed in Chile's Atacama Desert.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fab8b61e0000870070592f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There is a “substantial risk” that SunEdison may file for bankruptcy, the world’s largest renewable energy developer said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. The company’s fall isn’t a referendum on the solar industry as a whole, as much as it is on SunEdison’s aggressive growth strategy fueled by excessive debt and financial engineering, analysts say.SunEdison “just thought they were smarter than everyone else,” said David Levine, the founder and CEO of Geostellar, a solar energy marketplace that has done deals with the company.The company's shares have fallen steeply since they hit a high of $30 in July. They were at just $1.26 before the filing. The stock immediately dropped another 40 percent when the market opened after the filing, and the company was trading at just $0.59 by Tuesday lunchtime.“What happened from late-2014 to the middle of 2015, the company began embarking on a hyper-growth strategy,” S&P analyst Angelo Zino told The Huffington Post. SunEdison loaded up a total of $11 billion in debt to develop or acquire renewable energy projects. Once projects were complete, they sold them to one of two separate, public companies, called yieldcos, which SunEdison controlled. The company also created two internal financing entities, called warehouses, that raised a total of $2.5 billion to build renewable energy projects, which would be sold to the yieldcos once they were complete. The theory was that the risk of building and managing renewable energy projects could be split into its various components and investors could buy exactly the slice they wanted. To work, SunEdison needed to keep raising more money to build new projects, and its yieldcos needed to keep raising money to keep buying those projects so that the company could pay down its debt in order to borrow more to build new projects. “That is way too complicated, way too smart I would say... There’s only so much you should do because you are super smart,” said an industry observer, who is familiar with SunEdison’s business. “It’s a great company with great assets. It’s the finance department that’s the problem...They over-engineered it to death.”Levine told HuffPost that a deal to buy the residential solar company Vivint for $2.2 billion in July of 2015 started the cratering. He pointed out that there’s nothing inherently wrong with yieldcos. Other solar companies and other utilities have them, but what set SunEdison apart was what it tried to stuff into the yieldcos. Rather than sticking to utility scale projects, SunEdison included residential solar that was tied long-term contracts. Investors didn’t trust these contracts, called purchase power agreements, because they locked in rates at current prices, which wouldn’t make financial sense if solar costs keep falling, as they are predicted to. “[Investors] considered purchase power agreements for consumers to be the equivalent of subprime loans,” Levine said. “I think it was a totally stupid deal to do Vivint and it made everyone question SunEdison.” As a result of the Vivint deal, investors soured on the company's yieldcos and their stock prices, along with SunEdison's, started dropping. That meant that the yieldcos couldn’t raise more money to buy more assets from SunEdison. Worse, SunEdison had to delay its financial report because of accounting questions, so the company, already deeply in debt, couldn’t borrow more money. The carefully laid financial structure lacked what was necessary for it to work: new cash flowing in.When financing dried up, SunEdison’s only option was to sell its assets to other companies, like utilities. But Zino said there had been limited asset sales since the company last reported in November. “We’re at a point now where if they haven’t been able to generate cash via those assets sales, and you can’t tap the equity markets and you can’t tap the debt markets, there’s really no other means to generate cash,” the S&P analyst said. Zino thinks that could be because SunEdison's projects aren’t as good as the company says or because buyers know they are in trouble and is negotiating to get lower prices. Now the company, by their own admission, may file for bankruptcy protection. Zino, noting that strong growth in renewable energy last year, sees a bright spot for other big solar companies: They now have a chance to buy up projects from a competitor at a discount.SunEdison did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
