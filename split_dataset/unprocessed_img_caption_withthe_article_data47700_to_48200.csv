It's one thing to experience those iconic black-out nights in college, but it's another to dance the night away under the glow of a full moon on a secluded island on the islands of Cambodia. Oh, the world is full of such exotic splendors and immersing yourself in culture will (in cliche travel-writing form) change your perspective blah blah and change your life blah blah and you'll be addicted blah. It would be wrong to leave out though, that part of immersing yourself in a different culture is experiencing how the locals let loose and live it up. Whether it's a New Year's celebration that is actually a giant water gun fight or a gathering to watch a wooden giant go up in wild flames in the Nevada desert; letting your inner beast out to play while traveling can be good for the soul and you'll leave with outrageous stories to tell the kids one day...or maybe it's a good idea to bury some of those stories deep, deep down within your loins where no one can uncover them. Move over Full Moon Party and Coachella. From fashion to vegetable flinging and music festivals to national holidays, take a sneak peek at how the world parties hard and perhaps you animals may find yourself at one for your next international escapade. Songkran FestivalTwo words: water gun. That is, you'll need one for this water fight held throughout all of Thailand from April 13-15. On a serious note, this is the Thai New Year celebration, where water is poured on the hands of elders as a symbol of respect and cleansing. It has over time though, become a wet n' wild party, with locals and tourists lining streets with buckets of ice water and super soakers. No one is immune to the cleansing, so leave your electronics and whiny ""Don't you dare wet me, I just caked on makeup"" attitude at the hotel. Where can you soak up the fun? Bangkok, Phuket and Chiang Mai boast some of the biggest parties.Mercedes-Benz Fashion WeekFor all of the fashionistas out there, dip your fingers into some of the poshest parties, runway shows and events during a fabulous week that celebrates style and culture worldwide. Don your trendiest threads and scamper on over to Berlin, Istanbul or Sydney to be engulfed by the boldest looks and freshest clothing lines to hit the industry. Even if fashion isn't your thing, it's a thrilling way to get a taste of the creative ingenuity that goes into the festivities and bump elbows with the beautiful people, with parties organized by the top dogs in the promotional business.King's Day (Formerly Queen's Day)Amsterdam is the city to be on April 27, when the Dutch honor King Willem-Alexander with a national celebration. The party is held nation-wide, but Amsterdam is the popular spot, where a street party of epic proportions takes place. There's plenty of live music all over the city and various art events to explore. The infamous canals are jam packed with boats and those boats are jam packed with peeps. Don't forget to wear orange- the national color of the Netherlands.La TomatinaIf you've ever dreamed of splattering people in the face with fruits without getting punched in the face in return or getting grounded by the parents, then this is the party for you. Travel to Bu√±ol in eastern Spain, where 175 tonnes of ripe n' ready tomatoes are supplied for the world's largest food fight. For this festival, a gun fires and the tomato tossing begins. The sun shines, streets run red with vitamin C and the celebrations are non stop until the pistol fires once more to signal a close to the friendly gathering of tomato flinging. Burning Man Festival Burning Man, where strange and beautiful souls- the best kind of souls- gather in the heart of Nevada's Black Rock Desert to create a special community of around 30,000 people. Taking place in August or September, attendees must contribute something to the festival in accordance with the year's theme. Don't you dare try to use cash or card resources- the name of the game is to barter. Let your inhibitions explode out in the barren dust and sand and take in the magnificent artistic creations that seem to come to life when the moon and stars rule the heavens. The grand finale of the fest is a massive wooden figure that towers over the landscape, set ablaze for all to watch and reflect. Boryeong Mud FestivalIf it's not a water or tomato fight you're after, maybe you're one of those that just need to get down and dirty, like plastered from head to toe in mud dirty. In the small town of Boryeong in South Korea, there's a festival lasting around two weeks long to quench that mucky thirst. What began in 1999 as a way to promote the cosmetic benefits of the beach town's mineral packed glop, soon turned into one of the most popular annual parties, drawing international visitors in hordes. It's simple: show up, mud, get drunk, mud and mud it up some more until you and everyone around you is covered in, you guessed it, mud."

2,FIFTY,5 Reasons Why North American Retirees Are Flocking To Mexico,"Suzan Haskins and Dan Prescher, ContributorInternationalLiving.com Editors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/retire-in-mexico_b_11594580.html,"Current estimates put the number of U.S. and Canadian citizens living in various places in Mexico at well over one million.

Not all are retired, but hundreds of thousands of them are.  Beach in Cancun, Mexico This easily makes Mexico the world's most popular overseas retirement destination for U.S. and Canadian citizens.Remember, this is the country that one U.S. presidential candidate thinks is so bad that it should be walled off from the rest of North America.What makes so many North Americans disagree? What makes Mexico the world's biggest draw for U.S. and Canadian citizens looking outside their own countries for a quality retirement?We can think of five reasons off the top of our heads.The Weather -- The only place you'll find snow in Mexico is on the tops of mountains. Otherwise, the weather in the entire country is temperate to hot. Mexico's Pacific, Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf Coast beaches are justifiably famous for their warmth and beauty, and in Mexico's interior highlands, you'll find dozens of communities where North America retirees enjoy warm days and cool nights all year around. No snow to shovel, ever.  Outdoor Cafe in Merida, Mexico  Proximity to U.S. and Canada -- Mexico is the nearest neighbor to the U.S. and one country away from Canada. This makes getting back home for any reason quick, simple, and affordable. There are hundreds of direct flights from major airports in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Puerto Vallarta, Merida, Cancun, and other Mexican hubs to major U.S. cities every day. (And more are coming. The U.S. and Mexico just signed a treaty to allow even more direct flights between even more cities in the two countries.) And much of Mexico is close enough that many U.S. and Canadian retirees drive to their Mexican winter quarters or second homes.Great Medical Care -- In Mexico's major metropolitan areas, medical facilities are world class, and medical care costs significantly less than in the U.S. And entrepreneurs in Mexico are fully aware of the draw that good medical care has for U.S. and Canadian retirees... New facilities are being built and older facilities upgraded throughout Mexico to cater to foreign retirees. Lower Cost of Living -- It can cost much less to live in Mexico than it does in the U.S. or Canada. Weather has a lot to do with this... If you live somewhere with mild, year-around weather, utility costs naturally go down. But other costs are lower as well, including health insurance and medical care, rents, and the cost of real estate. (Annual property taxes in Mexico are rarely more than $200.) There are certainly some areas of Mexico very popular with U.S. and Canadian tourists and retirees where prices are on par with those up north, but it doesn't take much looking once on the ground to find extremely reasonable rents and real estate prices outside the tourist and ""gringo"" zones. (By the way, the Mexican peso has been trading at close to 18 pesos to the U.S. dollar for some time now, making this the most affordable time in recent memory to be spending dollars in Mexico.)  Colorful Sidestreet in Tequisquiapan, Mexico Wonderful Cultures -- Mexico has its own brand identity, and even people who have never been anywhere in the country think they know what Mexico is like. But it's a big country, and the difference between the culture in Merida and the culture in Puerto Vallarta is as vast as the difference between Virginia Beach and Portland or Montreal and Vancouver. The music, the food, the clothing, the attitudes ... there is so much cultural variety that thinking of Mexico as nothing but mariachis and tacos is like thinking of the U.S. as nothing but hip hop and burgers or of Canada as nothing but Celine Dion and poutine. Mexicans are proud of their national heritage, but they are just as likely as other North Americans to think of themselves in terms of their city, region, or state as anything else.So it's no surprise to us that North American retirees have made Mexico their #1 destination. We've lived in three different communities in Mexico and have visited nearly every Mexican state, so the charms of Mexico are obvious to us.And let us hasten to add that we have rarely felt unsafe or in danger anywhere we've lived or traveled in Mexico.A number of factors have combined to cause terrible violence in some parts of the country, mostly due to conflicts over control of various aspects of the illegal drug trade. Having the largest and most profitable market on the planet for illegal drugs just across its northern border has not helped Mexico overcome its problems with drug-related crime.But we are not involved in the production, sale, and distribution of drugs, and neither are the vast majority of expats living and working in Mexico. Statistically, many areas of Mexico are safer than areas of comparable populations in the U.S. and Canada. Those are the areas we've lived in, and those are the areas most U.S. and Canadian retirees live in. Safely.So we guess there are actually six reasons that Mexico is the top destination for U.S. and Canadian citizens looking for a more affordable, high-quality retirement than they can get back home. And remember, Mexico is part of North America ... No wall will stop us from doing business with, retiring to, or enjoying the cultural richness and opportunities of our southern partner.

Americans‚Äô preferences on immigration policy are divided. And there‚Äôs no consensus on how gender is affecting Hillary Clinton‚Äôs chances. This is HuffPollster for Friday, August 26, 2016.CLINTON‚ÄôS CAMPAIGN ADVANTAGES ARE APPARENT TO VOTERS - Jon Reid: ‚ÄúHillary Clinton has run a better presidential campaign than GOP rival Donald Trump, according to a majority of voters in a new Morning Consult poll. The national survey, conducted after the Trump campaign‚Äôs third major leadership change this year, shows that 51 percent of voters say Clinton‚Äôs campaign is performing better overall‚Ä¶.Broken down by political party, a majority of Republicans (54 percent) and Democrats (79 percent) say their party‚Äôs respective nominee has run a better campaign. But the difference between the two parties is significant. A small majority of Republican voters say the Trump campaign is doing well, while most Democrats are happy with their nominee‚Äôs campaign. Only 8 percent of Democrats say Trump‚Äôs campaign is doing better than Clinton‚Äôs.‚Äù [Morning Consult]Trump could be leaving votes on the table by not campaigning well - John Sides: ‚ÄúTrump is being vastly outspent in advertising and is limited essentially to whatever field organization the Republican National Committee can provide ‚Äî which will be exceeded by Hillary Clinton‚Äôs, much as Romney‚Äôs was exceeded by Obama‚Äôs. How much will this cost him on Election Day? Probably the best estimate comes from a recently published piece by political scientists Ryan Enos and Anthony Fowler. They show that the effect of the 2012 presidential campaign on voter turnout was quite large, about 7-8 points overall.‚Äù [WashPost]MANY AMERICANS SUPPORT BORDER CONTROL AND A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP - Pew Research: ‚ÄúThe public is divided over many aspects of U.S. immigration policy. However, when asked about the priorities for policy toward illegal immigration, more Americans say better border security and a path to citizenship should be given equal priority than favor either approach individually. The new national survey, conducted August 9-16 among 2,010 adults, also finds that a large majority (76%) says that undocumented immigrants are as hard-working and honest as U.S. citizens, while 67% say they are no more likely than citizens to commit serious crimes‚Ä¶. Overall, 29% of the public prioritizes ‚Äòcreating a way for immigrants already here illegally to become citizens if they meet certain requirements,‚Äô while (24%) say the focus should be on ‚Äòbetter border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws.‚Äô However, when given the option, a 45% plurality does say that both should be given equal priority.‚Äù [Pew]Trump supporters generally favor tougher enforcement - Carroll Doherty: ‚ÄúNearly half (48%) of Trump supporters say the priority for policy to deal with illegal immigration should be stronger law enforcement and better border security. Just 10% say the priority should be creating a way for undocumented immigrants to become citizens if they meet certain requirements. But about four-in-ten (41%) say both of these approaches should be given equal priority. When Trump voters who give equal priority to both are asked to choose just one, a majority overall comes down on the side of stronger law enforcement and better border security: 78% say this should be the priority, compared with just 19% who prioritize a path to citizenship for those in the U.S. illegally. Among Clinton supporters, opinions are nearly reversed: 80% say a path to citizenship should be the priority, while 19% prioritize tougher law enforcement and better border security.‚Äù [Pew]AMERICANS ARE SPLIT ON HOW GENDER AFFECTS CLINTON‚ÄôS CHANCES - Catherine Lucey and Emily Swanson: ‚ÄúAccording to a new poll from the Associated-Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, most Americans see [Hillary] Clinton‚Äôs gender playing a role in the campaign, with 37 percent saying her gender will help her chances of being elected president, 29 percent arguing it will hurt her, and 33 percent thinking it won‚Äôt make a difference‚Ä¶.Overall, 75 percent of Americans say they think men and women make equally good political leaders, while 17 percent think men make better leaders and 7 percent say women do. Still, about a quarter of Americans, including nearly half of Republicans and more than half of Americans who have a favorable view of Donald Trump, think a female president would not be tough enough to handle a military crisis or a terrorist attack. Men and women are about equally likely to say a woman is tough enough to handle those scenarios facing a president‚Ä¶.Despite gains made by women in elected office, just over half of Americans say gender discrimination remains a problem for women in politics, while about 3 in 10 feel the opportunities are about the same. About 2 in 10 think women have more opportunities.‚Äù [AP] POLLING MODE AFFECTS CLINTON‚ÄôS NUMBERS, NOT TRUMP‚ÄôS - HuffPollster: ‚ÄúIn telephone polls conducted by live interviewers, Clinton averages an 11-point lead over Trump in the HuffPost Pollster average. She‚Äôs approaching 50 percent, whereas Trump is struggling below 40 percent. These polls are averaging only 5.5 percent undecided and 4.4 percent for other candidates. Polls conducted either online or using automated voice technology over the telephone, without a real person on the other end of the line, tell a different story. In these polls, Clinton averages just under 44 percent support, a 5-point drop from the live telephone polls, while Trump loses less than 1 percentage point, still sitting at about 38 percent. That 5 percent who supported Clinton in live telephone polls, but not in these other polls, seems to have gone to the ‚Äòundecided‚Äô column. In online and automated phone polls, undecideds increase by 5 percent, growing to over 10 percent of voters‚Ä¶.Since it‚Äôs Clinton‚Äôs support that increases when undecideds are pushed in live telephone surveys, the polls indicate that undecided voters tend to lean more in Clinton‚Äôs direction.‚Äù [HuffPost]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Speaking with TMZ on Thursday, Isaacs, who‚Äôs made it her mission to diversify the awards ceremony after years of #OscarsSoWhite, urged everyone to not let the director‚Äôs past cloud the significance of Parker‚Äôs film in the current climate of the entertainment industry. ‚ÄúI know just by the conversation that has gone on at Sundance that it‚Äôs clearly a movie that filmgoers should go and see,‚Äù Isaacs told the gossip site, before admitting she hasn‚Äôt even seen the movie. Parker and his college roommate Jean Celestin, the film‚Äôs co-writer, were accused in 1999 of rape by a female classmate. Parker was cleared of the charges, claiming that he and the victim had previously engaged in consensual sex, but Celestin was sentenced to six months in prison. Celestin was later granted a mistrial when the victim refused to testify again. She committed suicide in 2012.When pressed about the rape allegations, Isaacs drew a strong distinction between the art and the artist, which some find difficult to separate considering Parker and Celestin‚Äôs collaboration and how the film addresses issues of rape and sexual abuse. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one issue, that‚Äôs his personal issue,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúAnd then there‚Äôs the issue of the movie. The important thing is for people to see it and enjoy the film, be impressed by the film. And I think that is what is very important. People need to see this movie.‚ÄùDespite Isaacs‚Äô recommendation, many are far less cavalier about supporting the film, after details of the rape, including new transcripts of disturbing phone calls between Parker and the victim, received increased media attention. Cultural critic and author Roxane Gay penned a particularly powerful response in an editorial for the New York Times earlier this month about the limits of empathy and why she refuses to support the film. ‚Äú‚ÄôThe Birth of a Nation‚Äô is being billed as an important movie ‚Äî something we must see, a story that demands to be heard. I have not yet seen the movie, and now I won‚Äôt,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúJust as I cannot compartmentalize the various markers of my identity, I cannot value a movie, no matter how good or ‚Äòimportant‚Äô it might be, over the dignity of a woman whose story should be seen as just as important, a woman who is no longer alive to speak for herself, or benefit from any measure of justice. No amount of empathy could make that possible.‚Äù"

But the justices were evenly split in the case, leaving the original injunction in place. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm filing this lawsuit for myself and the thousands of others like me who have been wronged by this judge‚Äôs decision,‚Äù said Batalla Vidal in a statement accompanying the lawsuit‚Äôs announcement.A spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which was named as a defendant in the case, declined to comment on the case because it‚Äôs deemed pending litigation.Batalla Vidal‚Äôs legal effort aims to narrow the scope of the original order that left millions of undocumented immigrants like him in the lurch. When U.S. District Judge Andrew ruled in the Texas case, the federal government had no choice but to stop Obama‚Äôs immigration proposal dead in its tracks ‚Äï even in the 24 states that did not join Texas‚Äô lawsuit over the policies, including New York, which favors deferred action.The National Immigration Law Center, Make the Road New York and the immigrant rights‚Äô clinic at Yale Law School are supporting Batalla Vidal in the litigation.It is unclear to what extent, if at all, this lawsuit might be affected by a separate move the Obama administration made last month asking the Supreme Court to revisit the deadlocked immigration case.Stephen Legomsky, a law professor at Washington University specializing in immigration law, said in an email that the student‚Äôs chances are ‚Äúhard to predict,‚Äù but that otherwise ‚Äúthe case law is clear‚Äù that court orders like the one Hanen issued shouldn‚Äôt be so broad that they go beyond what the plaintiff ‚Äï in this case Texas ‚Äï is suing about.‚ÄúA court decision that finds the nationwide injunction improper could support future challenges to the other terms of the same injunction ‚Äï especially the part that enjoins all of [Obama‚Äôs executive actions],‚Äù said Legomsky, also former chief counsel at USCIS. ‚ÄúSo there is a great deal at stake.‚Äù"

12,POLITICS,Most GOP Voters Didn't Really Want Trump's Mass Deportation Plan Anyway,Elise Foley and Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-republican-voters-deportation_us_57c05f51e4b04193420ed954,"Even among Republicans, there's significant support for a pathway to citizenship.",2016-08-26,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump said last year that he would create a ""deportation force"" for undocumented immigrants. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c067381800002100bcd57f.jpeg?cache=Cq7sPOFaAu&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump wouldn‚Äôt really be abandoning Republican voters by shifting away from mass deportation ‚Äï he would be joining them. The candidate began backing away this week from his past calls to round up and deport all of the undocumented population, instead indicating openness to some of them remaining in the U.S. It‚Äôs unclear whether that was an acknowledgement of reality ‚Äï deporting 11 million people was never a realistic goal ‚Äï or a step toward embracing legal status for undocumented immigrants, although he again ruled that out on Thursday.But the fact that he was willing to backpedal at all shows his campaign might be aware of another reality: that most voters aren‚Äôt as hardline on deportations as he was. Trump‚Äôs proposal to deport millions of people faced widespread opposition from Americans, 50 percent of whom said in June that the idea, along with his rhetoric against Mexican immigrants, bothered them ‚Äúa lot.‚Äù Just one-third weren‚Äôt at all concerned.Trump‚Äôs backers are more prone than the rest of the nation to anti-immigration sentiment, but even they have never been an entirely solid bloc. According to a March poll, about three-quarters of all voters, including 47 percent of Trump‚Äôs primary supporters believed that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country legally. While the 42 percent of Trump‚Äôs supporters who supported a national law enforcement effort to deport all undocumented immigrants was far higher than the 19 percent of all voters who favored that proposal, it still represented less than half of the businessman‚Äôs core supporters.Currently, a 51 percent majority of Trump‚Äôs general election backers consider creating a pathway to citizenship at least as much as a priority as amping up border security and law enforcement, although if pressed to pick one approach, they overwhelmingly lean toward protecting the borders.It‚Äôs too soon to tell how Trump‚Äôs latest statements on immigration will affect his standing in the race. But the public‚Äôs views of the issues are, by some measures, as malleable and as contradictory as Trump‚Äôs have proved to be.  A summer Gallup survey found three-quarters of Republicans support allowing undocumented immigrants the chance to become U.S. citizens ‚Äúif they meet certain requirements over a period of time‚Äù ‚Äï although the same survey also found 50 percent in support of deporting all such immigrants back to their home country.Trump has made contradicting statements on the matter, both publicly and privately. Latino supporters who met with him over the weekend told reporters that he indicated openness to legal status for undocumented immigrants, or even a solution that would involve them visiting the embassy or consulate of their country first rather than traveling back to their country. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) encouraged the GOP nominee to move away from that policy, according to Trump backer and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. It‚Äôs not clear that he is actually open to legal status for undocumented immigrants in the style immigration reform supporters want ‚Äï he and his campaign have said his positions haven‚Äôt changed.Instead, he and campaign aides say he would focus his efforts on building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, deporting criminals and enforcing laws to block undocumented people from employment ‚Äï more standard fare on immigration than the initial promise to deport all undocumented immigrants.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no legalization. There‚Äôs no amnesty,‚Äù Trump told CNN‚Äôs Anderson Cooper on Thursday. ‚ÄúAnd if somebody wants to go the legalization route, what they‚Äôll do is they‚Äôll go, leave the country, hopefully come back in. And then we can talk.‚ÄùBut he tested the waters with his supporters earlier this week. He tried out a few hypotheticals with a crowd on Wednesday and found support for all of them, including one that painted a sympathetic picture of an undocumented immigrant. ‚ÄúYou have somebody that has been in the country for 20 years. He has done a great job, has a job, everything else, OK?‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúDo we take him and the family ‚Äî her or him or whatever ‚Äî and send them out?‚Äù Some people in the crowd shouted, ‚ÄúNo!‚ÄùEditor‚Äôs note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ‚Äî 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ‚Äî from entering the U.S."

Javier escaped the assaults of his family only to endure the reality of the streets. In this week‚Äôs Huffington Post Queer Voices RaiseAChild ‚ÄúLet Love Define Family¬Æ‚Äù series installment, RaiseAChild contributing writer Eric Criswell reports how these teens were robbed of the chance for a stable home life, until they found their way to the Los Angeles Youth Network (LAYN). For many of us, home is a safe place, a refuge from the trials of life. But for many youth, home can be a place of emotional torment, physical pain or outright neglect. Many kids are kicked out of their homes or leave to avoid the continued abuse, only to find they must figure out a way to survive the heartless world of being homeless.‚ÄúIn Los Angeles County there are an estimated 10,000 homeless youth under the age of 18. A third of those will attempt suicide, and over 4,000 identify as gay, lesbian, or transgendered,‚Äù stated Raynetta Smith, Development and Communications Manager at Los Angeles Youth Network. ‚ÄúThere is an inherent need for organizations like LAYN.‚ÄùMaking a turn off of Hollywood Boulevard onto a residential street immediately took me back to the place where I grew up. Trees line the sidewalk. Houses from the 1920s sit on wide lots of green grass. The sound of lawn mowers hum in the background. It could be almost any street in any town in America, but it is in the heart of Hollywood surrounded by an iconic sign and tourists from every imaginable place. Three of these houses are run by LAYN, an organization that provides extensive programs and services for homeless youth.Having spent my past 15 years working with various organizations in multiple cities assisting youth living on the streets, I found LAYN to be one of the most impressive due to their wide range of support. LAYN does whatever it takes for the benefit of the kids they are helping, even risking the loss of large government grants in order to extend support to individuals that still need it.‚ÄúThese kids are in the system for a reason,‚Äù Mark Supper, who is LAYN‚Äôs president and CEO, explained. ‚ÄúMost of them come to us having some sort of abuse, whether physical, mental, sexual or neglect and abandonment. It‚Äôs our job to get them to trust again and find hope.‚ÄùIf there is one common thread through the staff, counselors, social workers and the kids at LAYN, it is hope. It is spoken as if it is the ultimate outcome, not shelter, not food, but hope as the power to save the world.‚ÄúI struggle with what is happening out there,‚Äù Neena Owusu-Ansah, MSW Case Manager said. ‚ÄúThere are so many families that are broken. I think the most difficult thing is to see a young person without their basic needs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just unacceptable. We believe in showing them that they have everything that they need here, and that it can get better.‚ÄùAccording to Neena, who has been with the organization for four years, ‚ÄúThe numbers keep going up. Last year was the most youth we have had and more of them are trans youth. The education and awareness about being transgender has gone up, but acceptance hasn‚Äôt.‚ÄùThere are two particular youth that have had an impact on Neena. She conveys the story of a child in a rural town in New Hampshire who tried to be a cheerleader, but just couldn‚Äôt fit in. He was struggling with the knowledge deep inside that he was really a boy. The rejection started in the home with the immediate family and spread into the community with neighbors in the small town voicing their disapproval. Soon the ridicule followed him to school where the other kids were relentless in their teasing and shaming, with no help to be found by teachers or any adults who were busy making up their own lies and stories to spread around town. The only person that defended this boy was his father, who saw the pain in his child‚Äôs eyes. These two were no match for the hatred that welled up within this community, so father and son headed off on their own and landed in southern California.With no job and no money, the son and his father became homeless on the streets of Los Angeles. Scared for his life and knowing that survival on the streets was only going to get worse, the youth reached out to LAYN for help. After counseling, permanency planning and support from doctors, the boy asked to change his name. He would now be known as Jordan.When I met Jordan, he was polite and had the personality and temperament of a young man in his mid-twenties, which made it a little shocking when I found out he was only seventeen. In jeans and a red polo, he was a typical teen trying to figure it all out. Having recently received his high school diploma, he was planning for his future to become an airline pilot.Jordan talked about all the things he had learned at LAYN, from doing laundry to learning how to cook. Baking desserts for the whole house became one of his favorite things to do. Beyond basic life skills, he left here much more self-confident than when he arrived and credits finding LAYN with literally saving his life. ‚ÄúThe stress of living on the streets was too much, and if I hadn‚Äôt found my way here, I know I would‚Äôve turned to drugs, or any way to survive, or even suicide.‚ÄùJavier is tall and slender, with the hair of a skater that he keeps under his knit cap. He told me the story of when he was young without anyone to take care of him. His parents were often absent, and when they were around, they would spend their time running him down with negative comments.The older he got, the more he began to realize that he was gay.‚ÄúAt first it wasn‚Äôt a problem,‚Äù Javier explained. ‚ÄúMy family said they accepted me and my dad even told me that I had a gay uncle, although I never met him. But the acceptance didn‚Äôt last long, and there was a lot of verbal and physical abuse because of who I am. I really didn‚Äôt know how to deal with it.‚ÄùAt the age of sixteen, Javier dealt with it by running away. He lived with friends on their couch for a month, until the landlord found out and he was forced to leave. From there he went to another friend‚Äôs place for a few weeks, then he ran out of places to go. Isolated from his family, homeless and with no resources, this quiet and sensitive kid began to feel as though he was slipping into a really dark place. With no hope, he attempted to end his life.When he confided in someone about his failed attempt, they gave him the phone number to LAYN. Javier made the call, got the address and walked up to the front door admitting he needed help.‚ÄúFrom the moment I walked in,‚Äù said Javier, ‚Äúit felt very positive. It felt like a home. They talked to me with respect and treated me with dignity. I was so scared at first, and was dealing with anger issues. I kept to myself as much as I could. It took a while to realize that they were talking to me because they wanted to, not because they had to. I had become so accustomed to the negative atmosphere of my family, that it was an adjustment being treated like a real person. But, even in the very beginning, I knew it was helping.‚ÄùAt the time of Javier‚Äôs arrival, LAYN was limited to 21 days per child due to governmental regulations tied to funding. When those days were up, it was still clear that Javier needed more assistance and resources. So the administration made the bold decision to sever their funding source in order to provide 90 days of care for Javier, and others like him, who needed it.‚ÄúWe made the critical decision to let go of government funding to continue helping Javier and the many youth who have come in after him,‚Äù said Supper. ‚ÄúThe youth come to us in need of housing and food, but beyond that they need support. They need to find the hope to continue. Like others, Javier was a unique case that needed help beyond the twenty-one days, and we assured him that through the help of our supporters, LAYN would be there for him beyond the governments allotted time.‚ÄùAccording to Alicia Riasati, MSW Case Worker at LAYN, although they are not specifically a LGBT organization, they do pride themselves of being an accepting and safe space.‚ÄúPart of our intake process is that we respect everyone no matter their race, [sexual] orientation, or gender identity,‚Äù states Riasati. ‚ÄúFor transgender clients, we will place them [where] they feel most comfortable and we are very sensitive to pronouns. We ask each child what they want and everyone will refer to them that way.‚ÄùIt is about the individual person and what they need most. LAYN has a wide array of programs and services to facilitate the ultimate goal of independent successful living for their clients. These programs range from shelter, individual/family counseling, art therapy, drug/alcohol abuse education, life skills tutoring, job development assistance, internships, community outreach, to working with the Los Angeles Unified School District in forming the first high school serving youth experiencing homelessness.As I walked through the houses of LAYN, it easily felt more like a home than a shelter. The feeling that they cultivated at the organization was one of the biggest benefits for Javier. He acknowledges that even with all the support at LAYN there was still a feeling of isolation.‚ÄúEven though my family was pretty horrible, and they still are, it still hurts,‚Äù Javier admits. ‚ÄúThey are your family, the ones you grow up with and are supposed to love and protect you. Birthdays and Christmas were painful, and there would be times when I was on the train coming to Hollywood from South Central and it was hard because it was so far away from everyone I knew.‚ÄùJordan pointed out, ‚ÄúWhen I got here, I wasn‚Äôt comfortable talking to people at all. But here, they respected me and my gender right away and put me with a male roommate. I began to feel like a regular person for the first time.‚ÄùThe primary order of business was to get Jordan enrolled in classes to continue his education. Neena intervened personally with the teachers to let them know Jordan‚Äôs situation and progress and help regulate expectations for everyone. There was therapy work on his gender identity and how he viewed the world, then spent time learning basic life skills. Through determination and hard work, Jordan graduated and was ready to tackle his future.It was decided that Job Corps was the best path forward, however, they had never addressed the issue of trans youth in their program. Jordan was determined to never feel ‚Äúless than‚Äù again and petitioned to be housed in the male dorm and became the first trans youth locally in Job Corps to be placed in the dorm of his choosing and later became president of his floor.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel like it was just a victory for me,‚Äù Jordan adds. ‚ÄúThere has already been another trans youth arrive at Job Corps. They gave him an option on which dorm to live in, so I know it is already getting better for people who come after me.‚Äù‚ÄúEvery child is not looking for the same thing,‚Äù Riasati admits. ‚ÄúThey have been in situations where people don‚Äôt believe in them or have been told repeatedly that they are worthless and never going to make it. What we do is listen to them, give positive reinforcement, and build their self esteem. That is the most important thing they need to make it through the system and continue on with their lives.‚Äù‚ÄúWe have the greatest respect for Los Angeles Youth Network,‚Äù said Rich Valenza, Founder and CEO of RaiseAChild. ‚ÄúWhile our work is different, our organizations share a very common goal of doing our best to improve the lives of children and youth.‚ÄùYou can help prevent homelessness for LGBTQ youth by supporting the work of LAYN and RaiseAChild.

Jerry Brown (D) said opponents of the new emissions targets were ‚Äúvanquished.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c064df180000dd10bcd570.jpeg?cache=rfMUJ3ilMg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California doubled down on its green economy Wednesday as the legislature passed a pair of bills that set ambitious new targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The new goals are being hailed by environmentalists for providing the certainty needed to ramp up clean-tech investment. Governor Jerry Brown announced in a press conference that opponents of the new targets were ‚Äúvanquished.‚Äù Indeed, there had hardly been a squeak from the oil industry or anyone else.Maybe that‚Äôs because the cap-and-trade exchange that allows heavy polluters to mitigate their damage by purchasing emission credits, and which is one of the state‚Äôs most embattled emission-reduction programs, got kicked down the road. All summer the new emissions goals were embroiled in intense negotiations centered on cap-and-trade ‚Äî talks that included the legislature, the governor and representatives of Big Oil and other heavy industries. Industry wants certainty about buying into the exchange, which has suffered from low participation in its auctions and is the subject of a lawsuit by the state Chamber of Commerce, and many programs seemed to be on the table.Capital & Main reported in July on the tumultuous and confusing signals coming from the governor‚Äôs office, which seemed to indicate that Brown was not only desperate to pass Senate Bill 32, but that he was also trying to strike a grand bargain with the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) and other trade groups to save the cap-and-trade program. This led many to speculate in background conversations that the state might have to sacrifice one of its nation-leading emission-reduction programs. SB 32 is a linchpin of state climate strategy, as it codifies the governor‚Äôs former executive order to ratchet up greenhouse gas reduction goals from 1990 levels by 2020 to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.The negotiations were colored by bruising battles in 2015, when moderate Democrats helped block SB 32 and stripped a provision to reduce gasoline use out of another key bill, SB 350, that increased the state‚Äôs Renewable Portfolio Standard to require 50 percent clean-energy usage by 2030.And then SB 32 sailed through. Have we entered a new era of climate change cooperation? Is somebody keeping their powder dry for bigger battles still to come over state cap-and-trade or other programs? Were foes truly ‚Äúvanquished?‚ÄùPart of the answer is that SB 32 was tied to another measure, Assembly Bill 197, which was designed to quell the fears of the moderate Democrats. Each bill required passage of the other.AB 197 was authored by former SB 32-doubting freshman Assemblymember Eduardo Garcia (D-Coachella). Garcia, like many legislators and public interest groups, was concerned that high-profile emission-reduction programs did little to address the effects of climate change in the hardest-hit communities, such as neighborhoods next to refineries or ports or farming regions, where air quality is often the worst. Cap-and-trade, for instance, allows big polluters to pollute as long as they pay for credits or offsets purchased in other parts of the state or country. AB 197 requires that the California Air Resources Board, which directs implementation of emission-reduction programs, should target direct reductions at both stationary and mobile sources in those communities. Such direct reductions are bitterly opposed by oil interests and heavy industry.The bill also restricts CARB board members to six-year terms, which can be repeated, creates a joint legislative oversight committee made up of three Senators and three Assemblymembers to make recommendations about CARB programs to the legislature, and places two legislators in nonvoting, ex-officio positions on the air board to increase legislative understanding and input into the board‚Äôs work. Evidently this was enough to smooth the waters.‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say anything‚Äôs ever smooth with regard to climate policy!‚Äù laughs Bonnie Holmes-Gen, senior director for Air Quality and Climate Change at the American Lung Association. ‚ÄúA lot of legislators want to understand more of what‚Äôs happening at the Air Resources Board, and they feel a little more comfortable with Eddie Garcia, that there is provision for more oversight, for engagement, for input from legislative voices. That does provide a lot of reassurance.‚ÄùWhen SB 32 was introduced in 2015, many newer legislators were fuzzy on how it actually worked and now understand it better. The bill has also taken a few serious hits: A provision requiring emission reductions to 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050 was stripped out of the bill by amendments.‚ÄúIf you look at all of it ‚Äì the education that‚Äôs happened between last year and this, scaling back the bill, and then the companion legislation [AB 197] ‚Äì I think that all helped,‚Äù said Mike Mielke, Senior Vice President for Environment and Energy, at the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a public policy group representing tech industries.With the addition of the two legislative non-voting board members, the state legislature will now have control of four seats on CARB, which expands to 16 seats from being only 12 seats a year ago. A 2015 bill by then-Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins (D-San Diego) added two legislature-appointed seats to represent environmental justice concerns, which were filled in February by former state Senator Dean Florez from the Central Valley and Diane Takvorian of Environmental Health Coalition, which is based in the San Diego/Tijuana area.Will this big board or any of the other changes hamper the ability of CARB to carry out its mandate?‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it hurts it,‚Äù says Bill Magavern, policy director at Coalition for Clean Air. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a substantial expansion, so there may be some growing pains there. But CARB and the legislature have to continue to try to understand each other better. Because I hear a lot of criticisms from legislators that are just uninformed‚Ä¶. CARB needs to do a better job of explaining its programs and its processes to the legislature.‚ÄùAll of this, however, still leaves questions as to what will happen to cap-and-trade and what kind of talks Gov. Brown really had with the oil industry. In July his office acknowledged being in direct talks with the WSPA to find a way forward past 2020, when both the emission-reduction targets of AB 32 and the state‚Äôs cap-and-trade program were set to expire. He was openly seeking a way to create a bill with two-thirds supermajority support that would head off the need to reauthorize the cap-and-trade program, in particular. In fact, the governor submitted draft language for SB 32 to address this issue, although it was not incorporated into the bill.As one close observer speaking on background characterized the talks, the governor and Big Oil went in trying to reach an agreement on cap-and-trade ‚Äì which proved impossible to get ‚Äì and they came out instead with ‚Äújust cap.‚Äù The governor‚Äôs office helped shape AB 197 and, with Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount) throwing his back into this climate package, setting a new cap became doable. So they skipped cap-and-trade for now.The WSPA, which did not respond to interview requests, issued a statement Tuesday by President Catherine Reheis-Boyd, after SB 32‚Äôs passage, claiming the legislature had really ducked the issue:‚ÄúAB 197 also does not address fundamental cap-and-trade issues that SB 32 conveniently dodges. In fact, it goes in the opposite direction by promoting a command-and-control system that is contrary to a market-based mechanism like cap-and-trade and would further undermine the market. Despite today‚Äôs symbolic victory for some, we will continue to do the real work required to make the appropriate fixes to cap-and-trade that can send the market real certainty.‚ÄùCap-and-trade has been under attack because of recent anemic auctions of its pollution credits ‚Äì the latest poor auction results, held last week, were announced on Tuesday, as SB 32 passed. Uncertainty about the program has caused electric utilities and other industries who participate in those auctions to hold back on purchases. Several public interest representatives speaking on condition of anonymity expressed fear that heavy industry might embrace cap-and-trade in exchange for softening or even eliminating programs like the state‚Äôs Low-Carbon Fuel Standards, which mandate use of such alternative fuels as ethanol, and of lower-carbon fuels like natural gas rather than petroleum. But that didn‚Äôt happen.Cap-and-trade has also been a lightning rod for other reasons: Funds it has generated, which are being used to develop high-speed rail between Los Angeles and San Francisco among other projects, have been the subject of a four-year-old lawsuit brought by the California Chamber of Commerce, which calls the purchases a tax.‚ÄúThis sort of uncertainty is never good for business,‚Äù said Alex Jackson, legal director of the California Climate Project at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what‚Äôs really at stake [with the passage of SB 32]: California‚Äôs climate policies writ large do not rest on one piece of legislation or one target, but this sort of legislation lifts all boats, and it sends a clear economy-wide signal that California remains committed to its path to clean energy.‚ÄùMike Mielke of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group notes there are two reasons why SB 32 is essential. ‚ÄúA, because it‚Äôs the right thing to do, and B, because [clean tech] is a larger and larger part of the state‚Äôs economy and it‚Äôs a larger and larger part of the Silicon Valley economy.‚ÄùCalifornia‚Äôs green economy has been credited with creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the state, including high-qualityskilled positions that have brought labor union support to climate targets like those set out in SB 32.Mielke chastised the media for often portraying ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù as standing opposed to environmentalism. ‚ÄúSome businesses, like heavy manufacturing and the oil industry, don‚Äôt care for this, but a lot of other businesses, like the ones that make up the majority of our membership, do. Silicon Valley is a valley of scientists and engineers. They see this as a problem to be solved, and a challenge to be addressed, and a way, honestly, to make money and create jobs.‚ÄùGovernor Brown is signaling very clearly that he intends to fight for every emission-reduction tool available, although California will have to wait for the next round of auctions to see whether the strong signal of new carbon-reduction targets drives participants into the carbon markets.‚ÄúNow is really not the time for us to back off, when the world is watching, and when we have seen that these programs are working, both for the impact they‚Äôre having on our air quality and therefore our health, as well as the positive impact on our economy,‚Äù said Sandra Fluke, California State Director of Voices for Progress. ‚ÄúWe do have to remember that, aside from revenues produced by the cap-and-trade auctions, which are important ‚Ä¶ the point of cap and trade is to lower greenhouse gas emissions. And that is working very successfully.‚Äù"

Just 7 percent say they‚Äôve seen more Trump ads. Another 24 percent say they‚Äôve seen an equal number for each candidate, while 15 percent haven‚Äôt seen any commercials and 7 percent are unsure. People‚Äôs self-reported recollections aren‚Äôt exactly perfect, and some will mistakenly report having seen ads that they couldn‚Äôt possibly have watched. In one study, 17 percent of people told pollsters that they remembered seeing a commercial that had never actually been played for them.But lending credence to the results is the lack of partisan split you‚Äôd expect to see if people on either side were trying to prop up their own party with their responses. Fifty percent of Republicans, and a nearly identical 53 percent of Democrats, say they‚Äôve seen more ads from Clinton.And, more importantly, the public‚Äôs impression that Clinton is outgunning Trump on the airwaves matches up with the numbers. Clinton‚Äôs campaign has outspent Trump‚Äôs campaign by a 17-to-1 margin, NBC News reported earlier this week, and even with outside groups supporting both candidates factored in, the Democrats retain a 6-to-1 advantage. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen a modern presidential campaign that is so lopsided in terms of advertising,‚Äù wrote Erika Franklin Fowler, the co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. Recent history offers little precedent for exactly how much that imbalance is likely to affect Trump, whose campaign voters increasingly perceive as being poorly run.‚ÄúThe evidence suggests that campaign ads have small effects that decay rapidly ‚Äî very rapidly ‚Äî but just enough of the impact accumulates to make running more advertising than your opponent seem a necessity,‚Äù political scientist Lynn Vavreck wrote in June. ‚ÄúIt sets off an arms race of ads as candidates try to neutralize or displace their opponents. But will the 2016 general election be different? Mr. Trump has used unconventional campaign tactics and has relied on free media to get his messages out. All of this may render advertising less relevant.‚ÄùAlthough Trump is losing on ad spending, he‚Äôs still getting plenty of airtime and ink. By a 27-point margin, 40 percent to 13 percent, Americans say they‚Äôve seen more news stories about Trump than Clinton in the past month, with 38 percent reporting hearing equally about both. ‚ÄúI have a little TV in my office. If I put it on right now, I have a 75 percent chance of seeing him,‚Äù Jordan Cohen, the chief marketing officer for the digital marketing firm Fluent, told The Wall Street Journal.Perhaps as a result, Trump also comes up more in Americans‚Äô conversations: Twenty-nine percent say they spend more time talking about him, while 13 percent spend more time talking about Clinton. A 53 percent majority spend equal time talking about both candidates, or try to eschew mentioning either candidate.The poll finds less clear of a disparity in other forms of messaging. While Trump has an 8-point edge over Clinton on the number of posts Americans have seen from him on Twitter and Facebook during the last month, 52 percent of respondents say they‚Äôve seen equal postings from both candidates or none at all. Roughly equal percentages of Americans also reported being contacted by each campaign. Ten percent said they‚Äôd heard from Clinton‚Äôs campaign, 11 percent said they‚Äôd heard from Trump‚Äôs, 4 percent said they‚Äôd heard from both, and 69 percent said they hadn‚Äôt heard from either.

But it‚Äôs the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, that has him on the run.The amendment went into effect 96 years ago on Friday, which is commemorated as Women‚Äôs Equality Day. And in November, women will use their hard-fought right to likely keep one of the most sexist presidential candidates in modern history out of the Oval Office. Women have skewed Democratic for decades, but this year the numbers could be even more dramatic. Women voters are overwhelmingly supportive of Hillary Clinton; while their male counterparts still lean towards her opponent.Donald Trump is faring terribly in the polls with women: Sixty percent of female likely voters said they‚Äôd go for Clinton in a head-to-head matchup against the reality TV star, according to a Quinnipiac poll out Thursday. Meanwhile, 48 percent of men said they‚Äôd vote for Trump, versus 42 percent for Clinton. An Economist/YouGov poll has Clinton polling 10 points ahead of Trump among women when you throw third-party candidates into the mix. Men, meanwhile, were 4 points more likely to choose Trump than Clinton. And an NBC/SurveyMonkey poll found Clinton was up 21 points with female voters, but male voters preferred Trump by 6 percent.There‚Äôs been a lot of talk of how Trump‚Äôs popularity with white men is shaping the election, but less focus on women: not ‚Äúsoccer moms‚Äù or ‚Äúsecurity moms‚Äù or some other reductive description for female voters, who for some reason are treated as a special interest group in U.S. politics.

But it‚Äôs the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, that has him on the run.The amendment went into effect 96 years ago on Friday, which is commemorated as Women‚Äôs Equality Day. And in November, women will use their hard-fought right to likely keep one of the most sexist presidential candidates in modern history out of the Oval Office. Women have skewed Democratic for decades, but this year the numbers could be even more dramatic. Women voters are overwhelmingly supportive of Hillary Clinton; while their male counterparts still lean towards her opponent.Donald Trump is faring terribly in the polls with women: Sixty percent of female likely voters said they‚Äôd go for Clinton in a head-to-head matchup against the reality TV star, according to a Quinnipiac poll out Thursday. Meanwhile, 48 percent of men said they‚Äôd vote for Trump, versus 42 percent for Clinton. An Economist/YouGov poll has Clinton polling 10 points ahead of Trump among women when you throw third-party candidates into the mix. Men, meanwhile, were 4 points more likely to choose Trump than Clinton. And an NBC/SurveyMonkey poll found Clinton was up 21 points with female voters, but male voters preferred Trump by 6 percent.There‚Äôs been a lot of talk of how Trump‚Äôs popularity with white men is shaping the election, but less focus on women: not ‚Äúsoccer moms‚Äù or ‚Äúsecurity moms‚Äù or some other reductive description for female voters, who for some reason are treated as a special interest group in U.S. politics.

22,POLITICS,"Yes, Citizens United And Other Court Rulings Led To A Rise In Dark Money",Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dark-money-supreme-court_us_57c09b32e4b0267344500abb,"No, it wasn't like this before the court started deregulating campaign finance.",2016-08-26,"Political strategist Karl Rove co-founded the dark money group Crossroads GPS, the most prolific advertiser among independent groups in the 21st century.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c09b9e1600003503bfebb4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ‚Äï In case there was still any argument left on the matter, a new report from the Wesleyan Media Project and the Center for Responsive Politics shows how much spending by groups that don‚Äôt disclose their donors soared in response to Supreme Court decisions that deregulated campaign finance.Although there has been a lot of ink spilled (or keyboards mashed) showing how undisclosed or ‚Äúdark‚Äù money surged following the court‚Äôs recent campaign finance decisions, this new report goes one step further by examining the actual number of advertisements these groups ran from 2000 through 2016. This unprecedented look at dark money shows definitively that there can be no other reason for the dark money surge than deregulatory court rulings.In the 2000 election, dark money nonprofits aired more than 34,000 advertisements, according to the report. This number dropped by half to slightly above 15,000 for both the 2004 and 2006 elections before skyrocketing to over 158,000 in 2008. By the next presidential election in 2012, dark money groups ran over 383,000 ads. You can see these surges in the chart below.What the report shows that is new is that the surge in dark money spending was not an illusion created by new disclosure rules enacted in 2002. That year, Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, more popularly known as McCain-Feingold after its bipartisan Senate co-sponsors, John McCain and Russ Feingold. It included requirements that independent groups, like nonprofits or 527s or even political party committees, disclose their election spending within certain windows before an election. This disclosure requirement even included spending that simply named candidates immediately before an election.Previous examinations of the surge in dark money looked at this disclosed spending. The new report‚Äôs look at actual advertisement airings adds a new wrinkle to this by providing a measure that goes back before the McCain-Feingold disclosure requirements were put in place.Or as Robert Maguire, political nonprofit investigator for the Center for Responsive Politics, says, ‚ÄúThis shows more conclusively than any study done in the past that there really is a change in quantity that goes along with court decisions and the lack of oversight of these groups that has allowed nonprofit groups to be a much more tantalizing vehicle for people who want to hide their political spending.‚ÄùThe two surges, first in 2008 and second after 2010, came in response to two Supreme Court decisions and one rule-making by the Federal Election Commission that significantly loosened campaign finance rules. In the 2007 Wisconsin Right to Life case, the court ruled that certain nonprofit corporations could spend corporate money on electioneering so long as it stopped short of calling for the election or defeat of a candidate. This is what we‚Äôd call ‚Äúissue ads.‚Äù The FEC followed up this ruling by gutting a new regulation imposed by the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law requiring all independent groups spending money on elections to disclose their donors.Then in 2010, the court ruled in the Citizens United v. FEC case that corporations and unions could legally spend unlimited sums of money on elections so long as it remained independent from candidate campaigns and political parties. Although the court‚Äôs ruling included a strong endorsement for donor disclosure, the ruling essentially lifted a major obstacle to dark money in elections by allowing nonprofits to use corporate donations to fund express electoral expenses.Why does this even matter? Well, those connected to dark money groups have repeatedly defended the practice by stating that they were simply trying to level the playing field. In particular, Karl Rove, who helped launch the dark money nonprofit Crossroads GPS, which came under fire from Democrats, argued in the Wall Street Journal that ‚Äúliberal groups have operated for decades in the same way GPS does without Democrats complaining.‚ÄùAlthough it is certainly true that both Democratic and Republican nonprofits did operate similarly by spending money on elections without disclosing their donors before Crossroads GPS formed, they did so at a wildly lower volume than Crossroads GPS and other groups did after the Supreme Court loosened the rules. That increased volume has been largely driven by groups that popped up after court rulings ‚Äï like Crossroads GPS.In fact, Crossroads GPS, founded in 2010, has aired more ads than any other independent group from 2000-2016. The conservative nonprofit aired more than 207,000 ads, according to the report. That is 50,000 more ads than the second most prolific ad buyer, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Once defended by Rove as a grassroots conservative nonprofit, Crossroads GPS has practically disappeared as a political force since it nearly lost its nonprofit status ‚Äï the very thing protecting it from disclosing its donors. The group‚Äôs tiny staff, however, has moved on to another nonprofit called One Nation. The new group has only run ads in the 2016 election, but it is already in the top 30 among all independent spenders.‚ÄúThe idea that Crossroads or any of these groups are active in the same way that a handful of groups were active in the past is absurd,‚Äù Maguire says.And now there‚Äôs a study to prove it."

And that has nothing to do with their religion.While France‚Äôs burkini ban conflates top-to-toe swimwear with religious fundamentalism, in India, as in other parts of the non-western world, coverage is simply essential for comfort. In fact, it‚Äôs not rare to see women enjoying water park rides fully-dressed, floating among the crowd in a public swimming pool wearing saris or salwar kameezes.For instance, here‚Äôs some photos of Indian women at water parks across the country.And here are some of the swimwear options on sale at India‚Äôs top e-commerce websites:For Indian women, being covered gives them the freedom to go out and enjoy the water, without worrying about the way that their bodies look.And that‚Äôs exactly what the creator of the burkini, Aheda Zanetti, was going for with her invention. Indeed, she claims that more than 40% of burkinis are sold to non-Muslim women, suggesting that there‚Äôs a big market for modest swimwear that cuts across religious lines.‚ÄúThe Jewish community embraces it. I‚Äôve seen Mormons wearing it. A Buddhist nun purchased it for all of her friends.

Sarkozy declared his plans to seek the nomination of the Republican Party in Tout pour la France (Everything for France), his book that came out Wednesday. The platform he outlines in the book indicates a shift toward right-wing identity politics, including a tougher stance on Islam and stricter immigration policy. His remarks come at a time when France is submerged in a debate over the burkini, a full-body swimsuit that mayors in more than a dozen seaside towns have decided to ban this month. France‚Äôs top administrative court, the Conseil d‚ÄôEtat, overturned the burkini ban in Villeneuve-Loubet on Friday, stating that it ‚Äúhad seriously infringed, in a manner that was clearly illegal, fundamental liberties such as the freedom to come and go, religious freedom and individual freedom,‚Äù but the decision is unlikely to put an end to the debate. Sarkozy‚Äôs platform, and his most recent suggestions regarding Islamic dress, cater to voters on the right who are calling for more security and policing of political Islam in the aftermath of almost two years of terrorist attacks. In an interview with Le Figaro Magazine this week, Sarkozy described wearing burkinis as ‚Äúa militant, provocative, and political act.‚Äù‚ÄúTo do nothing would make people think that France is weak, it would facilitate a further decline of the Republic,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf we do not put an end to this, the risk is that in 10 years, Muslim girls who don‚Äôt wear a headscarf or a burkini will be stigmatized and put under daily peer pressure,‚Äù he said, lumping the Islamic headscarf together with the disputed swimsuit.This week, French police confronted women dressed in outfits resembling the burkini on the beach, leading to public outcry. Four police officers asked a woman reclining on a beach in Nice to remove some of her clothing, and gave her a ticket for not wearing ‚Äúan outfit respecting good morals and secularism.‚Äù During an with interview on TF1, the former president said that ‚Äúthe best way to ease tensions is to proscribe any outward signs of religion‚Äù in the public space. In Everything for France, he outlines a law that would ban religious symbols not only in state schools, which haven‚Äôt allowed headscarfs since 2004, but also in universities and administrative buildings. Sarkozy has continued to harden his rhetoric against Islam and conspicuous religiosity in France over the past decade. It‚Äôs been quite the turnaround for someone who once championed ‚Äúpositive secularism.‚Äù During Pope Benedict XVI‚Äôs first visit to France in 2008, the then-president said it was ‚Äúlegitimate for democracy and respectful of secularism to have a dialogue with religions.‚ÄùA year later, Sarkozy maintained that while ‚Äúthe Muslim religion must be respected as much as other religions,‚Äù full veils were ‚Äúnot welcome‚Äù in France. ‚ÄúIn our country, we can‚Äôt accept women prisoners behind a screen, cut off from all social life, deprived of all identity. That‚Äôs not our idea of freedom,‚Äù he said in 2009.In the same year, however, he indicated that he had no major problem with the headscarf. ‚ÄúIn France, any girl who wants to wear the headscarf can do so. It‚Äôs their freedom,‚Äù he said.Throughout his presidency, he pushed for broader restrictions on Islamic dress. In 2011, Sarkozy banned the niqab and the burqa in all public spaces, as part of a law prohibiting people from covering their face in public.

31,POLITICS,Progressive Activists Take A Seat For The People At Federal Reserve Retreat,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-reserve-fed-up-jackson-hole_us_57bf7095e4b02673444f65b5,"This time, top officials gathered to listen to the reformers' ideas.",2016-08-26,"Fed Up activists, seen here in February 2016, have converged on the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole retreat this week.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bf71951800002100bcd38b.jpeg?cache=s7o6hn9E1M&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two years ago this week, the nonprofit Center for Popular Democracy and allied groups launched the Fed Up campaign, aimed at making the Federal Reserve more accountable to workers and communities of color. They converged then on the Jackson Lake Lodge in Wyoming, where Fed officials decamp every year to discuss policy and hobnob with the economic elite.How much political headway has the campaign made since then? This year, Fed Up activists were essentially put on the schedule for senior Federal Reserve officials, with a major meeting at the Jackson Hole summit.The group met Thursday, the first day of the summit, with eight of the 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks and two members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.Fed Up activists have met individually with the governors and regional bank presidents before; they spoke with some Fed officials less formally at the past two Jackson Hole gatherings. This is the first time, however, that their delegation of some 120 rank-and-file activists had met with so many of the central bank‚Äôs decision-makers in one place.‚ÄúIt is kind of like a mini-FOMC,‚Äù said Fed Up campaign manager Jordan Haedtler prior to the event, likening it to a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed‚Äôs policymaking body.The progressive campaign is calling for the central bank to wait for the economic recovery to reach more broadly across America before raising its benchmark interest rate again, a move that slows the pace of economic growth to head off price inflation.It has also criticized the Fed for the lack of racial, gender and professional background diversity among its senior officials, arguing that only a central bank that looks like America can craft policy in the best interests of all citizens.The Fed officials at the meeting were Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which hosts the annual symposium; New York Fed president William Dudley; Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan; Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari; Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester; Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren; San Francisco Fed president John Williams; Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker, and Fed governors Stanley Fischer and Lael Brainard.‚ÄúThey were really impressed with how well prepared we were,‚Äù said Haedtler after the meeting. ‚ÄúThey were heartened by the discussion.‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see how things go in September,‚Äù he added, referring to the next opportunity for an interest rate hike.Bill Medley, a spokesman for the Kansas City Fed, also gave positive feedback about the meeting.‚ÄúIt was a productive dialogue, as it always is, and we look forward to continuing the conversation,‚Äù Medley said.Fed Up has had a banner year so far. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton embraced the broad contours of its platform in May after weeks of private discussion with group representatives. ‚ÄúSecretary Clinton believes that the Fed needs to be more representative of America as a whole as well as that commonsense reforms ‚Äî like getting bankers off the boards of regional Federal Reserve banks ‚Äî are long overdue,‚Äù a Clinton spokesman said at the time.But Clinton stopped short of signing on to a bolder reform proposal that Fed Up rolled out in April, which would turn the central bank system into an entirely public institution. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors is already a federal agency, whose top officials are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. But the 12 regional banks it supervises are owned by the private financial institutions they serve. (Fed Up released a more detailed version of its idea on Monday.)The private nature of these banks is a major reason why they are run overwhelmingly by white men with backgrounds in finance, Fed Up argues. There has never been a black or Latino president of one of the regional banks, the group notes in its reform proposal, and one-third of the current bank heads are alumni of Wall Street power player Goldman Sachs.Fed Up‚Äôs moment at this year‚Äôs Jackson Hole symposium was not without its hiccups.Earlier this month, Fed Up were informed that the Jackson Lake Lodge had canceled over a dozen of its room reservations. The hotel said a ‚Äúcomputer glitch‚Äù had led to the overbooking of 18 rooms. But the fact that 13 of those rooms were booked by Fed Up raised concerns that they were being targeted.Although the activists found lodging at a nearby resort, Fed Up filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice, and members of Congress sympathetic to their cause sent Fed Chair Janet Yellen a letter asking for an explanation.In an apparent gesture of detente, George, the Kansas City Fed president, offered Fed Up the big meeting, and the campaign withdrew its objections to the lodging snafu.Fed Up agreed also to limit its presence in the lodge‚Äôs halls during a scheduled cocktail hour. In the past, activists have clustered inside the hotel to confront Fed officials in person. The group held a press conference-cum-rally outside the lodge before Thursday‚Äôs meeting. It also plans to run teach-in seminars and to canvass the city‚Äôs low-income neighborhoods to spread the word about Fed reform.But Haedtler, Fed Up‚Äôs campaign manager, wanted to focus on Thursday‚Äôs meeting. It is evidence, he said, that his fledgling movement‚Äôs priorities have made it into the mainstream.‚ÄúWe have clearly reshaped the discourse,‚Äù Haedtler said."

The legendary entertainer‚Äôs social justice organization Sankofa.org will host the ‚ÄúMany Rivers To Cross Festival‚Äù in Atlanta, Georgia, on Oct. 1. The two-day music and arts event will serve as a platform for artists, community organizers and activists to collaborate on the advancement of voting rights, mass incarceration and police relations ‚Äï to name a few.Jesse Williams, John Legend, Common, Chris Rock and Carlos Santana are among the list of names set to participate. Belafonte said during a press call Thursday that the event, which has been billed as the ‚Äúlargest music and arts festival dedicated to racial and social justice,‚Äù will give artists the platform to connect their material with topics surrounding relevant issues, such as America‚Äôs judicial system. ‚ÄúMost of the artists will be dealing with material that‚Äôs relevant to the issue of justice and incarceration,‚Äù Belafonte said. ‚ÄúOne of the things that we asked was that they create material to [discuss] the miscarriage of justice as the case may be.‚ÄùThe civil rights pioneer added that Sankofa has partnered with BET to film the the event which will be announced at a later date.In terms of laying the ground work for ‚ÄúMany Rivers To Cross,‚Äù Belafonte says he initially met with Prince, who he called ‚Äúa force,‚Äù during its planning phase.‚ÄúI was supposed to meet Prince on the week he died,‚Äù he said of the late musical icon. ‚ÄúWe were going to have our fourth meeting in New York when we got word that he had unfortunately passed away.‚ÄùBelafonte says the music icon‚Äôs tribute song, ‚ÄúBaltimore‚Äù ‚Äï which was recorded following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray ‚Äï will serve as a centerpiece for the event.In addition to the list of empowering symposiums and performances, fans will have the opportunity to meet community organizations and thought-leaders at the ‚ÄúSocial Justice Village.‚Äù There will also be an activation area which will provide attendees with additional info on advancing today‚Äôs human rights issues.For Public Enemy member Chuck D, who is performing at the festival, the importance and urgency of artists and cultural leaders to come together and accept their responsibility for change is long overdue. ‚ÄúHistorically, artists have come from the communities that face these same issues,‚Äù he said during the call. ‚ÄúBut for the past 30 years artists have listened to and followed the program of their lawyers, agents, managers who have kind of dangled money in their career to get them away from the accountability and responsibility.‚ÄúSo this is necessary. Artists linking up with real situations, real people doing real things to redefine our society is necessary.‚Äù For more info on the ‚ÄúMany Rivers To Cross‚Äù festival click here."

You just need somebody to let a little out.‚ÄùParker has since learned to deal with feelings of anxiety by discussing them with friends and family in the moment, she said.And she‚Äôs totally right to do so: Talking about mental health not only helps treat mental health issues, but also helps to reduce stigma. Research shows negative stereotypes often prevent people from seeking support ‚Äï and the more people like Parker open up, the more those stereotypes are smashed. Parker is just one of many celebrities who have been generating awareness around mental health in the media recently. Last year, she discussed the importance of creating more compassion around mental health ‚Äï especially when it comes to veterans and PTSD ‚Äï in Glamour magazine.Ultimately, Parker told the Coveteur, taking care of your mental wellbeing in the moment is all about understanding methods that put you at ease. For her, it‚Äôs indulging in a good book. For others, that may be going for a walk or trying a little meditation.But most importantly? It‚Äôs important to tackle any psychological issues head-on, she says.‚ÄúMy mental wellness is reliant on me figuring out how to cope,‚Äù she told the publication. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm also on the other hand not afraid of feeling anxious, I just want to know that I can handle my nerves or my anxiousness, or disappointment or sadness about myself or friends and family members.‚ÄùSounds pretty healthy to us.Read more from Parker‚Äôs interview over at The Coveteur."

Paul LePage attacked a Democratic state lawmaker on Thursday, challenging him to prove that the governor was a racist.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c04901170000aa0fc75ab4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) left a threatening voicemail for a Democratic state lawmaker on Thursday, using obscene language and challenging the lawmaker to prove the governor is racist.LePage believed that state Rep. Drew Gattine (D) accused him of being racist after the governor said he kept a binder full of drug traffickers arrested in Maine and that more than 90 percent of them were black or Hispanic. In an interview with the Portland Press Herald, Gattine denied he had made the claim.In the voicemail, obtained by the Press Herald, LePage directed several obscenities toward Gattine.‚ÄúMr. Gattine, this is Governor Paul Richard LePage. I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you cocksucker,‚Äù LePage said. ‚ÄúI want to talk to you. I want you to prove that I‚Äôm a racist. I‚Äôve spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker. You, I need you to, just freakin‚Äô, I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you.‚ÄùListen to the full voicemail below:In January, LePage said men with names like ‚ÄúD-Money, Smoothie, Shifty‚Äù were dealing drugs in Maine and impregnating white women. Earlier this week, he said the binder he kept proved he isn‚Äôt racist because it supported his statements about the racial makeup of the traffickers.LePage released a statement Friday, saying he was angry and apologizing for his language.‚ÄúWhen someone calls me a racist, I take it very seriously. I didn‚Äôt know Drew Gattine from a hole in the wall until yesterday. It made me enormously angry when a TV reporter asked me for my reaction about Gattine calling me a racist. It is the absolute worst, most vile thing you can call a person,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I called Gattine and used the worst word I could think of. I apologize for that to the people of Maine, but I make no apology for trying to end the drug epidemic that is ravaging our state.‚ÄùThe governor also said that he never intended to harm Gattine.‚ÄúWhen I said I was going after Gattine, I meant I would do everything I could to see that he and his agenda is defeated politically. I am a history buff, and I referenced how political opponents used to call each other out in the 1820s ‚Äî including Andrew Jackson, the father of the Democratic Party. Obviously, it is illegal today; it was simply a metaphor and I meant no physical harm to Gattine,‚Äù he said. Gattine did not respond to HuffPost‚Äôs request for comment on the incident, but he told the Press Herald that LePage‚Äôs voicemail was ‚Äúinappropriate and uncalled for.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat I said to the television reporter today is that the kind of racially charged comments the governor made are not at all helpful in solving what the real problem is,‚Äù Gattine told the Press Herald. ‚ÄúAnd that is, we have a crisis in the state of Maine of people overdosing on heroin and prescription drugs and we are not doing enough with respect to treatment and prevention.‚ÄùAfter leaving the voicemail, LePage publicly attacked Gattine and invited a television crew and Press Herald reporter for an interview in which he said he wished he could duel Gattine.‚ÄúWhen a snot-nosed little guy from Westbrook calls me a racist, now I‚Äôd like him to come up here because, tell you right now, I wish it were 1825,‚Äù he said, according to the Press Herald. ‚ÄúAnd we would have a duel, that‚Äôs how angry I am, and I would not put my gun in the air, I guarantee you, I would not be (Alexander) Hamilton. I would point it right between his eyes, because he is a snot-nosed little runt and he has not done a damn thing since he‚Äôs been in this Legislature to help move the state forward.‚ÄùLePage and Gattine have clashed on a number of issues, according to the Press Herald, including the governor‚Äôs effort to get rid of food stamps in his state.LePage‚Äôs voicemail prompted Westbrook‚Äôs mayor, council president and school committee chair to write an open letter to the people of Maine condemning their governor. ‚ÄúOnce more Governor LePage has humiliated himself and the Office of the Governor. He continues to again embarrass the citizens of this wonderful State,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúLePage‚Äôs voicemail to Representative Gattine is so outrageous it is beyond our ability to know how to respond. Furthermore, his threat to want to ‚Äòshoot him between the eyes‚Äô would be reprehensible coming from anybody, but from the individual holding the position of Governor of our State is insanity.‚ÄùDemocratic leaders in the state legislature said the comments showed LePage was not fit to hold office.Gattine wasn‚Äôt the only target of LePage this week. On Wednesday, he called Khizr Khan, the father of a killed American soldier, a ‚Äúcon artist‚Äù for criticizing GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.This post has been updated with a statement LePage released Friday and a letter from officials in Westbrook to the people of Maine."

Is that how this felt when you were performing and recording this concert?Todd Rundgren: Yeah, but not necessarily in those terms. In recent years, I‚Äôve been experimenting with different musical forms and different ways to present myself. As a result, there are things that don‚Äôt get played. I‚Äôll put it that way. One of the paradoxes of having a career in which you continue to create as opposed to resting on your laurels all the time is that fan favorites from decades ago don‚Äôt get played as often, or if they do get played, I sometimes readapt them to a style that I might be dabbling in. It reached a certain point where I felt like I had toyed with my audience for long enough and would just give them the more familiar stuff in a way that was more familiar, as opposed to just rearranging things. On any particular night, we have a list of fifty songs and I‚Äôll pick about half of them to perform. Even though the release is a document of a particular evening, it isn‚Äôt necessarily representative of any other particular evening, it‚Äôs just the songs we decided to play that particular night. On that tour and on the recent tours that I‚Äôve done with this show, the set list is different every night, both because we as players will get bored with it if we keep playing the same thing every night, and also I have fans who sometimes show up to more than one show, and that gives them an opportunity to hear more material than would fit into a single show.MR: How are you satisfying yourself creatively these days and how are you bringing your fans along with the live experience?TR: The dichotomy goes back to more or less the beginning of my career. I put together a band and the band lasted about eighteen months and put two records together over the course of it. After that experience, I still wanted to be involved in the music business but I didn‚Äôt like the politics of being in a musical group. I wasn‚Äôt comfortable fronting an act of my own at that point. I was a guitar player in a band. The first thing I did after the band broke up was get into engineering and production, before I recorded a solo album. That became a very successful avocation for me, to the point where when I was making my own records, I made them for me. I paid no attention to how the audience would respond. My first record was very eclectic and all over the map, the next one was a little bit more coherent. By the time I got to the third one, I had gotten my songwriting chops to a point where I had like three hit records off of Something/Anything?. At that point, the expectation was that I was going to slave in that mine for the rest of my career and milk the success of that. Well, because unlike most artists, I did not depend on my records and the success thereof for my livelihood. I was making plenty of money producing other people‚Äôs records right after Something/Anything? I decided I wanted to do something different, and I put out an album called A Wizard, A True Star and at that point, probably lost half of my entire audience. There were no hit singles off of it but that more or less defined the pattern that I would follow for the rest of my career, which is, ‚ÄúWhatever I did on that record you just heard, whether you liked it or not, the next one is likely not to be anything like it.‚Äù The audience that I developed over the years has grown to expect the unexpected. That‚Äôs part of the appeal. It‚Äôs something that has kind of gone out of music as the years have gone by, mostly because record labels like to have consistent and understandable product to move to the audience. Everyone sort of forgets the times when The Beatles were going through endless mutations and adopting new musical forms and discarding them. That to me was what was most exciting about the band; ‚ÄúWhat are they going to do next? What is this next record going to hold?‚Äù The people who have stuck with me probably have somewhat the same attitude. They would be perhaps a little disappointed if I suddenly settled down and stated making the same kind of record over and over again, and worst of all, appeared to be pandering to them in the process.MR: Fellow Huffington Post contributor, Sal Nunziato, has a question for you: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been twenty years since you‚Äôve used a band on a record, is there any chance of seeing that happen again?TR: As a matter of fact, the principal reason why I haven‚Äôt been using a band is more geographic than anything. When I moved out to Kauai, it just made it difficult to call a session with the players I‚Äôm used to playing with, being at least a five-hour flight from the West Coast. It made me go back to the way I initially made records, which was doing most all of it myself. For some reason labels keep coming to me and asking me to do more records, so I‚Äôve been recently contracted to do another record by the end of the year. This time, I‚Äôve decided that it‚Äôs going to be a much more collaborative effort, although that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean I‚Äôm putting a band together and going in to the studio in that old-fashioned, typical ensemble kind of way. These are going to be contributors from all over the world, so a lot of this will be done the way that a lot of music is made nowadays. We send the elements to each other and we make our contributions and then send them back. So yes, this will be a collaborative record and there will be many other players on it but it won‚Äôt necessarily be a band.MR: When performing live, are there any songs you can‚Äôt wait to get to?TR: Well, I guess you could say that some songs still have a certain resonance for me. The hardest ones are the ones from the very early parts of my career. I have a terrifically hard time getting into ‚ÄúHello, It‚Äôs Me,‚Äù being the very first song I ever wrote and likely one of the ones that I play as much as any other song. It‚Äôs certainly a song that people enjoy hearing because they can also sing along to it. There are those chorus parts and it‚Äôs simple and to many, it represents an era when music was different. I‚Äôve come to realize that the purpose of this kind of presentation, going back and reviving older material, has more to do with transporting people in the audience back to another time in their lives. They often remember the first time they heard a song or some significant event that occurred to them in which the song was part of the context. In that sense, it isn‚Äôt so much them in the present enjoying how we do the song so much as them in some sort of reverie, regressing to an earlier time. While that is certainly a valid expectation‚Äïthat when you go to a show you would have that sort of experience‚Äïbut once again, I caution the audience not to come with those sort of expectations, because that moment may not occur. If I didn‚Äôt feel like I was creating new moments that later you might have reveries about, I would probably give it up altogether. I‚Äôm not the kind of artist who could be contented to simply repeat the past. There‚Äôs too much music happening around me for me to feel like I‚Äôm not involved in it somehow.MR: Todd, what advice do you have for new artists?TR: The miracle of technology has eliminated a lot of the barriers that used to exist when I first started out. You had to go to a studio that usually the record label you were auditioning for owned. They would give you a half an hour or an hour to perform essentially live as many songs as you could get down on tape. That was usually the singular vehicle. There were other ways, I suppose. There were A&R men who would go out and see an act live and say, ‚ÄúSign ‚Äòem up,‚Äù but often, you had to go around and actually make audition tapes, different ones for every label. You couldn‚Äôt take the tapes with you after you had made them, you had to replay the songs for RCA and for Columbia and for Atlantic. I don‚Äôt know how many of those sessions we did before we eventually got signed, but it had little to do with our ability to actually perform in front of an audience, but our ability to make record. Things have changed, that whole sort of gatekeeper status that the record label had, because they owned all the equipment. That‚Äôs all disappeared. Kids nowadays have their own studios in their laptops. Crap, you can have it in your iPad or your phone at this point. There are no creative barriers any longer. You don‚Äôt have to try and get into anybody else‚Äôs expensive studio and do as much as you can in a limited amount of time. You have all the resources you need and all the time in the world to work on it. Then there are the other aspects, once you had a final product, the function of the label was to promote it, get people to play it on the radio, and take out ads in magazines so that people would know there was such a thing as your record. Now you‚Äôve got YouTube. You don‚Äôt need anything else to promote yourself. I know of artists who essentially have no label. In some cases, they don‚Äôt even sell music. They just promote themselves over YouTube and make all their money at the gigs‚Äïfees at the gigs and selling merchandise. This is actually very curious, because it‚Äôs pre-label. It‚Äôs almost back to the time before recording existed. There is not that necessity, nor even the desire to have some corporate entity suddenly controlling everything you do. I don‚Äôt have to give kids advice nowadays if they‚Äôve got the inspiration to make music. There is no impediment to them getting the resources to make it, and there‚Äôs no impediment to them getting it into the public eye, and there are all these social media networks where you can actually build your own promotion team, people who will go out and hype you to other people for free. How do you make the money? You‚Äôve got to go out and play live. I think regardless of whatever music you make, you‚Äôve got to go out and play live, make T-shirts and stuff. That‚Äôs how you make a living. You don‚Äôt actually make a living selling music in that old-fashioned sense. I think that‚Äôs incredibly liberating. For artists who grew up in the era of the big labels, they still think of music as being a ‚Äúthing,‚Äù something that‚Äôs etched into a piece of plastic and wrapped in cardboard, but music isn‚Äôt anything except when it‚Äôs being played, when it vibrates the air and enters your eardrum. We‚Äôve returned back to the basics, I think. We just have this space-age way of getting the word out and promoting it.MR: Sal Nunziato has another question for you: ‚ÄúIs the project with The Roots still happening?TR: Yes, it is ongoing. It‚Äôs just that they get busy and I get busy. It was never a project that had some sort of aegis behind it, we just started doing it because we had a mutual admiration and we‚Äôre all from Philadelphia. They started sending me some tracks, I started writing songs for them and singing them. That process will continue but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily have any deadline. We hope to complete it by sometime next year, but right now, it‚Äôs become somewhat of a lesser priority because we have this record under contract that we have to finish.Transcribed by Galen HawthorneKRIEF‚ÄôS ‚ÄúDEO GRATIAS‚Äù EXCLUSIVEMontreal-based Krief, aka Patrick Krief‚Äïformer lead guitarist and vocalist with The Dears‚Äïshares a lyric video to his new single ‚ÄúDeo Gratias‚Äù directed by Christopher Mills (Modest Mouse, Interpol). The song is taken off of his forthcoming double album Automanic, which will be released September 30 on Culvert Music.According to the lyric video‚Äôs director, Christopher Mills...‚ÄúThe snare drum rim shot buried in Patrick‚Äôs lush production of ‚ÄòDeo Gratias‚Äô felt like an old clock to me. I the instrumentation made me think of gears and bells, and Patrick‚Äôs soft, haunting voice made me think of a ghost inside a clock, waiting and longing. I also liked the idea that the video could have twitches to it‚Äïa bit like some kind of time lapse, or film-gate type of thing, so I projected Patrick‚Äôs image, and the lyrics into the curved glass of the clock, and used the abstract blur to create the ‚Äòtwitches‚Äô that come at unexpected moments, and to build the final composite of these very simple ideas, loosely assembled to back this lush song.‚ÄùALEXIS & THE SAMURAI‚ÄôS ‚ÄúDOGS‚Äù EXCLUSIVEAccording to Alexis & the Samurai‚Äôs Sam Craft... ‚Äú‚ÄôDogs‚Äô is the tale of two Great Danes that Alexis and I used to have in our old house in Mid-City, New Orleans. Well, they weren‚Äôt our pups; they were our roommates‚Äô. One dog was a sassy black princess who didn‚Äôt take any crap from anybody and the other was a big, dumb drool machine who tried to eat the floor a lot. One day, when I was home alone, the princess got out. Great Danes are huge animals and have the land speed of a gazelle, so I was terrified that I was gonna discover a pile of dog guts on the street and that their owners were gonna turn me into a pile of human guts on the street. I panicked and asked this wise, old Irish dude next door if he had seen the dog. He said no, but added, in a thick brogue, ‚ÄòUse the dumb dog to lead ye to the smart ‚Äòun.‚Äô Sure enough, I put him on a leash and that awkward-yet-loyal goofball led me right to his sister who was up to no good about two blocks away. I thought this tale of ‚Äòdoggus ex machina‚Äô would make for a good song. In our duo, Alexis often leads our music into interesting new territory and I get to follow my nose and pull the arrangements along to catch up.‚Äù A Conversation with Don McLeanMike Ragogna: It‚Äôs been many years, you‚Äôve had many hits, you‚Äôve had a career that many would be envious of, and yet here we are talking once again about American Pie. Don, does it ever get old?Don McLean: It‚Äôs a little like Groundhog Day. When I was younger, I fought it for a while. I had a couple other hits and it didn‚Äôt change anything, so I began to realize this is it, it‚Äôs always going to be this way. No matter what I do, I‚Äôll never really top the power of that song for people, and the importance of it for people. As an old guy now‚ÄïI‚Äôm going to be seventy-one in a few months‚Äïbelieve me, I‚Äôm really glad to have it. There are a lot of people who have a lot of hit records who can‚Äôt get arrested and here I am with this song and I can work and do whatever I want.MR: And the album will be re-released on vinyl. Is it fun to see the delivery system change back to vinyl these days?DM: There‚Äôs one thought that I have on that. Let‚Äôs say you go and buy a Beach Boys album that was put out in 1964, an album like The Beach Boys Today!. You get this album and you bring it home and you play it. That is the last word that Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys had on that recording. That is it. If you buy a CD of that record, somebody else has fooled with that. They‚Äôve changed the EQ slightly or they‚Äôve maybe remixed something or fooled with it. If you listen to something like ‚ÄúSalt Lake City‚Äù on the CD and then you listen to it on the vinyl, you will hear a big difference because people will screw around with these, putting them on CD. They think they‚Äôre improving them, but they never do. The original people made them the way they were supposed to be. So that‚Äôs one difference, but whether or not they pressed the new vinyl to the old tapes is the question. My sense is that they‚Äôve probably enhanced the tapes somewhat before they make these new pressings.MR: You‚Äôre absolutely right about that. But also, many times, cutting masters were used to accommodate flaws in the mixes, things they decided to play with without going back and doing more mixes. And they had to accommodate for the problems of the medium, the needle moving to the center of the eventual vinyl, where the recordings lost bass progressively. When labels moved to CD reissues, they initially used cutting masters but eventually went back to the original masters. I think that‚Äôs where all of this got confusing years later when pulling tapes and remastering for new product. DM: And if you remaster a song, you can change that song a lot. Mastering is something where you take the master tapes and pull out frequencies and enhance or change the basic feel of the bass or the mid-range or the high end. You‚Äôre not remixing, but you‚Äôre basically pulling out frequencies and making them more prominent. If you remaster even the original tapes from the way they were mastered originally, you can change the way they sound a lot.MR: When you look at American Pie, the LP has many highlights, and is considered a classic singer-songwriter album. What was it about your creative process that made the album so iconic?DM: I think Ed Freeman got a very good sound. I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it, he worked very hard on it. And I was at the top of my game. I was also up against a wall because my record company had folded. I was in the middle of making the American Pie record when Mediarts went under. They put out my first album, Tapestry. I didn‚Äôt know where I was going to go or what was going to happen to me. I was just working frantically on this album, and then all of a sudden, this white knight in the form of United Artists Records rode in and said, ‚ÄúWe have bought Mediarts and we‚Äôre going to continue this project and we‚Äôre also going to give you a big advance.‚Äù That was amazing. I lived off of that for like two years. I was able to finish it, thank God, without having to pay for it myself or whatever. One of the things you have to remember is that millions of people bought that record, or still buy it, so really, every song on there‚Äï‚ÄúBabylon,‚Äù ‚ÄúCrossroads,‚Äù ‚ÄúWinterwood,‚Äù ‚ÄúSister Fatima,‚Äù ‚ÄúVincent,‚Äù ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù‚Äïthey‚Äôre all famous to people. They know those songs. The same goes for a lot of the ‚Äúbest-ofs‚Äù I‚Äôve put out that have songs from other albums. There‚Äôs a way of getting around that big ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù roadblock and getting a lot of other songs into people‚Äôs minds as the years go by, if you‚Äôre able to survive long enough. One thing I wanted to say is this song is really worth about four or five number one records. It‚Äôs got so many parts to it and so many bits and pieces that get quoted that it‚Äôs really this big behemoth of a song. It‚Äôs not like having just one hit, it‚Äôs like having a bunch.MR: It‚Äôs not only quoted all the time but it must be nice to have contributed colloquial terms to the culture such as ‚Äúthe day the music died‚Äù through that song.DM: Yeah. There was another song on there, ‚ÄúEverybody Loves Me, Baby,‚Äù which was not produced as well as it could‚Äôve been and I always thought that could‚Äôve also been a hit song. A lot of people used phrases from that back in the seventies. It‚Äôs just a remarkable thing and I‚Äôm really thankful that I was able to do it and be part of something that is going to be remembered. Frankly, it brought so much fame to me so fast that it was really all I could handle.MR: Do you feel that having spent some creatively formative years with Pete Seeger added to how you approached music?DM: I have a number of influences and I‚Äôll tell you who they are. Josh White, Pete Seeger, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and to some degree, Buddy Holly. Those five people influenced what I did, and from there, I made a style that was an amalgam of pop, folk and rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll. If you listen to my version of ‚ÄúCrying,‚Äù I‚Äôm singing with Elvis Presley‚Äôs original group, The Jordanaires. Bob Moore, Pete Drake on the steel guitar, Ray Edenton on the acoustic guitar... He used to do all the Everly Brothers records. There‚Äôs a thing that‚Äôs connected to me and goes all the way back. As far as Pete Seger goes, getting to know him and be around him for six or seven years, it was different from all those other people because I got to see how he operated and I got to see how he did things. And I got to learn that mistakes are okay, because he made them all the time. I was a little bit of a perfectionist. I still am. I think I was more concerned about making mistakes before I knew Seeger. That was an important thing. Programming was another thing he was very good at‚Äïjuxtaposing one song to another. Also, idiomatic mastery. He didn‚Äôt have a set list that he followed every night, he made it up as he went along, and that‚Äôs what I do. I‚Äôll sing the five or six songs that people want to hear most of the time and then I‚Äôll have songs from the album that they know. Then I‚Äôll have songs that I just feel like singing that night, and then esoteric songs that they may have heard once and are worth hearing again. But I will never do the same show twice. I have never done the same line-up of songs twice ever in fifty years, and that comes from him.MR: Beautiful. Do you think it‚Äôs also because another of the skills you‚Äôve learned from him is how to read the audience?DM: Exactly. I know one singer songwriter who is very famous, I‚Äôm a fan of his and I won‚Äôt name him, but he admitted that he does two different shows‚Äïone is seventy five-minutes and one is ninety minutes and they‚Äôre always exactly the same. Some people operate that way, but I don‚Äôt. I like to read the audience and see where I can take them. A lot of times, I‚Äôll add songs and work them out with the band during sound check, we might do it for three days in a row and on the fourth day I‚Äôll use the song. I‚Äôll read whether or not the band really gets the song, and then I‚Äôll lay it on the audience at some point and that makes it new.MR: So there‚Äôs constant reinvention and adding to your track list.DM: All the time.MR: You‚Äôve had a wonderful lifetime of performance and recording, with hopefully much more to come. What are the biggest growths you‚Äôve experienced in both of those areas?DM: With this package, there‚Äôs going to be another package of the original CD with songs that were recorded during the making of the album. And there‚Äôs going to be a DVD of Don McLean at Royal Albert Hall in 1973, and a CD of the songs from that performance. That thing that I was doing back then when I became famous was really the folk Pete Seeger thing that I think evolved into doing a two-guitar thing with a great guitar player, John Platania, which we ended up doing for about fifteen years. Then I went from there to doing a trio and then having five guys on stage and being able to sing any song I want to sing and have it be any way that I want it. So that‚Äôs been the evolution I think as I‚Äôve gone along.MR: Are there things you‚Äôve discovered about yourself as the writer of ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù all these years later when you‚Äôre looking at it, maybe discovering the psychology of what went on during the writing of that song?DM: No, I knew exactly what I was writing about. I knew exactly what I was doing and I knew that it would be timeless because I know America. I hate to say that, it sounds very egotistical, but I just knew what I was doing. People say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to update it?‚Äù No, it‚Äôs exactly what it should be and it‚Äôll always be the same. It‚Äôs the same little prophetic story. It‚Äôs funny but one of the things if you want to connect my answer to that question would be to say, ‚ÄúWell, people lip-sync on stage every night, they make records with machines and not with people, the songs have become very rudimentary.‚Äù I would say, and that‚Äôs giving it a lot more credit than it deserves...not very musical, very repetitive. So music, in a sense, the way I knew it, has died. Songwriting the way we knew it is not alive as an art form anymore. That‚Äôs the part that surprises me. I never thought that would happen.MR: Well, in ‚ÄúAmerican Pie,‚Äù you wrote, ‚ÄúDrove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry.‚Äù You also grew up in a period when people were encouraged to be literate, when there wasn‚Äôt a lot of distraction except limited forms of entertainment.DM: One of the things that I have noticed and that I tell people sometimes in interviews is that when I grew up, it was very quiet. The TV wasn‚Äôt on; the radio may have been on once in a while. If the phone rang, there was no answering machine. It was important and if it rang late at night, it was really important. Not a lot of cars, not a lot of people. Under Kennedy, the population was a hundred and sixty million. Now it‚Äôs three hundred and fifty millions. In the cities and the suburbs, they‚Äôre jammed-in with cars, but in those days, it was very quiet. You were able to think. As a child, I remember being able to sit in my room or wherever I was and fantasize things and think. I think that I developed a level of concentration, as everybody else did, that was reflected in the quality of the schoolwork the kids did and the quality of the educations that people got because concentration was demanded. Now it‚Äôs very fragmented. It‚Äôs very difficult to concentrate; people are very bored. They‚Äôre very jumpy if they‚Äôre not being titillated all the time with bits and pieces of useless information. That‚Äôs what I love about ‚ÄúSatisfaction.‚Äù That song really talks about where we are now. Everyone‚Äôs looking for satisfaction and a lot of it is sexual. That‚Äôs an amazing song in terms of what the lyrics say from back in 1962 and it‚Äôs exactly appropriate from the way things are now, I think.MR: Was ‚ÄúVincent‚Äù written to that point?DM: I don‚Äôt really know how I did that song. I looked at the painting ‚ÄúStarry Night.‚Äù I read several books about Van Gogh and, of course, like everyone, I always knew his paintings. But the idea hit me to do the song. I took the imagery, I wanted to get in the song itself a swirling flow like the wind, almost. I think Ed Freeman‚Äôs beautiful string arrangement that comes in at the end of the song gives you that feeling like the wind coming through the window and rustling the curtains. This is the thing about the kind of music I want to make; it is the expression of that which is inexpressible. When you smell a flower, or when you notice a person‚Äôs scent, or their demeanor, there are so many things going on, subtle messages that are being sent to you all the time. Music is supposed to do that. It should do that, I think, especially if you‚Äôre a singer-songwriter, because you‚Äôre personally performing the song. I frankly want to say that I‚Äôve always thought of myself as a singer first and a songwriter second. If you hear ‚ÄúSince I Don‚Äôt Have You‚Äù or ‚ÄúCastles In The Air‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Mountains Of Mourne‚Äù or ‚ÄúCrying,‚Äù I‚Äôm a singer first and I happen to be lucky to have the ability to write some songs once in a while, but I‚Äôm not this ridiculously prolific songwriter who writes all the time. Steve Allen wrote five thousand songs. I write very personal songs and make very personal, eclectic recordings that fortunately, a few have become famous and made me famous, but I didn‚Äôt start out wanting to do that. I wanted to write the most beautiful, interesting things I could do and see them through. Each song is different, there‚Äôs no repetition in the styles of the songs. If you look at the hundred and fifty songs I‚Äôve recorded, they‚Äôre all different. I don‚Äôt repeat myself. I like to create wonderful babies in different styles. ‚ÄúDreidl‚Äù is different from ‚ÄúVincent.‚Äù I do this all the time. I like to change everything. MR: I‚Äôm assuming you consider yourself still learning?DM: Well, I‚Äôm trying. I‚Äôm always realizing that everything that happens to me is grist to the mill. There are thought and realizations and understanding that come along. I think that success and money can make you complacent. I do have a new album called Botanical Gardens coming out, which is a whole other thing. The songs on that are very different from songs I‚Äôve written in the past. I‚Äôm still creating and doing this.MR: What advice do you have for new artists?DM: It‚Äôs a very practical bit of advice: Find yourself a very good transactional lawyer who can tell you exactly what it is you‚Äôre signing when you sign a record contract or a contract with a manager or any kind of contract. I think a lot of young artists get so excited by the women and the applause and the fun of travel and fame. Behind the scenes, there are professional music people who know how to steal everything you have and they can do it very effectively with a contract. That‚Äôs the advice I‚Äôd give. If you make it in this business, you have to have a very good lawyer who can tell you what it is that you‚Äôre signing and what‚Äôs good about it and what‚Äôs bad about it, and then you can make an informed decision about whether or not you want to do that. I say this because you can‚Äôt change this. The covenants in a contract are like the covenants that are run with real estate, and they‚Äôre run for decades and you can‚Äôt change it once it‚Äôs locked in, so it is important to know what you‚Äôre signing. I think that would tend to avoid a lot of heartache if you‚Äôre going to make it. Of course, if you‚Äôre not going to make it, you‚Äôre not going to make it. There was a friend of mine named Nick Reynolds and he sang in The Kingston Trio. We were talking once and I said, ‚ÄúI paid some dues but not a lot of dues,‚Äù and he said, ‚ÄúWell, we paid some dues but not a lot of dues,‚Äù and then he thought for a moment and said, ‚ÄúWell, if you pay too many dues, you probably don‚Äôt have a lot of talent.‚ÄùMR: [laughs] You were friends with Jim Croce, right?DM: I really was. We were friends in college. I went to Villanova, I was a freshman and he was a junior and he was sort of the big man on campus‚Äïand that was a big campus, like five thousand students. He found me somehow because he always found everybody who could play banjo and guitar, and the word got around that I was a good guitar player and a singer and a banjo picker. He found me and started to hang around with me and I was a nobody. We got to be pretty good friends. He even got me a little radio show on the campus radio station, just something to do. I didn‚Äôt particularly like school all that much. Then later on, I became famous pretty quickly in 1969 and he was still wondering what he was going to do with his life. He thought he was going to be a psychologist. I think he had a master‚Äôs in psychology, very smart, but he had a dream. Next thing I know, there he was, the Jim Croce who everybody knows, who was not the guy who I knew in college. It was totally like a new character he created, with the cigar and the whole bit. But he was in his element, he discovered himself. He was an interesting guy, he was very smart, he was very well-educated, he was very funny. He could‚Äôve been a standup comedian without even being a musician, and he knew how to cut hit records, so he would‚Äôve been big.MR: It must have been very flattering to find out that Lori Lieberman through Gimbel and Fox wrote ‚ÄúKilling Me Softly With His Song‚Äù about you. What was it like hearing that song for the first time?DM: It was very beautiful. I‚Äôve met her and she‚Äôs very beautiful and a lovely person. She tells this story of exactly how that song came to be. You know, I‚Äôve had so many wonderful things happen to me. If I were a guy who had five Grammys and more hits, I‚Äôd almost rather have my career than anybody else‚Äôs. I‚Äôve had all this connection to music, songs written about me, and my songs recorded by many, many really major artists. It‚Äôs funny because when Obama was inaugurated the first time, my whole family and I were watching television and there was this concert and out comes [Pete] Seeger with [Bruce] Springsteen and they sing ‚ÄúThis Land Is Your Land.‚Äù Then out comes Garth Brooks who sings ‚ÄúAmerican Pie.‚Äù I thought to myself, ‚ÄúMy God, look what‚Äôs happened to me.‚Äù It‚Äôs amazing. I was a kid who had dreams and like Marilyn Monroe said, ‚ÄúThey all had dreams, but I dreamed the hardest.‚ÄùMR: You mentioned the new album. What else are you doing in the future?DM: I‚Äôm building a new life for myself. I‚Äôm recording and traveling and planning all kinds of things. We‚Äôre re-releasing various videos, the latest one is the ‚ÄúStarry Starry Night‚Äù video with Nancy Griffith recorded with a big orchestra for PBS in 1999 or 2000, and then there‚Äôs this show, the Manchester concert. That‚Äôs another one that‚Äôs been found and put out. The next thing we‚Äôre going to do are these live Cork concerts in Ireland, stadium shows that I did in the early 1980s. Then there‚Äôs also the American Troubadour documentary movie and CD, which gets shown around the world quite a bit, so there‚Äôs a video thing going on. I‚Äôm going to get the new album out next year and there are a bunch of other tracks that I recorded in Nashville for another album that I‚Äôll put somewhere. I‚Äôm not quite sure how I‚Äôm going to use that but I‚Äôll keep rolling along. There‚Äôs even a little documentary movie about the making of Botanical Gardens, which we‚Äôve got to work on a little bit and probably put on YouTube. It‚Äôs just a lot of things going on.MR: Oh yeah, forgot to ask. What advice would you give to Don McLean when he was starting out?DM: I think what I would‚Äôve done differently would be to know and enjoy other artists more. I think in my life, I was a bit too singular, a bit too detached. I‚Äôm sorry that that‚Äôs the way it is. I don‚Äôt know why that was but I was always sort of a lonesome character and I think that was probably something I shouldn‚Äôt have done.MR: But that‚Äôs not Don McLean in 2016, right?DM: No. I‚Äôm a lot more open.Transcribed by Galen HawthorneRED TAIL RING‚ÄôS GIBSON TOWN‚Äù EXCLUSIVEAccording to Red Tail Ring‚Äôs Michael Beauchamp‚ÄúLaurel and I went to a citywide vigil following the Kalamazoo shooting this past February. The vigil crowd overflowed into Bronson Park after filling up every square inch of the downtown church. The shootings had been brutal on the community‚Äïeight people shot, six of them killed, in a single night. That night, Laurel and I were so moved by the solidarity of the community, and so pissed off by the pointlessness of the killings, we walked straight home and wrote the lyrics in a few hours after basing the melody on Muddy Waters‚Äô ‚ÄòCatfish Blues,‚Äô and recorded it a week later.‚ÄùA Conversation with Sean CalleryMike Ragogna: Sean you‚Äôve been nominated for an Emmy virtually every year that the series 24 existed. What was it like being part of such a powerhouse?It is crazy to think I wrote the music for the first episode 15 years ago. No one had any idea at the time if 24 would be a success, and given that I was a very untested and unknown composer, I was frankly just trying to keep everyone happy and stay employed. I was very lucky that executive producer Joel Surnow believed in me and fought for me to be the composer of the series.It wasn‚Äôt until season 2 that I had a sense that the show was becoming more popular. I think it was the first series to release its first season on DVD in between seasons 1 and 2 and as a result our fan base grew. It was first time I ever heard the term ‚Äúbinge watching.‚Äù When social media started arriving into our culture around 2003-2004, it introduced newer avenues of communication and interaction between fans like never before.MR: Did the show‚Äôs music demands teach you any new skills and how did the music evolve over the years?SC: There was a lot of music to compose per episode, and as the minute count rose each season, I think my hair got a little grayer. The first skill I had to learn‚Äïand continue to learn‚Äïis managing the emotions of panic and so on. That might sound like a joke, but it‚Äôs not. There are times when you have huge deadlines and you know things have to get done, but on some days you have no creative ‚Äògas in the tank‚Äô, so to speak, and you can become anxious. Any kind of creativity requires being in the present moment and remaining engaged, and panic is the opposite of that. So for me the journey is about managing those moments as best you can so you can return to the work at hand, and (dare I suggest it) enjoy the ride.MR: You created the main theme music for Marvel‚Äôs Jessica Jones. Do you find there‚Äôs a difference in the creative process when writing for a series like that and let‚Äôs say Bones, which tends to be more lighthearted despite the crimes?SC: For me, the creative process is more of an ongoing path, connecting your own artistic instincts to the needs of the show you‚Äôre writing for, and trusting these instincts more and more each time. I try to strengthen this connection as I get older. You utilize the skills you‚Äôve learned along the way‚Äïwhile learning new ones as well‚Äïin order to make your most authentic contribution possible. This is true whether it‚Äôs for Bones, Jessica Jones, Homeland and another other project.The tools that you utilize in composing for each show, however, will often be different. This is the craft part of the process. With Bones, for example, I did not have a lot of experience writing more lighthearted fare‚Äï‚Äú24‚Äù certainly didn‚Äôt have much and I was very interested in exploring that kind of writing. It required a different kind of musical style and skill set using different instruments. Oddly enough, the visual effects on Bones are much more graphic and disturbing than those on ‚Äú24.‚Äù Every Bones episode features some kind of decomposing‚Äïand often disgusting looking‚Äïcorpse, but the humorous tone of the show makes these visuals accessible and less disturbing than, let‚Äôs say, Jack Bauer pulling a severed head out of a duffel bag.MR: What‚Äôs your musical training and how much of it do you find yourself utilizing for most of your work?SC: I was trained as a classical pianist as a kid. I walked to my piano lessons up the street at the home of Mrs. Hornby, who was probably pushing 90 when I walked through her door at the age of six. She had a little stuffed Beethoven doll on the piano that kind of gave me the creeps, but she was a great teacher. Later on I attended college at the New England Conservatory in Boston. All students were required to study history and theory, which was great because I had more than a few holes in my training and education growing up in Rhode Island. I had not ever heard the music of Stravinsky until I was 17 years old.At night, I played solo piano in restaurants and bars, and also for weddings with a jazz group. These jobs were a lot of fun, and that style of playing came in handy when I began composing for Jessica Jones, which incorporated the use of jazz infused sonorities and styles. I was briefly a music director for Olivia Newton-John, and did a brief stint as a musician at Disney World. I designed Cardassian spaceship warp sounds and alien phaser shots for a couple of the Star Trek television shows. Later on I worked for a computer music synthesis company which pioneered the use of the first digital recorders and samplers. Each gig, musical or not, allowed me to learn a skill set of some sort that I was able to put to use in scoring.MR: Can you give some examples of how you creatively approach each of the series you score?SC: The simplest way to describe it is that I pay close attention to what I‚Äôm feeling when reading a script or seeing a picture cut for the very first time; noticing the emotions and the energies that come in play, because in those first moments whatever comes up is completely genuine and pure, regardless of whether it makes any intellectual sense. I pay attention to those moments because that‚Äôs most likely the place from where I‚Äôll start composing. It‚Äôs connecting to an untouched truth of sorts‚Äîfrom the heart, before the analytical/problem solving part of your mind gets involved. It‚Äôs hard to describe these things and make sense, but I hope it comes across.Jessica Jones was unique because I was only allowed to look at still images from the pilot episode‚Äïnot moving picture-at first. I was put in a dark room and shown slides of Jessica Jones [Krysten Ritter], Kilgrave [David Tennant], her apartment, the street she lived on, Luke‚Äôs Bar, her neighbor‚Äôs place, the grungy hallway, the gritty streets, Trish‚Äôs apartment, everything. I couldn‚Äôt take the images offsite with me; I could only take down notes. From there, I came back to the studio and started finding the melodies that would eventually become the musical theme of the series. Seeing the still images‚Äïverses moving images‚Äïwas somehow more informative to me. Perhaps the imagination comes more into play with still images.MR: Since you‚Äôve worked on so many series and nominated for many Emmys, what keeps scoring satisfying for you at this point? Do you ever consider how far you‚Äôve come as a composer/arranger and what does that do for you?SC: My personal belief it that there is a primal satisfaction that comes from learning something new, and this almost always involves the willingness to break your comfort zones over and over again as you try out new things. This is what keeps me engaged‚Äïwhen I am not being lazy and procrastinating! In recent years, also, I have been teaching at a workshop at NYU with new composers, and I have enjoyed that very much because you meet new people and interact more with others and make new friends and colleagues along the way. You hear amazing work, new ideas, and you are inspired by it all. My Mom was a science high school teacher back in Rhode Island and so perhaps some of her energy is with me a bit‚Äïexcept I do not wear a lab coat.MR: Do you have a favorite show to work on and why?SC: The safest answer is to say that I love them all, which happens to be true, and I would hate to highlight one series at the expense of another. Having said that, when I‚Äôm having a challenging day I absolutely love watching Johnny Lee Miller as Sherlock Holmes on Elementary. His performance just brings a smile to my face. I am amazed at all the technical things actors have to go through in order to create a natural performance, and Mr. Miller‚Äôs take on such an iconic character is extraordinary. I really hope he gets an Emmy nod one day for his work on this series. And for Lucy Liu too! They are fantastic together.MR: Are you able to escape the reruns of scenes you‚Äôve been working on once you leave the office? What‚Äôs your technique for doing that?SC: I love ‚Äò80s arcade games. There is a place in downtown Los Angeles called Eighty-Two, which features the classic games from that era, along with pinball machines. Nothing shakes loose a burdensome work issue better than a few games of Robotron 2084.MR: What advice do you have for new artists?SC: Speaking from my own experiences, I find that expressing one‚Äôs truth involves connecting with and opening the heart. Doing this takes much practice, and it requires a willingness to be vulnerable, which can bring fear and discomfort. Fears arise about everything, from thoughts about how we will make a living, to relationships, to wondering if you have any talent at all. Everyone‚Äîeven the most successful among us‚Äîfeels this way from time to time.A kind of fearlessness is needed to navigate forward. This is not to say that the goal is to expunge fear or to conquer it somehow. The notion is that you can become more acquainted and connected with your fear when it arises and not fall apart. We can become more comfortable with the messiness and embarrassment of it all. It‚Äôs a tender spot that you touch over and over, and each time one does this, an inner confidence and trust is created, and from that, a genuineness and authenticity emerges in one‚Äôs art. It is most certainly not an easy path; I practice every day to bring about that kind of compassion with oneself.MR: Any advice for the younger Sean Callery?SC: Be humble and focused, keep cultivating your talent for when you‚Äôll need it on a moment‚Äôs notice, and learn learn, learn. Composers are always looking for smart and talented assistants and it‚Äôs not as easy finding the right people as one might think. Mentor / assistant relationships are good stepping stones for learning and refining your craft (I worked for Mark Snow years ago and it was an invaluable experience).Reach out gently to the people you‚Äôd like to work with. Reach out via email. Not all will respond but some do; I do eventually. Follow up every 4-6 weeks, not every day. Have patience in the process of reaching out and establishing relationships. Identify what is it about you that is unique and valuable to the person you want to work with. You are a great orchestrator perhaps? You are a whiz at Protools or some other studio skill? You are an incredible guitarist or singer maybe? These things are all valuable to know.MR: What‚Äôs in the future for you?SC: I am currently composing for a new series on ABC called Designated Survivor starring Kiefer Sutherland. It is the story about an untested lower level cabinet secretary who ascends to the Presidency after a catastrophic event. I think it‚Äôs a wonderful show and I hope people will enjoy it.JOHN BROWN‚ÄôS BODY‚ÄôS ‚ÄúWHO PAID THEM OFF‚Äù EXCLUSIVEAccording to John Brown‚Äôs Body...‚Äú‚ÄôWho Paid Them Off‚Äô is simply a song about the futility of our political system. Most of us are good law-abiding citizens who are constantly amazed at the incompetence and disingenuousness of our elected officials. The song is just a fantasy about calling people out on their bulls**t.‚ÄùA Conversation with Jeff RussoMike Ragogna: Jeff, your rock group Tonic was Grammy-nominated and sold millions of recordings. You also scored many hit television series including Fargo, Power, and The Returned, and you continue to supply the music for American Gothic, The Night Of and Legion. How can you create music for so many simultaneous programs? Do you have help?Jeff Russo: I do have a great team. 2 assistants, an orchestrator, a score coordinator, engineer/mixer, music editor, and someone who makes sure we all eat. It takes a village! The thing about working on multiple things is that it sounds like way more than it actually is at any one given moment. There are definitely overlaps, and that‚Äôs when it can get tricky, but it can also help the creative process. When I get stuck on something, I can shift over to a completely different project with a different tone, and feel and musicality, and it can shake loose new ideas. The main thing, though, is time management. It seems I have to consistently write about 6-7 minutes a day on average to keep up in the very busy times. I can be a big procrastinator so that doesn‚Äôt help. Oh, and Facebook doesn‚Äôt help either! MR: When did you begin scoring and how did you make those contacts, etc.?JR: In 2006, my band was taking a break and I was trying to figure out what to do. My dear friend, Wendy Melvoin, asked me if I wanted to hang out at [Wendy & Lisa‚Äôs] studio to see what they were doing. I already had an interest in scoring for narrative and media since I had played guitar on a movie score some years before that. I ended up never leaving their studio. They had me assisting and editing and straightening up. Then I was helping set up sessions, and before I knew it, they asked if I wanted to write a cue. At that moment I was hooked. It wasn‚Äôt too long after that when I started to try to get my own gigs. About 2 years later I met Noah Hawley when he was looking for a composer for a show he had written called ‚ÄúThe Unusuals.‚Äù MR: How do you approach each show thematically, for instance, American Gothic versus Legion? Do producers utilize you for your style or versatility?JR: I always like to start with reading the script/s and begin sketching ideas for various themes. The earlier you start the better. Once those themes are set, applying them to the underscore is easier. The two shows you mention couldn‚Äôt be more different, but the starting places are similar. I like to find the emotional center of a story and work from there. Once you figure out what the heart of a story is, working from that comes a bit faster. MR: Which shows have you scored that you feel the music impacts the most? Which shows have affected you the most personally once you‚Äôve seen how the music is sewn to the scenes?JR: Fargo, for me, has the most impact. We tend to let the music do its thing, which allows music to have a life in the show. It feels almost like another character of the show, but less of a narrator. I think both Fargo and The Night Of have had the most impact on me when I sat back and watched the music in the show and how it became part of the fabric.MR: Is there anything in your musical education that hinted at your one day scoring projects? JR: Not really. I‚Äôm mostly untrained and self taught. I remember listening to classical music with my dad as a kid, but I quickly moved on to playing drums and guitar in a rock band. The only thing I can think of is that I studied acting a bit when I was in high school with the most fascinating teacher named Tony Abeson. I think that has filtered down to what I do now with writing music for narrative. He taught about being honest in storytelling and connecting that to experience. Perhaps that helps me understand how help with telling the story. MR: Do you watch other television series and fantasize what it would be like with your music? JR: Not really. I try to just let the show be what it is. I‚Äôm thrilled at how good TV music has become.  MR: Do you have a favorite scene from a series or particular scene from any show that you‚Äôve worked on?JR: There is a scene in Fargo, year 2, that I really enjoyed working. In Episode 8, Peggy is watching an old Ronald Reagan movie on a small B&W TV, and then we sort of go into the movie. I had to create the score for the movie. That was really fun. It had to sound like a an old ‚Äò40s war picture. MR: You‚Äôre Grammy and Emmy-nominated. What does that do to your self-perception? Does anything change after each nomination?JR: It‚Äôs so great to be recognized by your peers. It really is an honor, and for a second you sit there and go, ‚ÄúWow this is awesome.‚Äù But then the self loathing comes back and I wonder how I‚Äôm going to write that next cue, and maybe I‚Äôm not the right guy for this or that and so forth. MR: How do you balance your rock career with Tonic and the demands of scoring a TV series?JR: Recently there hasn‚Äôt been a lot of time to do both. We just celebrated the 20th anniversary of the release of our first album and we did a few shows, but I have had to sit out of some this year as well. It‚Äôs a tough balance, but I try to make it happen. Weekend gigs are mostly doable, but I can‚Äôt really be away from LA for weeks at a time. Although I have written a few cues on planes and in hotel rooms. MR: What advice do you have for new artists?JR: Write, write, write. Develop a voice. Be honest. Now I wouldn‚Äôt call that career advice, but it‚Äôs true. You want to sound like you. Also, patience. Don‚Äôt try to rush. I know things must happen fast when working, but getting there takes time. MR: What about advice to yourself when you were beginning you musical career?JR: The advice my bandmates and I always tried to follow was to never look sideways. It‚Äôs hard to stay true to that, but its always best to stay focused on what‚Äôs in front of you, not coming up from behind or right next to you. MR: What are you working on now? Having seen the new shows you‚Äôve had to work on, any predictions about any of them?JR: I‚Äôm starting work on Legion, for FX. It‚Äôs always hard to predict anything about a show because you never know what people are going to think, but this show is so fantastic. I hope that people see it the same way I do. A Conversation with Us The DuoMike Ragogna: Hey Us The Duo, why not ‚ÄúWe The Duo‚Äù? Ahem.Michael Alvarado: [laughs] Well, Us The Duo started as ‚ÄúUs,‚Äù straight up. We found that people were having a hard time Googling ‚ÄúUs‚Äù because of the United States. We were like a thousand fifty on the Google search engine, so we literally added ‚ÄúThe Duo‚Äù as a way to search better, and it works. MR: You guys met on the set of a video, will you share that oh-so romantic story with all of us?MA: Definitely. I‚Äôm from North Carolina, Carissa‚Äôs from L.A. I had a college room mate who wanted to be an actor and live the dream, so he road tripped to L.A. and I went along to help him, just for the vacation. I saw on Twitter that a music video needed extras, so I showed up at this house and Carissa was there as an extra as well. It was definitely love at first sight for sure. For me, at least. It took her a little bit longer. We exchanged Twitter handles, since that‚Äôs kind of the new way of swapping numbers, and we kept in touch. When things started to get more serious, we moved to Facebook, and then when things got really serious, we moved to FaceTime. That is the social media steps of love, in case you‚Äôre wondering. MR: [laughs] Carissa. Do you concur!Carissa Alvarado: I do concur! I was playing hard-to-get in the beginning. I actually had a boyfriend at the time so I totally friend-zoned Michael. He really had to work to win me over, but it worked.MR: First of all, how did you get your initial Republic Records deal? It has something to do with a Vine video, right?MA: Exactly. After the love story happened, I moved to California and asked her to marry me, and she said yes. We got married and then Us The Duo formed. Right when we formed, we started making these little six-second covers in our living room. We had zero expectations, no intention of becoming internet famous or anything like that, but we did it, that happened, and we got like a million followers in thirty days. Then we got asked to go on Good Morning America and sing live, which we were very confused about. ‚ÄúAre you sure you want us, very normal people who just sit on the couch and watch Food Network all day to come on your show?‚Äù They were like, ‚ÄúYes, please come!‚Äù So we did. We were nervous as heck. I think it was the most nervous thing we‚Äôve ever done. After that, all these label inquiries came in through email. It was just a matter of picking, finding who was the best fit, and also figuring out how to transition our life from being very ordinary to being very fast-paced and on the forefront of people‚Äôs lives.MR: Your recording ‚ÄúNo Matter Where You Are‚Äù was featured in Book Of Life. How did that come together?MA: We wrote the song as our wedding vows. We put the video of us singing it at our wedding online and it kind of went viral. You guys covered it‚ÄïHuffington Post put it up; Business Insider and AOL put it on their home pages. All these things created this buzz and I think that‚Äôs what got it onto Fox‚Äôs radar. Somebody at the label did help make that connection a little stronger and get us a meeting inside, but really, Fox called us. Again, it was one of those situations where we‚Äôre sitting at home and we get a phone call from Fox that‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúHey, we want to use your song in our movie, can you come to our office in the next hour?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, let me get dressed ASAP!‚Äù It was a very big surprise for us, that‚Äôs for sure.MR: Carissa, how did this snowballing success affect your relationship and the music‚Äôs creativity?CA: It all happened so fast, it was a little tougher, I have to admit. We had a rough patch in our relationship just because it got hard to balance out our career and our relationship at the same time. We‚Äôve learned a lot and we‚Äôre at a good place now where we‚Äôre making sure that we do have time for date night. We make time for our relationship and we do remember that is the priority over everything else. Our career is very important and special to us, but we realize in those difficult times, personally and in our relationship, that we always need to remember that our relationship is the top priority no matter what.MR: And, of course, there‚Äôs the Oprah incident.MA: [laughs] Yeah, it was the craziest thing. We were playing that song live onstage, and Oprah‚Äôs kind of mysterious, she never really announces where she‚Äôs going to be or what‚Äôs going to happen, it‚Äôs just like, ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôll show up! Be ready in case,‚Äù and that‚Äôs what happened. We were playing the song and she just walks onstage right between us and gives us this big bear hug and then we talk about the song a little bit to the crowd and it was one of those ‚Äúpinch me‚Äù moments.MR: You kind of share an audience with Pentatonix. To me, that makes total sense because of the positive nature of your music and the positive nature of your personalities. The Pentatonix tour kind of broke Us The Duo even bigger, wasn‚Äôt it?CA: I would say so. They‚Äôve got such wonderful fans that really do latch on to people they like, and like you said, since we‚Äôre so similar to them and we started in the same social media space as well. I think people see that and gravitate towards us. We‚Äôve gotten a lot of their fans that are new fans of us coming to see our tour saying, ‚ÄúWe saw you on the Pentatonix tour and we loved you so we wanted to support you.‚Äù It‚Äôs such a blessing that that all worked out and it‚Äôs even better that we‚Äôve gotten even closer to the band because they‚Äôre such sweet people, they‚Äôve got great hearts and they‚Äôre just so friggin‚Äô talented. We are so inspired, watching them every night on their tour.MR: Did you learn anything about stagecraft or performance from them?CA: Oh, absolutely. Other than them being geniuses vocally, it showed us that we needed to practice and practice and practice as much as we can to get our voices up to the best of their ability. I think their performance and how they talk on stage really inspired us and we‚Äôre trying to put that into our performance more, talking to the audience and making them feel like they‚Äôre welcome, we‚Äôre just chilling in our living room and they‚Äôre all friends of ours. We‚Äôve incorporated that into our performances as well.MR: I‚Äôm imagining you benefited from initially having a major label though now you‚Äôre releasing the new album, Just Love, differently. It‚Äôs very hard to say goodbye to a major label, and this was your decision, not theirs. How has that affected your career since the parting?MA: Imagine two people who have always dreamed of being musicians since they were little kids. For them, a record deal is like the cream of the crop. That‚Äôs it, you‚Äôve made it. We always had our eyes on that, and until we got that we thought we weren‚Äôt successful, so that‚Äôs exactly what we did, and we signed the deal. At the time, they were the number one label in the US, so it seemed to make sense. We went through the motions and the formulas and we realized it wasn‚Äôt everything we thought it was. It‚Äôs not just our label in particular, I think it‚Äôs labels in general. Basically, we had the harsh reality that a label is a bank. You sign with them in order to get their investment on you, and they use their team of people to decide what‚Äôs best for your career and there comes a point where you just have to say, ‚ÄúOkay, whatever you say,‚Äù because they‚Äôre paying for it. Over time, as entrepreneurs like Criss and I are, who came through the social media space and have ten million followers that we garnished ourselves, it‚Äôs hard to be forced to listen to opinions above you over and over and over. What happened was we got creatively dry. We were on a label with Drake and Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift, so it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to get priority or the same funding or the same say,‚Äù so we kind of just had to surrender ourselves to whatever the machine told us to do, so we hit that wall. ‚ÄúOkay, we have ten million followers who believe in us, but we‚Äôre not able to do exactly what we want to do, so why don‚Äôt we just try going out on our own?‚Äù That is a very scary decision, especially for Carissa and I and our manager because we didn‚Äôt necessarily realize how much the label does in the background, like the logistical things, setting up your merch store and shipping around the world, distribution and royalty points and all of these things now fall on us, but it was a risk we were willing to take in order to put out the music we wanted and own those rights. That‚Äôs kind of where it came from. We left in December of last year; it was a very smooth parting, there‚Äôs no bad blood or anything. The next week, we flew to Nashville, booked a studio and a couple players that we knew, and we all just sat in a room. We stared each other in the face and tracked these songs that Criss and I wrote and pressed record. It was the most creative sparking inspirational thing that we‚Äôd ever experienced and we needed that for our souls as musicians. We were just starving for it. This album, Just Love, was a creative burst of whatever needed to come out or else we would‚Äôve exploded. The timing of it couldn‚Äôt have been better.CA: Yeah, mainly just the creative freedom at that point, putting out music that we wanted to put out from the heart and was very personal to us. I really think that the fans noticed the change and the shift in our music and what we were putting out when we did sign to the label. So I think when we started putting our own stuff out again, fans will really love and know and understand that that is us and who we are.MR: One of the coolest things you ever did was the ‚Äú2015 Top Hits In 3.5 Minutes.‚Äù Which are your favorite segments from that medley?MA: That medley is one of the most painstaking things we‚Äôve put together. This is our second one and each one has luckily gone viral, but we spend like two weeks picking the right songs, figuring out the right key‚ÄïI think that medley is in five different keys‚Äïtrying to showcase Criss‚Äô voice, making sure I can beat box and play piano. I think my favorite segment is when everything drops, the beat box comes in for the first time, the piano‚Äôs hitting hard and Criss is wailing this high note, I think it‚Äôs right when we hit the One Direction section. We‚Äôve been doing this live on the Pentatonix run as the last song and everybody goes crazy right after the ending because we do this jazz/blues walk down. It‚Äôs added a few standing ovations. We‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúAre you sure? We‚Äôre just two people on stage.‚Äù It‚Äôs a powerful thing when you look up and see ten thousand people standing in front of you for a pop medley. It‚Äôs really cool.MR: Do you still have some perks you got from Republic? For instance, do you have the same touring manager, or did that change when you left?MA: When we left, we didn‚Äôt have to use any of their in-house people. One of the downside of a label is they have an office with a section for each thing‚Äïmarketing, publicity, whatever‚Äïand you‚Äôre stuck with that. It‚Äôs free, of course you‚Äôre going to take it. But when we left, we pretty much hired individual superstars on each platform. We scouted and had meetings and said, ‚ÄúWhy would you make a great publicist for us?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat about you as a booking agency? What‚Äôs going to make you fit with a social media band? How are you going to understand our audience and get us the best shows?‚Äù So we did that for maybe a month after we left. At this point, we‚Äôve built almost a completely new team minus our original manager who is my college buddy who‚Äôs been there since the beginning. We kept him, but everybody else at this point is pretty much brand new.MR: And you acquired Jim Flammia who also handles Darlingside, so as soon as he pitched you to me, I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in.‚ÄùCA: Yay!MA: That was one of those things where he took a chance on us, because we know he normally doesn‚Äôt work in our genre, but we could tell by just a couple of conversations on the phone that he believed in us and understood what we were going for, so it was a good fit.MR: Once you enter a mix like that, if you don‚Äôt get superstardom, at the very least, you get fulfillment.MA: Totally.MR: So Us The Duo. What advice do you have for new artists?CA: We love answering this question. We would say a few things: Staying consistent, like what we do with our Vines. We found something that wasn‚Äôt being done, we found a niche, something special, and we stayed consistent with it. We did it every single day, no matter how much we didn‚Äôt want to film a vine, we filmed a vine. We switched out our shirts to make it look like we had a humungous closet; we kept doing that and in thirty days, we got a million followers. We were on to something, so we just knew that consistency was key and we kept that up. Another big thing is social media. That‚Äôs an obvious answer because it‚Äôs such a huge and important tool. We use it and we will never stop using it because that‚Äôs what we are, we‚Äôre ‚Äúsocial media stars,‚Äù so we have to keep that going. That‚Äôs such an important tool that I think any artist should use and benefit from to get seen around the world. Now we have fans from different countries begging us to come play a show wherever they are. It‚Äôs just amazing, the power that social media has. Michael, do you have anything to add to that?MA: Hmm. I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt be afraid to be bold in what your specific talent is. At a lot of our VIP meet-and-greets when we do these shows, a young girl or a young guy carries in a guitar and asks us to sign it and says, ‚ÄúWhat advice do you have for me as I try to be a musician?‚Äù We always say that one thing: You have to figure out what you do best. Maybe other people do it but be confident that you‚Äôre the best at it and just own it. Criss and I were so scared of the social media label at first. We were like, ‚ÄúOh man, people are calling us ‚ÄòThose singers from Facebook‚Äô or ‚ÄòThat couple from Snapchat.‚Äô We want to be ‚ÄòThat couple from the Billboard charts,‚Äô‚Äù but then we began to own it. You know what? They‚Äôre still stopping us and recognizing us, that is such a cool thing. Now we‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôre that couple from Facebook, thanks for saying hey!‚Äù The last thing I think would be constantly practice. For Criss and I, that‚Äôs always setting up the iPhone, pressing ‚Äúrecord,‚Äù staring at it, playing to it and then watching it back. There‚Äôs something so powerful and meticulous in watching your videos back.MR: There‚Äôs really good value in that, and I don‚Äôt know if everybody does that. I think some artists don‚Äôt like to look at themselves, but you guys were blessed with photogenia.MA: Aww.CA: [laughs]MR: But I want to ask you, Us The Michael, how much money would it take for you to cut off your man-bun? There has to be a number. Come on.CA: [laughs] No!MA: I think that answers the question. I would probably not even have it, but the wifey wants me to keep it around.CA: I love it!MA: Happy wife, happy life. I‚Äôm a man-bunner.MR: Have you ever talked about doing a joint venture with Pentatonix, maybe a record?MA: Ooh.CA: We haven‚Äôt really talked about it but we would absolutely be open to it.MA: We sing a song with them on their tour, all seven of us stand in a horseshoe and sing a full song, which is so nice of them to even bring us up on their set and even do that. But I don‚Äôt see why there‚Äôs no reason we shouldn‚Äôt hop in the studio with them. That‚Äôs a great idea.MR: Thank you. My spider senses are telling me they‚Äôll respond positively.MA: I think so. You might be onto something. We‚Äôll have to give you some credit if it happens.MR: Ha! Oh, you know how it starts? Get together with them to write a few songs.MA: There you go. I like that.MR: What‚Äôs the future of the duo?MA: The last two and a half years have been hodgepodge because we‚Äôve been going where everybody wanted us to go. So now we left the label, we hopped on tour‚Äïa hundred and fifty days of touring this year, it‚Äôs been total madness, so we haven‚Äôt even had a chance to think about it yet. Everything restarts when we get back from PTX Fall tour, right around Thanksgiving. MR: ...don‚Äôt forget the songwriting and recording!MA: [laughs] We‚Äôre going to go on vacation for like a week and be a couple again, and then we‚Äôre going to start back where we came from, spending a few months just honing our social media accounts again. We‚Äôre going to make videos, cover videos, new arrangements, we‚Äôre going to write again and just kind of go back to the basis of it all. Then we‚Äôll hit Europe on a tour as Us The Duo, we‚Äôre going to go to Asia, which they don‚Äôt know yet and I‚Äôm super excited about because Criss is Filipina, so every time we show up in the Philippines it‚Äôs like the queen has come home, it‚Äôs the craziest thing. That‚Äôs kind of the broad plan, bringing back the social media, doing more of a European and Asian tour and figuring it out from there.MR: Us The Carissa, what did he leave out?MA: [laughs]CA: See that‚Äôs good, you knew. Eventually, obviously, a family. I think that is starting to come across our minds as we‚Äôve been married for four years now, going on five. That‚Äôs definitely in the future, I don‚Äôt know how soon or how far away. That‚Äôs what he left out of course.MR: Then you‚Äôd better get on that PTX collaboration really quickly.MA: That‚Äôs child support right there.MR: [laughs] I‚Äôm all out of questions. Miss Carissa, could you ask Us The Michael a question?CA: Oh this is fun! If you could vacation anywhere in the world right now, where would it be, Michael?MA: I would go to the British Virgin Islands and get a hut on the beach and do absolutely nothing but sit there with a guitar and a beer and you.MR: And your man-bun.CA: And your man-bun!MA: It might be a little sandy, but it‚Äôll still be there.MR: And Michael, what would you ask Us The Carissa?MA: Oh! If you had to quit Us The Duo tonight...MR: [gasps!]MA: What would do tomorrow? Anything in the world goes, but Us The Duo doesn‚Äôt exist.CA: I would take on fashion and get into modeling and acting.MA: So you don‚Äôt even need me.CA: Yeah. [laughs]MR: See, I thought the word ‚Äúconvent‚Äù was going to come into the mix, but I guess not.CA: [laughs]MR: Almost forgot to ask, what is your favorite song on the new album and why?CA: I would say my favorite song would have to be ‚ÄúSafe,‚Äù just because it‚Äôs something we‚Äôve never done before, recording-wise. We did it completely live in the studio, one take, and that is exactly how it sounds on the album. We didn‚Äôt tune anything, we didn‚Äôt add anything. It was just a very raw and real moment, and also the fact that it‚Äôs such a relatable song right now in this crazy world that we live in. Whenever we perform it onstage, I get pretty emotional. That one‚Äôs my favorite. I just think it‚Äôs such a beautiful, beautiful song.MA: For me, I‚Äôm going to go with ‚ÄúStop (Just Love)‚Äù for three reasons: Number one, I get to use really jazzy chords in there, and I feel kind of rebellious as a pop artist because it‚Äôs all those things I would show to the label and they‚Äôd go, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs a little too jazzy for pop,‚Äù so I was just like, ‚ÄúWhatever, we don‚Äôt have any rules; jazz chords.‚Äù Number two, we changed the key completely between the chorus and the verse, which is something I‚Äôve always wanted to do just as an arranger. Number three: It‚Äôs a good song at showcasing Carissa and I individually as well as together. She sings the first verse and kind of does the sassy, cool thing, and then I get to try something in the second verse and then we come together in the chorus and harmonize. I think it‚Äôs just a cool overall song that says, ‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre Us The Duo, we‚Äôre independent, we‚Äôre at it again, check it out.‚ÄùTranscribed by Galen HawthorneA Conversation with Sarah SimmonsMike Ragogna: Sarah, you‚Äôve been pretty busy after participating in The Voice. Before we talk about your new album, please would you catch us up on what you‚Äôve been doing?Sarah Simmons: Within a week after The Voice, film producer Marty Bowen contacted me, and invested in my album. Marty sent me to Nashville, TN, where I recorded with Marshall Altman at House of Blues, Studio A. Then I moved to LA where I began recording music for TV and film. I have put together a band and have been touring for the last year. We are currently touring for my album, Freedom, which has currently landed us in New York for my CD release. We will be on tour until fall 2017.MR: The title of your new album is Freedom. Are you feeling free these days? From the artist‚Äôs perspective, how does that title apply to this group of songs?SS: Actually, yes, currently touring all around the country seeing the world, and meeting beautiful people. When I wrote this album I didn‚Äôt know how much of an effect the songs would have on me. Every time I sing the words I get a new perspective. The overall expression of what I want my music to stand for‚ÄïI want people to listen and walk away free. I think it is so important to release yourself of people, places and things that are hindering you from your potential, happiness and well-being. This album is a depiction of my personal journey overcoming burdens holding me from personal freedom.MR: How did Freedom come together and please can you take us on a tour of the album‚Äôs material?SS: Each song reflects a time in my life. They are a consensus of my growth and personal experiences of different situations, and also just the realities of life. I have always loved every single genre of music, and I think you will hear that on my album. The music is a mixture of the music I grew up listening to mixed with my own adaptation and my own style.MR: What was the studio experience like and which songs became dearer to you or upgraded significantly as they were being recorded? SS: I will never forget my experience recording my first album. Marshall truly pushed me to great heights. It was emotionally challenging, but freeing at the same time. When I was behind the glass listening to the musicians recording my music, I realized my dreams were becoming a reality. ‚ÄúStaring At The Sun,‚Äù was the song that truly brought me to my knees. The song is a depiction of loss and how we deal with it. It was written in memory of my close friend, Sean Reeder. Going to the studio and recording it absolutely blew my mind. That was freeing. Even after two years of his passing it had felt like a day still hadn‚Äôt passed.MR: How did being in theater at an early age affect your taste in music and which artists influenced you as you grew up? SS: Being in theater at an early age gave me an understanding of the overall production of a genuine performance. I absolutely love musical theater and actually love the acting part just as much as the singing. It also gave me an appreciation for all styles of music. Between my Grandmother‚Äôs oldies influence, and my Dad‚Äôs love for rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll, coupled with the musical theater music I grasped a diverse appreciation for all music and performance arts. The artists that truly inspired me are: Etta James, Billie Holiday, Rosemary Clooney, Led Zeppelin, Elvis Presley, Stevie Nix, Eddie Vedder, and Lisa Gerrard just to name a few.MR: Rumor has it you got a guitar at 15 and started writing songs. Any truth to that rumor and if so, can you remember what inspired see of those songs?SS: Rumor is true! I always wanted another instrument to accompany myself. Dad gave me my first guitar at 15 years old. My Dad had really inspired someone in recovery. This person was so moved by father‚Äôs ability to play; so much that he passed his guitar down to my Dad upon leaving rehab. This came to be my first guitar. With so much going on in my life at a young age, there was always inspiration to draw from.MR: What advice do you have for new artists?SS: If you are serious about it you can never give up. This business is for the people who never give up. It is for people who sacrifice their time and energy to do what you ultimately love. Sometimes the pay off is far in the horizon, but the risk is worth the reward. At times it may seem like you‚Äôre far away from success but your closer than you think. Remember it‚Äôs about the journey not the destination. MR: Can you remind us about your wild audition for The Voice?SS: It was an incredible experience. I had never expected to have all the judges turn around, that was beyond my comprehension. I couldn‚Äôt believe that four judges were facing me. What was funny is that I was actually really calm and not nervous at all. It could‚Äôve been the chamomile tea that I drank before I went on stage or just the prayer I said before walking out. I will never forget that.MR: Sarah, I think you were robbed! What‚Äôs your theory on why you and Judith Hill were eliminated on The Voice when everyone went nuts about you both?SS: Thank you so much for the compliment. I truly believe it was absolutely perfect the time that I left. You don‚Äôt have to win the show to have a successful career. The show is honestly an experience, not your career. I believe that I probably wouldn‚Äôt have been able to release an album of my own personal music this soon had I gone further. I am so grateful for the experience with the show, the amazing friends that I made for a lifetime, and the stepping-stones that the show afforded me.MR: In a perfect world, what does Sarah Simmons‚Äô future look like? And do you have any goals beyond music that you need to get to?SS: I can‚Äôt say for sure, but my ultimate goal is to move people with my music. It seems my future is a reflection of what I‚Äôm doing now. People have expressed to me that my music has helped them, and push them through barriers to make a change. This is my goal, to expand the quantity and number of people I can reach through song. A Conversation with Bob HolzMike Ragogna: Bob, the title of your new album, A Vision Forward, suggests this project is a commitment to change or progress. Was that the mission?Bob Holz: I looked around myself at what most people like musically and how they perceive popular music. I decided that the title would reflect a desire to create fresh and forward thinking musical ideas. The mission was to produce music that respects the tradition of jazz and at the same time attempts to break new ground.MR: The musicians that appear on A Vision Forward include Randy Brecker, Mike Stern, and Larry Coryell. How did you decide which guests to include and what was the recording process with which you captured their performances?BH: Since the compositions owe a lot to the fusion movement of the 1970‚Äôs, what better way to bring them to life than to have some of the key participants involved? The process was natural since I grew up around that musical period. I selected the players based on their ability to make a tune outstanding and used traditional recording techniques.MR: What did each guest bring to the project?BH: They brought their respective wealth of knowledge coupled with a willingness to try something new. For example, Mike Stern used his signature sound on the tune ‚ÄúMoving Eyes‚Äù to create a unique flow both rhythmically and harmonically.MR: How do you keep an objectivity when you produce your own recordings? BH: I try to identify the strong points, both compositionally and performance wise and then I allow the process to nurture both. That process includes the sound engineering aspect. I also know when to take a break and come back with a refreshed perspective. MR: How do you currently write songs? How collaborative are you with others when it comes to composing? How much improvisation goes into that part of the creative process?BH: I write at the piano. Once I have a draft chart, I meet with another piano player who helps me fine tune. When writing, I immediately have an idea in my mind as to how the melody should fit with the changes. As I craft and fine tune the composition begins to take shape. It‚Äôs more of crafting an initial idea verses improvisation. I leave plenty of room in the tunes for the players to improvise.MR: What influences from the past did you take into this step forward? Are there any artists, even beyond jazz, that will always influence your creative outlook?BH: My early exposure to jazz included listening to Sun Ra and Charles Mingus. I have also been profoundly influenced by many of the 1960‚Äôs rock and folk artists.MR: Which recordings on A Vision Forward do you feel represent some sort of breakthrough or leap in creativity for you?BH: To me, Steve Weingart‚Äôs synthesizer and electric piano part in ‚ÄúThe Stand Up‚Äù exemplifies a creative leap forward in jazz improvisation.MR: Was there anything unusual that you applied to the recording process, maybe some new effects or new approach to recording your music?BH: For the mastering process we used a new state of the art platform which created unique cymbal textures and helped me to get a more individualized sound.MR: What is jazz to you these days, the current state of it and where you think it might be heading?BH: I think there is a wealth of great jazz coming out. I‚Äôm pleased to see many young players embracing jazz and fusing it with other musical styles. I have an optimistic view of the future of jazz and fusion.MR: Speaking of the future, are there any young artists out there who you admire, maybe enough to want to help with their careers?BH: I admire pianist Joey Alexander. The idea of producing recordings for up and coming artists is something I‚Äôve been very interested in. I expect to follow that interest in the future.MR: What advice do you have for new artists?BH: I suggest one researches the great musical artists of the past. Listening to many different types of music can build a knowledge base. On stage, always listen. Keep your ears tuned to what‚Äôs going on at all times. If you listen and play musically with good feel, you‚Äôll build a positive reputation in the business.MR: You know what include another vision forward for you? Dropping drums and switching to saxophone. Tempting, right?BH: As I mentioned, I‚Äôm very interested in producing projects for up and coming artists. As for branching out and playing other instruments, look for Bob Holz to record some vibes in the future.MR: As an established jazz artist, from your perspective, where is your place currently in the field and where is it heading?BH: I‚Äôm a creative artist first and I don‚Äôt want to stick to any formulas in my compositions. That being said, my place is to maintain a good work ethic regarding the composition and performance of my music. I want to create music that touches the listener on an emotional level. My hope is that my music will evolve and change for the better. A Conversation with Matt RossMike Ragogna: You have a new venture, One River School of Art + Design. What gave you the idea and how did it come together? Matt Ross: Let‚Äôs face it. Art education is broken in America and has been so for many years. One River dissected what was wrong with art education and developed a new approach that has made learning art fun and cool. And along the way we developed a plan to ‚Äútransform art education in America‚Äù. Ragogna: What made you franchise One River School of Art + Design as opposed to outright owning and expanding?Ross: We are actually doing both. Our goal is to find the right operators across America and also identify select markets for company-owned units. It‚Äôs a big country and we want to bring our service everywhere. What better way to grow than partnering with franchisees in their home towns? We are looking for people who have a passion for the visual arts but also have the skill set to build and lead a great business.Ragogna: What kinds of courses does the school offer and what kind of faculty are you involving, and what are the teaching methods and classes?Ross: Over the last five years we have refined our proprietary methods called ‚ÄúArt Shuffle‚Äù and ‚ÄúArt Focus‚Äù into ‚Äúa new direction in art education.‚Äù Our courses are designed for people of all ages and delivered in a state of the art facility that feels like you are in Soho.Ragogna: What should a student expect to have learned after ‚Äúgraduating‚Äù from One River School of Art + Design? Ross: How to appreciate making and consuming art. They should have the ability to determine what is well done, what is relevant and what is potentially important. They will also likely continue making art for the rest of their lives because we provide a fun experience first that fosters the enjoyment of making art. They will take this with them.Ragogna: Does One River offer any artistic subjects or approaches that are unique to the school or perhaps are better than our traditional school system?Ross: Another innovative aspect is the school‚Äôs focus on Contemporary Art. One River has patterned its lesson plans on the last 50 years of art making and is tapping into a growing interest in the work of living artists as subject matter for its curricula. This provides for a fresh approach and produces vibrant artistic outcomes that are in line with today‚Äôs art world. We also have pioneered some innovative courses in digital arts and using the latest technology in our classroom that is largely reserved for university level work.Ragogna: What is your own history with art and while we‚Äôre at it, music?Ross: I am not a visual artist but I create everyday. When I was young, I was in the performing arts and like a lot of kids I stopped when I didn‚Äôt find a local space to nurture that interest. I learned to play music and have written and recorded. I have also developed a couple of screenplays and dabble in photography and video. At the end of the day, my creative energy gets applied to business and branding and that has provided some great rewards for me.I also spent 20 years in radio working for and running some of the most important radio brands in the country, including Q104.3 and Hot 97 in New York.Ragogna: Matt, you were also an early employee of School of Rock. What was the origin of the School of Rock and what was your role?Ross: I was hired in 2005 and ran the company until mid 2010. We went through a dynamic growth period and I am proud of the work I did there and remain a partner in the business today. Paul Green was the Founder and created the concept and many people believe he was the inspiration for the Jack Black character. Just so we are clear, One River is not owned or endorsed by School of Rock.Ragogna: Both art and music always seem to be the first cuts made when there are budget concerns. Since it‚Äôs been proven that a child‚Äôs healthy development needs to include art and music in the very least for hemispheric balance in the brain, why don‚Äôt we acknowledge this? Is this in the same category as climate change denying?Ross: LOL‚Ä¶I love it. I just read an insanely powerful article in the New York Times about climate change. My guess is the denial is not that bad‚Ä¶climate change will destroy the Earth. Not having art and music will destroy the soul...but you can still be alive and spend your time watching sports on 75 sports channels.Ragogna: What advice do you have for visual artists?Ross: Make a lot of work. Have fun. Don‚Äôt try to be too serious. Get to know as many other artists as possible. Continue to educate yourself. And most of all, it is not a straight line to economic success but it may be your purpose in life so be sure to give it your all. We need artists to keep our world in balance."
38,POLITICS,What Happens When We Accuse Muslims In Politics Of Having Extremist Ties,"Feyaad Allie, ContributorGraduate of Dartmouth College writing about politics",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-happens-when-we-accuse-muslims-in-politics-of_us_57bff96ee4b06384eb3efb2b,"Earlier this week, news headlines began popping up regarding Hillary Clinton‚Äôs top campaign aide Huma Abedin. This time they",2016-08-26,"Huma Abedin, aide to Hillary Clinton, was accused of having ties to extremism.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bfff311600002b00bfe96e.jpg?cache=8lNfmdBYTS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Earlier this week, news headlines began popping up regarding Hillary Clinton‚Äôs top campaign aide Huma Abedin. This time they weren‚Äôt about her marriage to former representative Anthony Weiner (D-NY) who resigned after a Twitter sexting scandal. The headlines were concerning whether Abedin had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and ‚Äúworked at a radical Muslim journal for dozens of years.‚Äù While sources fact-checked these statements and determined their falsity, politicians who support Donald Trump have used this ‚Äúextremist connection‚Äù rhetoric against Abedin. Sean Duffy (R-WI) during a CNN interview on Thursday insisted that Human Abedin had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Trump supporters have used these statements as a way to undermine Clinton‚Äôs campaign by slandering one of her top advisors. Similarly, when London‚Äôs Mayor Sadiq Khan was running for office, his opponent Zac Goldsmith accused Khan of having ties with extremists in Britain. While this did not cost Khan the election, it did tap into anti-Muslim feelings amongst voters and further exacerbated Islamophobic opinionsThis growing practice of politicians accusing Muslim political figures of having links to extremist groups begs the question: What are the consequences of falsely accusing our top Muslims in politics of having connections to extremist organizations?Rhetoric claiming a Muslim‚Äôs link to extremism exacerbates Islamophobia. Whether it‚Äôs in news headlines or coming directly from politicians, discussions of a Muslim political figures‚Äô connection to extremists‚Äîtrue or not‚Äîhas an impact on how the public views Muslims. And given the heightened tensions in the West regarding terrorist attacks from the Islamic State on their soil, the public is eager to believe another reason why they cannot trust Muslims, especially those that are involved in politics. With Muslims in politics facing defamation, there is a clear disincentive for more Muslims to seek opportunities in government. Muslims are severely underrepresented in political positions in the Western world. Currently, in Congress Muslims account for 0.4% of total members. And with Islamophobia already relatively high, it is an uphill battle for a Muslim to hold a prominent political position without controversy. These instances of alleging that a Muslim in politics has connections to extremists makes it more difficult for Muslims to be successful in government; therefore, discouraging more Muslim representation.In order to build trust and cooperation between the Muslim community and the government, we need to stop alienating Muslims by slandering politicians and government officials who represent them. Muslim communities need both allies and individuals of their faith to advocate for them in government. Yet, when these individuals are labeled as extremist sympathizers they lose their ability to represent and work for Muslims communities. Recently, more efforts have been made to positively showcase Muslims in government. In February, the White House featured stories of Muslim public servants highlighting that despite their experiences with discrimination they are dedicated to working for the American people. Although this is a step in the right direction, it does not counter the mudslinging against Muslims running for public office or those who work for politicians running for office.If the West expects to tackle Islamophobia it cannot do so without having Muslims in public office and top government roles. But the West also cannot expect to see Muslims in these roles if they regularly face smearing from opponents that claim they are linked to extremist groups. Sadiq Khan may have still won London‚Äôs mayoral election; however, there is little hope for the success of Muslims, such as Huma Abedin, in politics if we continue down this path of false accusations and ridiculous conspiracies.Follow Feyaad Allie on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/feyaadallie"
