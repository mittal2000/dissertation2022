A swift backlash overwhelmed Pocatello/Chubbuck School District 25 after Dalene Bowden, a so-called lunch lady at Irving Middle School, revealed she'd been fired on Dec. 18, allegedly for giving a $1.70 hot lunch to a 12-year-old girl who couldn't afford it. Bowden said she offered to pay for the meal, but that her supervisor was still displeased.She was placed on unpaid leave for two days. Then, a termination letter from the district's director of human resources arrived, which Bowden posted to Facebook. The letter accused Bowden of stealing school property and inaccurately recording transactions. Superintendent Doug Howell said he's forbidden from discussing personnel decisions but told the Idaho State Journal that the district has never fired an employee over a single infraction. ""I admits [sic] I broke the rules, but I'm not apologizing and I would do exactly the same thing again regardless of the consequences,"" Bowden wrote on a GoFundMe page she started to ""get [a] lawyer to change the law.""Donations poured in, and Bowden had raised nearly $20,000 as of late Thursday afternoon. A petition denouncing Bowden's firing had earned more than 88,000 signatures by the same time.The district circulated a press release on Wednesday saying that Bowden was welcome to return to the lunchroom.""In the spirit of the holidays, Superintendent Howell advises that the District has been in communication with Ms. Bowden extending an opportunity for her to return to employment with the District,"" the statement reportedly said. It appears that the district may not have handled this face-saving measure properly, though. Bowden wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday that no one from the school has spoken to her about employment and that she isn't sure if she would feel comfortable working there again. ""If I take my job back I feel i will be walking on eggshells with the school district. Nothing is going to be the same,"" she wrote. ""What do I do the next time a kid is hungry?"" "

Love compels us to stand with our Muslim family, to have their backs. When they come for our Muslim family, they come for all of us,"" said the Rev. Jacqui Lewis, Senior Minister of New York's Middle Collegiate Church, while delivering the letter.“This is a singular moment in time,"" she continued. ""Massacres and mayhem, vitriol and violence like I have never witnessed in my lifetime, all in the name of God. This is a singular moment in time, when good people of every faith join their voices in one freedom song: We will not stand by while our Muslim brothers and sisters -- our policewomen, doctors, teachers and neighbors -- are targeted with hatred because of the violent actions of a few.""The letter, which was organized by the Presbyterian Church (USA)-affiliated Auburn Seminary, comes amid increasing violence and threats against Muslims across the country. Since the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, The Huffington Post has documented at least 73 incidents targeted at Muslims in the U.S. and Canada that have ranged from armed protests outside mosques to attacks on Muslim families' homes. In one incident, a woman wearing a hijab in Florida was shot at and nearly run off the road while leaving her local mosque. The date of delivery has a special significance for Christians and some Muslims -- the Prophet Muhammad's birthday, which follows the lunar Islamic calendar, falls on Christmas Eve this year.“This is confirmation that we are not alone in the struggle to reclaim our country, to bring it back to the country that it has always been -- loving and warm -- and that the Statue of Liberty stands out there to welcome all,"" said Debbie Almontaser, president of the Muslim Community Network, when she received the letter. “I want to thank you very much on behalf of the American Muslim community, who will see this as a gesture of love and respect and admiration.""Read the letter, which will also be distributed to Muslim communities in Los Angeles, Denver, Atlanta, Detroit, Orlando and San Francisco, below.America is not America without Muslims. As people of faith and moral conscience, we promise to defend our Muslim brothers and sisters from attack, to speak up when they are maligned, and to support them with our voices, our actions, and our bodies.Editor's note: Former HuffPost Executive Editor of Global Spirituality and Religion helped organized the letter campaign, and is the Senior Vice President for Public Engagement at Auburn Seminary.Also on HuffPost:"

""Looking for a Taser, armed offender."" The dispatcher repeatedly calls for officers with Tasers to respond to the scene. ""Anybody close yet?... Asking for a Taser for armed offender with a knife."" On Oct. 20, 2014, police said they caught McDonald, 17, breaking into vehicles at a trucking yard. Officers followed the teen as he walked down the street, armed with a weapon.An officer says on police radio that McDonald popped the tire of a police car before walking toward a Burger King restaurant. Then an officer opens fire.""Shots fired by police. Get an ambulance over here,"" an officer says one minute later.Police dashcam video released last month -- the day Officer Jason Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder in the killing -- doesn't match the police department's initial narrative of the shooting. The footage, which a judge ordered city officials to release, shows Van Dyke shooting the teen repeatedly, even after he fell to the ground. But none of the dashcam footage contained any audio.The killing has prompted a storm of protest, the firing of Chicago police superintendent Garry McCarthy and a federal probe into the city's troubled police force. Protesters are calling for Mayor Rahm Emmanuel to resign.Black Lives Matters activists also continue to call for more police accountability. The activists shut down the Mall of America on Wednesday and disrupted holiday travel at Minneapolis and San Francisco airports. The activists also held large demonstrations on Black Friday.Also on HuffPost:"

In an interview with NPR, researcher Todd Moss said that it's a useful comparison because many developing countries face pressure to use more renewable sources of energy. Though switching to cleaner sources of power is important, Moss said, the graph he developed with Priscilla Agyapong shows poorer countries like Nepal and Ethiopia are just a drop in the bucket compared to the U.S.""It's pretty rich for me to sit in Washington, D.C., and tell Ghana they can't build one natural gas power plant,"" Moss told NPR.Americans' holiday decorations use 6.6 billion kilowatt hours of electricity, which is enough to run 14 million refrigerators, according to the researchers. But that only accounts for 0.2 percent of total electrical usage.Moss and Agyapong used data from the US Department of Energy and the World Bank. Also on HuffPost:"

But when Al-Shabaab militants ambushed a bus Monday, things didn't go according to plan.The bus carried over 100 passengers. The Muslims on board helped some Christians hide, and gave Christian women their hijabs to wear. They told the terrorists: ""If you want to kill us, then kill us. There are no Christians here."" It worked. Tragically, one Christian who fled was apprehended and murdered, as was another man whose truck had been driving behind the bus. But the people who remained on the bus all survived. The terrorists, after warning the passengers they would come back, slipped away.Words cannot do justice.

17,RELIGION,"Why This Group Of Atheists, Agnostics And Seekers Loves Christmas",Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sunday-assembly-christmas_us_5645ab6be4b0603773488e3a,"""For me, Christmas is about family and loved ones.""",2015-12-23,A scene from the stage at Sunday Assembly's 2015 Yule Rock concert.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/567b06ed1f0000c000e9c7c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"About 900 revelers crowded into London's Union Chapel last Thursday, ready to sing their hearts out. They were atheists, humanists, agnostics, spiritual seekers and many things in between. And they were there for the Yule Rock concert, a joyous celebration of Christmas. Many members of this merry crowd were fans of Sunday Assembly, the secular congregation that organized the event. Although Sunday Assembly is often called the ""atheist church,"" nearly three years after it was formed the community has become a space for both secular and spiritual people of all stripes. There are now locations in the U.K., North America, Australia and Africa. In line with SA's motto to ""live better, help often, and wonder more,"" London's assembly has formed smaller community groups around nearly every hobby and interest -- knitting, yoga, social enterprise, for example.The choir is one of those interest groups, and Yule Rock is one of their biggest yearly events. Sunday Assembly's Head of Music Emma Broomfield said that singing is a great way to build community because it often brings strangers together to work toward a common goal.""Singing is vital to people's well-being,"" the 34-year-old told The Huffington Post. ""And if you're not part of a religion, and not part of a choir, there are not many opportunities to sing communally."" For many secular residents of London, Sunday Assembly has become a way to address the needs of those who want to feel like part of a community, but don't necessarily identify with a specific religious tradition. There's been a steady increase in the number of residents in the U.K. who don't claim a religious affiliation (49 percent in 2014). This group, known as the ""religious nones,"" is also a growing minority in America (23 percent in 2014).Broomfield wasn't raised in a religious household. She said she felt the lack of community deeply after moving to London from the countryside a few years ago. She joined Sunday Assembly about two and a half years ago.""When things get tough, I wanted somewhere to go where I could feel a human connection,"" she said.Shelley Styles, one of the organizers behind this year's Yule Rock, said that the Christmas season in particular is a time for family and community. For her, the holidays bring her strong memories of her childhood and of classic U.K. Christmas pop songs, like ""Stay Another Day"" and ""Fairytale of New York."" ""For me, Christmas is about family and loved ones, taking care of people who are worse off than you. It's about getting together,"" Styles told The Huffington Post. ""Obviously Christmas comes from the Christian religion, but it can also be adapted for people who have no faith or lost faith."" Also On HuffPost:"
18,BUSINESS,Mom Who Recently Held Down 3 Jobs Wants Stable Home For Daughters,Jenny Che,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shannon-white-handup-rent_us_567854dfe4b06fa6887e271a,Shannon White is thrilled to have a place to come home to. Now she wants her daughters to join her there.,2015-12-23,Shannon White said she hopes to raise money for rent so she can bring her daughters to live with her.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/567ab9281f0000c000e9c704.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Shannon White finally has the home of her dreams. After spending the last five years passing between friends’ apartments, transitional housing and periods of homelessness, she now lives in a two-bedroom in Fairfield, California. She’s filled it with furniture from her childhood and from relatives, and there are family pictures lining the rooms. Now she’s just waiting for her four daughters to join her there. White, who has bipolar disorder, has struggled to keep a steady job while providing for her children, three of whom have learning disabilities. Her daughters, who range from 12 to 16 years old, have had 11 surgeries between them. They lived with White until 2010, when their father obtained full custody. White loves when she gets to see her daughters every week. She takes them shopping at the dollar store sometimes or to church, and she's hoping to get shared custody of them soon.But this past summer was tough. White was working at Denny’s and as an in-home elder care provider, and was also picking up jobs as a math and Spanish tutor in Fairfield. She was in an abusive relationship, she said, and in August she got into a car accident and had to be hospitalized. Unable to work, White said she has been having a hard time making rent and paying her bills.Meanwhile, she continues to arrange regular visits with her daughters and goes to court in the hopes of bringing them under her roof.“I have to be able to come up with rent, so I can have my daughters here and show the judge that I have a stable living situation,” said White, who connected this fall with counselors at HandUp, an organization that helps raise money for those in need. White recently launched a campaign on the site to get some help with rent. “When I come in the door, I just relax. And after not having a home, it feels really good,"" White told HuffPost. One of her biggest obstacles, she added, has been coming to terms with her bipolar disorder. At some moments, she reaches a high where she has no impulse control and wants to spend a lot of money; at other points, she retreats into herself and doesn’t enjoy the things she used to love, she said. White, whose mother was bipolar as well, has been reluctant to tell others about it -- even her daughters -- because she doesn’t know if she’ll make them upset.It took some time before White was able to face the stigma that often surrounds mental illness. “I don’t have a physical illness that they can see, and people say, ‘You should just get it together,’” White said. “It’s something that I've lived with my whole life, and I pray and take medications and go to counseling. But I can’t help that sometimes I’m having symptoms.”Shannel Usher, a personal service coordinator at Bay Area Community Services who met White shortly after the car accident, said that White’s relationship with her daughters has become more open in recent months as White’s mental health improved. “She was quite symptomatic when I first met her, and she was struggling with depression and anxiety,” Usher said. “Now she’s much more stable.”From the beginning, White's daughters have been a priority. “Her focus has always been to have a stable home for her children,” Usher added. “She always made her visit times, she made it a point that she was there, even when she didn’t have money for child support.”White hopes to land a job soon in car sales. She’s been reading up on cars in Car and Driver magazine and is taking up her studies again. She enrolled at Sacramento State in 2013 but had to drop out when her second-oldest daughter needed to undergo open heart surgery. White now takes online classes through Southern New Hampshire University and expects to obtain a degree in psychology 2017.See how you can help here. 12 Days of Giving, 12 FamiliesThis holiday, be reminded of why this season matters most -- giving back.

The luminous tail was observed streaming behind a distant galaxy in the galaxy cluster Zwicky 8338 -- and it spans a distance of at least 250,000 light-years. That's more than twice the diameter of our own Milky Way, which is home to our sun and more than 100 billion other stars.The apparent gap between the tail and the galaxy, known as CGCG254-021, suggests that the galaxy has been completely stripped of its gas.""In effect, the tail has been cut off from the galaxy,"" study co-author Dr. Thomas Reiprich, also from the University of Bonn, said in the statement.Big as it is, the tail is no match for the so-called Cold Spot, a stupendous cosmic bubble of sorts that astronomers say is some 1.8 billion light-years across. The Cold Spot may be the largest structure in the universe.A paper describing the tail was published in the November 2015 issue of the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.Also on HuffPost:"
20,POLITICS,The Supreme Court Is Cray If It Doesn't Listen To Killer Mike,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-rap-killer-mike_us_567a9ecde4b014efe0d78d88,This time the justices should see rap for what it is: music.,2015-12-23,"The Supreme Court should soon decide whether it will hear the appeal of Taylor Bell, who was suspended from school over offensive rap lyrics he posted online.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Once the news got out that Killer Mike, Big Boi, T.I. and other rap notables were joining a legal brief to the Supreme Court, entertainment outlets jumped on the story as if it were an amusing culture clash.Which it probably is. When the court last heard a rap-related case in December 2014, the press was all over Chief Justice John Roberts' recitation of Eminem lyrics at oral arguments. One law professor even did a mash-up of the chief and Marshall Mathers, aptly titled ""Roberts and Clyde."" Fun stuff.But both cases also raise serious issues of constitutional rights -- whether you're a rap lover or someone who cares about online freedom.In last year's dispute, a broad coalition of civil rights groups and free-speech advocates urged the court to recognize the First Amendment implications of essentially criminalizing the making of rap music and what an adverse ruling could mean for what anyone can say on the Internet.Killer Mike himself, writing in USA Today last year, expressed concern for how the justices might rule in Elonis v. United States, which involved a man found guilty of making threats to his wife in the form of rap lyrics posted to Facebook. Killer Mike and his co-author, University of Richmond professor Erik Nielson, worried that the court could miss a bigger picture: how the law often treats rap less as an art form and more as evidence of criminality in men of color. As if some rhymes over a beat were proof of violent intent.Roberts, writing for the 8-1 majority in Elonis, dodged all those concerns when the court ruled in June. He didn't even mention the First Amendment. The court's very narrow ruling threw dissenting Justice Clarence Thomas for a loop. Thomas chastised the majority for failing to set a workable standard for the state of mind that prosecutors must prove when going after threats made on social media, musical or not.""This failure to decide throws everyone from appellate judges to everyday Facebook users into a state of uncertainty,"" Thomas wrote.So Killer Mike is at it again. He and Nielson -- plus a cadre of other rap scholars and artists -- are pressing the Supreme Court to act in a new case that's at once very similar to Elonis and very different.It's similar in that the new case, Bell v. Itawamba County School Board, deals with government punishment of speech made online. It's different in that this is not a criminal case, but a civil dispute involving a high school that punished a student for a rap he posted on YouTube.Back in 2010, Taylor Bell, the black student at the center of the case, was equal parts aspiring emcee, whistleblower and caring classmate. Several girls at Itawamba Agricultural High School in Fulton, Mississippi, told him that two male coaches were sexually harassing them, making suggestive comments about their appearance and touching them inappropriately.Bell decided to rap about the allegations and post the audio to Facebook and YouTube, all from the comfort of his home. In keeping with the genre, his verses were riddled with explosive rhetoric: This nigga telling students that they sexy, betta watch your back / I'm a serve this nigga, like I serve the junkies with some crack / Quit the damn basketball team / the coach a pervert / can't stand the truth so to you these lyrics going to hurtThose are some of the softer lyrics. Elsewhere, there's a claim that Bell -- or rather, T-Bizzle, his stage name -- would ""hit you with my rueger [sic]"" or ""get a pistol down your mouth."" This was enough to raise alarm among school administrators and get Bell into trouble for allegedly threatening the coaches.But neither of those gentlemen appeared at his disciplinary hearing, and no evidence that they -- or the school -- faced an actual threat was presented at the hearing. Still, Bell was suspended and placed in an alternative school to finish out the remainder of the school year.A month later he sued the school district in federal court, claiming a violation of his First Amendment rights as they relate to off-campus speech. The law is hopelessly divided in that area, and so Bell's case wound its way through the courts until it landed before a 16-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit -- considered one of the most conservative courts in the country.Their August ruling was all over the place. In the course of 101 pages, a majority of the judges agreed that Bell's protest rap was ""incredibly profane and vulgar"" and that the school didn't violate the First Amendment in suspending him.But the judges split sharply in their reasoning, with one of them noting that ""the Supreme Court has not expressly ruled"" on how speech protections apply to off-campus speech by students.Instead, all the public and the lower courts have to rely on is a 1969 case holding that schools may punish on-campus speech, so long as the speech could bring about ""substantial interference"" with school activities. Courts have since applied that standard inconsistently to off-campus activity.Bell now asks the high court: To what extent does the Constitution allow schools to punish students for things they say when they're not there?That's squarely a First Amendment question. And given the uncertainty in the lower courts, the Supreme Court should agree to hear the case. But there's also the concern Killer Mike and the rap scholars raised in their brief filed Monday: rap's place as an art form and a vehicle for social protest by African-Americans.""If our judicial system allows these stereotypes [of rap's creators and listeners] to go unchallenged, justice will continue to be elusive for those Americans most in need of a voice -- a voice that rap music has given them,"" the brief argues.Whether the justices are ready to grapple with that reality is unclear. But their voices, however unhip, could resonate loudly in cases where music may wrongly be associated with a person's character, a crime or even entire communities.Or as Killer Mike told The New York Times when he reflected on what Bell did: ""I see a kid who saw wrong happening and was outraged about it. He wrote a poem about it over a beat.""We should find out in the next few months whether that's enough for the Supreme Court to weigh in."
