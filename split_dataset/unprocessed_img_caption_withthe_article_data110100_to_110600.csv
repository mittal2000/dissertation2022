Your tag line of ""incurable"" ripped through my heart like a million razor blades tearing it to shreds. You have made me doubt myself and my ability to care for my own daughter. Your dooming prognosis made me want to run away. I still feel ashamed when I think of those fleeting thoughts. I have never been faced with a problem that I couldn't fix, or at least attempt to fix. You however, are a different creature. I can't fix you, or your damaging effects that have taken a home within my daughter's innocent body. As I lay my body on my daughter, attempting to restrain her for an EEG, I feel nothing but hate for you. As each tear falls from her face I carry more and more anger. Within those moments you make me want to give up. I want to throw my hands in the air and wave the white flag, surrendering myself to your overpowering existence. But then my daughter, who has been your prey, shows her amazing strength and cracks a smile. All of a sudden the anger, pain and grief leave the room. You can attack her from all sides and she still has the ability to show her strength. She is stronger than you. Which makes me stronger than you. Her smile returns my strength and makes me once again renewed and ready to tackle whatever you throw our way. We will not be defeated by you. We will not give you that power. We will fight for our daughter and the thousands of others who have been attacked by you. You may be a part of our life, but we refuse to be defined by you.You are messing with the wrong family.

But al-Abadi's statements after the meeting indicate that Iraq's new government may have a different understanding about the role of the international community in protecting Iraq from the Islamic State militant group -- and experts say this perception could create problems for the administration's regional strategy in the months ahead.While al-Abadi emphasized that he would govern inclusively to rally disaffected Sunnis against the Islamic State, meeting one of U.S. President Barack Obama's conditions for expanded U.S. involvement in Iraq, he spoke of Iraq remaining dependent on U.S.-led international support.""Our role is to defend our country, but the international community is responsible to protect Iraq and protect Iraqis in the whole region,"" al-Abadi said. ""What’s happening in Syria is coming across to Iraq. We cannot cross that border. It’s an international border, but there is a role for the international community, for the United Nations to do that role.""Yet neither the U.S. nor its international partners have expressed an obligation to protect Iraqis or to cross the border into Syria on their behalf. Obama said last week that his goal is to ""degrade and ultimate destroy"" the Islamic State. But while he noted that the group poses a huge threat to Iraqis, he spoke at greater length about the potential threat to American citizens in the Middle East and the risk that Islamic State fighters will use western passports to attack the homeland. And his administration has made clear that Iraq's ""problems can only be solved with Iraq political solutions.""With al-Abadi suggesting that he sees continued international involvement as essential and almost inevitable, Iraq watchers say it's possible that he won't be as proactive in increasing Iraq's stability on his own. Ken Sofer, a Middle East analyst at the Center for American Progress, said that there is a risk of ""freeriding"": al-Abadi's government may avoid difficult but necessary reforms because it is certain that the international community will ward off the Islamic State, he said.The fact that al-Abadi's government contains polarizing former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and a number of his advisers -- a decision that has prompted criticism in the Arab world -- further complicates the situation.""Haider al-Abadi says all the right things, but, you know, Nouri al-Maliki said a lot of the right things, too, and then he did other things,"" said Daniel Serwer, a scholar at the Middle East Institute who formerly worked on Iraq at the United States Institute of Peace.Serwer said that it's too early to tell whether al-Abadi will enact the real changes necessary to win the backing of Sunnis. Al-Abadi's appointment of Sunnis and Kurds to positions in his cabinet -- something al-Maliki did as well when he was in power -- will not be enough to assuage Sunnis' distrust of the government, he added.""The question is not really about giving jobs in the government to people who happen to be Sunnis or Kurds, it's a question of the distribution of power,"" Serwer said. ""The Kurds feel particularly strongly about this because they made deals with Maliki that he didn't fulfill ... the Sunnis feel oppressed as well and excluded from real power, and that's going to be an even harder problem to fix.""Accusations that al-Maliki's government was victimizing Sunni opponents and alienating the Kurds by denying them their share of national oil revenue played a key role in his political collapse over the summer. The Kurds recently announced that they're only joining the new government on a three-month trial basis. Al-Abadi's government has shown its commitment to include Sunnis by creating a national guard that will be organized on a local level, Serwer said.""Those forces will reflect the [ethnic or sectarian] composition of the population in a particular province, and they won't look like the Iraqi army, which is mostly [Shiite],"" he said.But Sofer warned that the government will still have to reform what he described as a ""corrupt"" Iraqi national army, publicly withdraw its support from Iranian-backed Shiite militias, and rebuild its relationship with Sunni tribes.He outlined the message the U.S. must send to the new Iraqi government:""One, that we're not going to be the Iraqi air force, and two, we're not going to drop bombs just for the sake of dropping bombs -- we need a partner on the ground that's actually going to do legwork."""

India and China are expected to sign a pact that will open the way for Chinese participation in new rail tracks, automated signaling for faster trains and modern stations that India's British-built rail system desperately needs, having barely added 11,000 km of track in the 67 years since independence.China, which added 14,000 km of track in the five years to 2011, is also pushing for a share of the lucrative high-speed train market in India, which it says would be cheaper than Japanese proposals.""India has a strong, real desire to increase its cooperation with China and other countries to perfect and develop its rail system, and has concrete cooperation ideas,"" Assistant Chinese Foreign Minister Liu Jianchao told reporters ahead of Xi's trip.""India is considering building high-speed railways, and China has a positive attitude towards this.""China's consul general in Mumbai, Liu Youfa, told the Times of India last week that Chinese investment in the modernisation of India's railways could eventually touch $50 billion.Beijing is looking to invest another $50 billion in building India's ports, roads and a project to link rivers, part of an infrastructure push that Modi has said is his top priority to crank up economic growth.Chinese investment will also help narrow a trade deficit with India that hit $31 billion in 2013.From economic parity in 1980, China's growth has outstripped India's fourfold. Beijing is now seeking to recycle some of its vast export surpluses into foreign investment in resources and infrastructure in South Asia to feed its industrial machine. DISTRUSTNew Delhi's ties with Beijing have long been held back by distrust, mostly over their contested border. India has reported a rise in incursions by Chinese troops in recent years across a military control line, prompting a drive to beef up defenses.India also views Chinese military collaboration with its arch-rival, Pakistan, as a security threat.Beijing, for its part, is concerned about the activities of Tibetans led by the Dalai Lama who fled to India following a failed uprising in 1959.Xi kicks off his visit in Ahmedabad, the commercial capital of Modi's home state, Gujarat, on Wednesday when the nationalist Indian leader will be marking his 64th birthday.Xi is set to launch one of two industrial parks focused on building power equipment in the booming state, which topped India's growth rates when Modi was its chief minister. China will set up another park in the neighboring state of Maharashtra that will be mainly involved in the autos sector.The informal setting of the first meeting between Xi and Modi is expected to bring a personal touch, much like the friendly get-together of the new Indian leader and Abe in Kyoto before their formal summit in Tokyo.""We hope that during this visit the Chinese and Indian relationship of the last 50-60 years would see a directional change,"" India's Trade Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.For all that, Modi's bonhomie with Abe and his plans to meet U.S. President Barack Obama later this month point to a carefully balanced approach to relations with big powers.""Modi is playing his cards very close to his chest, first by visiting Japan ahead of Xi coming to China, and also by planning a U.S. visit later this year,"" said a Beijing-based diplomat who follows the China-India relationship.Before he arrives in India, Xi will visit the Maldives, the Indian ocean island which India has long considered its area of influence.He will also travel to Sri Lanka, where China is building a port less than 200 km from India's southern coast, part of a drive to build ports across the Indian Ocean that some have dubbed a strategic ""String of Pearls"".Earlier this month, Abe visited Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.(Additional reporting by Frank Jack Daniel and Tommy Wilkes in New Delhi; Editing by Jeremy Laurence)"

A fourth poll showed the contest essentially tied. All together, the surveys indicate a close race just five days ahead of Scotland's Sept. 18 referendum. Pollster Opinium put pro-union voters at 53 percent, compared to 47 percent who are pro-independence. A Survation poll, commissioned by the official pro-union campaign Better Together, similarly found supporters of staying with the U.K. leading supporters of Scottish independence by 54 percent to 46 percent. However, a survey by ICM Research found the opposite split: 54 percent for independence versus 46 percent for the union. Polling expert John Curtice noted that ICM surveyed fewer people than the other polls did, and he said its findings should be ""viewed with caution."" Yet another poll, by Panelbase, found pro-union voters ahead, but by a smaller margin than its last survey: 51 percent to 49 percent, down from 52 percent to 48 percent a week ago.All the poll results released excluded voters who said they were undecided. Turnout for the Thursday referendum is expected to be huge, with 97 percent of Scotland's adult population now registered to vote.For months, polls had the pro-union vote consistently in the lead. But a survey last Saturday showed independence supporters leaping ahead for the first time, causing consternation among leaders of Britain's main political parties, who have championed the pro-union cause. The apparent surge in support for Scottish independence also led investors to sell off the British pound, as concerns grow about the economic impact of breaking up the United Kingdom."

The Times reports that Chapur had asked for their split to be made public, and the abrupt Facebook post was certainly that. Sanford also announced in the Facebook post that he would be getting a lawyer in response to a new lawsuit from his ex-wife, who recently demanded he undergo a psychiatric exam and take both anger management and parenting classes.The saga began in June 2009 when Sanford, then the governor of South Carolina, disappeared for several days.

But these days historic moments in ballet are taking place elsewhere: last week Misty Copeland made her debut as Odette-Odile in Swan Lake with American Ballet Theatre in Brisbane, one of very few black ballerinas ever to be cast in this iconic role. And this week, another distinctive ABT ballerina, Filipino American Stella Abrera returns to her homeland to debut in Giselle with Ballet Philippines, and to call attention to the continuing plight of children in Guiuan, the coastal town on Leyte hardest hit by typhoon Haiyan late last year. Ballet to the People caught up with Abrera by phone just as Giselle rehearsals were wrapping up in Manila and she was headed for the airport, bound for Guiuan, to visit the construction site of a new school being built by disaster-relief organization Operation USA and Honeywell. Two days prior, she had just flown in from Australia, fresh from ABT's first season in Brisbane where critics lauded her performances in Twyla Tharp's Bach Partita and Alexei Ratmansky's Seven Sonatas. Arguably the most versatile of ABT's current crop of soloists, the coolly elegant Abrera tackles the classics and more hard-edged contemporary work with refinement and aplomb. Finely etched body lines, delicate, precise footwork and exquisite épaulement are Abrera's trademarks - though she also has a great flair for comedy, evident in her uproarious portrayal of Hermia in The Dream, Frederick Ashton's distillation of A Midsummer Night's Dream. One of her best known roles is that of Myrta, Queen of the Wilis, in Giselle. Between the hours of midnight and dawn, these specters of jilted maidens, who died before their wedding day, prowl the woods and torture unsuspecting men. Behind Abrera's steely self-assurance as Myrta, we sense a tragic grief. The greatest dramatic challenge in all of classical ballet is undoubtedly the lead role of Giselle: the transformation from naive peasant girl in Act I to strong-willed revenant in Act II, by way of the famous mad scene that brings down the curtain on Act I. Adding to the gala performance buzz will be Abrera's return to the Philippines, where she was born and where she still has strong family ties, though she grew up and trained principally in California. Gold medal award winner at the Royal Academy of Dance's Adeline Genée Awards in London in 1995, Abrera joined American Ballet Theatre the following year. She and her husband Sascha Radetsky performed the Giselle Act II pas de deux on tour with Daniel Ulbricht's ""Stars of American Ballet"" last summer. But, she notes, ""preparing the full-length ballet is a far more fulfilling experience. Telling the story from the beginning, with a full cast of players, allows everyone in the theater, including myself, to become invested in the characters. When Act II comes around, the atmosphere is more magical and heart-rending. I feel I can more fully flesh out my characterization of Giselle when I can tell her story from beginning to end."" This homecoming is poignant for Abrera for another reason: ""Soon after I received the invitation to dance in Manila, super typhoon Haiyan ripped through the Central Philippines. The reports of devastation and suffering were staggering, and I knew my upcoming visit to the country needed to somehow contribute to the relief effort."" Abrera learned that child labor rates - already high in that part of the world - are rising in the typhoon-hit areas, as many children have been orphaned, families' livelihoods threatened, and schools destroyed. Increasing access to education for the children affected by the typhoon is a top priority in combating rising child labor rates. However, the current conditions for education are sometimes verging on hazardous. Many classes are held in overcrowded, makeshift schoolhouses, and basic supplies are scarce. Abrera has partnered with Operation USA to help them rebuild Guiuan's essential infrastructure. She formed Steps Forward for the Philippines, a charity charged with providing material and supplies for their new school. Friends, fans and fellow dancers have responded to Abrera's appeal to ""step forward,"" and to date a little over half of the $30,000 she is targeting has been raised. One of Abrera's strongest supporters in this campaign is fellow ABT dancer, James Whiteside, who travels with her to Manila to partner her in Giselle. He dances the role of the perfidious Prince Albrecht, who pretends to be a commoner so he can woo village maidens, even while engaged to a noblewoman. Whiteside has danced many iconic lead male roles since he joined American Ballet Theatre in 2012 from Boston Ballet. (Ballet to the People was particularly moved by his interpretation of the Artist in Alexei Ratmansky's Chamber Symphony, from the epic Shostakovich Trilogy.) The pair will be supported by Ballet Philippines' Rita Angela Winder as Myrta and Richardson Yadao as Hilarion, the feisty gamekeeper whose love for Giselle goes unrequited, and who is sent dancing to his death by the fearsome Myrta and her gang.Abrera and Whiteside headline the gala performance of Giselle on September 19th. Ballet Philippines' Katherine Trofeo and Jean Marc Cordero, Denise Parungao and Earl John Arisola will take over the roles of Giselle and Albrecht for the remaining four shows through September 21st.But before the curtain goes up on the innocent young village girl and her deceitful lover, Abrera takes an important trip to Guiuan, Leyte, and hopes that her fans will be inspired to help her on her mission: Steps Forward for the Philippines with Ballerina Stella Abrera from StepsForwardPH on Vimeo.Photos: 1.

But they said they were under consideration as the United States begins to identify country roles in its emerging coalition against jihadists who have declared a caliphate or Islamic state ruled under Sharia law in the heart of the Middle East.The addition of Arab fighter jets could strengthen the credibility of the American-led campaign in a region skeptical of how far Washington will commit to a conflict in which nearly every country has a stake, set against the backdrop of Islam's 1,300-year-old rift between Sunnis and Shi'ites.""I don't want to leave you with the impression that these Arab members haven't offered to do air strikes because several of them have,"" a senior U.S. State Department official told reporters in Paris.The official said the offers were not limited to air strikes on Iraq. ""Some have indicated for quite a while a willingness to do them elsewhere,"" the official said. ""We have to sort through all of that because you can't just go and bomb something.""So far, France has been the only country to publicly offer to join U.S. air strikes on Islamic State targets, although limiting these to Iraq. Britain, Washington's main ally in 2003, has sent mixed messages. It has stressed the West should not go over the heads of regional powers nor neglect the importance of forming an inclusive government in Iraq.The U.S. comments come a day after Islamic State stirred fresh outrage with a video purporting to show the beheading of British aid worker David Haines. British Prime Minister David Cameron called it ""a despicable and appalling murder,"" and vowed to bring the killers to justice.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will meet British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond during a conference on Iraq in Paris on Monday. ""I am sure that will be a topic of discussion,"" a second senior U.S. State Department official said, referring to the beheading.The conference brings Iraqi authorities together with 15 to 20 international players. It comes ahead of a U.N. Security Council ministerial meeting on Sept. 19 and a heads of state meeting at the U.N. General Assembly later this month.The U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity. ""MORE AGGRESSIVE KINETIC ACTION""Offers of Arab air participation have been made both to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) overseeing the American air campaign and to the Iraqi government, the first U.S. official said.""I want to be clear that there have been offers both to CENTCOM and to the Iraqis of Arab countries taking more aggressive kinetic action against ISIL,"" said the official, referring to the group by its former name Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.On Thursday, Kerry won backing for a ""coordinated military campaign"" from 10 Arab countries - Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and six Gulf states including rich rivals Saudi Arabia and Qatar.Although President Barack Obama has authorized the use of U.S. fighter jets in a plan announced on Wednesday to attack both sides of the Syrian-Iraqi frontier and defeat Islamic State Sunni fighters, no decision has been made yet on whether to carry them out, U.S. officials said.As of Saturday, U.S. fighter jets had conducted 160 air strikes on Islamic State positions in Iraq. The United States will present a legal case before expanding them into Syria, U.S. officials said, justifying them largely on the basis of defending Iraq from militants who have taken shelter in neighboring Syria during its three-year civil war.""If and when there is a decision to actually conduct a strike, as opposed to authorize strikes which is what the president has talked about, I think we'll be very clear about what the basis of that is going to be, but I wouldn't want to get ahead of that,"" one official said of possible U.S. air strikes on Syria.""But surely the defense of Iraq and Iraq's right to self defense from threats and invasion across its border will play a part in that decision.""An expansion of U.S. air strikes into Syria would deepen a conflict that already cuts across multiple sectarian lines. Islamic State is made up of Sunni militants fighting a Shi'ite-led government in Iraq and a government in Syria led by members of a Shi'ite offshoot sect.Several Arab states have powerful air forces, including Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.But in Saudi Arabia, as elsewhere in the region, Kerry has faced reluctance to be seen aggressively joining the U.S. campaign in Iraq and Syria, fearing in some cases reprisals by extremists or forces loyal to the Syrian government.While Gulf Arab leaders are alarmed at the prospect of a disintegrating Iraq that could shelter Islamist militants who may target their own countries, some such as Saudi Arabia also deeply fear the fight against Islamic State could hasten U.S.-Iranian detente.Saudi Arabia and Iran back opposing sides in wars and political struggles in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Bahrain and Yemen. Saudi Arabia's ruling Sunni Muslim princes, for instance, see the battle to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Riyadh's foe Shi'ite Iran, as pivotal to their own future, fearing that if Assad survives, Tehran will expand its influence across the region and entirely encircle the kingdom.(Additional reporting by John Irish; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"

Foley and Sotloff's families have claimed that government officials threatened them with criminal prosecution if they attempted to get involved.McDonough said nobody was threatened, but the families were made aware of the law. The U.S. National Security Council has indicated that is against the law to make ransom payments to certain people or entities, including the Islamic State, and that it is against U.S. policy to grant concessions to hostage takers.""In terms of what was communicated to the families, in the midst of many, many meetings over the course of this very difficult circumstance, we obviously made clear what the law is,"" McDonough said during an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday.""

We will do so in a calm, deliberate way, but with an iron determination,"" he said in a TV statement from his offices.Britain was quick to join U.S. military action in Afghanistan and Iraq. But a war-weary public and parliament's rejection last year of air strikes on Syria have made Cameron cautious. Complicating his decision are the sensitivities surrounding Scotland's independence referendum on Thursday.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is expected to discuss the aid worker's beheading with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond at a meeting in Paris on Monday, one senior U.S. State Department official said in Paris on condition of anonymity.Foreign leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, and the office of French President Francois Hollande condemned the killing of Haines and expressed their condolences.""The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve,"" Obama said in a statement.During his own statement, Cameron outlined no plans to recall parliament, which is in recess, to seek its authorisation for air strikes against IS. People familiar with his thinking say he has no immediate plans to do so.His last attempt to get the British parliament to back such air strikes, against Syria last year, failed to win the support of lawmakers, an embarrassing setback.Video footage of the murder of Haines by IS militants fighting in Iraq and Syria means Cameron is under pressure to get tougher with IS. At the same time, he trying to persuade Scotland to reject independence in Thursday's referendum.He has said he is not ruling out any options to degrade IS, except deploying troops on the ground, and he is facing increasingly loud calls from some of his own Conservative lawmakers and from former military chiefs to join the United States in launching air strikes.But Scotland is his domestic priority, and he is aware that Scots have often been more skeptical of British military action overseas. Proposing air strikes now could risk alienating them before the independence vote.Cameron called the murder of Haines, a 44-year-old Scottish aid worker, callous and brutal, hailing him as a ""British hero"".""We will hunt down those responsible and bring them to justice no matter how long it takes,"" he said, calling IS ""the embodiment of evil"". ""They are not Muslims, they are monsters.""Britain's Foreign Office said the Haines video showed ""all signs"" of being genuine. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage, but the images were consistent with those of the filmed executions of two American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, in the past month.Haines's murderer appears to be the same man who featured in videos with Foley and Sotloff. The man, nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" by Western media, seems to have a British accent.At the end of the video, another hostage, identified as Alan Henning, was shown. The masked man said he too would be killed if Cameron continued to support the fight against IS.A British security source speaking on condition of anonymity said an investigation was underway into the killings and that senior intelligence officials had attended the meeting of the emergency committee that Cameron chaired.The source declined to go into detail about what, if any, progress the investigation had made. AIR STRIKESFaced with the rise of IS, Britain has so far confined itself to delivering humanitarian aid, carrying out surveillance, arming Kurdish forces who are fighting IS militants, and promising training in Iraq.On military action, London supports U.S. air strikes while keeping its own options open.Sir Richard Dannatt, the former head of the British army, said on Sunday IS executions should not deter the government from taking military action against the militants.""If we don't confront and destroy these Islamic State Jihadi fighters then their influence will grow, their confidence will grow and the problem will get bigger,"" he told Sky News.Mike Haines, brother of the slain aid worker, said on Sunday that David had chosen humanitarian work in Syria only to be murdered in cold blood.""He was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly,"" Mike Haines said in a statement. His brother left behind two daughters from two marriages, he said.ACTED, Haines's employer, said he had been working on a humanitarian response for civilian Syrian populations in the Atmeh camp close to the Turkish border. His ""horrible"" murder would not stop it helping people in need, the organization said.Alex Salmond, Scotland's First Minister, told BBC TV Haines's murder was an ""unspeakable act of barbarism.""Asked in a BBC interview if an independent Scotland would be prepared to take military action against IS, he said any response must be under United Nations auspices, underlining Scottish anxiety about unilateral military action.""There's an urgent requirement to get back to collective (action) under the United Nations,"" said Salmond.Salmond has called the 2003 Iraq invasion illegal because it was not launched with U.N. approval.Haines was remembered in prayers at the morning service in Edinburgh's St. Mary's Cathedral, where provost Graham Forbes praised him for his dedication to humanitarian work.

He said that while the reasons for their disappearance were unclear, he had told the families to contact police.In a separate case, a 19-year-old American Somali woman from St. Paul snuck away from her parents on Aug. 25 saying she was going to a bridal shower. Instead, she flew to Turkey and joined IS in Syria.Home to the biggest Somali community in the United States, the Twin Cities area of Minnesota has been plagued by terrorist recruiting since the Somali group al-Shabaab began enlisting in America around 2007.This year, law enforcement officials say they learned of 15-20 men with connections to the Minnesota Somali community fighting for extremist groups in Syria. They included Douglas McAuthur McCain, a convert to Islam, who was killed in battle this summer.The St. Paul woman is the first case of an area female joining IS that has been made public although her family have asked for her name to be kept private because it fears retaliation from Islamists.Greg Boosalis, FBI division counsel in Minneapolis, said law enforcement was investigating the possible recruitment in the area by Islamist extremists of other females, as well as males, but refused to comment on specific cases.""We are looking into the possibility of additional men and women travelers,"" he said.Somali leaders and sources close to police worry that the reports of female would-be jihadis from the region could mark a new trend.The St. Paul woman is highly likely to have been recruited by IS through Islamist sympathizers in the United States, rather than joining the group on her own, they said. At least one other woman is suspected of helping her leave the United States.Another U.S. teenager, nurse's aide Shannon Conley, 19, from Colorado, pleaded guilty this week to trying to travel to the Middle East to enroll in IS. She was arrested at Denver International Airport in April with a one-way ticket and had been recruited online by a male militant in Syria.Nipping domestic extremism in the bud before Americans try to join terrorist groups is part of Obama's strategy against Islamic State announced in a televised address last week.Along with an aerial bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria, Obama pledged that the government would ""intervene with at-risk individuals before they become radicalized toward violence and decide to travel abroad to Syria and Iraq to join ISIL.""He said authorities would offer ""tailored domestic programs to prevent violent extremism and radicalization"" but gave no more details.The Somali woman from St. Paul who traveled to Syria attended a mosque near the eastern bank of the Mississippi River which had previously attracted suspected extremists. In June, the mosque banned an Egyptian-American man it said was spreading radical ideology.The woman told a relative after leaving the United States that she wanted to help children in IS-controlled territory in Syria.""The nature of the recruitment of these crazy organizations is how they use the element of surprise. Now they have surprised us again by going for the girls,"" said Bihi, speaking about the St. Paul woman who he said was targeted by recruiters.Bihi's teenaged nephew was killed in Somalia in 2009 after being persuaded to join al-Shabaab while in Minnesota. ""BABY FACTORIES""While foreign women who join Islamic State often envision aiding a holy war or at least playing an active role in establishing a purist Islamic nation, the reality can be more mundane.Monitoring of extremists' social media accounts and other writings shows that male jihadis regard women counterparts as little more than mating partners, said Mia Bloom, from the Center for Terrorism and Security Studies at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.""ISIS is recruiting these women in order to be baby factories. They are seeing the establishment of an Islamic state and now they need to populate the state,"" Bloom said.Scores of European Muslim women, mostly from Britain and France, have joined IS in the Middle East.Denver teenager Conley became engaged to an Islamic State militant in Syria who she met online. Jihadist groups like al Qaeda and IS usually only put women near the frontline in emergencies, Bloom said.Some young foreign women have been deployed to Islamic State checkpoints in northern Syria where they pat down other women to search for weapons and force local females to abide by strict Islamic dress codes.But snapshots on social media of the female jihadis' lives in Syria more often show that, ""the girls go around making cookies. It's almost like a jihadi Tupperware party,"" Bloom said.The main worry for law enforcement is that U.S. militants will one day return to the United States and attack targets.""The obvious fear is of individuals coming back and committing a terrorist act here,"" said the FBI's Boosalis. The FBI has been working with the Somali community in Minnesota for years to help it combat radical Islamists. (Editing by Marilyn Thompson and Ross Colvin)"

Coming on in relief after Griffin was carted off the field, Cousins piloted the team to a 41-10 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars.

He would finish with 250 passing yards a pair of touchdowns. “I feel like we can win any game with Kirk Cousins,” Washington coach Jay Gruden said after the win, via the team's website. “Kirk is a special guy. … He can handle it mentally, and obviously, physically. I feel like he can make every throw in the book, and we are going to move forward with Kirk.”With Griffin, who underwent reconstructive knee surgery after stellar rookie campaign in 2012 and struggled during the 2013 campaign, failing to move the offense during the preseason, Theismann proclaimed Cousins was the team's best option at quarterback. “Let’s stop beating around the bush,” Theismann, a former Washington quarterback and commentator for the team's broadcast network, said during the fourth quarter of an August preseason game, via The Wasington Post. “Kirk Cousins has played much better at the quarterback position than Robert Griffin III has.""“It’s going to be a decision that Jay Gruden is going to have to make,” Theismann added. “Right now, Robert Griffin III is his quarterback. Now, if there was a quarterback competition, it wouldn’t be a competition.

After a blockbuster trade with the St. Louis Rams, Washington selected Griffin with the second overall pick. The team then drafted Cousins out of Michigan State early in the fourth round.
