Violations carry a $4,000 fine.Michael Cohen, an executive vice president for the Trump Organization, said his staff was trying to locate the text of the agreement with the city, and could not immediately confirm or deny the suggestion that closing the atrium was a violation.Trump lives in a penthouse in the tower with his family and has his main office there.He previously battled with the city over the space, most recently after he replaced a bench there with a kiosk selling Trump merchandise. A city judge ruled the kiosk violated Trump's agreement with the city, and Trump agreed to removed the kiosk in January and pay a $4,000 fine.(Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Editing by Peter Cooney)"
1,POLITICS,Media Heroes Rescue Veterans' Charity Money From Scam Artist,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/media-donald-trump-veterans_us_574ef24be4b0757eaeb127e0,A praise chorus.,2016-06-01,"Caught in the media spotlight, Donald Trump sent long-promised checks to help vets.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Not all heroes wear capes -- because, I'm sorry, they are just not a functional garment. And this week, that truism proved itself in grand fashion, as members of your free press pulled off a significant accomplishment: forcing presumptive GOP nominee and sclerotic pannus Donald Trump to finally part with the millions of dollars he had promised to various veterans' charities. What we've learned over the past few days makes clear that absent the media's harangues, Trump would have never given up the boodle. Let us now praise them.As you no doubt recall, back in January, Trump -- in one of his patented spasms of unearned pique -- bailed on a Fox News debate in Des Moines, Iowa. Seemingly of the belief that Fox had victimized him in some way, Trump hatched a revenge plot in which he staged a rally at the same time as the debate, ostensibly for the purpose of raising money for veterans -- at least those veterans who'd never been prisoners of war, whom Trump famously despises. At the end of the night, Trump was making big claims about the cash he'd immediately raised: $6 million.From there, the movement of this money became a great mystery. But members of the media set out to solve it. In mid-April, a critical CNN report prompted an incomplete disclosure from Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks, who claimed to have accounted for half of the money allegedly raised. In late May, The Washington Post's David Fahrenthold reported that Trump's sometime campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was walking back the original $6 million promise, alleging that only $4.5 million had been raised and pinning the blame on donors who had reneged on their promises to Trump.An undeterred Fahrenthold wouldn't let go so easily. He took to Twitter, publishing a partial transcript of The Washington Post's most recent interview with Trump that documented his colleague Drew Harwell's attempts to pin the candidate down on the matter of where the money went. Trump spent several minutes zanily dissembling to Harwell. The interview concluded after Trump was asked about posing as his own spokesman -- a bizarre stunt to which Trump had previously copped before suddenly electing to start denying it again -- whereupon Trump fled the interview by hanging up.But Fahrenthold's rigorous pursuit of the money owed to veterans culminated in this week's press conference, during which Trump was finally forced to account for the money's whereabouts. There at Trump Tower, he assailed the press for doing their job, referring to specific members as ""sleaze"" and ""nasty,"" like so: “You know, you’re a nasty guy. You’re really a nasty guy. I gave out millions of dollars that I had no obligation to do.”Actually, when you stand on a stage bragging about having raised $6 million for charity, that does, in fact, obligate you to give out millions of dollars. If we're being exact, it obligates you to give out six million dollars. What's more, it would seem that it was the heat applied by Fahrenthold, et al., that finally forced Trump to honor this obligation. As The Associated Press reported after the press conference, the media's recent burst of high-tensile scrutiny of this issue seems to have pushed Trump to hastily start writing checks:The Associated Press spoke or left messages with each of the organizations Trump named. Of the 30 groups that responded by Tuesday, about half said they had received checks from Trump just last week.So you know how a kid in junior high school might wait till Sunday to let his parents know that he has to go to school on Monday dressed as his favorite constitutional amendment, and then mom and dad have to dash out to various craft stores to get their dumb, procrastinating child properly kitted out to resemble the walking embodiment of our Founding Fathers' antipathy for quartering troops in a private home? That's basically what Donald Trump's organization is like, except he's also a grasping, itchy-palmed con man on top of everything else.As Mother Jones' Kevin Drum has documented, Trump's basic story about his charitable donations to veterans' organizations underwent substantial changes right up until Tuesday's press conference, at which an all-new tale was told. Previously, Trump had said that the organizations to which the donations would flow had been chosen in advance of the charity rally. Yesterday, he said that the vetting process had only just concluded. (And by the way, that vetting process missed one.)Hilariously, Trump made several attempts to act as if this whole effort to raise money for veterans had always been something he wanted to do without much fanfare. ""I wanted to do this out of the goodness of my heart. I didn’t want to do this where the press is all involved,"" he lied, adding, ""If we could, I wanted to keep it private because I don’t think it’s anybody’s business if I wanna send money to the vets.""None of that squares with the original intent of the rally, to punish Fox News by outperforming it in the ratings -- a point on which Trump was still harping during the very press conference in which he was attempting to pose as an anonymous saint. “It was the lowest-rated debate, by the way,” Trump said, desperately clinging to something he could call a ""win.""Perhaps the most newsworthy part of Tuesday's press conference was Trump's insult-laden exclamations against the media who had done nothing more than (successfully) hold him to account. CNN's Dylan Byers and Jeremy Diamond referred to Trump's outbursts as having ""reached Nixonian levels."" Based on their reporting, it seems that reporters are learning to adjust to a new world in which Trump has explicitly encouraged the media to pick a side -- stand fully behind him or face the consequences. Per Byers and Diamond:Trump's objective here is clear, several campaign strategists and political reporters observed: To discredit the people who call attention to his lies, his contradictions, his lack of transparency and the less seemly aspects of his history.Elsewhere, The Washington Post's Paul Waldman proclaimed that Trump had ""declare[d] war on the press."" But for this day, it might be more proper to say that the press had effectively routed Trump in this battle over donations, with the real victors being the charities themselves, who can thank the media for obtaining the promised lucre for their needy coffers from a bent-on-reneging Trump.This is good news, because there are larger quarries to hunt. Trump University, which looks like the ne plus ultra of Trump scams, is becoming a thing. There are tax returns that need to be brought to light. And then there are just the day-to-day instances of Trump radically reversing himself on his policy positions, which resemble the lifecycle of a mayfly in the way they come tumbling from his mouth into the world only to die a flip-flopped death at the next utterance.After his drubbing, Trump sought shelter in the traditional refuge of America's blackguards, the warm embrace of Fox News' Sean Hannity. There, Hannity -- who's so obviously chuffed to find, in Trump, a candidate that pairs his desire to be a GOP party hack with his longing to be some sweaty autocrat's version of Baghdad Bob -- joined the reality television mogul in musing about how terrible the media are and reassured the wounded candidate that he could count on Hannity's vote in November. It's so sweet watching two guys with a history of suspect donations to veterans connecting like that.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
2,POLITICS,Voters Have No Idea Who Gary Johnson Is,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gary-johnson-is-unknown_us_574f3a1ce4b0ed593f1319c5,"In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, most voters say they've never heard of the candidate, let alone his positions.",2016-06-01,"Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson looks on during the party's National Convention held at the Rosen Center in Orlando, Florida, last weekend.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574f413b1600002a00f9509f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a presidential race between two historically disliked major party candidates, there's a certain cachet to being merely the other guy.The leading contender to be that guy? Former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. He's the Libertarian Party nominee, a bicycling enthusiast and, with little time left for any new entrants to the race, perhaps this year's de facto alternative to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Recent national polls with his name thrown into the mix show him polling as high as 10 percent, pulling equally from both sides of the aisle. That's not enough to get him into the presidential debates, let alone establish him as a serious contender. But it marks a significant improvement from his run in 2012, when a June Gallup survey showed him at just 2 percent, and he went on to win under 1 percent of the popular vote.Gauging support for candidates like Johnson is tricky. Polls that include third-party candidates by name tend to overstate support for them, according to an analysis of 2014 surveys, while those that don't ask about third-party candidates end up underestimating their vote share. Voters' eagerness for an alternative often functions more as a statement of dissatisfaction than a serious commitment to buck the two-party system -- especially in the case of polls pitting a nameless ""independent"" candidate against Clinton and Trump. Unlike David French, the conservative writer supported by Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, Johnson is likely to appear on the ballot in all 50 states. And unlike the shapeless counterpoint of an ""other"" option, Johnson is a real person, with an actual record and policy positions.But, as a new HuffPost/YouGov poll shows, Johnson's relative anonymity means that he isn't yet much different from a generic alternative, with even those voters who know who he is largely unsure about his political beliefs.Voters who have heard of Johnson are split in their opinions of him, with 35 percent rating him favorably, 36 rating him unfavorably and the remainder unsure. They're equally divided in their perceptions of his ideology: 22 percent consider him very or somewhat liberal, while 26 percent consider him a moderate, 30 percent believe him to be conservative and the remainder won't even hazard a guess.Part of the confusion may be that libertarian ideology maps imperfectly onto a standard liberal-to-conservative ideological spectrum. Part may also be intentional on the part of the candidate, who's recently claimed that ""73 percent of what Bernie [Sanders] says I agree with"" while positioning himself as a fiscally conservative alternative to Trump. But the unsureness about Johnson contrasts sharply with voters' clear, if unfavorable, impressions of Clinton and Trump, both of whom have nearly universal name recognition. And that's among those who have even heard of Johnson, which is only about a third of those surveyed. The other 66 percent didn’t even recognize his name, or weren't sure whether they'd heard of him.Combining those groups shows just how few voters have a substantive impression of Johnson:About 12 percent of voters who have heard of Johnson -- about 4 percent of the potential electorate as a whole -- say they're very or somewhat likely to vote for him. Given how little is known about him, much of that support right now is likely a statement of protest against the major party candidates. Whether that will translate into a protest vote in November remains an open question.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 25-26 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

And that Niemeyer also seems to have a problem with.""The Department of Education and the Justice Department, in a circular maneuver, now rely on the majority’s opinion to mandate application of their position across the country,"" he wrote, adding that his court and the 4th Circuit simply lacked ""congressional authorization"" to go that route.Niemeyer said that ""by redefining sex to mean how any given person identifies himself or herself at any given time,"" the government deprives ""all affected persons the dignity and freedom of bodily privacy.""""Virtually every civilization’s norms on this issue stand in protest,"" he added.Here's where the Supreme Court comes in: In view of ""the momentous nature of the issue,"" the judge all but implored the Gloucester County School Board, the school district where Grimm attends, to seek review of the case from the justices.

But Congress failed last week to pass a bill to give health officials the money they need, and then left the Capitol for a 10-day recess. CDC Director Tom Frieden begged Congress on Thursday to stop bickering over the financial details and move on Zika before it's too late. “Imagine that you’re standing by and you see someone drowning, and you have the ability to stop them from drowning, but you can’t,” Frieden told reporters and potential donors at the National Press Club. “Now multiply that by 1,000 or 100,000.

A young man has died and it is a tragedy,"" Luger said.""We are unable to bring federal criminal civil rights charges in this matter,"" he said.The fatal shooting came at a time of fierce national debate over the use of excessive force by police, especially against black men.Luger cited contradictory and inconclusive evidence about whether Clark was handcuffed when he was shot as well as about other circumstances of his death.But he said the death of Clark had raised serious questions that must be addressed through a dialog in law enforcement regarding the use of force in Minnesota. He said that would prevent future tragedies.The U.S. Department of Justice's civil rights division, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minneapolis and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Minneapolis division conducted the investigation into Clark's death at the request of the Minneapolis mayor.Authorities said Clark was a suspect in an assault and had an altercation with the officers before one of them shot him.Clark's death in November sparked protests in Minneapolis and hundreds marched again in March when the prosecutor decided not to bring charges.The officers involved in the shooting are on desk duty and are still awaiting an internal investigation by the police department.(Writing by Fiona Ortiz; Editing by Alan Crosby)"

Originally, the bill would have offered parole for cases decided before June 2012 and not for subsequent cases, but a new amendment by state Sen. Danny Martiny (R) made it all-inclusive, opening the door for more than 300 people in prison to take advantage of the option.In his argument for the amendment, Martiny cited the 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling Miller v. Alabama, which found that juveniles have a different brain structure than adults and should be allowed different considerations when they're sentenced. Under the bill, juvenile offenders would have to serve at least 35 years of a life sentence to have the option for parole. Another amendment introduced by state Sen. W.

Nellie Bowles, who covers Silicon Valley for The Guardian, is joining the media company as a tech correspondent and will head up a new San Francisco bureau. In addition, Vice News has hired Entertainment Weekly's Melissa Maerz as senior producer for culture; The Washington Post's Robert Ferdman as an economics correspondent; and Craig Thomson, most recently of now-shuttered Al Jazeera America, as senior planning producer. Ben Craw and Jon Strauss, both of whom recently worked at The Huffington Post, are coming aboard as video producers across politics and entertainment.Tyrangiel, a former Bloomberg executive who joined Vice last year to spearhead the HBO show expected to launch this fall, has been on a hiring spree since shifting to an expanded role of overseeing news operations throughout the media company. Vice News has recently hired around two dozen journalists as part of its overhaul, including Madeleine Haeringer (MSNBC), Ryan McCarthy (The New York Times), Ravi Somaiya (The New York Times) and Scott Conroy (HuffPost).But this recent spate of hiring has come alongside layoffs, with Vice cutting around 20 staffers last week. The staff reduction, coming on the heels of layoffs at Mashable, were interpreted by some as part of a trend in digital media companies diverting resources away from costly news coverage and into potentially more profitable areas like video and entertainment. Vice stressed at the time the layoffs were part of a news reorganization, not a retreat. Two days later, the company hired BBC ""Newsnight"" deputy editor Neil Breakwell to lead its U.K. division and indicated additional staffers were on the way. "

Garland himself has said he views the legality of the death penalty as settled law. Whatever the court's behind-the-scenes rationale, it won't hear the case of LaMondre Tucker, who was convicted of murdering his pregnant girlfriend when he was only 18 and later sentenced to death.The heinousness of Tucker's crime didn't stop Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg from saying they would have given his case a cold, hard look.The pair, but particularly Breyer, has been on a crusade to get the Supreme Court to reconsider its assumptions about the death penalty as a constitutional form of punishment -- in a day and age when it appears to be on life support.Breyer pointed out that Tucker, who was barely an adult and had an IQ of 74 at the time of the crime, may have only received the ultimate punishment because of where he lived: Caddo Parish, a Louisiana county that is responsible for nearly half of the death sentences doled out in the state.""Given these facts, Tucker may well have received the death penalty not because of the comparative egregiousness of his crime, but because of an arbitrary feature of his case, namely, geography,"" Breyer wrote, in a dissent joined by Ginsburg.That's one of the assumptions about the imposition of the death penalty that Breyer attacked in his own dissent in Glossip v. Gross, an explosive case that upheld Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol last summer. Since then, Breyer has been beating the drum that he'd like to hear a case about ""the need to reconsider the validity of capital punishment under the Eighth Amendment"" -- including factors such as the excessive delays to mete it out, the countless cases of innocent people sentenced to death, or its plain arbitrariness.""One could reasonably believe that if Tucker had committed the same crime but been tried and sentenced just across the Red River in, say, Bossier Parish, he would not now be on death row,"" Breyer wrote on Tuesday.Breyer and Ginsburg probably won't get to hear the case they want any time soon, but that won't stop America from letting the death penalty die a natural death: Louisiana, where Tucker is on death row, won't see a new execution until at least 2018. The drugs needed to carry out lethal injections are drying up."

Cruz, an appeal brought by a retired lawyer who claims that Cruz isn't a ""natural born citizen"" within the meaning of the Constitution.A lower court dismissed the case on the basis that the lawyer, Walter Wagner, lacked standing to bring the challenge in federal court. The judge in the case said the alleged harm to Wagner from Cruz's participation in the Republican presidential primary was ""conjectural and hypothetical at best."" (Cruz was still in the race when the judge ruled in mid-March.)Wagner appealed in the usual way, but while the case was pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit -- which has yet to rule -- he moved on to the Supreme Court under a rule that allows him to do so if the case is of ""imperative public importance.""Apparently Wagner didn't meet that high bar.Reached by phone on Tuesday, Wagner said claims against Cruz on the natural-born question aren't moot and will have merit for ""as long as he's still alive."" The lawyer noted that presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump could drop dead tomorrow and then Cruz would certainly ""be back in the race.""Cruz's legal team is due to submit briefs responding to Wagner's appeal before the 10th Circuit by Thursday. After that, the court could issue a summary ruling upholding the dismissal of the case or decide to hold oral arguments and issue a more substantive ruling at a later date.By and large, federal courts across the country have sidestepped ruling on whether Cruz is a natural-born citizen eligible to be president and have dismissed these cases on procedural grounds. Other state courts and administrative bodies have also sided with the senator.""Basically it's a cop-out,"" Wagner said of some of those rulings. ""They don't like to make decisions if they don't have to.""While he awaits a final decision from the Denver-based appeals court, Wagner said he wouldn't rule out making a second trip to the Supreme Court if he has to.""Maybe they'll amend the Constitution in the meanwhile,"" Wagner said.

""He’ll have a White House counsel. There will be others who point out there’s certain things you can do and you can’t do.""Trump has openly campaigned against freedom of the press and freedom of religion, two things enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He has also vowed to disregard international law and commit war crimes. And he likes to threaten his political opponents. McConnell said President Barack Obama has been worse, pointing to Obama's executive orders on immigration that have been held up by courts. ""No president has pushed the limits more than Barack Obama,"" McConnell said. ""And people who are outraged by some of the things that Donald Trump says and are afraid he’s going to push the limits too far ought to look at the current occupant of the White House.""McConnell endorsed the presumptive GOP nominee at the beginning of May.

Gov. Dan Patrick (R) told reporters on Tuesday that he is sending letters to every superintendent in the state advising them not to follow the Obama administration's recently issued guidance on transgender students. But Patrick apparently doesn't care how the state's colleges and universities treat trans students, because those institutions don't seem to be getting any letters.The U.S. Departments of Education and Justice released their guidance on trans students on May 13. It advises that under the federal equity law Title IX, schools must allow trans students to use the restrooms and locker room facilities that best correspond to their gender identity. Title IX applies to all schools receiving federal funds, meaning all public schools and any private institutions that take money from the U.S. government. Patrick mainly spoke on Tuesday about how policies should apply to trans students at the K-12 level. For example, he said parents would not want their ""15-year-old daughter showering with a 15-year-old boy."" He also cited the question some pundits have raised about what would happen if a group of boys decided to go out for the girls' basketball team, and thus prevent some female students from playing sports. Patrick argued that this would be a Title IX violation because it would deny women equal access to sports teams. When a reporter asked Patrick whether he knows anyone who is transgender, he replied that no, he does not ""know any on a personal basis.""Patrick reiterated his earlier statements that he'd rather give up all federal funding to schools than comply with Title IX by allowing trans students access to facilities that match their gender identity. Patrick called the guidance a violation of ""local control, when the president of the United States of America decides to get into every schoolhouse in the United States of America.""Still, for all this outrage about federal overreach, the lieutenant governor did not speak Tuesday about Texas' institutions of higher education, which are just as obligated as K-12 schools to follow the Obama administration's interpretation of Title IX requirements.A spokesman for Patrick's office told The Huffington Post on Tuesday that the letters denouncing the Obama administration's guidance will be sent to K-12 schools. The spokesman said he did not know whether any letters would be sent to colleges or universities in the state.When Patrick said previously that the legislature would provide funding to replace the billions Texas could lose from the U.S. government, he did not mention what would happen to the state's colleges and universities if they lost federal funds. In the University of Texas system, for example, losing federal funding would decimate research, and the loss of access to student loans and Pell grants could cause thousands of students to be booted out of public colleges. Last week, Texas and 10 other states sued the Obama administration over its guidance on trans students, arguing that Title IX does not offer protections based on gender identity. The suit could ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.________"

This can prevent additional exposures in emergency departments or doctor’s office waiting rooms.State health officials have listed 14 potential areas besides the detention center where others may have also been exposed to the virus. They include a high school graduation, a church, various stores and restaurants and a casino. Measles is not usually deadly, but the disease can be severe, especially in children under five years old and adults. For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from it. The virus causes symptoms like fever, cough, runny nose, a red, raised skin rash and watery eyes. It can take up to 21 days for symptoms to appear after first being exposed to the disease, which can be spread through the air via coughs and sneezes. The disease is so infectious that if one person has it, 90 percent of the people he or she comes in contact with will also get the disease if they are not immune to it, notes the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The full two-dose measles vaccine offers 97 percent immunity to the disease, but not everyone can get the shots. People with suppressed immune systems, pregnant women, and children under 12 months old cannot get the vaccines and instead have to rely on ""herd immunity"" -- the immunity of others around them -- to avoid the disease. The threshold for effective herd immunity from measles is about a 92 to 94 percent vaccination rate.Thanks to widespread vaccination campaigns, the U.S. eliminated the measles back in 2000. But backsliding on vaccines, thanks in part to discredited, but popular theories linking vaccines to autism, brought the disease back. Starting in 2008, the government began noticing that the U.S. was recording more measles cases than usual, in part because of international visitors and also because of local spread among unvaccinated communities in America. For instance, in 2014 the U.S. saw a record 667 cases of measles, and in 2015 the U.S. had a large, multi-state measles outbreak linked to Disneyland visits during Dec. 2014. One family who didn’t vaccinate their children brought the disease from Disneyland back to their home in Kearny, Arizona, where they exposed about 1,000 people to the disease by visiting several doctor’s offices and hospitals. The U.S. also saw its first measles death in 12 years in July 2015, after an immunocompromised woman died in Washington. "
22,WOMEN,Want To See What Toxic Masculinity Looks Like? Watch 'The Bachelorette.',Emma Gray,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chad-the-bachelorette-toxic-masculinity-slash-hot-garbage_us_574cf679e4b055bb1172913f,"Hot garbage, thy name is Chad. 😑",2016-05-31,"Portrait of a man who loves protein powder, hates ""naggy"" women.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574cf74c160000ab02f94cce.jpeg?ops=crop_21_61_922_551%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On last night's episode of ""The Bachelorette,"" viewers witnessed the birth of an alpha-male-reality-TV villain in the form of self-described ""man"" (subtext: real manly man) Chad. Chad is buff. He has a suitcase full of protein powder. He eats a lot of meat. He constantly does pull-ups. He hates men who have feelings and thinks women who ask men to share their feelings are ""naggy."" He knows beautiful women, er, ""girls,"" just want ""a man,"" and he seems to believe he is uniquely qualified to fulfill that role. Essentially, Chad is a caricature right out of the He-Man Woman Hater's Club or an MRA sub-reddit -- toxic masculinity, personified. When we talk about toxic masculinity, we're referring to the worst parts of our society's prevailing definition of what makes a man a man. Physical prowess, financial success and acquiring (yes, acquiring, because women are ultimately seen as objects) a conventionally hot girlfriend are rewarded. Emotional intelligence is not. That's how we end up with men like Chad, who enter a social situation and immediately comment on their own ""rugged"" manliness, while looking down on men who deign to talk about their feelings.""I'm afraid, I have feelings,"" Chad says to the camera, mocking his male peers during ""The Bachelorette"" premiere. ""Shut up.""During last night's episode, Chad continued to make it clear how much he dislikes the men around him, who don't live up to his standards of masculinity or who receive things he believes he deserves. Former marine Alex is short, therefore the only reason bachelorette Jojo Fletcher is keeping him around is so that America won't think she hates short guys. The men who get a date when he doesn't are ""the B Team."" When the other dudes have a cheeky singalong about Jojo to pass the time in the mansion -- reminder: they have literally nothing to do but sit around, eat, drink, and talk -- Chad looks on, disgusted.""I think Jojo wants a man,"" he later says. ""I cannot see Jojo falling in love with a childish boy, like some of these guys.""Toxic masculinity is also built on the assumption that ""honesty"" means saying any thought that jumps into your mind, without considering whether that thought could be damaging or disrespectful. We watch Chad consistently spew verbal garbage without regard for the fallout. This plays out both in his interactions with the other men (see above) and in the way he ""courts""Jojo. (Spoiler alert: Both involve healthy doses of open disdain.) First Chad rails against ""nice guys"" while claiming that he is, in fact, the real nice guy.Then, he goes full-on pickup artist during the second group date of the week, employing a technique called ""negging,"" in which a man uses backhanded compliments or outright insults to assert his own confidence and manipulate a woman's affections. During a faux proposal -- the sort of cheesy ""Bachelorette"" activity for which the show is famous -- Chad is obviously unenthused. After he fails to have any fun with the exercise, simply dropping to one knee and muttering ""will you marry me?,"" Jojo pushes him to talk about what he loves about her. ""You need me to tell you all the things I love about you?,"" Chad says. ""You're startin' off a little 'naggy' here.""Later, he doubles down, arguing that he's just being ""honest."" And astoundingly, it works! Jojo eventually acquiesces, agreeing that Chad's rudeness is simply an indication of how ""real"" and ""mysterious"" he is. (On a side note, the way Jojo talks about Chad's appeal is disturbingly similar to the way Americans talk about Donald Trump's appeal, something that did not go unnoticed by Bachelor Nation.)""The Bachelorette"" is supposed to flip the script on the traditional gender norms that govern ""The Bachelor,"" giving a woman the chance to be in the driver's seat controlling the fate of her romantic relationships while the men around her profess their love. But unlike the women on ""The Bachelor,"" who generally only push back on the premise of the show when the lead is being a colossal asshole (see: Juan Pablo's entire season), the men on ""The Bachelorette"" often feel righteously entitled to the lead's affections on their terms. They may be there to win the bachelorette's heart; but if they don't, it must be because she failed to understand what she truly needs.""I am ready to take care of Jojo in the way that she needs to be taken care of,"" Chad told fellow dude-bro Daniel during last night's episode. And more than once during Kaitlyn Bristowe's season of ""The Bachelorette,"" we saw men blow up when they didn't receive the affirmation they believed they deserved.Of course, the franchise's messy gender politics mean that viewers get mixed messages about the value of traditional masculinity. When a man goes far in the season, like Josh Murray, who became Andi Dorfman's fiancee, characteristics that might be toxic are played off as hunky and appealing. (Andi has since publicly said Josh was emotionally and verbally abusive throughout their relationship.) When a man is destined to become the villain, like Chad, we see those same tendencies for the burning hot garbage they really are.Chad's hyper-masculinity does not exist in a vacuum. He is an exaggerated product of the subtle messages boys and men in this country receive on a daily basis. Feelings are bad. Muscles are good. Being too nice is bad. Telling it like it is is good. Affection is bad. Blind rage and physical violence are good. And it looks like we'll be getting both in spades during next week's two-night ""Bachelorette"" Chad extravaganza. Remember, dudes: the patriarchy is quite literally bad for your health. So maybe it's time for Chad -- and other bros like him -- to redefine what it means to be a man.For more on Chad and the second episode of ""The Bachelorette,"" listen to HuffPost's ""Here To Make Friends"" podcast:Do people love ""The Bachelor,"" ""The Bachelorette"" and ""Bachelor in Paradise,"" or do they love to hate these shows? It's unclear. But here at ""Here To Make Friends,"" we both love and love to hate them -- and we love to snarkily dissect each episode in vivid detail. Podcast edited by Nick Offenberg."

Jerry Brown (D) endorsed Hillary Clinton in an open letter on Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574d98a8130000d605383193.jpeg?cache=l5smCSf8Pm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) endorsed Hillary Clinton Tuesday for the Democratic presidential nomination, providing an influential boost to the party front-runner ahead of the state’s primary next week.“On Tuesday, June 7, I have decided to cast my vote for Hillary Clinton because I believe this is the only path forward to win the presidency and stop the dangerous candidacy of Donald Trump,” Brown wrote in an open letter to Democrats and independents in the state.Brown said Clinton “has convincingly made the case that she knows how to get things done and has the tenacity and skill to advance the Democratic agenda.” Her lead among primary voters up to this point is a testament to those skills, he added.But Brown’s case was ultimately pragmatic, arguing that Clinton is the best candidate to defeat presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. “The stakes couldn’t be higher,” Brown said. “Our country faces an existential threat from climate change and the spread of nuclear weapons. A new cold war is on the horizon.” “This is no time for Democrats to keep fighting each other. The general election has already begun,” he concluded. “Hillary Clinton, with her long experience, especially as Secretary of State, has a firm grasp of the issues and will be prepared to lead our country on day one.”Brown’s endorsement gives Clinton an influential boost ahead of the California primary next Tuesday. Clinton leads Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the Golden State by nearly 12 points in HuffPost Pollster’s polling average. The endorsement is also notable because Brown has not always had an amicable relationship with the Clintons. He lost to Bill Clinton in a contentious race for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992.Sanders has campaigned heavily in California in the hopes of pulling out an upset win in the delegate-rich state. The Vermont progressive has made gains against Clinton in the state in recent weeks.Voters who decline to state a party affiliation on the voter registration in California are eligible to vote in the state’s Democratic primary, which could benefit Sanders.Brown also said he was “deeply impressed” with Sanders’ performance and commended him for “[driving] home the message that the top one percent has unfairly captured way too much of America’s wealth.”Sanders’ supporters might take issue, however, with Brown’s contention that the Democratic primary race has already come to a close. Even if Clinton has the race locked up, she has yet to unify Sanders' supporters behind her candidacy."
24,BUSINESS,How Your Credit Card Limit Affects Your Ability To Get A Job,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/credit-card-limit-employment_us_57471e30e4b0dacf7ad428fc,A credit card buys people more time for the job hunt.,2016-05-31,"For the unemployed, finding a new job can be a slog.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/574dc25f160000ab02f94dec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Social benefits in the United States are notoriously stingy.When someone gets laid off, for example, unemployment benefits only last for 26 weeks and represent just a percentage of the person's previous pay. While benefits vary by state, the maximum benefit in New York is $420 per week — barely enough for most city dwellers to pay rent. To make up for a loss in income, people often turn to their credit cards or even take out a second mortgage to pay their bills. As a result, the amount of private credit that unemployed Americans have access to determines how long they can afford to look for their next job, says a new a working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. If you have access to it, credit acts like unemployment insurance, giving people who aren't earning a regular paycheck more of a cushion to pay their bills while they search for a job, Kyle Herkenhoff, one of the three authors of the NBER paper, told The Huffington Post. And being able to afford a longer period of unemployment is a positive thing, because you have time to find a good job instead of taking the first offer you get. On its face, this is sort of an intuitive conclusion. ""If you lose your job and you are severely indebted, what else are you going to do other than take the first job?"" Herkenhoff asked. But it's the first time that actual data has been brought together to prove that this is true. The findings have implications not only for the poor, who have less access to credit in the first place, but also for people who can get access to credit but use it up. If your credit cards are already maxed out when you lose a job, it's harder to spend time searching for work that's a better fit. Desperation can cause people to take jobs that pay less or don't exactly line up with their skills.The lesson here for individuals is pretty simple and not particularly astounding: Having access to credit can be useful in a financial emergency, so it's helpful not to max out your credit cards in good times.But there's also a message for policymakers who determine how much access to credit the entire economy should have, says Herkenhoff.""The idea is that if you can change interest rates, it affects the types of jobs that households take,"" he said. The NBER's working paper suggests that flooding the economy with credit during a downturn can have a long-term positive effect on the kinds of jobs temporarily unemployed people end up with. And that benefits everyone once the economy gets going again.The findings also expand on what we already know about the effect of changing interest rates on the economy. ""The existing research shows that if you drop a lot of credit on an economy, people will spend more,"" said Herkenhoff. ""This goes the other way: You might see unemployment rates go higher as people take longer to find jobs."" But that's ultimately a good thing when they find jobs they're better suited for."
