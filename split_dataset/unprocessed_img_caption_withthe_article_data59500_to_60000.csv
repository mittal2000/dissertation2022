1,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: New York Is Donald Trump And Hillary Clinton Territory,"Natalie Jackson, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-clinton-new-york-primary_us_570f89c6e4b0ffa5937e40af,The biggest question is how many delegates Trump can win.,2016-04-14,https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2016-04-13/polrevapr11.png,https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2016-04-13/polrevapr11.png,"TRUMP LIKELY TO WIN MOST OF NEW YORK'S DELEGATES - Nate Cohn: ""Unless every poll is wildly wrong, Donald Trump is going to win in New York on Tuesday, and he’s going to win big.... A few votes here or there could make the difference between a solid or shaky road to the Republican nomination….But New York awards its delegates in a fairly unusual way: proportionally but with a 50 percent winner-take-all trigger for each district and for the pool of statewide delegates. So Mr. Trump would need 50 percent of the vote statewide and in each congressional district to win all of the delegates. To win 50 percent of the vote statewide, he needs to run up the score in the relatively Republican areas where he’s expected to do well: Staten Island, Long Island and upstate New York. But to maximize his delegate haul, he needs convincing wins in every congressional district — including in some of the most Democratic places in the country. Every pocket of weakness could cost him delegates….All things considered, if he went over 50 percent statewide, he would probably win at least 75 delegates."" [NYT]It's hard to know exactly how many delegates he'll win- Nate Silver: ""The more difficult question is how this translates to congressional districts; if Trump winds up with (for instance) 54 percent of the vote statewide, in how many districts will that translate to a majority? You should be wary of quick-and-dirty answers from polls that break out the results by region. For one thing, the sample sizes on those regional breakouts are usually quite small. But also, the precise way the regions are defined is important; they may not tell us very much about the deep-blue districts we’re interested in….Therefore, even if Trump gets 55 percent or 60 percent of the vote statewide, he’ll probably be under 50 percent in a handful of districts, preventing a clean sweep…. He should beat our original estimate of 71 delegates unless he finishes below 50 percent statewide. Given the recent polls, our models calculate there’s less than a 10 percent chance of his failing to hit that majority threshold."" [538] Polls all show substantial leads for Trump statewide - The business mogul has been at or above 50 percent in every New York primary poll out this month. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is in second place in most of the polls, but trails Trump by over 30 points on average. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz isn’t faring too well in the state -- he gets just under one-fifth of the vote in HuffPost Pollster’s polling average. Unless the polls are catastrophically wrong, Trump is headed for a big victory next Tuesday.POLLS SHOW CLINTON LEADING IN NEW YORK - New York's Democratic primary shows a similar pattern to national polls: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders might be closing the gap on Hillary Clinton, but likely not fast enough to win the state. According to HuffPost Pollster’s average, Clinton leads by just over 10 points -- down from nearly 20 points according to a Siena poll of registered voters at the beginning of March, although there was little polling at that point. Surveys since late March have shown the race mostly stable. Sanders might have made inroads in the state, but with the primary coming up on Tuesday he probably doesn’t have enough time to take the lead. He will still win a substantial chunk of delegates since Democrats allocate delegates proportionally, but Clinton is likely to win the majority of delegates if the polls are correct. [HuffPost]The demographics of the state favor Clinton - Asma Khalid: ""Historical and current U.S. Census data suggest that New York's demographics are unusual compared with other states that have already voted this primary season. No doubt, New Yorkers have their own state of mind, but, a few demographic trends help us understand the electorate...52 percent of active Democratic voters reside within New York City. New York is a diverse metro area; two-thirds of New Yorkers are black, Latino, Asian or multiracial. Hillary Clinton, so far, has shown an advantage with minority voters, winning African-Americans by huge margins across the country...It's worth pointing out that many urban voters are young....Sanders performs well with young voters of all races and ethnicities….But young voters as a whole usually have the lowest voter turnout of any age group, and so Clinton has been able to keep her losses at a minimum by relying more on older voters….The other advantage for Clinton is that New York is a closed primary. In other words, independents are not allowed to vote — and that's bad news for Sanders."" [NPR] SANDERS AND TRUMP SUPPORTERS UNITED ON NEED FOR DRASTIC CHANGE - Kathy Frankovic: “Sanders supporters are looking ahead to a political revolution. 59% of Americans overall believe that the country 'needs a political revolution,' and that belief is most apparent among the supporters of the two insurgent candidates – Sanders on the Democratic side and Donald Trump among Republicans. But that opinion is not just limited to those two candidates’ voters. Even 40% of those Democratic voters who want Clinton to be the nominee agree the country needs a political revolution.” [YouGov] AMERICANS LARGELY SUPPORTIVE OF INCREASING MINIMUM WAGE - HuffPollster: ""Fifty-three percent of all Americans say that raising the minimum wage will help workers, while just a third see the idea as a negative. Proposals to raise the minimum hourly wage to $10.10, $12 and $15 are all popular, but there’s more backing for a smaller wage hike. Sixty-six percent of Americans support a $10.10 federal minimum wage; 59 percent support $12 and 48 percent support $15…. Partisan agreement also falls apart for the more ambitious proposals. While majorities of both Republicans and Democrats support an increase to $10.10, Republicans largely oppose a higher raise….Asked which proposal they most favor, a slim 30 percent plurality of Americans said they favored a $15 minimum wage, with 28 percent preferring a smaller rise to $10.10. Another 20 percent staked out a middle ground at $12, while 18 percent want to see the minimum wage unchanged or repealed altogether."" [HuffPost] GMO OPINIONS LINKED TO EDUCATION AND INCOME LEVEL - Joseph Erbentraut: ""Americans still believe, contrary to the scientific consensus, that GMOs are unsafe to eat….The most striking divisions in perceptions of GMO safety had nothing to do with political party affiliation...Instead, education level and family income showed the widest gaps. Forty-nine percent of respondents with a college degree said they believe GMOs are generally safe, compared with 36 percent who had completed some college and just 22 percent who completed high school or less. When it came to family income, 51 percent of respondents making $100,000 or more per year said they believed GMO foods are safe to eat, compared with 42 percent of those earning $50,000 to $100,000, and 26 percent of those earning less than $50,000.""

By 2020, there will also be increased competition from cheaper versions of pricey biotech medicines, known as biosimilars. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has so far approved two biosimilars, with many more in development.In 2015, generic drugs, including off-patent medicines still sold under brand names, accounted for nearly 89 percent of all prescriptions filled, IMS reported.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Bill Rigby)"

""We built an editorial team composed of new voices reflective of the breadth of American experience,"" Snyder wrote. ""You have announced a new generation, committed to the highest standards of journalism.""Snyder did not indicate whether he is leaving for another media company, and no immediate or interim replacement was named Thursday.The newest leadership of the New Republic hasn’t said much publicly about their plans, but there’s been speculation McCormack and new publisher Hamilton Fish, steeped in the traditions of niche political and cultural magazines, could try returning the magazine more to its previous incarnation. Reached by phone Thursday, Snyder declined to comment on the new owner's plans and suggested such a top-of-the-masthead change should be expected under the circumstances.""New ownership often has new visions and I think it makes sense, is typical, for there to be a change in editorial leadership,"" he said. ""And that’s all that happened.""Snyder took the helm of the publication in December 2014, one of the rockiest moments in the magazine’s history. Just two weeks after celebrating its centennial, the magazine’s top editors, Frank Foer and Leon Wieseltier, quit following disputes about the publication’s direction with then-owner Chris Hughes and CEO Guy Vidra. Dozens of staffers and contributing editors followed in a mass exodus that gutted the magazine of not only talent, but also its institutional memory. Hughes moved the magazine's headquarters to New York City, reduced its print frequency from 20 to 10 issues, and emphasized increasing publishing on the web. In gearing up for an early 2015 relaunch, Snyder recruited a diverse staff of journalists and came out of the gate with a cover story tackling the magazine’s legacy on racial issues. Over the next year, the magazine published a number of provocative stories, such as Michael Eric Dyson’s takedown of Cornel West, and ambitious features like Elle Reeve’s “The Secret Lives of Tumblr Teens.” The New Republic, born in the Progressive Era, continued to champion progressive causes under Snyder’s stewardship, such as paid family leave.To some, the new New Republic would never live up to the old New Republic, which at its best produced deep, ideas-driven reporting and erudite cultural criticism, and proved willing to deftly challenge liberal orthodoxy. Still, the old New Republic also enthusiastically backed the Iraq War, a position its editors regretted a year later, and long drew criticism for its then-owner's reflexive support for Israel and dismissal of Palestinians' concerns. The latest incarnation seemed to be coming into its own when Hughes -- who made his $700 million fortune as a Facebook co-founder -- announced in January that he wanted to sell the magazine after sinking $20 million into two relaunches in less than four years. Hughes had been the magazine’s savior, rescuing a money-losing operation and promising to uphold its traditions while opening his wallet to hire big-name writers. But after shifting priorities, and creating turmoil in the process, Hughes was done. After Hughes' announcement, Snyder and some editors explored setting up a nonprofit model for New Republic that would include a board of directors similar to publications like Mother Jones, ProPublica and Lapham’s Quarterly, according to sources familiar with the plans.Snyder confirmed in an interview that he and some editors began putting together a proposal for a non-profit New Republic that would supported by donors, members and subscribers. Kira Brunner Don, a former executive editor of Lapham’s Quarterly, also assisted in drafting the plan. While Snyder said he ""was heartened that there was a lot of interest,"" the group wasn't ""able to get it together in time before the other bids came together.""Hughes found a willing buyer in McCormack, a donor to Democrats and progressive causes and publisher of literary quarterly Tin House. McCormack brought in Fish, a former publisher of The Nation, as publisher and editorial director. (The most recent masthead, however, only lists Fish as publisher.)In a separate memo, Fish touted several achievements during Snyder's tenure and said the the editor ""put his distinctive mark on what a political and cultural institution looks like in 2016.""Read Snyder and Fish's memos below:Friends,"

""Not today, not tomorrow and not in the foreseeable future.""

Prosecutor Scarlett Wilson said in court documents filed on Tuesday that she would be willing to try Slager earlier if Roof's trial were delayed. Nicholson said he would hear arguments on that issue soon.Roof, who is white, also faces 33 federal charges including hate crimes, obstruction of religion and firearms offenses. Authorities have said evidence showed he had white supremacist views and that he targeted the victims because of their race.Roof's trial in U.S. District Court has been delayed several times while the government decides whether to seek the death penalty.Defense attorneys in both cases have said Roof will plead guilty if he does not face the possibility of execution.(Reporting by Harriet McLeod; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Alistair Bell)"

""It feels like my audience has broadened from just the theater world to people who watch network TV from their comfort of their couches in Montana or California,"" he said. ""I'm trying to put myself out there in a bigger way. I've known that I've wanted to do a concert of this nature for a while, and I was just waiting for the right time."" Even audiences familiar with the actor's musicality will find a few surprises along the way, Johnson said. He'll be joined by fellow Broadway performer Lindsay Mendez and ""Glee"" actor Billy Lewis, Jr. during all three nights of his run. A longtime pal of Johnson's, YouTube sensation Todrick Hall will make an appearance at the April 30 show. ""This whole show has been an accumulation of maybe three or four years of just my brain working toward my dream show,"" Johnson told HuffPost.And while Johnson now has varied achievements in the arts, there's clearly still a part of him that clings to being the ""Sister Act 2""-loving choir boy of his youth. ""I’m gonna throw in a little gospel tune and make my mom cry,"" he quipped. Jay Armstrong Johnson plays New York's Feinstein's/54 Below on April 27, 29 and 30. Head here for more details, and check out the Indiegogo campaign for Johnson's album here. "

Most involve incidents said to have occurred a decade ago or more, too long to be criminally prosecuted, or even litigated in civil court.But authorities in Pennsylvania charged the entertainer in December with sexually assaulting a woman in 2005. And at least nine other women - eight of them in Massachusetts - are currently suing Cosby for defamation, claiming they were smeared by his public assertions that their allegations of sexual wrongdoing were false.Huth, however, filed her suit under a California law allowing victims of childhood abuse to sue beyond the statute of limitations if, within the last three years, they have realized they suffered from psychological damage that previously was repressed.Cosby's lawyers have countered that Huth's claim fails to meet that test, saying she ""unsuccessfully tried to sell her story to the tabloids nearly a decade ago.""""This fact belies the allegations in the lawsuit that (Huth) only just discovered the basis for her claims within the past three years,"" defense lawyers argued in their court filing. According to Cosby's lawyers, Huth sued the comedian only after unsuccessfully trying to extort him for hush money.Cosby's lawyers also have sought dismissal of Huth's complaint on grounds that she lacked the required certification from mental health professionals to support her claims.Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Craig Kaplan was expected to hear arguments from both sides and possibly render a ruling on Thursday.(Reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles)"

But three women -- all mothers with young children who are U.S. citizens -- have chosen to take a stand in court for themselves and all the others like them.Through their attorney, the mothers will tell the justices that more than legal lines and constitutional prerogatives are at play in United States v. Texas. There are real lives at stake.“I felt the need to speak up,” said one of them, identified in court papers as Jane Doe #2, in an interview conducted in Spanish with The Huffington Post. “Unfortunately, there are many who are in my same situation but choose not to speak up. They stay quiet for fear of retaliation or that they’d be deported.”The three Jane Does are what the law calls “intervenors” in a watershed case that began as a longshot challenge to the president's deportation relief programs. It now stands to redefine the contours of executive power and the executive branch’s exercise of prosecutorial discretion under the Constitution.The bulk of the hearing next Monday will focus on these and other thorny legal issues -- and arguments will be made by lawyers for the United States, for Texas and for the U.S. House of Representatives, which last month voted to side with the states against the president.But the women will add ""the perspective of the only non-institutional, human participants in the case as parties,"" said Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, in a press briefing on Thursday. MALDEF is representing the women, with the pro bono help of the law firms O'Melveny & Myers and DLA Piper. Saenz will present their argument before the Supreme Court.""There is an urgency to the case of the Does that is unique in this litigation,"" Nina Perales, vice president of litigation at MALDEF, said in an interview. ""Every month that goes by without this policy in place, without this guidance in place, is a month of suffering and fear.""Evidence of that is the fact that the Jane Does won't actually be at the court, because checkpoints in the region along the U.S.-Mexico border mean they risk revealing their undocumented status to the authorities if they try to travel outside the area. “Landlocked” is how Carlos García, Jane Doe #2’s local attorney, described the women’s living situation.Obama announced plans in November 2014 for a broad expansion of deportation relief, but those initiatives were blocked under a nationwide injunction issued in this case in February 2015. The Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, or DAPA, would allow certain certain parents who are undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. and work for three years. Obama also planned to expand the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, to allow more undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to stay temporarily and gain work authorization. The two efforts could aid as many as 3.7 million people, according to an estimate from the Migration Policy Institute.Texas, joined by 25 other states, sued in December 2014 to halt the implementation of the programs -- arguing, among other claims, that the programs would harm the states' interests and that the Obama administration had overstepped its executive authority. Lower courts accepted the first claim but never addressed the latter constitutional question. That is, until the Supreme Court stepped in and decided to rule anyway on whether the president’s immigration plan runs afoul of the Constitution’s requirement that he “take care” that the laws be faithfully executed.But the women had a role in the case long before it reached the justices or became an issue of election-year politics.Soon after the litigation began in the federal courthouse in Brownsville, Texas, Perales and her team began reaching out to contacts in the state’s Rio Grande Valley region to find undocumented immigrants who might be helped by DAPA or the expansion of DACA and who would be interested in participating in MALDEF's intervention. She ended up connecting with the three Jane Does, all of whom are originally from Mexico and would be eligible for DAPA as mothers of U.S. citizen children.In an interview, Jane Doe #2, who lives in McAllen, Texas, said that she has two U.S.-born children: a 7-year-old son who is in second grade and a 5-year-old daughter who is in preschool. Even as she helps care for her mother, who has Alzheimer’s, she is trying to earn her GED in hopes of better work opportunities and to provide for her children.“Sentí mucha emoción,” Jane Doe #2 said in Spanish, by which she meant she was overcome with emotion when she first learned of Obama’s executive actions. If upheld, DAPA would give her the chance to obtain a better job and a driver’s license, without worrying that immigration authorities would one day seek her deportation.“What would happen to my children? They are very small,” she said. Asked if her children knew about her status and her court involvement, she said, “My children don’t know that I’m illegal. I haven’t told them about any of this. I don’t talk to them about any of this for fear that one day an official may ask them [about me] and they’ll tell them I’m illegal.”MALDEF did not make the other two women available for interviews, but sworn declarations filed in federal court in January 2015, a month after the lawsuit began, shed some light on who they are. Jane Doe #1 lives in Edinburg, Texas, and moved to the U.S. from Mexico 15 years ago. She is married with four children, the youngest of whom was 8 years old at the time of the filing. She is an active volunteer at her church and her children's schools, and she works selling tamales, other food and catalog items.Jane Doe #3 moved to the U.S. from Mexico 11 years ago and lives in Donna, Texas. She has a 2-year-old daughter. To support her family, she sells food and other items at a flea market, and previously worked as a waitress and in child care. That these mothers are living in the shadows is implicit in their court filings, which argue that they must remain anonymous lest they “face opprobrium and possibly harassment from members of the public who support” the states’ legal challenge.The women and their attorneys had to fight to be involved in the lawsuit at all, over the wishes of the U.S. government and the states suing it. Both opposed the intervention by MALDEF when the case was before U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen, whose ruling blocking DAPA and the expanded DACA set in motion the case’s tortured path toward the Supreme Court.""Nobody, no one, wanted us in"" the case, Perales said. The U.S. government's position, in particular, took MALDEF by surprise.""We were surprised because we thought that we could add something to the litigation, that it would be better to have the presence of parents who are affected by this policy, and we thought the defense would benefit from having the participation of the Does,"" Perales said. The U.S. Solicitor General’s Office, which will present the government’s position at the Supreme Court on Monday, declined to comment for this story.In a tersely worded order, Hanen denied the mothers' request to intervene in the case.Perales said he also rejected similar requests from a motley crew of interested characters, including a goat farmer, birther advocate and attorney Orly Taitz and immigration hardliner Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- whose own challenge to the president’s immigration orders was turned away in January by the Supreme Court.

In November 2015, on the same day it dealt a blow to the Obama administration by upholding Hanen’s injunction against the deportation relief programs, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit issued a separate decision siding with the women.“The Jane Does themselves will or will not be eligible for deferred action, depending on the outcome of this case,” the 5th Circuit said in a 16-page decision. The court stressed that “their interest in avoiding deportation is a concrete, personalized interest that is legally protected by” the Constitution.Now that the women are officially part of the case, they’ve become allies of a sort with the federal government in its bid to lift the hold on the executive actions. Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to give the mothers' legal team 10 minutes of the Obama administration’s argument time to present their case.""The issue was simply too important to pack up our bags and go home,"" Perales said.A decision in United States v.

17,POLITICS,Three Mothers Are Fighting For Millions Of Undocumented Immigrants At The Supreme Court,Cristian Farias and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-undocumented-immigrants_us_570d19c5e4b01422324a3281,They want to remind the justices that constitutional disputes affect real people.,2016-04-14,"Another immigrant, Rosario Reyes, originally from El Salvador, and her 7-year-old son Victor attend a December press conference in support of DAPA.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570fb7492200002900253830.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- For about 10 minutes next week, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear from several million undocumented immigrants, all of them potential beneficiaries under President Barack Obama’s stalled executive actions on immigration.They won't all be there, of course, and the vast majority are probably unaware that someone will even be speaking for them. But three women -- all mothers with young children who are U.S. citizens -- have chosen to take a stand in court for themselves and all the others like them.Through their attorney, the mothers will tell the justices that more than legal lines and constitutional prerogatives are at play in United States v. Texas. There are real lives at stake.“I felt the need to speak up,” said one of them, identified in court papers as Jane Doe #2, in an interview conducted in Spanish with The Huffington Post. “Unfortunately, there are many who are in my same situation but choose not to speak up. They stay quiet for fear of retaliation or that they’d be deported.”The three Jane Does are what the law calls “intervenors” in a watershed case that began as a longshot challenge to the president's deportation relief programs. It now stands to redefine the contours of executive power and the executive branch’s exercise of prosecutorial discretion under the Constitution.The bulk of the hearing next Monday will focus on these and other thorny legal issues -- and arguments will be made by lawyers for the United States, for Texas and for the U.S. House of Representatives, which last month voted to side with the states against the president.But the women will add ""the perspective of the only non-institutional, human participants in the case as parties,"" said Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, in a press briefing on Thursday. MALDEF is representing the women, with the pro bono help of the law firms O'Melveny & Myers and DLA Piper. Saenz will present their argument before the Supreme Court.""There is an urgency to the case of the Does that is unique in this litigation,"" Nina Perales, vice president of litigation at MALDEF, said in an interview. ""Every month that goes by without this policy in place, without this guidance in place, is a month of suffering and fear.""Evidence of that is the fact that the Jane Does won't actually be at the court, because checkpoints in the region along the U.S.-Mexico border mean they risk revealing their undocumented status to the authorities if they try to travel outside the area. “Landlocked” is how Carlos García, Jane Doe #2’s local attorney, described the women’s living situation.Obama announced plans in November 2014 for a broad expansion of deportation relief, but those initiatives were blocked under a nationwide injunction issued in this case in February 2015. The Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, or DAPA, would allow certain certain parents who are undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. and work for three years. Obama also planned to expand the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, to allow more undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to stay temporarily and gain work authorization. The two efforts could aid as many as 3.7 million people, according to an estimate from the Migration Policy Institute.Texas, joined by 25 other states, sued in December 2014 to halt the implementation of the programs -- arguing, among other claims, that the programs would harm the states' interests and that the Obama administration had overstepped its executive authority. Lower courts accepted the first claim but never addressed the latter constitutional question. That is, until the Supreme Court stepped in and decided to rule anyway on whether the president’s immigration plan runs afoul of the Constitution’s requirement that he “take care” that the laws be faithfully executed.But the women had a role in the case long before it reached the justices or became an issue of election-year politics.Soon after the litigation began in the federal courthouse in Brownsville, Texas, Perales and her team began reaching out to contacts in the state’s Rio Grande Valley region to find undocumented immigrants who might be helped by DAPA or the expansion of DACA and who would be interested in participating in MALDEF's intervention. She ended up connecting with the three Jane Does, all of whom are originally from Mexico and would be eligible for DAPA as mothers of U.S. citizen children.In an interview, Jane Doe #2, who lives in McAllen, Texas, said that she has two U.S.-born children: a 7-year-old son who is in second grade and a 5-year-old daughter who is in preschool. Even as she helps care for her mother, who has Alzheimer’s, she is trying to earn her GED in hopes of better work opportunities and to provide for her children.“Sentí mucha emoción,” Jane Doe #2 said in Spanish, by which she meant she was overcome with emotion when she first learned of Obama’s executive actions. If upheld, DAPA would give her the chance to obtain a better job and a driver’s license, without worrying that immigration authorities would one day seek her deportation.“What would happen to my children? They are very small,” she said. Asked if her children knew about her status and her court involvement, she said, “My children don’t know that I’m illegal. I haven’t told them about any of this. I don’t talk to them about any of this for fear that one day an official may ask them [about me] and they’ll tell them I’m illegal.”MALDEF did not make the other two women available for interviews, but sworn declarations filed in federal court in January 2015, a month after the lawsuit began, shed some light on who they are. Jane Doe #1 lives in Edinburg, Texas, and moved to the U.S. from Mexico 15 years ago. She is married with four children, the youngest of whom was 8 years old at the time of the filing. She is an active volunteer at her church and her children's schools, and she works selling tamales, other food and catalog items.Jane Doe #3 moved to the U.S. from Mexico 11 years ago and lives in Donna, Texas. She has a 2-year-old daughter. To support her family, she sells food and other items at a flea market, and previously worked as a waitress and in child care. That these mothers are living in the shadows is implicit in their court filings, which argue that they must remain anonymous lest they “face opprobrium and possibly harassment from members of the public who support” the states’ legal challenge.The women and their attorneys had to fight to be involved in the lawsuit at all, over the wishes of the U.S. government and the states suing it. Both opposed the intervention by MALDEF when the case was before U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen, whose ruling blocking DAPA and the expanded DACA set in motion the case’s tortured path toward the Supreme Court.""Nobody, no one, wanted us in"" the case, Perales said. The U.S. government's position, in particular, took MALDEF by surprise.""We were surprised because we thought that we could add something to the litigation, that it would be better to have the presence of parents who are affected by this policy, and we thought the defense would benefit from having the participation of the Does,"" Perales said. The U.S. Solicitor General’s Office, which will present the government’s position at the Supreme Court on Monday, declined to comment for this story.In a tersely worded order, Hanen denied the mothers' request to intervene in the case.Perales said he also rejected similar requests from a motley crew of interested characters, including a goat farmer, birther advocate and attorney Orly Taitz and immigration hardliner Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- whose own challenge to the president’s immigration orders was turned away in January by the Supreme Court. Perales accused Hanen of being ""incapable of differentiating"" between the mothers and ""a very kooky group of people.""An appeals court saw things differently. In November 2015, on the same day it dealt a blow to the Obama administration by upholding Hanen’s injunction against the deportation relief programs, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit issued a separate decision siding with the women.“The Jane Does themselves will or will not be eligible for deferred action, depending on the outcome of this case,” the 5th Circuit said in a 16-page decision. The court stressed that “their interest in avoiding deportation is a concrete, personalized interest that is legally protected by” the Constitution.Now that the women are officially part of the case, they’ve become allies of a sort with the federal government in its bid to lift the hold on the executive actions. Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to give the mothers' legal team 10 minutes of the Obama administration’s argument time to present their case.""The issue was simply too important to pack up our bags and go home,"" Perales said.A decision in United States v. Texas is expected sometime before the end of June.Cristian Farias reported from New York. Elise Foley reported from Washington, D.C."
18,POLITICS,Education Secretary John King: It's Time To Stop Ignoring The Arts And Sciences,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-king-well-rounded-education_us_570e9013e4b03d8b7b9f34c6,"His department wants schools to offer a ""well-rounded education.""",2016-04-14,The secretary looks to his own youth in urging more than reading and math.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570e91e51600002b0031b9f0.jpeg?cache=5NYAxtASaJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The No Child Left Behind Act, the controversial Bush-era education law, promoted an emphasis on reading and math, sometimes at the expense of other subjects. Now, the nation's new education secretary is calling on schools to expand their focus to other subjects and give students a more balanced set of course offerings. Secretary John King Jr. -- who was confirmed in March -- is expected to tout the benefits of a ""well-rounded education"" in a speech at the Las Vegas Academy of the Arts on Thursday. Public officials and private citizens, meanwhile, are working to draft the regulations that will implement the Every Student Succeeds Act. Passed in December, the law takes the place of No Child Left Behind. Under No Child Left Behind, students took standardized tests in math and reading every year from third through eighth grade and once in high school. They also took standardized tests in science three times between third and 12th grade. Schools were held accountable for their students' scores. While the Every Student Succeeds Act keeps this testing schedule in place, states have new flexibility to set the goals for which they will be held accountable.King plans to express hope that this change will allow schools to pursue a broader definition of educational excellence.""I hear frequently and passionately from educators and families who feel that key elements of what makes up a well-rounded education have been neglected in favor of too tight a focus on math and reading,"" King is expected to say. ""Sometimes, that's because of constraints on resources, time and money. Often, teachers and administrators have told me, it’s because math and English language arts were focused on so intensely by some districts and schools under No Child Left Behind that other subjects were under attended to or even ignored.""King will point to his own life to bolster his call to educate the whole child. After both his parents died at a young age, teachers provided him with a valuable support system.""One of the things that made school such a safe and supportive and enjoyable learning environment for me was the education I got was a well-rounded education,"" said King on a call with reporters on Wednesday. He grew up to become a social studies teacher before founding a charter school.In his Thursday speech, King will tout the importance of social studies, the arts and world languages. He will also talk about President Barack Obama's commitment to teaching computer science, which is reflected in his latest budget proposal. ""The evidence doesn't show a vast, nationwide abandonment of subjects outside of math and English language arts, but there is a lot of reason to believe that students are not getting the instruction in science, social studies, the arts and world languages that they need,"" King will say. ""Strong literacy and math skills are surely necessary for success in college, careers and life -- but they just as surely are not sufficient.""Indeed, critics have long complained that current standardized tests promote too singular a focus on math and reading, that they reduce students' strengths and weaknesses to mere scores, and that they make it difficult for educators to teach creatively. The Obama administration has been criticized for pushing policies that add to these problems, like tying student scores to teacher evaluations. In October, the administration called on schools to limit the amount of time they spend testing students, while acknowledging that Washington has played a role in over-testing. But King will say he hopes schools will embrace the challenge of widening their students' horizons. ""I became a teacher and a principal because I wanted to try to do for other kids what my teachers at P.S. 276 and Mark Twain Junior High School in Brooklyn had done for me,"" King will say. ""I remain focused on that goal as we at the department seek to advance equity and excellence for the nation’s children."""

The company said that about 1,200 employees take parental leave each year, about half men.By essentially eliminating the distinction between maternity and paternity leave, EY is perfectly on trend -- at least among a certain group of elite employers desperately fighting to attract talent. Several tech companies have recently gender-neutralized parental leave, including Facebook (four months for moms and dads), Etsy (26 weeks), Spotify (six months) and Netflix (one year).Public policy on parental leave -- what little exists -- also makes no distinction between maternity and paternity leave. New York State recently passed a new, gender-neutral paid leave law, for example. And the national Federal Medical Leave Act, currently the only nationwide parental leave policy, gives workers 12 unpaid weeks off to take care of a child or tend to a sick relative, regardless of gender.Yet, giving women or so-called “primary caretakers” more leave is still the norm among the few employers that provide parental leave. This probably isn’t doing women any long-term good at work or at home. Indeed, it might help give men an edge as more desirable employees -- who won’t take much time away from work. It also puts more of a burden on women at home, where it's assumed they'll take on more caregiving.“The idea of giving women more parental leave than men is based on a sex stereotype that women should be home and men at work,” Peter Romer-Friedman, deputy director of litigation at the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, told The Huffington Post recently.It is unlawful to give women more leave to take care of their children, he said, citing the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The only disparity in leave that can be justified, Romer-Friedman said, is the amount of time it takes a woman to recover from childbirth -- generally six weeks.In a press release, EY said it’s the first in the consulting industry to “equalize parental leave benefits,” a claim that Fortune fact-checked on Wednesday and seems likely true.The other consulting outfits also offer generous packages, but typically birth mothers get more time off. At Accenture, birth moms get 16 weeks and all other primary caregivers get eight, according to Fortune. At IBM, birth moms get 14 weeks paid leave, fathers and adoptive parents get six weeks. Many of the consulting firms make a distinction between ""primary"" and ""secondary"" caregivers that seems anachronistic in 2016, when most couples are dual-income and responsibilities are shared relatively equally at home.“Companies that view parental leave as something solely for mothers are becoming extinct, as more modern and enlightened companies are realizing that many people, especially millennials, are even more interested in co-parenting given most are part of dual career couples,” said Karyn Twaronite, EY global diversity and inclusiveness officer.This post has been updated with a statement from Ernst & Young."
20,POLITICS,This Quirky Congressional Rule Change Could Slash Entitlement Spending,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congressional-rule-entitlement-spending_us_571012c0e4b0060ccda2c77d,Conservatives on Capitol Hill want to make it easier to cut mandatory programs.,2016-04-14,Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) has offered a rule that would freeze funding for programs with lapsed authorizations.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571013cb2200003600253921.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It sounds like another meaningless, wonky rule change from a Congress relegated to renaming post offices. But a conservative proposal to alter how the House considers mandatory spending and lapsed programs would have dramatic consequences for the social safety net, government shutdowns, and dozens of federal departments and programs.At least, that was the argument on Thursday from House Democrats -- and a House Republican -- in attendance for a Rules subcommittee hearing on the offered changes.The proposal is really two proposals: one from Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) to allow cuts to mandatory spending in appropriations bills, and another from Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) to freeze funding for programs with lapsed authorizations. The ideas would both have the practical effect of making it easier for Congress to slash spending through obstruction.The chairman of the Rules subcommittee, Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), said he planned to hold three more hearings on the changes, but the sense among senior GOP aides is that the proposals are unlikely to happen.“I don’t think so,” one aide said.In the immediate-term, absent emergency authorizations or waivers, the changes would force agencies like the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service and NASA to shut down, Democratic Rep. David Price of North Carolina told the Rules panel on Thursday.“A number of agencies and programs crucial to our national security would be forced to put up a closed sign,” Price continued, “namely the U.S. Coast Guard, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Prison System, the Secret Service, Customs and Border Protection, along with federal grants to state and local law enforcement agencies.”“We would also have to close a little-known and rarely discussed agency known as the U.S. State Department,” Price added. (Congress hasn’t reauthorized the State Department since the fiscal year of 2003.)Conservatives argue that enacting their rule changes would just force committees to do honest reauthorizations. They say the changes could be phased in so that lawmakers could catch up on reauthorizing expired programs, and that the rules would simply force Congress to revisit programs and, in the words of McClintock, “ask the obvious questions: Is it effective? Is it meeting its goals? Is it still needed?”But Price noted that those reauthorizations are “fraught with longstanding partisan divisions.” And if committees were unable to reach an agreement, then the program would just shut down.“It’s a recipe for chaos and a threat to our national security,” Price said.Conservatives argue, in response, that the national debt is a national security threat. McClintock actually began his testimony Thursday by noting a favorite point among House conservatives: that former Admiral Mike Mullen said when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the United States’ greatest national security threat was the national debt.Griffith said it was “impossible to get serious about cutting spending and setting priorities in Washington when our own rules prevent us from doing so.”But Democrats argued that Republicans already had the authority to cut mandatory spending; they just want to make it easier.“You don’t need to have all these magical fixes to mess around with the appropriations process if you want to get at mandatory spending,” said Rules Committee member Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), adding that Republicans could go through the appropriate committees to get changes they want.The ranking Democrat of the committee, Louise Slaughter of New York, called the change “a backdoor way” to cut Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits, food assistance, Head Start and community block grants. “Programs that Americans rely on but Republicans have been trying to slash for years,” Slaughter said.More than just a way to sneak spending cuts through, there’s concern among Republicans that the proposed change could dramatically change the power dynamic in Congress.Appropriations Committee member Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) argued that the proposal would give too much authority to the committee, granting his colleagues broad jurisdiction over entitlements.“Do you really want to trust me to do that job?” Cole asked.""I guess if you give Frodo the ring, he'll put it on,” Cole said, summoning a somewhat flawed understanding of The Lord Of The Rings. “But do you want to give him the ring?""Cole also argued that deferring to the Appropriations Committee to fund or defund unauthorized agencies would make the panel members into the police officers of Congress. “Don’t use the Appropriations Committee to discipline every other committee,” Cole said.Price also argued that the appropriations process would get “totally gummed up” as lawmakers get into fights over contentious entitlements.Part of the reason mandatory spending is outside the normal congressional purview is to give certainty to those programs. But another reason is that lawmakers typically want to avoid those partisan fights. That's part of the reason conservatives want to make it easier to hit mandatory spending, and part of the reason the changes considered on Thursday are unlikely to go into effect."

Ted Cruz saw the Texan sweep all 34 of the state's delegates who will appear at the Republican nominating convention in Cleveland.Trump's supporters fear a similar outcome in Georgia on Saturday, where Republicans will gather in each congressional district to pick more than half of the 76 delegates and their alternates for the convention.The real estate mogul''s top campaign aide in the state sounded the alarm on Thursday.""Mr. Trump won Georgia by more than 14 points, almost 200,000 more votes than his next closest rival,"" Trump state director Brandon Phillips wrote in an email, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. ""He also carried 155 counties out of 159. Ted Cruz didn’t win a single county. Because of this landslide victory, Mr. Trump was awarded 42 delegates. We’re asking that the Republican officials honor his victory this Saturday with fair representation.""""If you are willing to attend one of these meetings this Saturday morning and show your support for Mr. Trump, please contact the volunteer coordinator nearest you,"" he added.However, as the AJC notes, the deadline to attend a meeting as a delegate has passed -- convention delegates were selected last month at county-level meetings across the state.The reality TV personality's supporters appear to be unaware of the rules. Some have aired their grievances on Facebook. Others have urged fellow Trump fans to call district chairs and protest. One post on the ""Georgia for Donald Trump"" Facebook page claims Rachel Little, chair of the Georgia GOP for the 4th congressional district, is ""not allowing known Trump supporters to interview as a delegate.""""The establishment likes to say we don't know the rules and yet they won't give them out when people ask. She is also not allowing known Trump supporters to interview as a delegate for Cleveland. Please call ASAP and ask her why she is abusing her power,"" reads the post.The group complains in another post about Mike Fitzgerald, chair of the 6th district GOP, tells supporters to call and ""ask him to stop dragging his feet on providing the necessary paperwork for Trump supporters to attend the convention.""The deadline to be considered as a Delegate or Alternate in the 6th District, was April 7. The rules for doing so are clearly posted on the Georgia GOP website.Trump carried Georgia by 14 points -- winning 42 of the state's delegates. Those delegates are only bound to vote for him on the first ballot. If Cruz's campaign manages to ensure that some of those delegates are favorable to his cause, he can increase the chances of winning the nomination on the second ballot. Requests for comment to Little and Fitzgerald were not immediately returned.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Both Face 6 Years For Conspiracy.,Dana Liebelson and Nick Baumann,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oregon-occupation-conspiracy-charges_us_570e8c30e4b0ffa5937de7a0,Prosecutors are blurring the line between supporters and leaders of the Oregon occupation.,2016-04-14,Duane Ehmer rode his horse and carried a flag at the Oregon occupation.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570e8ce31900002e0056b1f3.jpeg?ops=crop_7_33_3480_2126%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Earlier this year, Ammon Bundy, the son of famed anti-government militant Cliven Bundy, led an armed seizure of a remote federal property in Oregon. Proclaiming that he was prepared to stay for years, he demanded the government free two imprisoned ranchers and give up federal lands. ""We need you to bring your arms and we need you to come,"" he said, reaching out to supporters at a press conference.Duane Ehmer, a cowboy, showed up late with his horse, Hellboy. He’d been shoeing horses in Heppner, Oregon, when a friend told him to head over and find out what was going on with the militants. They seemed like nice people, Ehmer decided, so he stayed. ""Ehmer was there out of curiosity, to support the [imprisoned ranchers] and to feed cows,"" his lawyer wrote.Ehmer bragged on social media about doing guard duty, which meant standing by the road blockades. He also liked to put on his USA jacket and ride around on Hellboy, carrying an American flag and a 1860 cap-and-ball revolver. When law enforcement asked the militants to leave, he complied and tried to encourage others to go, according to his lawyer.The occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was haphazard and chaotic; people came for vastly different reasons. But despite their own varying roles, actions and motives, 26 people, including Bundy and Ehmer, now face the same charge: conspiracy to impede federal officers, a felony that carries a maximum six-year prison sentence. (Some of the occupiers face other charges, too.)Laws against conspiracy are based on the idea that a group of people who coordinate to commit a crime tend to be more dangerous than a lone actor. They make it illegal for people to agree to commit a crime, even if the ultimate crime never happens. Conspiracy charges are popular with prosecutors, who can use them to lump together leaders, like Bundy, with foot soldiers or fellow-travelers, like Ehmer. In the Oregon case, accusing such a wide range of people of the same crime risks blurring the line between supporting the occupation, witnessing it unfold and actively participating.The law that federal prosecutors are using against the Oregon occupiers forbids agreeing to impede a federal officer by force, intimidation or threat. Under this specific law, the government doesn't have to prove that any of the defendants impeded federal officers. It doesn't matter whether or not Ehmer himself erected barricades, intimidated federal employees or verbally threatened officers. To convict Ehmer or any other defendant, the government only needs to prove that person agreed with the goal of impeding federal officers by force, intimidation or threat.""The key issue in a conspiracy case is what was going on in the defendant's mind,"" said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor who's now a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. ""If they think they were agreeing to commit a crime, then they crossed the line.""That's why people who played much smaller roles in the occupation than Bundy could face the same punishment: It's all about intent. Alone, a nonthreatening Facebook message or verbal statement isn't enough to get someone in trouble. But in the case of these defendants, speech that would otherwise be protected by the First Amendment could land them in prison. (A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Oregon declined to comment, citing active litigation.)It may seem bizarre, but ""speech itself can constitute criminal conduct when the crime is a criminal agreement,"" explained Lisa Mathewson, a Philadelphia attorney who often defends clients in conspiracy cases. A defendant doesn't have to ""take any action at all that is illegal in order to enter into an illegal agreement. He could be sitting on a beach.""Some of the militants made statements that might be read as admissions they were working together toward a common and illegal goal. A handful of occupiers, including Ammon Bundy and his brother Ryan, gave regular press conferences in which they made their demands. Ryan Bundy told a reporter that they were willing to ""kill and be killed if necessary."" Jon Ritzheimer, a notorious anti-Muslim activist who often walked around the grounds of the wildlife refuge with a gun visible on his hip, said in a video, ""We need you to get here and stand with us. … That's what's going to prevent any bloodshed, the more people that get here, whether you're armed or unarmed.""But other people charged with conspiracy made more ambiguous statements. Pete Santilli, a conservative radio host from Ohio who did not stay at the wildlife refuge and often wore a large press vest, was charged even though he insists he was merely acting as a sympathetic reporter. The feds note that Ammon Bundy told Santilli in a YouTube video to ""let everybody know"" that ""we're continuing the stand."" Santilli responded, ""OK.""The government could read ""OK"" as ""I agree,"" said Ellen Brotman, a criminal defense attorney in Philadelphia. But it could just as easily mean, “OK, you do that!” or “I understand what you’re telling me.""Brotman said generally that the problem with relying on communications made through social media or other more-casual means is ""the extent to which they can be misread or taken out of context."" The lawyer pointed to a different example in which a drug dealer’s girlfriend answers the phone, it’s a buyer, and she puts her boyfriend on the line knowing a transaction will be made. The girlfriend is now arguably a co-conspirator to the drug deal, but she only agreed to put someone on the phone.Oregon lawyer Mike Arnold, who is representing Ammon Bundy, said he expects evidence to exonerate his client and the others. But ""if the government wants to talk about the intent of a so-called conspiracy,"" he said, ""I guess I'll have to concede that there was a conspiracy [to] educate, to inform and to effectuate political change. ... There were a lot of like-minded people who wanted to be heard."""

Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday to ask lawmakers to pass the Safe Skies Act, which would grant cargo pilots the same rest protections as passenger pilots.""Let me be very direct: fatigue is a killer,"" Sullenberger said at a press conference.

The Federal Aviation Administration has extensive regulations to ensure that airline pilots get enough sleep, mandating 10 hours of rest before they can go on duty.

The Safe Skies Act is a proposed amendment to close the loophole excepting cargo pilots from the FAA's rest standards.With the loophole as it stands, cargo pilots can be on duty for up to 16 hours a day -- six hours longer than other pilots, according to Boxer.""Cargo airline operations share the same airspace, the same runways, and the same airports as the rest of the airline industry and the flying public, and should also share the same safety rules when it comes to pilot fatigue,"" Klobuchar added.Boxer said there had been 14 U.S. cargo plane crashes involving fatigue since 1990, including the 2013 UPS jet crash in Alabama that killed two crew members.At least two courier giants oppose the amendment, according to Roll Call. A group of cargo airlines including FedEx and UPS sent a letter opposing the amendment to the Senate on Monday. They argued that cargo pilots need different regulations because they ""fly fewer legs, have longer layovers, and have better rest opportunities on our trips."" Sullenberger pointed out that cargo pilots have more overnight flights. That means their schedules are more disruptive to their circadian rhythms -- humans' 24-hour sleep-wake cycle, or “body clock.” The science of circadian rhythms underlies the FAA's fatigue regulations for passenger pilots.Boxer asked the floor to at least bring the measure to a vote. ""We just need a vote on this,"" she said, ""and you know, if people want to come down in the well and vote the wrong way on safety, then they have shown themselves to be more concerned with the special economic interests, frankly, than the lives of the people that are being put at risk.""The Safe Skies Act is one of several amendments to the FAA Bill that the Commerce Committee and Senate leadership is currently processing."
24,POLITICS,Why New York's Democratic Debate Suddenly Seems A Lot More Important,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-democratic-debate_us_570fc663e4b03d8b7b9fb2eb,"Thanks to the economy and Donald Trump, a Democratic president might actually have a chance to get stuff done.",2016-04-14,The Clinton and Sanders agendas might not be as hypothetical as we all thought.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570fc7551900002d0056b375.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The moderators at Thursday's Democratic presidential debate shouldn’t have a hard time thinking up questions. It’s been more than a month since Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders met on stage. Since that time, the campaign has become far more contentious -- with nasty arguments over everything from whether Clinton is “qualified” to whether Vermont’s lax gun laws caused crime in New York, which is the site of next week’s primary.Still, the folks at CNN, which is hosting the debate, would do the public a favor by asking basic, straightforward questions about how Clinton and Sanders would address the economy, health care, and other key issues. Yes, they covered this material before — at length, back when the campaign was getting underway. But at that time, everybody was sure Republicans would hold at least one house of Congress, making it impossible for either Democrat to win more than token legislative victories. In other words, the agendas that Clinton and Sanders were proposing seemed largely theoretical.Now the political environment has shifted, in ways that put the GOP at a bigger disadvantage. The phrase ""Democratic House"" no longer evokes laughter among mainstream political professionals. It's actually possible that Clinton or Sanders could get stuff done.To be clear, a Democratic landslide remains unlikely. Clinton, the former secretary of state, and Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, each have serious political liabilities. Either could easily lose. And while Republicans will struggle to keep their Senate majority because they hold most of the vulnerable seats in this cycle, they are in much stronger position in the House, where they have a majority of 59 seats. Wiping that out -- i.e., flipping 30 districts from Republican to Democrat -- would require a win of historic proportions.But there are three reasons to think such an outcome is sufficiently possible to take seriously. One is the economy, which political scientists have shown influences election outcomes strongly. March was the 73rd consecutive month of private sector job creation and wages, finally, are starting to pick up.Another factor is President Barack Obama’s popularity. Last month, his job approval rating cracked 50 percent in the Gallup poll, something that hasn’t happened since 2013. The third factor, naturally, is Donald Trump. He’s the most polarizing and, potentially, most unpopular major candidate in modern history. By dividing the party and depressing turnout, Trump could make it harder for other Republican candidates.Even with Trump as the nominee, Republicans would be favorites to keep the House. Among other things, Democrats got a late start on recruiting candidates in potential swing districts. But the forecasting pool from the political scientists at The Monkey Cage pegs Democratic prospects to be something like 1-in-4. The Cook Political Report’s David Wasserman, one of the most trusted observers of congressional races, wrote last month that “congressional Republicans are entering uncharted and potentially dangerous territory” -- and said the unpredictability of this election makes the prospect of a Democratic House impossible to dismiss.Even if Democrats come up just short of a House majority, victories would still put pressure on Republicans -- maybe enough for a Democratic president to eke out a few policy victories, at least on issues like the minimum wage that are so popular even conservatives are reluctant to oppose them. As a result, Thursday would be a perfect time to ask both Democratic candidates some tough questions -- not about verbal slights, real or intended, but about what they’d actually do if they find themselves sitting in the Oval Office next November, with a Congress capable of passing at least some meaningful legislation. Here are just a few:1) The Sanders health care plan would dramatically reduce incomes for not just the insurance and pharmaceutical industries, but likely for doctors and hospitals as well. Does Sanders think it’s possible to impose these cuts without creating massive disruption and shortages?2) Clinton has proposed only modest tweaks to Obamacare. What about the people who say they need much more help covering premiums or paying for high out-of-pocket costs? And is there any hope her changes will move the country much closer to truly universal coverage?3) Both candidates have called for massive expansions of early childhood programs, and cite evidence of successful pilot programs as proof that such initiatives can make dramatic differences in the lives of low-income kids. But these kinds of programs frequently yield weaker results when government tries them on a large scale. Given the huge investment these programs would require -- hundreds of billions of dollars -- isn’t this a big gamble?4) Sanders has proposed raising the minimum wage nationally to $15 per hour. But even liberal economists like Princeton’s Alan Krueger, whose research provides the intellectual support for a higher wage, has said $15 might be too high in some parts of the country -- putting a big enough strain on business to reduce employment. Does Sanders disagree with that? Would he consider modifying his proposal to adjust the level locally?5) Clinton has said her ties to Wall Street haven’t corrupted her and cites, as proof, her strong proposals for regulating the financial industry. But how can she assure voters that, as president, she’d actually pursue the proposals she’s made -- and hang tough in negotiations when her campaign contributors start lobbying for weaker legislation?6) Sanders has called for programs that will require massive tax hikes, affecting the middle class as well the wealthy. Does he actually think this is politically feasible? If so, how does he imagine persuading moderate Democratic senators who shudder at the thought of even modest tax increases? 7) Clinton is a big fan of infrastructure spending, but her plan is about one-fourth the size of Sanders’, who has called for an investment of roughly $1 trillion over 10 years. If infrastructure is in such dire need of repair, and it has such benefits for the economy both in the short and long term, why not go big? Even if Congress is unlikely to approve such an expenditure, why not start with a high opening bid?The list goes on. Of course, some of these questions might sound a little boring. Most of the underlying issues haven’t been in the news lately. But that’s precisely the point -- they should be. With just the right political breaks, they could become something more than figments of the liberal imagination."

The 28-year-old actress and her 39-year-old husband are also parents to daughter James Reynolds, who was born in December 2014. Lively was spotted with what looks like a baby bump on the set of her new film, ""The Shallows.""During an interview with HuffPost Live in 2015, Reynolds spoke about what it was like to be a first-time parent. ""I just find it funny -- everybody thinks their son or daughter is God’s gift to air, and in their home, they are. I mean, when I’m [in my house], I look at my daughter and I’m like, ‘You are the most amazing creature I’ve ever seen in my life,'"" Reynolds said. ""But that’s sort of annoying when you do that publicly, so I usually kind of go the other way with it. I’ll write silly jokes about how my daughter is terrible at her art or whatever."" Lively and Reynolds are extremely private when it comes to their daughter. Occasionally, Reynolds will tweet about James or the two will post a very covered up photo of her.Considering these two are already the cutest parents around, we can't wait to see what their new addition to the family looks like (if we ever get a peek!) The Huffington Post has reached out to both Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' reps for confirmation and will update this post accordingly. "

In fact, there's been a surge of anti-Muslim rhetoric and incidents in America in recent months.""After San Bernardino we were completely and totally depressed,"" the 27-year-old wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. ""We had days where we didn't leave the house."" In a video for Upworthy, Robins, who converted to Islam, spoke about how after the shootings, he felt afraid for his wife to go out in her hijab. He was also afraid for their young son, Safi. And for the first time in his life, he also felt afraid to be out in public.Robins said that the experience helped him realize just how much privilege he has experienced in his life as a white man.""That was this huge wake up call for me,"" Robins said in the video. ""If I'm afraid, how do you think my wife feels every day as a hijabi? And it was just this horrifying realization of what it is to be different, what it is to be other.""In an effort to promote interfaith understanding, the couple decided to station themselves outside of a Cambridge, Massachusetts library with a few doughnuts, cartons of coffee, and a sign emblazoned with the words ""Ask a Muslim."" They invited passers-by to stop and ask them questions about anything -- the Red Sox, the weather, and maybe if they stuck around long enough, what it feels like to be a Muslim in America today.""We just wanted to bring a smile to people's faces. We wanted to have heart connections,"" Haydar told The Huffington Post. ""We wanted to replace the trauma and terror with love by way of doughnuts, coffee, flowers and good conversations.""Since that first impromptu social experiment in December, the couple said they've set up shop with their signs and donuts close to a dozen times and had conversations with between 200 and 500 people. Haydar said that some were quick hellos and others were much lengthier conversations. The most common question they reportedly get is, ""Why aren't Muslims standing up against terrorism?""""Unfortunately people don't know just how much and how vehemently Muslims are consistently coming out in droves individually and institutionally to condemn acts of terrorism,"" Haydar wrote. ""Every major Muslim organization and institution which represents individual Muslims have come out time and time again to share the message that ... people who commit acts of violence on behalf of Muslims do not and could never represent us.""People also want to ask Haydar about her practice of covering her hair and her body. Haydar said that this question always results in [great]CONSTRUCTIVE conversations. ""We get to talk about the beauty industrial complex, misogyny, patriarchy and societal expectations on women to look a certain way,"" she wrote.""We must deconstruct the notion that this practice is based on oppression in order to rebuild the more truthful narrative that it is a spiritual practice meant to emphasize our hearts and minds rather than our very ephemeral bodies.""Overall, Haydar said that these encounters have been healing and healthy for the couple.""We always walk away feeling seen, heard by and connected to the people who stop to talk,"" she wrote.Watch the video above for Upworthy's interview with Haydar and Robins."
27,POLITICS,Democrats Plan To Sue Over Arizona's Primary Election Mess,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-suing-arizona-primary-voting_us_570fdd45e4b0ffa5937e8a59,Some voters waited up to five hours to cast their ballot.,2016-04-14,"Maricopa County recorder Helen Purcell, left, and Secretary of State Michele Reagan speak during a news conference ahead of Arizona’s Presidential Primary Election in Phoenix on March 21.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_327_3000_1679%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"National Democrats plan to file a lawsuit Friday on behalf of voters who were affected by cutbacks to Arizona voting sites for the state’s primary on March 22. The state’s most populous county, Maricopa, cut the number of sites where voters could cast their ballots from 200 during the 2012 presidential primary to just 60, and by 85 percent since the 2008 presidential primary. Thousands of voters waited in line, some for up to five hours, as a result. Now, the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Arizona Democratic Party are filing a joint lawsuit alleging that the state “needlessly disenfranchised” voters, and particularly voters of color, by reducing the number of voting sites so dramatically and by not counting provisional ballots cast. Hillary Clinton’s campaign, which is represented by Marc Elias, who does legal work on behalf of the committees, will also join the suit. The campaign for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced on Thursday that it was also signing on. ""The handling of the primary election in Arizona was a disgrace,"" Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, said in a statement. ""People should not have to wait in line for five hours to vote. How many people were turned away? What happened in Arizona is part of a pattern of voter disenfranchisement by Republicans.”Elias is also behind lawsuits challenging voting restrictions in North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. Arizona’s “alarmingly inadequate number of voting centers resulted in severe, inexcusable burdens on voters county-wide, as well as the ultimate disenfranchisement of untold numbers of voters who were unable or unwilling to wait in intolerably long lines,” the lawsuit reads, according to The Washington Post, which got an early copy.The suit names Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R) and the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors as defendants, along with Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell, a Republican who initially blamed the primary’s issues on “the voters, for getting in line.” (She later took responsibility for the lines and said the reduction in voting sites was done as a cost-saving measure but proved to be a mistake.) The DNC said in a press release Thursday that the suit “points out that more minority voters will likely be disenfranchised in future elections as the direct result of a new state law enacted in March, which makes it a felony for one voter to turn in a signed, sealed ballot to the county registrar on behalf of another voter” and that the state’s policies “have imposed onerous burdens on Arizona voters generally and Maricopa County voters specifically, and threaten to drag the state backwards when it comes to discrimination.”Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton (D) wrote in a letter asking the Department of Justice to investigate that Maricopa County “distributed fewer polling locations to parts of the county with higher minority populations.”Phoenix, a city with a majority nonwhite population, had one polling place for every 108,000 residents, while predominantly white communities were given more polling sites for significantly smaller populations. Stanton got his wish: The Justice Department is now investigating Maricopa County, asking it to explain its reasons for cutting the number of polling places.“Republicans are using every tool, every legal loophole and every fear tactic they can think of to take aim at voting rights wherever they can,” DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement. “And what they’re aiming at is clear -- they want nothing less than to disenfranchise voting groups who are inconvenient to them on Election Day. That’s exactly what Arizona’s officials did when they closed polling locations and rejected thousands of provisional ballots, and it’s exactly what they’ll continue to do if left unchecked.” A spokeswoman for the Maricopa County Recorder’s office declined a request for comment from The Huffington Post, saying the office hasn't read the lawsuit yet.Maricopa County likely wouldn’t have been allowed to cut so many polling sites if the Voting Rights Act had as much strength as it once did. The Supreme Court gutted the landmark civil rights legislation in a controversial 5-4 decision in 2013. Until then, states with a history of racial discrimination, including Arizona, were required to get permission from the DOJ or in federal court to change their election procedures or laws and demonstrate that such measures wouldn’t leave voters of color worse off. The lawsuit reportedly asks the U.S. District Court of Phoenix to review the county’s polling location plan for the general election in November. It also seeks to halt other state election policies that disproportionately affect racial minorities, who are more likely to vote for Democrats.The lawsuit furthers the narrative that while Democrats care about making voting accessible, Republicans are eager to push laws cutting early voting and polling sites, eliminating same-day registration and requiring government-issued photo identification to vote, among other measures. But time is ticking: A problem voting rights advocates run into is that courts are wary of intervening to stop restrictive procedures or laws too soon before an election.This article has been updated to reflect that Bernie Sanders joined the lawsuit.

28,STYLE,Maybelline's Newest Brand Ambassador Has Plans To Change The Fashion Industry,Krithika Varagur,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/herieth-paul-interview_us_570e94e9e4b08a2d32b8c87b,Tanzanian-Canadian model Herieth Paul is ready to make waves.,2016-04-14,Herieth Paul on the Zac Posen runway in February 2012.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570e954f1600002b0031b9f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"20-year-old model Herieth Paul may have more stamps on her passport than years on the planet. Born in Tanzania, she moved to Ottawa, Canada, with her diplomat mother when she was 11 years old. She was spotted at just 16 and spent four years on the international runway circuit for the likes of Givenchy and Balmain. This February, she was announced as a global brand ambassador for makeup giant Maybelline, joining the likes of Jourdan Dunn and Gigi Hadid.It's still rare to see women of color represented in the beauty world, both in campaigns and for products themselves, so Paul's appointment is a welcome addition to the Maybelline lineup. Paul isn't content with the mere fact of representation, however, and has stated in multiple interviews that she plans to use her platform to change the face of the modeling industry. To learn more, we caught up with the supermodel about diversity, makeup tricks and the importance of beauty sleep. HuffPost: Why do you think diversity has stalled on runways? Despite recent improvements, the runways currently feature only about 25 percent models of color, so what do you think needs to be done to get those numbers up after the initial push?Herieth Paul: True change must start from within each of us. We must look outside ourselves and recognize that the world is made up of people of all different colors. Fashion is a reflection of the times we live in. Today fashion is a global business, runway shows are live-streamed all over the globe as they happen. With “see now/shop now,” smart designers will recognize the need to represent the times we live in on fashion runways and campaigns. Social media was the spark that initiated the discussion. More importantly we must continue to speak about it!How do you plan to use your platform as a Maybelline spokeswoman to advance diversity in fashion and empower other girls of color?Women of color are already empowered from within themselves. I plan to use my platform as a Maybelline spokeswoman to set a good example.You are the face of a major cosmetics brand now -- what do you look for in makeup, particularly to suit your skin tone?I love lightweight makeup. The texture and color must match perfectly, and that's what I get with Maybelline's ""Fit Me"" foundation.How has social media helped you connect with other models and girls of color?Social media is such a big part of our industry for everyone. This allows me to keep in contact with everyone, from maintaining friendships with other models wherever we are traveling for work, and also great opportunities to make new friends!Can you discuss the differences in beauty culture between Tanzania, where you grew up, and Canada? Beauty starts from within. Health is true beauty. The women in Tanzania are effortless with their beauty. And I feel like women in Canada are also very similar. You've spoken before about your decision to wear your hair short -- why is it still rare to see short hair in the fashion world? Cutting my hair short was not my idea at first. But the very first second I cut it I fell in love with my hair. It's what sets me apart from other models. Back when I started modeling it was rare to see models of color with their natural hair. But now it's not so rare.We at HuffPost are big proponents of sleep -- what's your idea of ""beauty sleep,"" and what's your ideal sleep routine?Beauty sleep is a must. Right before bed I take off my makeup with towelettes, and then apply my liquid cleanser with a washcloth to cleanse and gently exfoliate my skin. When I wake up in the morning I won't have any blemishes. I'm also big on afternoon naps. Every time I have a day off, I take 2-hour naps."

Police said they recovered the weapon used.The New Orleans Police Department said on Tuesday that a fully loaded 9 millimeter handgun had been recovered inside Smith's Mercedes. The department did not say who owned the weapon. It said there was no indication that the gun had been fired during the incident. Smith, who was one of the National Football League's top defensive ends before his retirement in 2014, was traveling in the city's Lower Garden District shortly before 11:30 p.m. CDT (0430 GMT) on Saturday when his car was rear-ended by a Hummer.Smith, 34, exchanged words with the driver of the Hummer, who took out a handgun and shot him several times, police said.Smith's wife Racquel was shot in the leg and taken to the hospital, the police said. Her condition was not immediately known.Police on Tuesday also disclosed that a male passenger was also inside Hayes' car during the incident and was released after he cooperated with detectives. Another male and female were inside Smith's vehicle, police said.Surveillance video captured minutes before the final crash and posted online by news media outlets appears to show a Mercedes SUV bumping a Hummer from behind in a minor collision. The Hummer then pulls over toward the curb while the Mercedes drives off. The Hummer then follows in pursuit.""My client was not the aggressor and my client is legally not guilty,"" John Fuller, an attorney for Hayes, said on Tuesday, questioning why police waited three days to disclose the presence of more weapons at the scene.New Orleans police also said detectives found a loaded revolver inside Hayes' vehicle, and there was no indication that weapon was fired.Smith played a decade with the Saints before he was injured in 2013 and his contract was terminated in 2014. He was a prominent member of the New Orleans Saints team that won the Super Bowl in 2010.(Reporting by Eric M. Johnson in Seattle and Karen Brooks in Fort Worth, Texas; Editing by Michael Perry)"
