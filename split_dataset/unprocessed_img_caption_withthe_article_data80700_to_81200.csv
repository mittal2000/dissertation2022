0,COLLEGE,"Back Away From Students' Medical Records, Feds Warn Colleges",Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colleges-medical-records_us_55d36045e4b055a6dab18b0d,Schools were accused of looking at sexual assault victims' therapy history.,2015-08-18,<p>The University of Oregon has come under criticism for providing a student's medical records to its lawyer.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d36c111d00002f001451df.jpeg?ops=crop_39_270_3033_1692%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A college facing off against a student in court should generally refrain from accessing that student's medical records without a court order or written consent from the student, the U.S. Department of Education said Tuesday. The department characterized that guidance as a clarification of existing federal privacy laws.Schools have a limited authority to review a student's records from an on-campus service provider under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). But in a draft Dear Colleague letter to schools nationwide, the Education Department said they should avoid doing so in most cases where there is litigation.Without ""a court order or written consent, institutions that are involved in litigation with a student should not share student medical records with the institution's attorneys or courts unless the litigation in question relates directly to the medical treatment itself or the payment for that treatment, and even then disclose only those records that are relevant and necessary to the litigation,"" wrote Kathleen Styles, the department's chief privacy officer. The department is seeking input until Oct. 2 on its draft guidance.The University of Oregon was recently the center of controversy when it was revealed that school officials had transferred a student's medical records from the university's counseling center to its lawyer's office. The student was seeking treatment after she said she was gang-raped by three university basketball players last year.The school has maintained that it did nothing illegal and that it was merely acting in anticipation of a lawsuit that the student filed against the university in January. The suit was settled for $800,000 this month.However, other universities have also asked students reporting sexual assaults to waive their federal privacy rights so that the schools can look through their therapy records. Those schools include the University of California, San Francisco, and the University of Kansas.Styles warned that the benefits of on-campus medical services ""cannot be fully realized in an environment where trust between students and the institution is undermined. Students should not be hesitant to use the institution's medical services out of fear that information they share with a medical professional will be inappropriately disclosed to others.""On its website, the Education Department elaborated on one situation in which a school has more flexibility to review a student's medical records:The only exception is if the litigation in question relates directly to the medical treatment itself or the payment for that treatment, and even then institutions should only disclose those records that are relevant and necessary to the litigation. To provide a clarifying example, if an institution provided counseling services to a student and the student subsequently sued the institution claiming that the services were inadequate, the school's attorneys should be able to access the student's treatment records to defend the school without obtaining a court order or consent. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who had prodded the department earlier this year to clarify how student medical records should be treated under FERPA, called the new guidance ""encouraging."" ""Now, it's critical that privacy experts and the higher education community weigh in on the draft guidance to make sure colleges and universities are held to the highest possible standard when it comes to protecting student privacy,"" Wyden said in a statement.

5,SPORTS,"Northwestern Football Players Won't Get A Union, But Their Fight Doesn't End Here",Travis Waldron and Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/northwestern-football-players-union_us_55d357d5e4b07addcb44213e,"After a setback at the labor board, the movement to unionize college athletes will have to agitate in other ways.",2015-08-18,<p>Northwestern University football players can pursue other avenues of improving how they're treated by the school after their attempt to unionize was rejected by the National Labor Relations Board.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_14_144_3577_2025%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On Monday, the National Labor Relations Board rejected a historic attempt by Northwestern University football players to unionize as employees of the school. The precedent-setting decision will make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for college athletes to formally join labor unions in the future, forcing players to pursue other ways to change how they're treated by their schools and the NCAA.In their ruling, the five-member board decided unanimously that it should not assert the agency's jurisdiction in the case, essentially dodging the complex question at its core -- whether schools exert enough control over scholarship athletes for them to be considered employees. Many experts were not surprised by the ruling. Though the board's liberal majority may well have sympathized with the student-athletes, a ruling in favor of them could have been politically explosive.Labor attorney Bradford Livingston, who testified on the matter before Congress as a guest of Republicans, called the ruling ""a 75-yard punt, down to the one yard line.""Any board members disposed to letting the players unionize ""were caught between a rock and a hard place,"" said Livingston, of Seyfarth Shaw. ""Had they decided that these individuals were in fact employees and had gone ahead and counted the [union election] ballots, I think there would have been a highly negative reaction, not only in the entire higher education and business communities, but in Congress as well. And it is Congress that funds the NLRB.""The narrow decision marks the end of the road for any Northwestern players who were hoping to have a union to bargain on their behalf. And though it does not rule out unionization for college athletes in general, it leaves them with few viable options moving forward. Because federal labor law would apply only to athletes at private universities -- 17 of the 125 that make up the NCAA’s top division -- players at public colleges and universities could still seek to organize under state labor laws. But given the federal board’s decision and the politically fraught nature of the case, labor experts said state boards would likely be reluctant to grant athletes union rights.“I would not predict that any state, even a state that is perceived to be fairly union friendly, would open the door to this type of organizing,” said Jonathan Fritts, a partner at Morgan Lewis & Bockius in Washington, D.C.And though there are ongoing legislative efforts to extend employee rights to athletes in states such as Connecticut, those protections would be limited solely to athletes at public schools within the state. Any major organizing campaign built around this tactic would therefore have to be piecemeal.Though ultimately unsuccessful before the labor board, the Northwestern union movement, alongside other causes that brought awareness to issues facing college athletes, was not without its achievements. The Big Ten Conference, of which Northwestern is a member, and others have mandated that schools provide four-year guaranteed scholarships to athletes, and the NCAA has relaxed rules on meal allowances.The Northwestern players also won a ruling from NLRB Regional Director Peter S. Ohr that they qualified as employees, a detailed tract that blew apart the “student-athlete” concept propagated by the NCAA. Ohr’s decision could be “persuasive, if not precedent” in future cases involving athletes’ rights, said John G. Adam, an attorney who represented the College Athletes Players Association, the players' would-be union, in front of the labor board.Michael Wasser, policy analyst at Jobs with Justice, a worker advocacy group that supports the athletes, said Northwestern's pro-union players had plenty of reasons to ""hold their heads high"" despite Monday's ruling.""The decision doesn't vindicate Northwestern or the NCAA,"" Wasser said. The board ""didn't make a decision on college athletes being employees or not. In many ways, the players demonstrated that when they spoke up about issues and came together and used a collective voice, they pushed for changes that happened for all athletes and that the NCAA had been unwilling to make. They can take, in large part, responsibility for those changes.""The players can continue to press for policy changes at their schools and in the NCAA, even if they aren't recognized under federal collective bargaining law, Wasser noted. Plenty of workers are agitating outside the traditional union framework these days -- fast-food workers, taxi drivers and domestic workers, to name just a few. Such workers may not be able to secure union contracts, but they can still pressure their companies and their industries into raising pay and changing workplace policies.Such campaigns typically rely on the funding and institutional support of established unions, and the Northwestern effort was no different. It has been backed by the United Steelworkers union. Despite the setback at the labor board, the union's president, Leo Gerard, said Monday that the steelworkers ""will not stop fighting until athletes secure the basic protections they so desperately need."" The NLRB’s ruling may be the “end of the line” for a traditional organized labor movement in college sports, Fritts said. But even if it is, current and former athletes are still pushing for major changes to the collegiate landscape through other legal avenues. The NCAA is currently appealing a federal judge’s ruling that granted athletes a share of revenues generated from their names, images and likenesses, and it is also facing a major antitrust suit from prominent sports labor attorney Jeffrey Kessler that seeks to create a free market for college athlete compensation.Those suits may force larger -- and more sudden -- changes to college sports than an organizing push could have.“If Jeffrey Kessler wins,” said Adam, the CAPA attorney, “that will open the NCAA up to issues that will be far more difficult for it to deal with.”"
