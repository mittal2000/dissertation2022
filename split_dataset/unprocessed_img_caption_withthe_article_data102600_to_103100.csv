Risen could face jail or punshing fines for not revealing his source of classified information for his 2006 book that detailed the CIA's efforts against Iran's nuclear program.

The legal battle was sparked by Risen's 2006 book, “State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration,"" which allegedly used information supplied by Sterling in its pages. But it seems now that the court has finally had enough, demanding a decision be made in one week's time as to whether Risen will be made to testify. ""Since June 2, 2014, the United States has had over six months to decide whether it will subpoena James Risen to testify at this trial, which is scheduled to begin Monday, January 12, 2015,"" the order read. ""Because Mr. Risen's presence or absence at the trial will have a significant impact on how the parties present their case, a decision about Mr. Risen must be made sufficiently before trial to enable the parties to prepare adequately."" The impending trial has reignited a debate over whether journalists have the right to protect the identities of those who confidentially supply classified information to them, and Risen has stated in the past that he will go to jail rather than testify against a source. But in recent months Holder and President Obama have both hinted that Risen will not have to serve jail time for doing his job, and there has been speculation that some sort of deal or resolution might be struck between the two parties. According to Politco, however, a lawyer for Risen said Wednesday that they are still waiting on the Justice Department to inform them of what happens next."

4,BUSINESS,5 Reasons Shopping at Walmart Makes You a Scrooge This Holiday Season,"Linsey Pecikonis, ContributorCommunications Director, Tabletop Strategies",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-reasons-shopping-at-wal_b_6303534.html,"Employing this many workers may make the company seem virtuous and altruistic, but the business model is not a model other companies should emulate.",2014-12-10,16th January 1970: British actor Albert Finney plays Ebenezer Scrooge in Ronald Neame's Dickensian musical 'Scrooge'. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb317ba2400003000974041.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's no secret that Walmart is the nation's largest retailer and that the family who owns Walmart, the Waltons, are mega-billionaires worth more than $144.7 billion, but what you might not know is that Walmart is the the largest private employer in the United States employing over 1.3 million workers.Employing this many workers may make the company seem virtuous and altruistic, but the business model is not a model other companies should emulate. The middle class is struggling economically today because of the corporate practices and loop-holes that Walmart has established as an industry standard. This holiday season, when you're looking for the most sought after gifts -- avoid shopping at Walmart. Below you'll find the top five reasons why if you shop at Walmart this holiday season you're pretty much a Scrooge.1. Walmart doesn't support American business. While the company proudly boasts and encourages shoppers to ""Buy American,"" the majority of the company's goods are made outside of the United States and often made in sweatshops. When you buy something at Walmart, you are not buying American.2. Walmart creates more poverty than jobs. When a Walmart store comes to town -- it isn't the economic golden child the company's PR machine would like you to believe. In fact, a study done by the Northwest Community group estimates that a Walmart opening up in a local town will actually decrease the community's economic output over 20 years by an estimated $13 million. It also estimates that Walmart will cost the community an additional $14 million in lost wages for the next 20 years. This translates to communities being worse off in the long run when Walmart strolls into town. When you shop at Walmart, you are not creating jobs.3. Walmart's jobs are poverty jobs. This year numerous studies released expose Walmart's poverty wages and the corporation's willingness to place that burden on taxpayers -- not the company. A report by Wisconsin's Democrats looked at how to quantify Walmart's cost to taxpayers in that state. At a minimum, Walmart workers in the state rely on at least $9.5 million a year to subsidize medicaid for workers. If these poverty level wages were raised to $10.10 an hour it would create 100,000 new jobs in the overall Wisconsin economy, not to mention adding another $13.5 billion to the overall economy. When you shop at Walmart you support poverty wages.4. Walmart fires workers illegally. Walmart has a long history of violating workers' rights far beyond mistreatment. The National Labor Relations Board found that Walmart has violated the rights of workers by ""unlawfully threatened, disciplined, and/or terminated employees"" for ""having engaged in legally protected strikes and protests"" and ""in anticipation or response to employees' other protected concerted activities."" In essence -- Walmart not only encourages its managers to bully employees who want to speak out about unfair practices, they will also fire you if they find out you're planning a strike. When shopping at Walmart you support their anti-worker practices.5. Walmart is a JOB KILLER.  We've touched on how Walmart promotes itself as a company that values made-in-America products while their products on its shelves are largely produced overseas and in sweatshops. We've highlighted how Walmart relies on subsidies by the federal government to legally pay their workers poverty wages. We've even exposed Walmart for illegally firing its workers who plan to strike or threatening their jobs to keep the workers from speaking out. All of this adds up to Walmart costing us an estimated 196,000 jobs -- many of them manufacturing jobs between 2001 and 2006. To prove the power Walmart has in the job market -- each store opened destroys almost three local jobs for every two it creates. When you choose to shop at Walmart you don't create jobs.We're not alone in reconsidering our Walmart shopping habits. A recent blog on Daily Kos pointed out that a poll by Lake Research Partners found that Walmart's reputation is suffering among consumers with 28 percent saying they have an unfavorable view of Walmart compared to just 13 percent for Target and just 6 percent for Costco. This large unfavorable view is having an impact on Walmart's most loyal customer base, who in the same poll, said they have decided to shop their less because of the mega-retailer's reputation.All of this adds up to you having the power to make a difference for retail workers across the country. If you, like all of us at Brave New Films, avoid shopping at Walmart this holiday season, you'll send a strong message to the retailer that workers' rights and living wages are more important to you than a few extra dollars in savings.If you'd like to learn more about Walmart and its horrible practices, watch Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price for free below."

In the era of smart phones and YouTube, many people have grown used to recording their lives, from fun moments with friends to tense encounters with police. Some have discovered the hard way that this can result in felony charges, for recording their arrest for peddling without a license, for instance, or taping police in a dispute about old cars on a lawn. Many more people could be introduced to the Illinois law in May when thousands of protesters and journalists head to Chicago for the NATO and G8 summits.

The legislation is intended to replace Illinois’ previous law, elements of which were ruled unconstitutional by the Illinois Supreme Court in March.The previous law, deemed to be among the strictest in the nation, technically forbade any recording of anyone without consent from all parties involved. The new proposal draws a distinction between “private” conversations and those that “cannot be deemed private,” such as a loud argument on the street. The recording of private conversations, unless there is all-party consent or a warrant, remain prohibited under the bill. The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois fiercely fought the previous eavesdropping law, and worked with state lawmakers to craft its replacement. They offered a mixed review of the new proposal, saying the organization is pleased the new statute “generally protects our reasonable expectations of privacy in our conversations, phone calls, and electronic communications from unwanted recording or interception.” They also noted it protects the ability of civilians to record on-duty government officials and police officers “talking with the public as part of their jobs.” However, the ACLU expressed concern that the new bill ""significantly expands"" police eavesdropping by allowing law enforcement and informants to record or capture certain private conversations for 24 hours before a warrant is necessary, in the event of certain serious crimes and with the approval of a state attorney. Previously, such requests required the prior approval of a judge, whose role -- unlike a state attorney's -- is outside law enforcement. State Rep. Elaine Nekritz (D), a lead cosponsor of the bill, admitted the expanded number of circumstances where police may surreptitiously record or otherwise intercept communications was a trade-off for allowing the protections of public recordings to be included, the Associated Press reported.The measure also drew some criticism for not addressing privacy issues related to police officers wearing the body cameras some departments, including Chicago’s, will soon implement. Fellow bill sponsor Rep. Kwame Raoul (D) said he and Nekritz will work on a separate bill addressing that topic in the coming weeks, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.The legislation now awaits the signature of Gov. Pat Quinn (D) before it becomes law.Quinn spokesman Dave Blanchette told The Huffington Post Wednesday the bill has not yet been received by the governor, but that once the legislation reaches his desk, he will carefully consider it. Blanchette did not say whether the governor intended to sign the measure or not.Regardless if whether Quinn signs the legislation, it remains legal in all 50 states, including Illinois, for civilians to record their interactions with police officers while officers are on duty, so long as civilians do not interfere with officers’ ability to do their job."

Byzantium survives in splendor as Rome collapses before the barbarian hordes. So it has been with ACORN. So it shall be.Fear not, America. House Republicans have resumed their war on the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, an anti-poverty nonprofit staffed by low-income people, a scant 4 1/2 years after the organization officially folded.Truth be told, there are no signs of a resurgent ACORN. There have been no attempted coups at other nonprofits, no banners bearing the seal of the mighty oak's seed raised above the ramparts of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. By all accounts, the organization that shattered in the spring of 2010 remains in pieces.And yet. On Tuesday, House negotiators unveiled a bill to fend off a looming government shutdown that included the following ominous provision:""None of the funds made available under this or any other Act, or any prior Appropriations Act, may be provided to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, allied organizations, or successors."" A mere four months ago, it appeared that the long Republican crusade against ACORN was at an end. None of the piecemeal House appropriations bills funding various parts of the government had included anti-ACORN language. The GOP, it seemed, was finally laying down arms against the phantom menace.But the so-called cromnibus proves Republicans have not lost their resolve.At this point in history, educated persons of all backgrounds are familiar with the saga of ACORN and the House GOP. But it is a good story, one that bears repeating.Congress cut off federal funding for ACORN in late 2009, after a selectively edited video from conservative provocateur James O'Keefe appeared to show its employees aiding tax-dodging schemes for prostitution. Subsequent government investigations cleared ACORN of wrongdoing, but the PR blow proved fatal, and the organization closed in the spring of 2010. The mere demise of ACORN, of course, didn't end the Republican assault. The House GOP over and over blocked federal funding to ACORN in appropriations bills, ultimately voting more than a dozen times to prevent the non-existent entity from receiving taxpayer money. The most recent attack came in January, when House Republicans included four riders to prevent federal funds from flowing to ACORN in their omnibus appropriations bill. Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee explained to HuffPost in 2013 that the anti-ACORN language was essentially legislative boilerplate, routinely inserted into every appropriations bill that came out of a few subcommittees. Hing stopped responding to requests for comment on HuffPost's ACORN funding stories after four or five iterations, and declined to comment for this article as well.There are plenty of controversial provisions in the cromnibus. Progressive Democrats are fuming over a provision that Wall Street lobbyists secured providing taxpayer backing for risky derivatives trades. Conservative Republicans believe the bill does not sufficiently punish President Barack Obama for his recent executive action shielding millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. The legislation may survive, and it may falter. All things must pass.The war on ACORN shall endure."

Much is traded secretly, not through shops.Ivory carving and sale is legal in China but is meant to be tightly controlled. China only permits 37 companies to work with ivory and in 2013 only 145 outlets were allowed to sell ivory. Collection cards are needed for identification of legally sold ivory.However, a report, ""China Faces a Conservation Challenge"" by Kenya-based Save The Elephants and the British-based Aspinall Foundation said 26.5 percent of the thousands of elephant ivory items on sale in Beijing and Shanghai were illegal.""Many small shops that do not have licenses to sell elephant ivory items are doing so,"" said the report's authors, who visited 303 outlets selling elephant and mammoth ivory in Shanghai and Beijing.They found that the value of ivory has tripled since 2010, pointing to surging demand among Chinese buyers.In Beijing the price of a 1-5 kg tusk rose to about $2,100 in 2014 from about $750 in 2010.The Chinese government has in the past said it is committed to helping end poaching in Africa, where about 22,000 elephants were illegally killed in 2012, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).CITES banned trade in elephant ivory in 1989 but later allowed a limited amount to be sold.

But in a difficult economy, can the public afford its annual spending spree? From the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research archives:How much do we spend?The amount of money individuals plan to spend on holiday gifts ranges considerably. In an October Gallup poll, 34% said they expected to spend under $500 on gifts for family and friends. Another 21% expected to spend between $500-999, and 28% anticipated $1000 or more. Seventeen percent couldn't hazard a guess. Not surprisingly, spending is linked to income. Among those who reported an annual income under $30,000, just 11% thought they would spend $1000, but among those making $70,000 or more, 45% did. This poll is the most recent in a series on holiday spending that Gallup has been conducting since the late 1980s. The proportion of Americans saying they spent over $1000 on gifts increased substantially for nearly twenty years, starting at 18% in 1989 and rising to a peak of 34% in 2006. The recession starting in 2008 caused a drop in this number, but the figure has since climbed back to 28%.Respondents who indicated how much they would be spending each year were also asked if that amount was higher, lower, or about the same as what they had spent in the year before. In most years, over half anticipated spending the same, with slightly more expecting to show increased restraint than intending to indulge more lavishly. But the recession affected responses in this area as well, with 45% in 2008 planning lower spending. That proportion has since returned to pre-2008 levels. A 2013 CNBC poll asked those who expected to spend less on Christmas that year than the previous to tell in their own words the main reasons they were planning to cut back. About a quarter said they had a lower income than the year before, 22% cited general concerns about the economy, 16% wanted to save, and 14% said they had had trouble paying bills.How do we afford it?Christmas spending on not just gifts, but also entertaining, decorating and travel, comes on top of the usual bills and financial obligations. While 48% in a 2013 CNBC poll said they did not need to make any adjustments to their spending to cover the increased costs associated with the holidays, others were planning to spend less on things like eating out, travel, or entertainment. Seven percent intended to spend less on credit card or other debt payments. In the same poll, about one in five admitted they would use credit cards to make purchases and would not pay off the debt right away. A significant share of Americans will enter the shopping season already bearing credit card debt. A 2013 Allstate/National Journal poll found 38% of Americans carry at least some credit card debt, while 20% said in a July 2014 NBC/WSJ poll that they carried more than $2000 in credit card debt that they were unable to pay off each month.   Father Christmas, bring me some money - or at least some economic securityThough Americans may be planning to spend much as they did before the recession, the financial picture for many this season is not all rosy. Last year, 39% of respondents in a CNN/ORC International poll said current economic conditions would make the Christmas season more stressful than in previous years. Forty-one percent of those who report an annual income of less than $50,000 said the holiday would be more stressful, while 27% of those with an income of $75,000 or more said so. Those who find it hard to be merry in the current economic climate have good reasons. Despite job growth and improvements in the stock market, a sizable share of the public report that over the past year, they have suffered from serious financial problems, like layoffs, difficulty paying rent or mortgage, and problems with credit or collection agencies. Almost no Americans see their income rising faster than the cost of living, while a majority believe they are falling behind. Twenty-five percent in a September Fannie Mae poll saw their monthly household costs as significantly higher than last year. Given these financial troubles, meeting expectations for a jolly Yuletide may be difficult for many Americans this year."

This is the most important step we can take to ensure healthy, productive lives for our children and their children. For many years, governors and mayors across America have been united in our commitment to healthy cities and states. Many have long recognized that climate change -- fueled largely by mankind's use of fossil fuels -- threatens the health and welfare of people who live in our cities, suburbs, and rural areas. Scientists repeatedly have documented those dangers in reports, each more dire than the last. For instance, last May the authoritative National Climate Assessment (NCA) concluded that climate change ""is already affecting the American people in far-reaching ways,"" including more frequent and/or intense extreme weather events, more acidic oceans, and rising sea levels.Energy security is the most important issue facing the United States, and the Clean Power Plan is a way forward for a massive public and private investment to develop new technologies, particularly renewable technology.As governor, I knew that we had to move New Mexico forward in several important areas, including clean energy. As a champion of addressing the threat of climate change, I took direct action to make New Mexico the ""Clean Energy State"" by requiring utilities to meet 20 percent of New Mexico's electrical demand from renewable sources; and established a Renewable Energy Transmission Authority to deliver New Mexico's world-class renewable resources to market. Because on the flip side, we know that moving away from dirty fossil fuels and towards energy efficiency and renewable energy is a win-win-win: reducing the instances of asthma and other diseases caused by air pollution; protecting us from extreme weather and severe drought; all while adding potentially millions of good jobs in moving away from fossil fuels and towards a clean energy economy. In short, by embracing the fight against climate change, we can help make the United States a leader in clean energy jobs and economic opportunity, as well as environmental protection.Just last month, President Obama announced a historic agreement with China to cut carbon emissions. This climate change deal is set to see China peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and aim to get 20 percent of its energy from zero-carbon emission sources that year. With the two largest economies, and two largest polluters in the world tackling climate change, it's time for everyone else to step up and join the fight.For all those reasons, the EPA's proposed standards on carbon emissions from existing power plants are crucial and should be strongly supported by our community. Reducing the harmful, and currently unlimited, pollution released into the air by coal-fired power plants will allow our families to continue to enjoy clean air and natural beauty for generations to come. We must act now for the sake of our children and grandchildren.As a former governor, I know first-hand the impacts of drought in the Southwest, and more extreme weather on state and local government's ability protect our constituents' wellbeing. Every one of us should raise our voices in support of the EPA's important work to reduce carbon pollution across our country. Our children and future generations will remember that, in the time of crisis, we took action to protect them from the worst impacts of climate change."
