If people are still gonna try to make it happen, it’s not gonna happen. I think that’s a good PSA to do,"" said actor Jonathan Bennett. ""Stop trying to make fetch happen! It hasn’t happened because you're trying to make it happen.""Though you may know him best as Lindsay Lohan's ""Mean Girls"" crush Aaron Samuels, Bennett has actually been all over Hollywood lately. The actor is now hosting Food Network's new show ""Cake Wars,"" which he promises has ""ten thousand times"" the suspense of ""Cupcake Wars,"" and is also acting in a number of other shows, including the final season of MTV's ""Awkward."" Bennett recently opened up to The Huffington Post about his new hosting gig, his acting roles and even those reports that he was against a ""Mean Girls"" reunion:You're hosting ""Cake Wars"" now, so we have to know: Is butter a carb? According to Regina George and the judges of ""Cake Wars,"" we have concluded that butter is a carb. And it’s also delicious. Food competition shows always seem to come down to the last second, but what's it really like? I'm not gonna lie to you. When I started, I thought exactly what some people at home might think where they stage stuff and create the drama. I was totally blown away and totally wrong ... When you have a cake artist trying to create the stuff they're creating in only 4 hours, things are bound to go wrong. When I'm counting down from 10, I'm actually watching them put the finishing touches on the cake. And there are so many times that I hold my breath.If cakes were at war, which would win? German chocolate. I mean, according to history. I would have to say German chocolate. Do people always tell you when it's October 3rd? October 3rd is national ""Mean Girls"" day. My social media blows up!What can fans look forward to on the final season of ""Awkward""? They're gonna be able to look forward to seeing where Jenna (Ashley Rickards) ends up in her job and how that translates into her future. I play Jenna's new boss for her summer internship, and I put her through the wringer... he’s a really funny, quirky and out-of-this-world character. I'm so excited to be playing him. There were a bunch of reports that you're against a ""Mean Girls"" reunion. What's the deal there? To clear the record, it’s not that I don’t want to have a ""Mean Girls"" reunion. I'm just tired about everyone asking about it. Because if I knew, you would know. It’s not that I don’t want there to be a reunion. It’s just I don’t know when, so that’s what I always say. ""Mean Girls"" reunions are like ""fetch."" [laughs].""Cake Wars"" premieres Monday, June 29th at 8:00 p.m. ET on Food Network."

Rose's efforts to finally make it to the Hall of Fame had been getting some traction earlier in the year, but that has changed now. The new information regarding Pete Rose is only of the ethics scandals that has hit baseball in the last few weeks. The other is the news that the St. Louis Cardinals had hacked into the Houston Astros internal network, giving them access to private information and communication between Astro front office personnel.These incidents might be lumped together under the collective notion of ethics violations or breaking the rules, but there are some real differences in both the actions and the likely consequences. Rose bet on baseball, thus violating a cardinal, excuse the pun, rule of big league baseball. Every player knows that this is unequivocally forbidden in the baseball. Rose has been punished for this with lifetime ban from baseball that includes keeping him out of the Hall of Fame despite his extraordinary career and his position as baseball's all time hit leader. While this punishment is reasonable given how clear these rules are, there is another side to it. By betting on baseball, although never against his team, Rose never sought an unfair advantage over another team or player or endangered his or anybody else's health or safety. The same cannot be said about the Cardinals actions. Hacking into another companies computer system is, according to many, illegal. Moreover, it was part of an effort to gain an advantage over the Astros by breaking the rules. The technical term for trying to gain an advantage by breaking the rules is cheating. This is true even if the Astros are a bad team in the other league.It is not yet clear what consequences the Cardinals will face for this offense, but the chances of anybody getting banned from baseball for life is very small. There are several reasons for this. The people involved in the Cardinal hacking scandal are peripheral front office personnel, rather than star players. This also is the first case of this kind in baseball so MLB policies on computer related cheating is still largely undefined. Lastly, from a baseball angle, although what the Cardinals did was not legal or kosher, the impact of this on play on the field is not clear. This, of course, is also true of what Rose did.There is, however, another reason. Pete Rose as a player and manager was gruff, a little sleazy and linked to disreputable characters from the gambling world. The St. Louis Cardinals, on the other hand, are the best organization in baseball. We know this because the media reminds us of this all the time and because their manager wrote a book called ""The Matheny Manifesto: A Young Manager's Old-School Views on Success in Sports and Life."" I have not read the book but am looking forward to the chapter on how to successfully lose in the post-season to teams that you had been expected to beat.There have been cases of teams cheating in the past. In 1951 the New York Giants allegedly had a system of stealing signs that contributed to their great comeback forcing a playoff against the Brooklyn Dodgers and leading to Bobby Thomson's famous home run, that may also have been the result of stealing signs. This information came to light long after 1951 making it impossible for baseball to do anything about it. More recently, in 1981, Seattle Mariners manager Maury Wills extended the batter's box closer to home plate so his players would have an easier time hitting late breaking curve balls. Wills was caught, received a modest fine and suspension and, a few weeks later, was fired by the Mariners.The Cardinal case is different than the Giants case because baseball is in a position to do something about it while the relevant actors are still with the team and different from the Wills case because it involves more than one person. Moreover, it is not yet clear how widespread the knowledge of this hacking was within the Cardinal system. It is an unequivocal blemish on a franchise that, spin and self-righteousness notwithstanding, is one of the premier teams of the last 10-15 years.It is important that baseball send a clear message, not simply a punitive one to the Cardinals, but one that makes it apparent that high tech cheating will not be tolerated. To downplay the problem, let the Cardinals handle it internally or hope that it goes away, the directions in which the issue looks to be going now, would be a big mistake. It would confirm baseball's timidity, open the door to further cheating and demonstrate again that in the commissioner's office too frequently everything is personal."
2,POLITICS,Same-Sex Marriage Advocates Still Fighting To Change Minds,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gay-marriage-opponents_n_7682086.html,,2015-06-28,"Same-sex marriage supporters hold up balloons that spell the words ""love wins"" as they stand in front of the White House, which is lit up in rainbow colors in commemoration of the Supreme Court's ruling to legalize same-sex marriage, on Friday, June 26, 2015, in Washington. Gay and lesbian couples in Washington and across the nation are celebrating Friday's ruling, which will put an end to same-sex marriage bans in the 14 states that still maintain them. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb90254210000d601c97207.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When same-sex marriage bans were overturned in the Supreme Court on Friday it marked a major victory for LGBT advocates. But there's more to be done to change the minds of Americans who still oppose marriage equality, advocates said Sunday. ""Our laws have to treat everyone equally, and that's what this ruling grants LGBT Americans, but we also have to acknowledge there are still folks who are coming along,"" Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ""But that is truly the lesson of this movement,"" he continued. ""As LGBT people have lived their lives openly and out at home, at work, at school and church, it has changed folks' minds."" A majority of Americans support gay marriage, but about 40 percent still oppose it, and LGBT people still face discrimination in a number of other ways. ""The work is not done,"" said Evan Wolfson, president of the pro-marriage equality group Freedom to Marry, on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday. ""We have won the freedom to marry in the law, but we need to harness the conversation,"" Wolfson said. Mary Bonauto of Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, a legal rights nonprofit, expects her services will still be needed in the fight against discrimination, she said in an interview that aired on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday. ""I do believe that the work goes on to ensure that the way that we live our lives and the way people treat us, we're not singled out for different treatment because of who we are,"" she said. That's not to say LGBT advocates aren't celebrating. In the same interview with NBC, Greg Bourke and Michael DeLeon, two of the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court case, said it will be a ""big win"" to be able to have both of their names on their adopted children's birth certificates. Jim Obergefell, another plaintiff, said the ruling wouldn't end his advocacy, even though he will now be able to achieve his goal of having his name listed on the death certificate of his late husband, John Arthur.""I've discovered that fighting for something that's bigger than me is very important to me and I will continue, like Evan [Wolfson] said, to be involved in the fight for non-discrimination, to make sure that the LGBT community across the country truly is equal part of society and deserving of all the same rights and protections,"" he said on ""This Week.""

But it also was a great victory for something that rests right at the heart of the human experience, the paramount legal doctrine of M.Y.O.B. Mind Your Own Business. Reporters love to generate controversy. In a TV interview on Friday, a reporter asked me, ""What do you have to say to all of the millions of opponents of gay marriage?"" I replied thusly: ""Mind your own business."" OK, I'll admit that that response will not earn me the Nobel Peace Prize. But I'm making an important point here. What difference does it make to Person X if Person Y marries Person Z? Seriously. I sometimes give a speech where I go through a mock agenda for a Tea Party conference. One of the items on the agenda, from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m., is a colloquium on ""How Gay Marriage Destroyed My Straight Marriage,"" moderated by No One. And attended by No One. (Now that I think about it, most Tea Partiers who might attend that colloquium wouldn't know what a colloquium is. And for sure, they couldn't spell it. Or as they would write, ""spel it."") Let's face it: Whenever anyone sticks his nose into other people's business, something bad happens. The war in Iraq. The NSA spying on everyone because I-don't-know-why. Chinese cyberattacks. Even the Patriots stealing opponents' signals. Hey, everyone, just mind your own business! One of the basic functions of the U.S. Supreme Court, which we just saw in spades, is to prevent a prejudiced majority from employing the law as a device to stick their noses into the business of ""discrete, insular minorities."" That phrase comes from the most famous footnote in U.S. Supreme Court history, footnote 4 of the decision United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144 (1938). Here's the good part: ""[P]rejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and which may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry..."" (Congratulations, you just passed the bar exam. Now good luck finding a job.) In Carolene terms, the LGBT community is a discrete, insular minority. Prejudice against gays means that they cannot rely exclusively on political processes to protect them from prejudice and inequality. Therefore, in Friday's decision, after a ""searching judicial inquiry,"" the U.S. Supreme Court did so. Q.E.D. So Friday's decision was not merely a victory for our LGBT friends. It was a quantum leap forward in how we see each other- - with a very healthy respect. We mind our own business. Or, as Pope Francis put it, ""Who am I to judge?"" A very good question, for all of us. Courage, Rep. Alan Grayson ""It doesn't matter much to me."" -- The Beatles, ""Strawberry Fields Forever."" (1968)."

Ace fighter pilots came to be regarded as folk heroes. Publicized in the popular press, they soon became larger than life characters. Their planes were no less famous. Most of the classic aircraft of World War I were fighters. One of the most famous was Anthony Fokker's E1 ""Eindecker."" Throughout 1915 and into early 1916, the highly successful Eindeckers were the scourge of the Western Front, wreaking havoc amongst the under-armed Allied pilots. Built in four models, the Eindeckers had progressively more powerful engines and were all fitted with LMG 08 Spandau machine guns. These fired through the propeller arc.The term ""ace"" was first applied by French newspapers to describe the exploits of Adolphe Célestin Pégoud. He was the first pilot to shoot down five enemy aircraft. Pégoud was also the first pilot to jump successfully from an airplane using a parachute. He was also the first pilot to complete a loop, the first case of flying while inverted. It's not clear why the term ""Ace"" came to be used other than for the fact that in popular culture the ""ace"" in a deck of cards was considered the highest ranking card and the term had come to be used as an expression of excellence especially when applied to sports. Nor is it clear why five victories came to be the prerequisite for achieving ""ace"" status. Initially, the term ""ace"" was only used by the French air force. The British Royal Flying Corps used the term ""star-turns"", a show business term for a successful performer in London's West End theater district. The German's used the expression ""Uberkanonen"" to designate their top pilots. The term translates roughly into ""top gun"". Prerequisites for achieving ""ace"" status also varied. In some instances it required ""confirmed kills"" committed solo, in other instances shared kills were counted. Initially, simply forcing an enemy aircraft to land was counted in achieving 'ace"" status but eventually this was changed to ""confirmed kills"". In total, over 1,800 pilots achieved ""ace"" status during World War I.The Eindecker produced one of the early aces of the German Army Air Service, or Luftstreitkrafte, Lieutenant Max Immelmann. He developed the ""Immelmann Turn"" in 1915. The maneuver allowed him to use the speed of a diving attack to loop and half-roll to regain height and engage again. The ""Immelmann Turn"" is still a classic maneuver in air combat. Immelmann, with a score of 17 ""kills"" to his credit was shot down and killed in June 1916.  Albatross Bi-planesOne of the most famous of all of the World War I aces, was Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen: the ""Red Baron."" Originally a cavalryman, von Richthofen went on to command Jagdstaffein 11. The jagdstaffeln (often abbreviated to jastas) were specialized fighter squadrons in the Luftstreitkräfte during World War I. By the spring of 1917 Jasta 11 was operating red painted Albatross bi-planes and Fokker Dr.1 tri-planes. Richthofen led his unit to unparalleled success. He peaked during the month of Bloody April in 1917. In that month alone he downed 22 British aircraft, including four in a single day; raising his tally to 52. In June 1917, von Richthofen assumed command of the larger unit Jagdgeschwader controlling Jastas 4, 6, 10 and 11. These were highly mobile tactical units that could be sent on short notice to different parts of the front. For this reason they became known as the ""Flying Circus,"" its name coming both from the unit's mobility and from their use of tents, trains and trailers. On April 21, 1918, with 80 victories to his credit, von Richthofen was fatally wounded over the River Somme. He managed to land his Fokker Dr.1 but died almost immediately. The ""Red Baron"" had come down in a sector of the line controlled by the Australians and it was they who gave him a funeral with full military honors. Manfred von Richthofen with other members of Jasta 11, 1917 as part of the LuftstreitkräfteThe French air service was highly innovative and developed two great fighter families of aircraft: the Spad and later the Nieuport. Captain Rene Fonck was the leading Allied ace with a score of 75 combat victories. By 1918, Fonck was flying the Spad S 13, a more powerful version of the capable Spad S 7 he had flown earlier. He survived the war unscathed. Unlike most aces, he was never wounded, and amazingly not a single enemy bullet ever hit his aircraft. France's second highest ace, with 53 kills, was Captain Georges Guynemer. Descended from the French Bourbon kings, he was popular and a French national hero. Georges Guynemer was awarded the Medaille Militaire and two grades of the Legion d'Honneur. He had previously been shot down seven times and survived. Flying his Spad S 13 on September 11, 1917, Guynemer disappeared on a combat mission and was reported shot down behind enemy lines. His body was never recovered.  Formation Flying Over the Western FrontThe British did not give a lot of publicity to their air aces, feeling that it was detrimental to the morale of other flyers. The highest scoring ace in the Royal Flying Corps was Major Edward Mannock with 73 air victories. He was killed in his S.E. 5A in July 1918 at the age of 31. The Canadian Lieutenant Colonel William ""Billy"" Bishop was the second highest ace with 72 kills. On April 1917, flying a Nieuport 17, Bishop survived an encounter with Manfred von Richthofen. Always leading ""at the front of the pack,"" Bishop was awarded the Victoria Cross and survived the war. During World War I the United States did not produce any of its own combat aircraft, relying instead on British and French machines to equip the squadrons of the Army Air Service. Captain Edward ""Eddie"" Rickenbacker was America's top ace with 26 air victories to his credit. Formerly a racing car driver and designer, Eddie Rickenbacker had great difficulty, at first, joining the Army Air Service because of his lack of formal schooling. He was finally accepted into the 94th Aero Squadron, the ""Hat in the Ring"" squadron, which he went on to command.  American Pilot Frank LukeWith 21 ""kills,"" Second Lieutenant Frank Luke Jr. was America's second highest scoring ace. He was a crack shot but an undisciplined loner. Luke did shoot down aircraft but his specialty was balloon busting. Between the twelfth and twenty-ninth of September 1917, Luke was credited with shooting down fourteen German balloons and four airplanes. These eighteen victories, which Luke gained during just ten sorties in eight days, was a feat unsurpassed by any pilot during the war. On September 29, 1918, while attacking three more balloons, Luke was severely wounded. Despite his wounds, he landed his aircraft and fought off a German patrol with his pistol until he succumbed. Ace fighter pilots were portrayed in the popular press as the 20th century equivalent of medieval knights. Their exploits may also be the origins of the concept of the ""super hero"". That term, which first became prominent in 1917, would go on to spawn a broad category of popular literature."

From The Guardian: ""Schumer’s stand-up repeatedly delves into racial territory tactlessly and with no apparent larger point. Her standup special features jokes like “Nothing works 100% of the time, except Mexicans” and much of her character’s dumb slut persona is predicated on the fact that the men she sleeps with are people of colour. ""I used to date Latino guys,” she says in an older stand-up routine. “Now I prefer consensual.” Schumer's response didn't mention the Guardian article directly, but said: “You can call it a ‘blind spot for racism’ or ‘lazy’ but you are wrong.”The Guardian isn't the first to take issue with the way the comic approaches race. A Daily Dot article published last week made similar claims. Schumer also drew criticism for a joke she made about ""Gone Girl"" and Latinas while hosting the 2015 MTV Movie Awards in April."

The so-called Freedom Flotilla III -- a convoy of ships carrying pro-Palestinian activists, at least one European lawmaker and an Arab-Israeli MP -- will try to reach the shores of the Gaza Strip by the end of the month. AFP PHOTO / MAHMUD HAMS (Photo credit should read MAHMUD HAMS/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc151bf240000330022a158.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Supporters of continuing the Israeli occupation of Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem would like global public opinion to believe that the occupation can be maintained and yet Israel can be considered a democracy. A central challenge of occupation opponents is to expose and exacerbate the contradiction between democracy and occupation in mainstream international political discourse. The #FreedomFlotilla III sailing to challenge the Gaza blockade is providing an excellent opportunity to expose the true face of anti-democratic, pro-occupation political actors in international media. The Jerusalem Post reports:Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid on Saturday denounced those taking part in the flotilla to Gaza as ""a gang of supporters of terrorism"" and a ""despicable flotilla that needs to be stopped.""In U.S. media descriptions of Israeli politics, Lapid is routinely described as an Israeli ""centrist."" For example, in this June 22 Politico article:Multiple Israeli officials also condemned Oren's essay. Former Finance Minister and leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party Yair Lapid told an Israeli news source that Oren's piece was ""pseudo-psychological analysis based on nothing"" and Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely told Walla! News that his article ""does not represent Israeli policy.""Who are the people that the ""centrist"" Lapid called ""a gang of terrorism supporters"" that Israel needs to ""deal with"" as if it were ""trying to disperse a violent protest""? Participants in the #FreedomFlotilla III include the former President of Tunisia, Moncef Marzouki; Israeli Knesset Member Basel Ghattas; Spanish Member of the European Parliament Ana Miranda; Jordanian Member of Parliament Yahya Abo Soud; and Moroccan Member of Parliament Abouzaid El Mokrie El Idrissi.Responding to the attacks of right-wing Israeli politicians on the participation of MK Ghattas, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz editorialized: MKs are elected to represent the positions of their parties and the public that elected them... All MKs must remember that Ghattas is entitled to convey his views in a nonviolent manner, whether by defiant expression or through protest activities like the flotilla... it is important to remember that the purpose of the flotilla is to break the blockade that Israel has imposed on Gaza, which continues an unacceptable situation in which nearly two million people are closed up as if in a cage. Instead of ""killing the messenger,"" who is trying to increase awareness of an ongoing injustice, it would behoove the State of Israel to remove the blockade and help rebuild the Gaza Strip.Retired IDF Major General Shlomo Gazit, who was head of IDF military intelligence, has called on the Netanyahu government to leave the flotilla alone. He wrote in Haaretz:The ship that is currently making its way toward Gaza...isn't carrying military cargo. It is seeking to focus world attention on the blockade that Israel is imposing on the 1.8 million residents of the Gaza Strip...The world is accusing us of still maintaining Gaza under military occupation. We, in turn, are seeking to prove that we have withdrawn, but we haven't disengaged. We continue to control everything going in and out, and that is a continuation of an occupation government.If you think that Secretary of State Kerry should side with Haaretz and Major General Gazit rather than with Lapid, and press to avert any Israeli military attack on the flotilla, you can tell Secretary Kerry so here."

It came in a tub and smelled like fantastic, exotic honey mixed with an oud-inflected perfume ... and it cost $140. I didn't even bother trying it -- I figured the only people even remotely pleased to hear about such a thing were the mostly male-patterned-bald bankers who'd just plunged the world into economic disaster and gotten away with it; even if some of them did have hair, I was in no mood to make a single one of them happy. But my friend with flat, unvolumizable hair started exclaiming over it, exclaiming and exclaiming and exclaiming anew. Then another friend with overcolored, slightly frizzy hair started raving, too -- her daughter chimed in: ""Mommy's hair is finally smooth and pretty."" My hair is sort of normal, but I had to try it. And: It made my hair -- better. A touch of volume, a touch of smoothness, some shine ... However ineffable its effects, I'd be standing in the shower and I'd think, Well, do I NEED to look especially good today? If the answer was yes, I went with the Russian Amber.Related: How to Get Miley Cyrus's Glitter-Streaked Hair This is how you know. If you have to have it on the day you need to look better than you do on all the other days (and are willing to fork over the billions it costs) it's the One, for sure. Desperation, then, is the ultimate test. If I must have fantastic skin on a particular morning, I put Prevage Night from Elizabeth Arden on the night before; I only use it rarely, lest the magical effect (glowier, smoother, mystically dewy-fresh skin, reportedly powered by proprietary antioxidants in the formula) fade. Not that I haven't tried every supposed skin miracle that's come along; it's just the Prevage -- also in Philip B price territory, at $136, though you go through it less quickly -- is always better.I also believe in love at first sight. The minute I applied the YSL Sheer Candy in Pomegranate -- it looks like a chic French lipstick in the vein of Catherine Deneuve, but is inexplicably both transparent and intensely pigmented so it brightens anyone's entire face, without looking like ... lipstick -- I knew it was a forever thing. Every so often I force myself to try something that vaguely resembles it, and it's never as good. And sometimes the romance is based on the irrefutable evidence that it's just plain good for you: Even though I have breakout-prone skin, I threw some serious fuel on the face-oil fire in its early days. The Shu Uemura Cleansing Oil convinced me that oils could actually benefit the greasy-complected; I tried every oil I could find, when one day I happened upon Intelligent Nutrients (the all-organic line from Aveda-founder Horst Rechelbacher) Oil Serum. Not only did it make my skin look and feel better, I somehow developed the practice of dabbing a bit of it on over my makeup whenever I looked tired before going out, instead of adding more makeup. I liked it, but it was only when I gave some to a friend recovering from a botched Mohs surgery on her face -- she'd been told there was no way she'd escape a major scar -- and it utterly obliterated any sign of surgery whatsoever that I fell fully and irreparably in love. Since then, the world has embraced the face oil, but still, there is only one for me.

Trump made headlines with his recent presidential announcement, and many of them were for remarks that were insulting to Latinos and immigrants. ""The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everyone else's problems,"" he said. ""When Mexico sends its people, they're bringing those problems. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting."" That was two weeks ago, and the furor over Trump's comments shows no signs of going away. Latino groups have rightfully reacted with anger to his bigotry. Trump has damaged his own brand, and created a headache for the Republican Party. He is quickly becoming an example of how not to deal with a political and public relations disaster. Trump has no one to blame but himself for the ongoing controversy. If he had shown a basic level of respect for Latinos, then he would not be facing growing outrage in the Hispanic community. Univision cancelled its contract to air the Trump-owned Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants. The two Latino co-hosts of the upcoming Miss USA broadcast both quit in protest, as did the scheduled musical guest. Now a coalition of the nation's leading Hispanic advocacy groups is lobbying NBC to cut ties with Trump. But The Donald has so far refused to say the two words that could alter his recent barrage of bad press: I'm sorry.What Trump doesn't realize is that this is a fight he cannot win. He has already lost, because his incendiary words will surely prove bad for business. According to his website, in addition to the high-end residential properties for which he is well-known, Trump lends his name to hotels, casinos, books, spring water, men's wear, eye wear, a modeling agency, and golf courses. He can legitimately be called a mogul. Yet he is demonstrating bad business acumen by not fully apologizing for his remarks and moving on. Instead, he is railing against Univision (he has vowed to sue the network) and sparring with Telemundo anchor Jose Diaz-Balart on TV. It is as though Trump is unaware of the huge spending power of Hispanic consumers - Nielsen estimates it at $1.2 trillion -- or he simply doesn't care. Fact is, the American public is generally forgiving of all kinds of behavior. In 2012, Mitt Romney damaged his presidential hopes with his ""47 percent"" comments. Hillary Clinton once made an insensitive joke about Indian Americans. Then they both did the right thing, and apologized for their words. Making a public apology is almost a rite of passage for celebrities and politicians nowadays, for everyone from Paula Deen to Joe Biden to Reese Witherspoon. If a true test of character is how we handle our own failings, Trump is failing miserably. By refusing to disown his comments, Trump is harming himself, his family, and his supporters. It's too easy to dismiss Trump as an ego-inflated sideshow to the 2016 race. But consider that he is currently polling in second place behind Jeb Bush among New Hampshire Republicans. Or that a national Fox News poll about the 2016 race also puts him in second place. As the GOP struggles to win over Latino voters, an arrogant xenophobe like Trump is the last thing the party needs; no wonder he has been called the ""Republicans' worst nightmare."" While no one expects him to mount a credible challenge for the GOP nomination - one analysis ranked him as the ""most hated candidate"" - the luxury developer has the potential to turn the GOP primaries into a low-rent spectacle. Trump's fellow 2016 rivals have already been criticized because none of them has had the courage to denounce his hate speech. Sure, Trump has every right to take a stand against illegal immigration, and to be against immigration reform. That doesn't make his racist rant acceptable. In fact, he does the anti-immigration movement a disservice by devolving into such bigotry. And in a week marked by a historic win for marriage equality at the Supreme Court and a moving show of grace by President Obama at a South Carolina funeral, Trump's continued refusal to apologize for his comments seems extraordinarily tone deaf and ill-advised. ""The Donald"" ought to apologize to Latinos and other Americans for his divisive remarks. If not, Trump will become increasingly synonymous with bad judgment, bad politics, and bad business."

Greece is also set to impose capital controls that will limit the amount of funds that citizens can transfer or withdraw from its financial institutions.Tsipras made the address hours after the European Central Bank stated it would not increase the levels of emergency credit, known as emergency liquidity assistance, that it provides to Greek banks in order for the institutions to keep running. The prime minister blamed the ECB for forcing Greece to impose the measures, which are intended to prevent a bank run by Greeks from draining the country's remaining funds.No information was given as to the specifics of the controls or the limits that may be placed on ATMs, which have already seen long lines of people seeking to take out their cash. Over 1 billion euros have been withdrawn from the Greek banking system since Friday night, Agence France-Presse reported.""I would withdraw money today, anyway.

Eurozone finance ministers denied that request, significantly raising the likelihood that Greece could default on its debts and be forced out of the euro currency.  Tuesday is the deadline for Greece to pay off a 1.6 billion euro debt to the IMF, something the nation currently does not have the money to do. The nation and its creditors have been negotiating for months to extend the bailout program and release a 7.2 billion euro tranche of its funds that would allow the Greeks to pay off forthcoming debts. Disagreements over creditors' demands for strict austerity cuts to Greece's public spending and economic reforms have resulted in continual breakdowns in the talks.If Greece cannot make Tuesday's payment then it will default, which could have potentially disastrous effects on its economy and put it on a path to exit the eurozone. U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the crisis on Sunday, with the White House saying that the two leaders agreed it was ""critically important"" to keep Greece in the euro, Reuters reported. EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker announced that there would be a news conference on Monday to discuss the crisis, as officials from creditor organizations insisted that a deal may still be salvageable before the deadline hits.

An international sex symbol since the steamy drama ""Sex and Lucia,"" Ms. Vega didn't disappoint with her appearance, although like most actors, she's far more petite in person that she appears on-screen, or with her conversational skills, revealing a thoughtful intellect underneath the glamour. PAZ VEGA: THE CAT'S MEOWSpanish actress Paz Vega first gained international attention with her smart, sexy turn in Julio Medem's Sex and Lucia (2001), as a free-spirited young woman who finds personal liberation through a torrid affair after the loss of her boyfriend. The film's lush visuals (which included Vega's incandescent beauty) and sexual frankness raised eyebrows and heart rates in filmgoers everywhere. Vega soon found herself one of Europe's biggest stars, appearing in over 30 productions, including Almodovar's Talk to Her (2002), and making her American debut in James L. Brooks' serio-comedy Spanglish (2004). Born in Seville January 2, 1976, Paz Vega was fascinated by the movies from a young age. Inheriting a theatrical flair from her father, a former bullfighter, she cut her teeth on Spanish television in the late 1990s before landing her first feature role in Zapping (1999). Married to Venezuelan businessman Orson Salazar, Paz Vega now makes her home in Madrid with her husband and three children and is an international icon of fashion, style and beauty. Vega moves into action heroine territory with her latest cinematic effort, John Stockwell's Cat Run, a comedic thriller in which a young mother (Vega) finds herself pursued by a tenacious assassin (Janet McTeer, wonderful) after witnessing a massacre during a sex party in Montenegro. Aided on her journey by two awkward, but loveable, twenty-somethings (Scott Mechlowicz and Alphonso McAuley), this cat-and-mouse game deftly blends suspense, comedy and buckets of movie blood. Distributed by Paladin and LLjeu Productions, the film opens Friday, April 1. Paz Vega sat down with us during a recent stop in Los Angeles. Here's what transpired: This is a real change of pace for you: a pure action movie.Paz Vega: When I read the script, I said 'Wow, this is a cool movie.' I'd never done this kind of movie before and after I spoke with (director) John Stockwell on the phone, I said 'Let's do it. Let's go to Montenegro.' Had you been to that part of Eastern Europe before?I'd been to Serbia, shooting another movie, but I'd never been to Montenegro. It was amazing people, great food, twist my arm. (laughs) It was awesome. What spoke to you about this particular character? What part of yourself did you see in her? Well, I'm a mother, first of all. Also, she's the one who carries the drama. She's trying to save herself and save her baby. But the movie's a comedy! So you try to find the perfect balance between the two, and she's really the character who holds all that together, so that really appealed to me. It was a challenge.  Cat Run. Did you like the comedy or the drama better?The comedy. (laughs) I loved jumping into the comedy. It's true when they say...how do they say it in English? ""Dying is easy, but comedy is hard?"" Yes, that's it! Thank you. (laughs) Comedy is so hard, but it's what's hard that makes the work rewarding. Also, as a mother I know when someone wants to do something harmful to your kids, you can become a wolf, an animal. You'll do anything to save your baby, and you can do anything. So that's what was compelling for me. Not because she was a sexy girl on the run, but because she wanted to save her baby.  Cat Run. This is the most physical part you've ever done. Was that difficult? It was physical, but I didn't need any extra training. I did do all my own stunts and own driving. We drove without permission sometimes. (laughs) But I enjoyed that. It was great fun. Your director, John Stockwell, was originally an actor. Is it a different experience working with a director who understands acting from that perspective? It was different, but in a good way. He knows exactly what you need. He knows exactly what he has to tell you to find what he wants. It was very easy. Sometimes you have a director who is shy, or doesn't know how to explain what they want. This is the second time I've worked with a director who was originally an actor. The other was Jada Pinkett Smith on Human Contact. It was the same. She knew exactly what she had to tell you. When I was young, I directed a play. I was a drama teacher for kids. I know that if I directed something now, I would know what to tell them.  Cat Run. Do you want to direct? Maybe. We'll see. (laughs)So you understand the process. Yes. Let's talk about your background. You were born and raised in Seville. Were any of your other family members in the arts?My younger sister, my only sister, is an amazing singer. She has a beautiful voice and is preparing her next album right now. She's also a flamenco dancer. Did both your parents work when you were growing up? My mother stayed at home, and my father was a bullfighter.Was he a famous bullfighter? I know in Spain, bullfighters are as famous as movie stars.  He was pretty well-known when he was young, he was a main bullfighter, a matador, the guy who faces the bull. But as he got older, he became one of the guys who works along with the matador. He was the guy who put the swords in the bull. But I understand if, as an American, you might not understand that or think it was okay. I actually love going to bullfights, and didn't think I would originally, because I also love animals. But I've been to that beautiful ring in Seville where your father worked and seen a bullfight. It was amazing, and majestic. They really honor the bull in the ring, and the animal goes out with a lot more dignity than if he were just being raised for slaughter. It is amazing and majestic. When the bull is killed, it's quick, and with no pain. You have to understand that the bull is raised just for that, and is treated like a king during its life. And all the meat is given away to the poor after the fight. What's better, to be raised in a cage where you never see the light and get to roam and be natural? Because that's the animal that we usually eat in a restaurant. You just have to be more open to understand. I know a lot of people might read this and take exception to what I'm saying, but we're not murderers or barbarians in Spain with our tradition of bullfighting. I've never felt that way. Anytime I'm in Spain or Mexico, I try to find a bull ring and get myself a beer and a cigar and spend the afternoon. Hemingway had it right. Yes, the bull has a good finale, especially because he winds up feeding people who need a good meal.Back to growing up in Seville. When did you know you were an actress? Was there one inciting incident? I was a competitive swimmer as a child, then one day I went to the theater to watch a play, and I had a revelation. I was sixteen. It was called La Casa de Bernarda Alba, by Federico Garcia Lorca. After that, it was so clear in my life what I wanted to do. But when I was young, I remember my father saying ""Okay, let's go to bed"" at eight. But I would keep the door open a crack, and watch the old black & white movies my parents would be watching on TV, and I would love that! Cary Grant, Lauren Bacall...Lauren Bacall is the last one now, isn't she? Yeah, now that Elizabeth Taylor is gone. So I was fond of old movies from the beginning. It was always there. You started off acting in television. Yes, and that was great training. You can watch yourself and keep changing an evolving your character every work. This movie, I did it a year and two months ago, and now I see it, and I cannot change anything. But with a TV show, you can keep changing and evolving your character, and that's great. It's closer to the theater. Yes, it is closer to the theater. And my second show on TV was with a live audience. We'd rehearse Monday through Wednesday, then on Thursday we'd shoot with a live audience for two hours, and the show was an hour long when it was cut together.  Sex and Lucia. The first film I saw you in was Sex and Lucia, which made you an international star. Was it difficult being so young and performing such sexually-frank scenes? Yes, well, I was twenty-four, but yes, I was young. I read the script and it was a scary experience for me, for several reasons. I cried when I finished it, because I thought, 'This is the most beautiful role I've ever seen before,' but you have to feel free to play a role like that. You have to just take the jump and say 'Okay, whatever you want, I'm free.' And I decided to do that. The director, Julio Medem, and I made this deal that I would be completely free and open, and I think it's a really beautiful movie. I'm very proud of it. It helped me a lot in my career. It gave me a lot of opportunities. If you want opportunities, you have to take that jump. (laughs) Your first American movie was James L. Brooks' Spanglish. What was that like? That movie was such a big studio movie, and it was so different from shooting movies in Spain. Cat Run was much similar to making movies in Spain, because it was an independent movie and was shot relatively fast. With Spanglish, we must have shot for around eight months with a lot of big sets and big trucks, and I was thinking to myself 'Wow, this is really Hollywood!' (laughs) It was quite overwhelming, but I had a great time on it.  Spanglish, with Adam Sandler. When I've interviewed actors and filmmakers from Europe in the past who've come to the States to make films, they all say the same thing: in Europe filmmaking is very much a community, and in the States it's very much a business. Yes, exactly. It is. But this is now a problem in Europe now, as well. In Spain, no one wants to see Spanish movies anymore. We like to think of ourselves as artists in Spain, when we make movies, but the audiences aren't responding to the films from their own country anymore like they used to They want to see the big American movies, like Spiderman. I understand that this is a business and you have to make money, so I understand the Hollywood mentality that films have to be commercial, but it's also nice to have some variety. Is this a recent development in Spain where people are more drawn to Hollywood movies, or has it always been that way? I think it's pretty recent. I'd say for the past five years, or so. They want to see the big Hollywood films, and for Spanish filmmakers, the box office is not going so well. Even for people like Pedro Almodovar? No. We have about five or six directors whose films are still very popular, like Almodovar. So the Spanish are weird. We're very critical of ourselves, I'd have to say.   "

16,POLITICS,10 Days That Shook the Regressive World,"Robert S. McElvaine, ContributorHistorian",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ten-days-that-shook-the-r_b_7679674.html,"It has been a bad couple of weeks for regressives (the accurate term for ""conservatives""). The 10-day period from June 18 to June 26 has been such a disastrous time for regressives that it may be looked back upon as the time when it became clear that history has passed by the ""Conservative Movement"" and left it untenable.",2015-06-28,2015-06-28-1435508829-9992018-PopeFrancisStPeters10232013.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-28-1435508829-9992018-PopeFrancisStPeters10232013-thumb.JPG,"Call Them What They Are: ""Regressives""It has been a bad couple of weeks for regressives (the accurate term that we all should start using for the people who inaccurately label themselves as ""conservatives"").Indeed, the 10-day period from June 18 to June 26 has been such a disastrous time for regressives that it may be looked back upon as the time when it became clear that history has passed by the ""Conservative Movement"" and left it untenable.The series of earthquakes that have shaken the Regressive World's foundations began on June 18, when Pope Francis issued his encyclical on the environment and climate change, Laudato Si', and continued through the racist gunman's terrorist attack on Emanuel AME Church in Charleston and the reaction to it, to the Supreme Court decisions on the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage on Thursday and Friday and President Obama's remarkable speech in his eulogy to Rev. Clementa Pinckney a few hours after the latter decision was announced.Going Up Against Science and ReligionThe Pope's encyclical links destruction of nature with such other injustices as inequality, poverty, and hunger. He called upon people around the globe to hear ""both the cry of the Earth and the cry of the poor"" resulting from ""compulsive consumerism"" and the pursuit of profit above all else. He chastised ""obstructionist"" climate change deniers who ""seem mostly to be concerned with masking the problems or concealing their symptoms.""The encyclical amounts to a nearly complete condemnation of regressive economic and social policy.The Pope's words made climate change a religious, as well as a scientific, issue. It is a question on which regressive Republicans are totally identified with the other side. As leading Catholic commentator Father Thomas Reese put it: ""Suddenly, you're not just doing it for the polar bears, you're doing it for God."" Surely the Pope's powerful declaration will shrink further the number of Americans who agree with the climate change deniers. A Pew poll taken before the papal encyclical found that only 25 percent of Americans believe that global warming is not happening and a Gallup poll in March found that 55 percent of Americans believe we are already experiencing the effects of global warming. Yet Republican presidential candidates are obliged to reject both science and the Pope in order to appeal to the party's regressive base.The ""Southern Strategy"" Has Become a LiabilityThe Charleston horror left Republicans scrambling to distance themselves from the Confederate flag and other symbols of racism that many of them have been embracing since the 1960s. There is, though, no sign that they plan to ease up on their efforts to prevent minority people from voting. They understand that the emerging diverse America is not one in which they can win elections with their current positions -- but the regressive base of their party insists that they stick with those positions. Republicans sold their soul to the devil in the late 1960s in a pact called the ""Southern Strategy."" It enabled the party to win several national elections. Satan is now demanding his payment.""The Sixties"" Have Won<To put it another way, Republicans have identified themselves since 1968 as the ""anti-Sixties party."" Now, though, on one issue after another, the Sixties have won.Beyond the justice of the two huge Supreme Court decisions this week, they leave Republicans desperately trying to appease their base by embracing increasingly unpopular positions.Opposing Obamacare Has Become a Political LiabilityThe percentage of Americans who think the Affordable Care Act should be repealed has been noticeably declining in recent months, falling to 31 percent in a CBS News/New York Times in mid-June. That poll also found, for the first time, more Americans approving (47 percent) than disapproving (44 percent) of the health care law. And in this poll prior to Friday's decision, a stunning 70 percent of all Americans (and 70 percent of independents) said the Supreme Court should allow the government to ""continue to provide financial assistance to help some low and moderate income Americans buy health insurance.""That's right: 70 percent of Americans support the Obamacare decision that every Republican presidential candidate denounced in the harshest terms. And it is almost certain that support for Obamacare will grow between now and the 2016 Election.Equal Rights for ALL: An Idea Whose Time Has ComeWhat about Friday's decision? Recent polls consistently show that 57 percent or more of Americans (and, significantly, 59 percent of independents) favor same-sex marriage.And young Republicans, like young Americans in general, are overwhelmingly in favor of same-sex marriage and full equality for LGBT people. Yet Republican presidential hopefuls are furiously competing with each other to appeal to the party's regressive base and so digging themselves ever deeper into a hole out of which it will be exceedingly difficult for them to climb.Then there were President Obama's superb speeches following the SCOTUS decision on the ACA on Thursday and, particularly, at the funeral of Rev. Pinckney on Friday. If they, combined with the continually improving economy and the extraordinarily good week the President had, do not result in his popularity increasing, it will be very surprising.A Bleak Political Landscape for RegressivesThe political landscape on other major issues is similarly bleak for regressive Republicans. A CBS News/New York Times poll in May found that 66 percent of Americans believe that ""the money and wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed among more people,"" 67 percent think ""the gap between the rich and the poor in the U.S. is getting larger,"" and 65 percent believe that ""the gap between rich and poor in this country is a problem that needs to be addressed now.""On one major issue after another, Republicans have shown themselves to be regressives who want to go backward instead of forward. And they are out of step with growing majorities of Americans on every one of them.It was, as Judith Viorst would put it, ""a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad"" 10 days for Regressives and the Republican party that they dominate. They find themselves on the wrong side of history on issue after issue and would have to change their positions across the board in order to have much hope of avoiding being consigned to the dustbin of history.--Robert S.

17,WORLDPOST,6 Facts You Didn't Know About Trade And How They Affect You,"Michael Møller , ContributorDirector General of United Nations Office at Geneva",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/six-facts-you-didnt-know_b_7680500.html,"Trade is not always the solution to poverty or fragile economies but it can help boost local economies, increase employment and bring people together. Like ships that get loaded and unloaded, we can look at Geneva as a global trade hub that discharges old trade policies",2015-06-28,2015-06-28-1435479210-2199985-Inographics_tradecr.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-28-1435479210-2199985-Inographics_tradecr-thumb.png,"The world's most impressive ports are in cities marked by trade. Although Geneva does not even have a port for container ships, it is still a global hub for trade. The World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Trade Centre (ITC) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) are at the core of this hub. But there are a number of other international organizations that work on trade-related issues including the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the South Centre and the International Labour Organization (ILO) that are anchored in Geneva.Furthermore, with over 400 trading companies, Geneva is also a big trading hub for commodities. It accounts for roughly on third of world trading in oil, rice and cereals and for about half of the global coffee and sugar trade.Our daily lives are highly influenced by trade yet we hardly think about it. Did you know that...1) Less tariffs means greater trade. Over the past 20 years, an average tariff reduction of 15% helped to quadruple trade worldwide! That has not only helped to boost local economies but also to increase the global standards for health, security and environment, which in turn increase average life expectancy.2) There is no need for trade wars. The WTO has handled over 500 trade disputes in the last two decades. This resolves conflicts and reduces trade tensions, so that trade can flow more freely and easily, which also increases your country's exports.3) Trade brings prices down. Trade liberalizing measures increased more than 60% in recent years, which has helped to bring down the prices of imports. This translates into spending less on our purchases.4) More trade means more choices. The WTO now has 161 member countries, which account for about 98% of world trade! So, the more countries get included in global trade, the greater your choice of products is when we go shopping (and the more economic growth will be stimulated)!5) Innovation fuels trade. Patent applications rose by 9% in 2013. They help extend trade and will eventually find their way into our smartphones, cars, houses or gadget which don't even exist today. Trade fights poverty. By increasing their share in world trade, least developed countries (LDCs) reduced poverty (defined as people living with less than 1,25 USD a day) from 65% of the population in 1990 to 45% in 2010! This contributed to the inclusion of more and more people into the riches of world trade, not only cutting living costs, but also raising living standards globally.It's important to note that trade is not always the solution to poverty or fragile economies but it can help boost local economies, increase employment and bring people together. Like ships that get loaded and unloaded, we can look at Geneva as a global trade hub that discharges old trade policies and replaces them with new ones so we have an updated trading system that works for all. Have a look at our infographic that gives a snapshot of the impact Geneva has on trade."

James J. Bulger."" In the film, Bulger tells his defense attorney that he was never an FBI informant, but rather had federal agents on his payroll. The documentary directed by Joe Berlinger has its premiere at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. (AP Photo/Sundance Institute, David Boeri Archives)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2c3961f00005100226fa5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"James ""Whitey"" Bulger, mobster and convicted murderer, has a simple message for the younger generation: Don't waste your life.In a letter penned in February, Bulger told three teens working on a project at a high school in Lakeville, Massachusetts, that his ""life was wasted and spent foolishly,"" bringing ""shame and suffering on my parents and siblings."" The students -- all 17-year-old juniors at Apponequet Regional High School -- were working on a website for a National History Day competition and sent Bulger a message requesting his opinion on his legacy, according to The Boston Globe, which was provided with a copy of the letter.Bulger, now 85, was sent to prison in 2013 after he was convicted of killing 11 people during his ""reign of terror"" as a Boston crime boss in the 1970s and '80s. Throughout his trial, Bulger showed no remorse for his actions, swearing at witnesses during a period of ""unwavering defiance,"" according to the Globe. He was captured in Santa Monica, California, in 2011 after evading federal officials for more than 16 years, and is currently serving two life sentences.In the letter, Bulger told the teens not to waste their time on him, but rather, look toward individuals like his younger brother, William M. Bulger, who was the longest-serving president of the Massachusetts state Senate. The younger Bulger was forced to resign as president of the University of Massachusetts after refusing to testify at a congressional hearing about his brother's activities, according to The New York Times.Not everyone has seen Bulger's letter as an admission of remorse. The Boston Globe contacted Patricia Donahue, whose husband was shot and killed by Bulger in 1982. Donahue told the outlet she doesn't feel the gangster has ""changed at all.""“All he cares about is his family, which is probably one of the only normal things about him,"" she said. ""He doesn’t care about anybody else. I’m sure he doesn’t have any remorse about anyone he’s hurt or killed. He is a wasted life.""Bulger ended his letter with another bit of advice on how to make crime pay.“Advice is a cheap commodity some seek it from me about crime -- I know only thing for sure -- If you want to make crime pay – ‘Go to Law School.’”Read the full text of the letter at The Boston Globe.

""They either are going to follow God, their conscience and what they truly believe is what the scripture teaches them, or they will follow civil law."" ""They will go the path of Dr. Martin Luther King, who in his brilliant essay the 'Letters from a Birmingham Jail' reminded us, based on what St. Augustine said, that an unjust law is no law at all,"" he continued. ""And I do think that we're going to see a lot of pastors who will have to make this tough decision."" After the Supreme Court ruled Friday against bans on same-sex marriage, Huckabee urged his supporters to ""resist and reject judicial tyranny, not retreat."" ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos asked Huckabee to explain what that would mean in practice and whether he was calling for civil disobedience. Along with pastors, Huckabee said that he expects to see Christian business owners, university presidents and school administrators resist. He said county clerks should not be required to issue licenses for same-sex marriages if they do not want to. Huckabee, like many Republicans, has said that the Supreme Court's ruling will usher in an age of discrimination against Christians who oppose same-sex marriage and may be forced to acknowledge or serve gay and lesbian weddings. ""I'm not sure that every governor and every attorney general should just say, 'Well, it's the law of the land because there's no enabling legislation,'"" Huckabee said. ""For the states who have a constitutional amendment that affirms marriage, as has been affirmed by the courts for 135 years since the ratification of the 14th Amendment, right up through the first time we've seen same-sex marriage enacted by any state, which was Massachusetts, in many states you have overwhelming majorities of the people who voted to say that they believe marriage is between a man and a woman."" Earlier on the show, Stephanopoulos talked to Jim Obergefell, one of the plaintiffs in the same-sex marriage cases that went before the Supreme Court. Obergefell was fighting to have his name listed on the death certificate of his husband, John Arthur, who died in 2013. Huckabee said he was ""deeply moved"" by Obergefell's story, but still convinced the Supreme Court overstepped. Obergefell had a message during his appearance for Huckabee and others who oppose same-sex marriage.""I would simply like to say, think about your brother, your son, your sister, your daughter, a dear friend,"" he said. ""If one of them were gay, they would still be the same person. You would still love them. And wouldn't you want them to enjoy the same rights that you do and that everyone else in this country does? We're simply asking to be treated equally and fairly and to enjoy the institution of marriage and to be able to commit to the ones we love."""

""In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, forgive us!""The Waldensians, who now live mostly in Italy and Latin America, were founded by Peter Waldo in France in the late 12th century. He gave up his wealth and preached poverty but as the movement grew it came into increasing theological conflict with the papacy.The movement, an early precursor of the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, was branded as heretical and in 1487 Pope Innocent VIII ordered its extermination.Some 1,700 Waldensians were killed in 1655 by Catholic forces commanded by the Duke of Savoy.Today the Waldensians are part of the World Communion of Reformed Churches and the World Council of Churches. They haveonly two sacraments -- baptism and the Lord's Supper -- as opposed to seven in the Roman Catholic Church, a member of the Italian branch said.During a visit to Jerusalem in 2000, Francis' predecessor Pope John Paul II asked forgiveness from Jews for their persecution by Catholics over the centuries.In 2017, Christians will mark the 500th anniversary of the launching of the Protestant Reformation by Martin Luther, who nailed his 95 Theses to a church door in Germany to denounce corruption in the Catholic Church.Various Christian churches have still not agreed on how they will jointly mark the divorce that split western Christianity and led to many bloody religious wars.The head of the Protestant Church in Germany, Bishop Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, has said he would be in favour of inviting the pope to a ""joint Christian festival"" to mark the anniversary.Francis, an Argentinian whose father and grandfather were born in the Turin area, wrapped up his two-day visit to the region with a private lunch with his Italian relatives."

Take a class.",2015-06-28,2015-06-22-1434947419-1722968-Hoopdancer.3_enhanced.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-22-1434947419-1722968-Hoopdancer.3_enhanced-thumb.jpg," One of the greatest benefits of having a radio show is receiving valuable advice that can help everyone, myself included, in how to handle the stresses of life. Recently, I asked several of my guests for tips on riding life's ups and downs. Here's what they shared:1. Relax Practice a relaxation technique regularly to cope with stress and prevent depression. Jihan Barakah, Founder of The Global Quantum Shift, suggested, ""Just take this moment and take a nice deep breath. I really feel we have lost touch with our breath. Just connecting with breath. What a shift that is!"" Dr. Scott Stoll, author of Alive!, and Chair of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Coordinated Health, told us, ""Deep breathing decreases the stress hormones, cortisol, norepinephrine, and adrenaline."" Michael Neill, empowerment coach and author of The Inside-Out Revolution, discussed why relaxation helps to decrease stress and depression, ""As you get quieter on the inside, thoughts are changing all the time by themselves. And they're moving in the direction of health - moving in the direction of clarity.""Try this: Sit with a straight back, your legs comfortably crossed, focus your attention on your breath and on any sensations that you notice in your body. Slow down your breathing and say silently to yourself, as you inhale, ""one,"" then breathing out, slowly say ""one."" Do this every morning for 5-10 minutes and several times throughout the day for a minute or two.2. Put on your track shoes, or your dancing shoes, and get moving. Exercise reduces stress, increases stamina and strength, thereby increasing one's ability to cope with stressors. It releases endorphins, those feel-good brain chemicals, helping to improve mood. So, go for a walk, try some tai-chi, take a yoga class, dance. But, first, please check with your physician before starting any new exercise program.3. Socialize Depression causes people to isolate themselves, and isolation leads to further decline in mood. Getting around other people can help break the cycle. If you're not able to get out by yourself, ask for help from a friend, family member, or neighbor. Join a community center. Take a class. Join a ""meet-up"" group (check out: meetup.com). Exercise with other people. Join a dance group. Call a friend or relative to talk. Meet with with ""like-hearted, like-minded people. Have a community to belong to,"" as Jihan Barakah suggested.  4. Commune with Nature Venture out to a park or a lake, river, or ocean. Plant a garden or some indoor plants. Pet your dog, cat, or your horse or a llama, if that's the pet that suits you best. Share some kind words with them and watch them respond. Henry David Thoreau wrote, ""I believe that there is a subtle magnetism in Nature, which, if we unconsciously yield to it, will direct us aright."" ""Nature is always healing,"" stated Jihan Barakah when she discussed how she healed herself from depression. ""I would sit by the water and listen to water, feel the warmth of the sun, and I would feel a healing taking place.""5. Laugh regularly Laughter always turns a bad attitude into a good one. Make a point to laugh every day. Find a way to laugh at yourself, rather than criticizing yourself for a mistake you might have made. Look for life's ironies. Watch a funny movie or television show. Read a funny book or a book of jokes. Tell a funny story to a friend. Sharing a funny story with a loved one can, not only bring both of you relief from stress, but it can also improve communication between the two of you. Research has found humor to be extremely powerful in reducing stress, improving mood, and strengthening the immune system to fight off illnesses ranging from colds to cancer. In their book, Awakening the Laughing Buddha Within, The Barefoot Doctor, Stephen Russell, and Joe Hoare report that, even listening to the sound of laughter, can significantly reduce stress. There are laughter apps that you can download on a smart phone with many varieties of laughter to listen to.6. Eat well Poor nutrition can cause depression and can lead to illness. Eat balanced meals. Decrease alcohol, caffeine and sugar. And read my blog, Food and Mood. That old adage, ""We are what we eat,"" holds true, especially today.7. Sleep. Get enough of it! How? Set a schedule to go to bed at a regular time each night--and stick to it. Consider it an appointment with yourself.""Everything you do, you'll do better with a good night's sleep,"" says Dr. Michael Breus, author of Beauty Sleep.For more tips, check out my blog, Getting to Sleep.8. Become a ""glass half-full"" person Practice substituting positive thoughts for negative ones. Quentin Vennie, wellness coach and yoga guide, spoke on the radio show about how thoughts affect how we feel, ""I'm a firm believer in constant affirmations. If I can focus my attention on that one positive, no matter how difficult it is for me to find it, if I dig deep and I find that one positive to focus my attention on, nothing else around it is real.""9. Find meaning  Help someone else. Volunteer. Do a good deed for a neighbor. Make someone who is feeling blue laugh. Look for the deeper meaning in an unfortunate circumstance. If you can find something meaningful, something of value, to take even from the most difficult of situations, it will have a dramatic effect on how you deal with that situation. One of the most powerful ways of preventing depression, or even coming out of a depression, is by focusing energy on helping others. Jihan Barakah advises that finding one's purpose in life helps to keep us from being knocked down by low moods. Says Barakah, ""If you don't know what your purpose and calling in life is, live a life of curiosity. That, in itself, creates enthusiasm.The nature of life is that it always contains dark and light, yin and yang, up and down, ebb and flow. We can ride these waves as smoothly as possible, by accepting that this is what life is about, instead of resisting them or letting them cause us to feel like we're drowning. Using the above tools can provide a life-raft, so to speak, and help us sail smoothly and peacefully over the sometimes tumultuous waves that can disrupt our life. 10. And one last tip:  Keep in mind that nothing is forever. This too shall pass and the seas will once again be calm and the sun will shine again. Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

Take a class.",2015-06-28,2015-06-22-1434947514-6318528-Eagle.1_enhanced.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-22-1434947514-6318528-Eagle.1_enhanced-thumb.jpg," One of the greatest benefits of having a radio show is receiving valuable advice that can help everyone, myself included, in how to handle the stresses of life. Recently, I asked several of my guests for tips on riding life's ups and downs. Here's what they shared:1. Relax Practice a relaxation technique regularly to cope with stress and prevent depression. Jihan Barakah, Founder of The Global Quantum Shift, suggested, ""Just take this moment and take a nice deep breath. I really feel we have lost touch with our breath. Just connecting with breath. What a shift that is!"" Dr. Scott Stoll, author of Alive!, and Chair of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Coordinated Health, told us, ""Deep breathing decreases the stress hormones, cortisol, norepinephrine, and adrenaline."" Michael Neill, empowerment coach and author of The Inside-Out Revolution, discussed why relaxation helps to decrease stress and depression, ""As you get quieter on the inside, thoughts are changing all the time by themselves. And they're moving in the direction of health - moving in the direction of clarity.""Try this: Sit with a straight back, your legs comfortably crossed, focus your attention on your breath and on any sensations that you notice in your body. Slow down your breathing and say silently to yourself, as you inhale, ""one,"" then breathing out, slowly say ""one."" Do this every morning for 5-10 minutes and several times throughout the day for a minute or two.2. Put on your track shoes, or your dancing shoes, and get moving. Exercise reduces stress, increases stamina and strength, thereby increasing one's ability to cope with stressors. It releases endorphins, those feel-good brain chemicals, helping to improve mood. So, go for a walk, try some tai-chi, take a yoga class, dance. But, first, please check with your physician before starting any new exercise program.3. Socialize Depression causes people to isolate themselves, and isolation leads to further decline in mood. Getting around other people can help break the cycle. If you're not able to get out by yourself, ask for help from a friend, family member, or neighbor. Join a community center. Take a class. Join a ""meet-up"" group (check out: meetup.com). Exercise with other people. Join a dance group. Call a friend or relative to talk. Meet with with ""like-hearted, like-minded people. Have a community to belong to,"" as Jihan Barakah suggested.  4. Commune with Nature Venture out to a park or a lake, river, or ocean. Plant a garden or some indoor plants. Pet your dog, cat, or your horse or a llama, if that's the pet that suits you best. Share some kind words with them and watch them respond. Henry David Thoreau wrote, ""I believe that there is a subtle magnetism in Nature, which, if we unconsciously yield to it, will direct us aright."" ""Nature is always healing,"" stated Jihan Barakah when she discussed how she healed herself from depression. ""I would sit by the water and listen to water, feel the warmth of the sun, and I would feel a healing taking place.""5. Laugh regularly Laughter always turns a bad attitude into a good one. Make a point to laugh every day. Find a way to laugh at yourself, rather than criticizing yourself for a mistake you might have made. Look for life's ironies. Watch a funny movie or television show. Read a funny book or a book of jokes. Tell a funny story to a friend. Sharing a funny story with a loved one can, not only bring both of you relief from stress, but it can also improve communication between the two of you. Research has found humor to be extremely powerful in reducing stress, improving mood, and strengthening the immune system to fight off illnesses ranging from colds to cancer. In their book, Awakening the Laughing Buddha Within, The Barefoot Doctor, Stephen Russell, and Joe Hoare report that, even listening to the sound of laughter, can significantly reduce stress. There are laughter apps that you can download on a smart phone with many varieties of laughter to listen to.6. Eat well Poor nutrition can cause depression and can lead to illness. Eat balanced meals. Decrease alcohol, caffeine and sugar. And read my blog, Food and Mood. That old adage, ""We are what we eat,"" holds true, especially today.7. Sleep. Get enough of it! How? Set a schedule to go to bed at a regular time each night--and stick to it. Consider it an appointment with yourself.""Everything you do, you'll do better with a good night's sleep,"" says Dr. Michael Breus, author of Beauty Sleep.For more tips, check out my blog, Getting to Sleep.8. Become a ""glass half-full"" person Practice substituting positive thoughts for negative ones. Quentin Vennie, wellness coach and yoga guide, spoke on the radio show about how thoughts affect how we feel, ""I'm a firm believer in constant affirmations. If I can focus my attention on that one positive, no matter how difficult it is for me to find it, if I dig deep and I find that one positive to focus my attention on, nothing else around it is real.""9. Find meaning  Help someone else. Volunteer. Do a good deed for a neighbor. Make someone who is feeling blue laugh. Look for the deeper meaning in an unfortunate circumstance. If you can find something meaningful, something of value, to take even from the most difficult of situations, it will have a dramatic effect on how you deal with that situation. One of the most powerful ways of preventing depression, or even coming out of a depression, is by focusing energy on helping others. Jihan Barakah advises that finding one's purpose in life helps to keep us from being knocked down by low moods. Says Barakah, ""If you don't know what your purpose and calling in life is, live a life of curiosity. That, in itself, creates enthusiasm.The nature of life is that it always contains dark and light, yin and yang, up and down, ebb and flow. We can ride these waves as smoothly as possible, by accepting that this is what life is about, instead of resisting them or letting them cause us to feel like we're drowning. Using the above tools can provide a life-raft, so to speak, and help us sail smoothly and peacefully over the sometimes tumultuous waves that can disrupt our life. 10. And one last tip:  Keep in mind that nothing is forever. This too shall pass and the seas will once again be calm and the sun will shine again. Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

Lazarus has died, and his sister Mary is reproaching Jesus for not having been there because he might have saved his friend from death. She's weeping, everyone else gathered around her is weeping, and as The King James version has it: ""Jesus groaned in the spirit, and was troubled."" When asked to see where Lazarus has been laid out (in a cave), he weeps, too. It's a very powerful scene, given wonderful life by Bernado Bertolucci in his celebrated Jesus of Nazareth mini-series.Now, can the former governor seriously compare anything in this highly dramatic and emotional scene of public mourning over the death of a beloved individual to the liberation of a whole class of people? Gays and lesbians who only want to share their love, devotion and commitment with each other? And compare the scene to the joyous normalization of the family life of hundreds of thousands of children living with same-sex parents, children who like their parents will no longer be second class citizens in the eyes of the law? Isn't Mike Huckabee, someone who considers himself a man of faith, taking his Lord's name in vain? Lev Raphael is the author of 25 books in many genres including the memoir/travelogue My Germany."

25,WORLDPOST,Over A Third Of Greek ATMs Run Out Of Cash,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greece-bank-run_n_7678858.html,,2015-06-27,"People queue at a national Bank of Greece ATM in central Athens on June 27, 2015. Eurozone ministers meet in Brussels on June 27 for a crunch meeting after a shock call for a referendum by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras threw a push to avert a default by Athens into confusion. Greece will vote on July 5 on the outcome of negotiations with its international creditors that have dragged on since January, when Tsipras's Syriza party first took power on a promise of ending austerity. AFP PHOTO / ARIS MESSINIS (Photo credit should read ARIS MESSINIS/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc151b9240000130a51bae9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By George Georgiopoulos and Lefteris PapadimasATHENS, June 27 (Reuters) - More than a third of automated teller machines across Greece ran out of cash on Saturday before they were replenished as Greeks pulled out money on fears their country was set to crash out of the euro, three banking sources said.Anxious Greeks lined up outside ATMs after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras made a surprise call for a referendum on austerity terms demanded by lenders, throwing talks with lenders in disarray and putting Greece on the verge of a default.About 35 percent of the ATM network - some 2,000 out of the 5,500 ATMs across Greece - ran out of euro banknotes at one point during the day and were being replenished, the bankers said. Banks were working in coordination with the central bank to keep the network fed with cash, they said.Replenishing ATMs usually takes one to two hours per ATM, leading to the long lines, one banking source said.Around 600 million euros was withdrawn from the banking system on Saturday, one senior banker at one of Greece's four big lenders told Reuters. A second banker estimated the outflow at more than 500 million euros.Though that was below the level of over 1 billion euros seen on some days over the past two weeks, the figure was almost exclusively from ATM withdrawals, where the average daily limit of cash that can be taken out is 600 to 700 euros, bankers said.""Demand for cash is definitely higher than what you see on a normal Saturday,"" one of the bankers said.""This does not mean that there are lines everywhere but we are trying to keep ATMs fed with banknotes.""Minutes after Tsipras's address to the nation, small lines could be seen at some ATMs in Athens. In addition to lines at various ATMs across the country on Saturday, a line of about 40 people could be seen at an ATM inside the Greek parliament.Greece's government has insisted that banks will reopen as normal on Monday and denied the country will have to impose capital controls to prevent the banks collapsing.The banks depend on emergency liquidity from the European Central Bank to stay open, and senior government officials held talks with the ECB chief Mario Draghi on Saturday to ensure continued support to banks amid the crisis.

Indeed, it is the land of enchantment, perhaps a bit like Dorothy's Oz and when you discover this magic kingdom for yourself, it is layer upon layer of discovery, like un-peeling a gift on Christmas morning that you will find quite multifaceted as you continue to discover more. My latest venture to Ireland was earlier this year, in January, so the air was still crisp and the sunlight still elusive in the sky giving the land a sort of mystical feel. Indeed, my eyes seemed to be covered with the shadow of the culture and tradition that lies just underneath the surface of the Emerald Isle.Off the plane on the first morning I headed straight (for my second time) to a falconry experience at Ashford Castle's School of Falconry. First things first however, since driving in Ireland can be a bit stressful, you want to make sure you are driving a sturdy car, my vote is for the Nissan  Qashqai. The 2015 Nissan Qashqai is a compact crossover so it's perfect for European roads and here in the states I would compare it to the Nissan Murano. This style of Nissan has been in the European Nissan lineup since 2006, some folks familiar with the European brands might remember the Qashqai under the moniker of the Nissan Dualis, but reviews are in and the Qashqai stands up as much better in every way as compared to the Dualis from years past. The 2015 Nissan Qashqai has also seen a reincarnation since last year too and it has been built on a new platform with the car buyer in mind. That is the car buyer who wants a cool design, but not in a big monster vehicle, preferring instead the quiet comfort of the sport utility feel with a gentler touch. Overall, the competition in the market for the 2015 Nissan Qashqai is the Toyota RAV 4, Hyundai Tucson and the Honda CR-V.What I found most impressive about this European cousin to the Murano was the sleek designing that definitely stands out with a rear rise to the shape, but with an SUV feel. There is also a good ground clearance and good wheel arches with 19-inch wheels for just the right ride. Under the hood there are a number of choices you can opt for including the 113bhp, 1.2-litre four-cylinder turbo fuel, 108bhp 1.5-litre turbo diesel, this being the most sought after for the European market, a 128bhp 1.6-litre turbo diesel or a 161bhp turbo fuel option.When driving the Qashqai, you are definitely looking at a more comfortable ride than in years past, and with the new design, it's more comfort for not only the driver and front seat passenger, but also the folks in the back seat as well and that includes maximum headroom. There is also plenty of storage space in the cabin, the only distraction, the fake leather steering wheel, but it's not a deal breaker by any means. As I drove to the castle, it was located in County Mayo and while closed for renovation, the School of Falconry on the grounds of the castle was still open for business. Meeting these remarkable birds of prey and then flying them on the castle grounds is nothing short of extraordinary, and later, as I was able to hold and fly the school's owl (a Dingle European Eagle Owl) as he was sitting on my arm, I felt it was a thing of legend. The school of Falconry really only allows for a person to fly Hawks, but it's just as spectacular. These are Harris Hawks, and this school is actually the oldest established falconry school in Ireland. Falconry actually dates back 4,000 years. Later, I stayed in Galway for the night, and the next morning found myself heading further into the Galway area through Connemara for some sightseeing along the way. Just driving the back roads and getting a feel for the country is priority number one when you first arrive in Ireland since you will want to stop and meet the people and hear the stories they have to tell. Just don't ask for directions, the Irish are known for giving twisted directions and the big tree at the end of the road might really be a rock. You probably won't mind a few diversions however, since wherever you end up it won't be very bad.As you continue your journey in Ireland, make the next day another driving experience on to Sligo, where there are stone circles that will remind you of a culture that is long gone, but still just feels a breath away. The stone circle at Carrowmore in Sligo is a must, and then precede to W.B. Yeats's grave in nearby Drumcliffe with a number of interesting Irish high crosses to see reminiscent of the area.After spending some time in the Republic of Ireland, take the time to head north to the very different, Northern Ireland for a look at the diverse landscape that offers castles and coastal roads that are unparalleled and enjoy the diversions leading to jewels just behind the next curve. Heading to Belfast for the first night ask around and be sure and tour the city before heading out to the countryside for a few nights.The drive north from Belfast leads along a scenic drive called the Causeway Coastal Route, which has been rated as one of the top five roads to drive in the world with 120 miles from Belfast Lough to Lough Foyle. On this road highlights will include the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, a bridge that fishermen erected to reach a rock island crossing a large gorge. Then up the road to the very well-visited Giant's Causeway that was formed over 60 million years with the help of molten lava. The dramatic formations have names like the Wishing Chair, the Camel and the Harp. Made from hexagonal basalt columns, my current visit was a change from several years back since there is now a new state-of-the-art visitor's center offering a variety of displays and self-guided explanations of the 40,000- year-old columns. There is also a great legend to go with Giant's Causeway too telling the story of the giant Finn McCool who created the Causeway as a challenge to his Scottish rival, the legend lives on and these days the location has even been marked as a World Heritage Site.Also on the Causeway Coastal Route stop in at Dunluce Castle, this is one of my favorite castles in Ireland overall, it is sweeping and magnificent and you see it before you ever arrive. It conjures up tales of days gone by and will remind you of how the area along this coast was a wild and free place to live or be attacked by neighboring clans.   After a few days exploring the Causeway Coastal Route, take another 24 hours before heading home and spend it in Belfast again, this time for some Titanic history. You can spend the afternoon in the Titanic Quarter visiting the SS Nomadic the tender ship for first and second class passengers to the Titanic and the last remaining ship of the White Star Line. There is also the Titanic Belfast that opened in 2012, which is the year that marked the centenary of the sinking of this most famous ship. Ireland as a whole enchants, and whether it's the food you are wanting to experience, a bit of the whiskey, the history or the culture dating back well before the Christian era, this is a destination that will leave you with just a glimpse of what is to come since you can be sure you will return again and again."
27,ENTERTAINMENT,AFI Docs Fest Wraps Up,"Michael Rose, ContributorAuthor, journalist, and documentary filmmaker",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/afi-docs-fest-wraps-up_b_7675652.html,"Last week I was able to view a handful of the 81 films from 25 countries, at the five-day long AFI Docs festival that attracted filmmakers, national policy and opinion leaders, journalists and a large crowd of viewers to the 13th annual running of the event in the Washington DC area.",2015-06-27,2015-06-26-1435361350-4417534-WhiteHouseforHuffP.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-26-1435361350-4417534-WhiteHouseforHuffP-thumb.jpg," The White House, courtesy King Rose ArchiveLast week I was able to view a handful of the 81 films from 25 countries, at the five-day long AFI Docs festival that attracted filmmakers, national policy and opinion leaders, journalists and a large crowd of viewers to the 13th annual running of the event in the Washington DC area that ran from June 17-21. This isn't a top tier festival for filmmakers hoping to find distribution or rub shoulders with a bevy of celebrities but it is the place to see important, engaging and entertaining (these are not mutually exclusive categories) films that provoke discussions and can help to shape national policy.I highly recommend the following films.""Best of Enemies"" This is a fascinating new doc about the dust-up between William F. Buckley and Gore Vidal at the 1968 Democratic Convention during a series of televised debates aired by ABC.As the anti-Vietnam protesters battled the police in the streets of Chicago these two squared off in a makeshift studio set up at the stockyards where the convention was being held. Like two bulls squaring off, they veered away from analyzing the convention proceedings and locked horns and got personal. Vidal called Buckley a ""pro-crypto-Nazi.""Which prompted Buckley to respond, ""Now listen, you queer. Stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I'll sock you in the goddamn face and you'll stay plastered.""This oratorical blood sport sent ratings soaring and some say it triggered a seismic shift in television news and talk shows. It opened the floodgates for the shout fests we have today. What the film doesn't touch on is how ABC producer George Merlis had to shepherd Vidal and actor Paul Newman out of the studio before Buckley made good on his threat.""The Diplomat"" As Iraq morphs into the endless war and Afghanistan limps toward some unknown resolution while Israel and the Palestinians show no signs or finding a way out of pyrrhic trap we're reminded by this timely doc of a time when the US could actually broker a peace. This film, about Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, traces his remarkable career bookended by the foreign policy tragedies of Vietnam and Afghanistan. In between these monumental U.S. failures is a victory for diplomacy engineered by Holbrooke whose make it up as you go tenacity brokered the Bosnian peace accords. Directed by his son David, it explores the personal and public life of a remarkable figure who proved that peace was possible if diplomacy was given the chance to succeed. It will air on HBO later this year.""Very Semi-Serious"" Another wonderful film at AFI Docs fest takes us into the world of the New Yorker cartoons and the people who create these snapshots of our time. Ten years in the making, it delivers the stories of the characters behind the characters and their original takes on life.""Code: Debugging the Gender Gap"" Computer code is the language of the present and the future yet in many schools learning this tool isn't encouraged or rewarded or even taught. This is especially true for girls and women. This new documentary makes the case for changing the Barbie paradigm and breaking down gender barricades in computer science.""Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine"" This really hit home for me. Befuddled by the IBM PC I turned to a Mac and was writing and printing within half an hour. General Motors, my employer at the time, let me bring it to work and it gave me access to the computer world. Not only was it easy - intuitive to use - it was the David up against the Goliath of the tech world. How could I resist? But this outlier has become - actually surpassed - the popularity of its former foes and in many ways become everything it once despised. I wanted to see the new documentary by the prolific Alex Gibney at the AFI Docs fest to better understand how what I'd once thought was the champion of the little guy was transformed into a corporate behemoth. Apple is an attractive siren luring millions to its shores while parking billions in Irish shell companies, harassing journalists, squeezing $300 in profit from each iPhone while paying its Chinese assemblers $12 a day and discharging tons of carcinogenic heavy metals into the streams flowing past its factories. Gibney, like he did with Scientology in his other recent film, ""Going Clear,"" peels back the complex layers surrounding the man who was driven to ""Think Different"" and felt he had the license to defy moral gravity. I'm writing this on my Mac Book Pro and, like the iPhone owning Gibney, I'm conflicted and hobbled by the idea of transferring all my data and programs to a new platform. Plus, I like the way it looks. This is a film worth seeing and talking about.""Drunk, Stoned, Brilliant, Dead: The Story of the National Lampoon."" One of the pleasures of the AFI Docs fest is seeing films in interesting locations like the Naval Heritage Museum that hosted a screening of what seemed to be an unlikely film for this venue. The turbulent story of the National Lampoon was a story I knew nothing about. I'd always thought the original cast of Saturday Night Live came from Second City, but Belushi, Gilda Radner, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray were all alums from National Lampoon's various enterprises. The film is a sometimes hilarious, sometimes tragic look at the price of being funny.""What Happened, Miss Simone?"" This film earned the Fest's Audience Award for Best Feature. Director Liz Garbus uses a mountain of archive films, recordings and a few recreations to trace the tumultuous story of singer/Civil Rights activist, Nina Simone.Once dubbed the ""High Priestess of Soul"" we discover Simone started her ascent as a classical pianist in North Carolina. Walking to her piano lessons from what was literally the wrong side of the tracks brought home the ever-present racism that surrounded her. Instead of being crushed by hate she became determined to lend her voice and spirit to the drive for equality. Caught up in the center of the Civil Rights movement she became friends with Martin Luther King, James Baldwin, Malcolm X and his family and nearly anyone else who was dedicated to making a difference. Her devotion to the struggle, aversion to compartmentalizing her beliefs so as not to interfere with her commercial success, and what was later diagnosed as manic depression sent her career into a tailspin. Fortunately, she's eventually rescued by friends who help to lift her out of despair and regain her footing.This is a film that speaks to us on many levels and in this era of our reawakening discussions about race it's a story that should trigger conversations about our responsibilities and the cost for speaking out.Another of the side benefits to the AFI Docs fest is taking in a little tourism in between nonstop doc screenings. After the close encounter with Steve Jobs my colleagues and I took a stroll to grab a look at the White House. The old access road was still bracketed by post 9/11 concrete barriers and an ugly chain link fence. This didn't deter an endless stream of people from lining up along the sidewalk to snap a photo of their friends and family or take a selfie posed in front of this magnificent symbol that's still a beacon of hope to people from around the world. With all the bad news coming from Charleston and elsewhere it felt good to see the country hadn't lost its appeal. The line up at AFI Docs laid out a number of ways we can enlarge the conversation about who we are and what we need to do in order to shoulder the responsibility we have to live up to the ideals that attract millions of people to come and stand before the White House every year."

The ink was yet wet on the Supreme Court's decision legalizing gay marriage when Southern Baptist minister and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee called for an uprising.""I will not acquiesce to an imperial court any more than our Founders acquiesced to an imperial British monarch,"" he roared. ""We must resist and reject judicial tyranny, not retreat.""Weirdly, Chief Justice John Roberts denigrated his own institution. ""Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law,"" he sneered in dissent. [""A]s a judge, I find the majority's position indefensible as a matter of constitutional law."" Roberts must have been snoozing in con law class. This is precisely what the Supreme Court is supposed to do: Prevent a tyranny of the majority. That is its essential function.The Founders changed the world by crafting a separation of powers in our government. Any ambiguity about the Supreme Court's role was cleared up in 1803 when the Court issued its decision in Marbury v. Madison. In that towering decision, Chief Justice Marshall ruled that laws in conflict with the Constitution are no laws, and that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of what the Constitution says.Roberts knows this, and Scalia, Huckabee and the whole howling pack of angry critics must know this, too. Why are they so furious about a decision that can have no direct effect on them? A court majority that blithely made ""money talks"" the law of the land in Citizens United really cannot complain about ""judicial tyranny"" when it finds itself in the minority.Indeed, being in the minority, yet retaining fundamental rights, is exactly what this week's ruling is about. So what rights have gay marriage opponents lost? The answer, I think, is their future.Opposition to gay marriage has only one refuge: Old Time Religion. To be sure, there are still plenty of people who take certain biblical passages to mean that homosexuality is wrong (conveniently overlooking other passages that say slavery is right). But their numbers are dwindling. American attitudes on gay marriage have swung about like the boom on a yacht caught in a gale of change.What the religious right rightly fears is being blown away. They talk about the Roe v. Wade decision, but what haunts them is Loving v. Virginia. That 1967 Supreme Court ruling overturned laws banning interracial marriage. It came at a time when ""We Shall Overcome,"" with its verse ""black and white together,"" could be heard in the streets across the nation.Today, racism persists, but only like a fatal disease awaiting eradication. It has lost all legitimacy. Even a billionaire NBA team owner can't get away with being a public racist. Now, I am not making a content comparison of Old Time Religion with racism. I am saying that right-wing religion's exponents fear being stigmatized by this decision. Rick Scarborough of Vision America told NPR ""What we have historically done is enforce moral standards,"" and after vowing to continue to discriminate in hiring regardless, he added wistfully, ""Who wants to respond to a pollster and be called a bigot?""Good question.More than two-thirds of young Americans already accept gay marriage. As it proliferates, more will. To come out as anti-gay is already seriously not cool. Increasingly, in high schools and colleges, to be anti-gay will be like coming out as a Klansman. Are young people going to want to join a church whose emblem is a huffing and puffing Mike Huckabee wielding the Bible to exclude millions from marriage? Not likely."

""But in poker, you can always lose.""After five months of negotiations with a Greek government elected to end the pain of austerity measures, EU leaders left a summit in Brussels on Friday believing a deal was close to roll over bailout funding and let Athens meet a repayment to the IMF on Tuesday and further obligations over the coming months.But Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras provoked consternation by returning home to call a referendum for next Sunday on the offer and urging voters, weary of years of debt crises, to reject it.Not for the first time, EU officials said Greek negotiators across the table were themselves taken by surprise by news from Athens. ""They heard about the referendum on Twitter,"" one said.""Tsipras messed up,"" a euro zone official said. ""We did everything possible. They chose to blow up when we were so close to settling this in a way that would allow them to sell it.""Amid political drama in Greece, where a clear majority wants to remain inside the bloc, the next few days present a major challenge to the integrity of a 16-year-old currency bloc, which many blame for massive unemployment in countries outside Germany and its neighbors in the richer north and west of Europe.RISK MANAGEMENT""We must do everything we can to fight any conceivable threat of contagion,"" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said after a meeting at which the group effectively called for capital controls to ring-fence Greek banks hemorrhaging cash.While acknowledging that only Greece - or possibly banks themselves - can instigate such a shutdown, the ministers said the European Central Bank, whose management meets on Sunday, should use its powers to stabilize markets.""You have to count on Greece getting into acute problems in the coming days because of this decision,"" said Schaeuble, some of whose conservative allies have made no secret of preferring to see Greece forced out of the euro zone. ""That is difficult as we do not know how it will live up to its commitments.""He and others, however, stressed their faith in stability mechanisms put in place after skepticism among investors pushed the euro zone to breaking point following a run of national bankruptcy scares in the wake of the global crash of 2008.And, echoing his French Socialist counterpart, Michel Sapin, Schaeuble insisted after the fifth such deadlocked ministerial meeting in just over a week: ""Greece remains a member of the euro zone and Greece remains part of Europe.""But there is a divergence, certainly in tone, between Berlin and Paris. Sapin insisted the Eurogroup at least discuss the Greek request for an extension on Saturday but Schaeuble and most others had lost patience, sources close to the talks said.Afterwards, Sapin said he was still ready to negotiate, a view repeated on Sunday in Paris by Prime Minister Manuel Valls.But few EU leaders now trust this Greek government, whose calls for debt relief and criticisms of the bailout's deadening effect on growth have been echoed by some leading economists.When representatives of the three creditor institutions - euro zone governments, the ECB and IMF - met after Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis had left, participants quoted one senior official as joking that at least they could refer again to the lenders as the ""Troika,"" a term Varoufakis had insisted be dropped because Greeks associated it with external diktats.Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Eurogroup chairman, repeatedly referred to the possibility that the Greek parliament might reject Tsipras's call for a referendum. But lawmakers dashed any prospect of a quick shift in Greek politics before markets open on Monday by voting for it to go ahead.Still, Dijsselbloem insisted: ""The process has not ended. It will never end probably. We will continue to work with Greece. Many things could happen, many scenarios are conceivable.""As Greeks lined up to take cash from ATMs, it remained to be seen how financial mechanisms would work. If Greece fails, as it has said it will, to repay 1.6 billion euros to the IMF on Tuesday, that default can have knock-on effects.Greece could stay in the euro zone but also issue a local currency to pay bills -- a form of ""Grexit"" recommended on Sunday by influential German economist Hans-Werner Sinn of Ifo.The ECB must also decide whether to keep supplying liquidity to Greek banks, once the government whose debt makes up a large chunk of their assets is no longer meeting its obligations and once the bailout program formally expires on Tuesday.POLITICAL FALLOUTThe central bank, under its president Mario Draghi, has been reluctant to take such a highly politicized decision. At the same time, political leaders have been reluctant to override the decisions of finance ministers lest that appear to be a signal that the rules of the common currency are open to manipulation.Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who chairs meetings of the 28 EU leaders, made clear at two summits in the past week that heads of government must nonetheless take their responsibilities in a crisis that affects the Union as a whole.Early on Sunday, he was in contact with leaders again: ""Greece is and should remain euro area member,"" Tusk tweeted.The Greek government's demands have alienated its euro zone partners - from Germany and its northern allies, to southern states and Ireland whose governments face critics of their own bailout terms to easterners much less prosperous than Greece.But with Britain already planning a referendum on leaving the EU, a breach in formal institutions worries those who fear economic drift. Complaints it lacks democratic accountability threaten the EU's survival in its present form.One official close to Saturday's Eurogroup discussions said the issue of Greece leaving the euro, or the EU, was not raised - there is no obvious legal way to force it out of either. But, the official said, a ""Grexit"" could not be entirely ruled out.Leaving Brussels on what he called a ""sad day for Europe,"" the outspoken Varoufakis warned that the rift with Athens would damage the euro zone's credibility as a ""democratic union"" - ""And I'm very much afraid that that damage will be permanent.""

A group of effective classroom teachers from across the country is joining the fray with a powerful -- and perhaps unexpected -- message.,2015-06-27,2015-06-27-1435375328-4895769-alicejohnsoncain_edited.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-27-1435375328-4895769-alicejohnsoncain_edited-thumb.png," By Alice Johnson CainAs a recent Washington Post article shows, two traditional allies -- the civil rights community and the nation's largest teachers union, the National Education Association -- are at odds over legislation to re-write the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). At the heart of the disagreement is whether the law should include meaningful accountability for the nation's most at-risk students. A group of effective classroom teachers from across the country is joining the fray with a powerful -- and perhaps unexpected -- message.   These teachers are calling for more accountability, echoing the civil rights community, which does not support the bill in its current form because it does not fulfill its functions as a civil rights law. The small but mighty group of teachers leading the charge is associated with the nonprofit where I work, Teach Plus, and these teachers stand out in two important ways: They have demonstrated their effectiveness in the classroom and, as teachers in high-poverty schools, they teach the very population of students ESEA was designed to serve.   The NEA is right that the overly-prescriptive interventions applied to ESEA through No Child Left Behind (NCLB) are not the solution that schools need. Time and again, NCLB has required struggling schools to implement the same set of interventions on the same timeline, regardless of whether students in all grades from all demographic groups were struggling or whether only a small group of students were struggling. NCLB applied a hammer when a scalpel was warranted.  The Senate is on the verge of throwing out the hammer, scalpel and rest of the toolbox by stripping the law of meaningful accountability. The fatal flaw with the Senate bill to replace NCLB, the Every Child Achieves Act (ECAA), is that a school can gather data that shows year after year -- or decade after decade -- that, for example, its Hispanic fourth graders are struggling, but no steps have to be taken, ever, to address the problem.   At a recent Congressional briefing, Los Angeles teacher Chris Hofmann, who has a record of excellence in a school where 96% of the students are Latino and 90% qualify for free and reduced meals, explained: The current legislation is akin to saying I have to give tests, identify the students who can't read, put them over in the corner, say they need help and that's it. We wouldn't accept that from our teachers, and we shouldn't accept that from our states. Where the NEA is misguided is in its assertion that accountability must be punitive and one-size-fits all. This does not have to be the case. At its best, accountability is about measuring and using data to know what is working in an ongoing process of making sure that all students, in all schools, get the instruction and support they need to succeed. Strong accountability systems help us see the progress that is being made. Meaningful accountability also creates focus and leverage to help states and districts make informed decisions about how to allocate precious education dollars in an equitable way -- a shared priority of civil right groups, teachers' unions and teachers from high-poverty schools.  The most promising solution under consideration, known as ""proportional response,"" says that if, for example, Hispanic fourth graders are the only group of students in a school who are below grade level, the school's interventions should be tailored to Hispanic fourth graders. In other words, it uses a scalpel. This approach, proposed by House Democrats, has the support of the Tri-Caucus, comprised of Hispanic, African-American, and Asian and Pacific-American Representatives. Over 80 of its members sent a letter to Senators opposing their bill and asking them to ""further protect children of historically underserved communities - specifically, children of color, children with disabilities, and children in poverty so that they can break the cycle of poverty and overcome socio-economic barriers for a brighter future.""  A Senate amendment -- supported by the civil rights community but actively opposed by the NEA - says when accountability data shows that a group of students in a school (or an entire school) is struggling, states and districts would need to put interventions in place to improve results for those students. A recent Teach Plus Flash Poll found two-thirds of the 1,000+ teachers surveyed want states to be required to take action when a school is struggling.   Since states and districts would have the freedom to determine their own interventions, it aligns with recommendations from Teach Plus teachers from high-poverty schools who created a set of principles they want to see in the law. High on their list is that ESEA ""should require states to take proactive, evidence-based measures on behalf of students who are struggling...Interventions should include helping struggling schools invest in targeted, evidence-based, teacher-led training and development that will improve the effectiveness of educators.""   Heeding advice from effective teachers who spend their days with the students ESEA was designed to help is the best way Congress could honor the law's civil rights legacy.

I recently was reminded of this as I met with students who were visiting Washington, D.C. to mark the end of their academic year exchanges.The students from our Future Leaders Exchange (FLEX), and the American-Serbia and Montenegro Youth Leadership Exchange (A-SMYLE) programs, for example, contributed over 4,000 hours of community service during their exchange year in the United States, adding to the well over one million community service hours their FLEX and A-SMYLE peers have contributed before them. FLEX and A-SMYLE students in Washington, D.C.Makhabat from Kyrgyzstan made it her goal to inspire religious tolerance among people of Christian and Muslim faiths, as she completed over 100 hours of community service at a food pantry, a soup kitchen, an elementary school, and other venues. Marija from Montenegro also completed over 100 hours of community service, including starting a fund-raising campaign for the people of Haiti after watching a documentary about living conditions there. Ilya from Russia, in addition to contributing almost 200 hours of community service, conducted 37 presentations about his home country, increasing understanding of its history and culture among his classmates and in his host community.The students' energy and enthusiasm demonstrated that the future of our global community will be bright.As I met with students, I also heard about the importance of host families in creating a brighter future. American volunteer host families are a fundamental element of our exchanges - providing a home and a safe, nurturing environment where ideas, like the concept of volunteerism, can be shared and explored. As one host parent said: ""Hosting is more than most people think. It's adding a person to your family. It's expanding your knowledge of other countries and cultures. It's an everyday adventure that expands your horizons."" In short, hosting matters because it gives foreign youth firsthand experience of life in the United States and increases understanding between Americans and people of other countries.The U.S. Department of State brings nearly 2,000 high school youth to the United States from over 50 countries each year through the FLEX, A-SMYLE, Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (YES), and Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange (CBYX) programs. I invite American families to host a student from one of these programs in your home or school. Learn more through our #WhyHostingMatters campaign and at hosting.state.gov. You too can be personally inspired by these amazing students while contributing to relations between the United States and countries around the globe. And in the process, you will make your community a better place."
