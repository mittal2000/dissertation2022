I imagine myself as the Italian girl walking through Florence in the black and white poster that hung in so many college dorms. That I look nothing like a hair model or 20-year-old Italian is moot.

I feel my hair bounce like a Breck commercial as I smile at puppies and passers-by. I imagine myself as the Italian girl walking through Florence in the black and white poster that hung in so many college dorms. That I look nothing like a hair model or 20-year-old Italian is moot. The sun on the street mirrors my mood and I give thanks to the great gift of time.See the balm isn't Spring Street or even spring as I moved here last April in the depths of despair. I bolted up each morning at 5:00 crying out for my mother. She had died two months earlier and I needed her to steer me through the rocks of my divorce. I needed her to teach me how to follow in her footsteps as the co-innkeeper at our family inn, the Wilburton Inn in Manchester, Vermont. I needed her to know how much I missed her and loved her and was so sorry she was gone. I clutched the wooden headboard of my new bed, which my grandmother slept in for 60 years. My grandma was an immigrant who lost her sister in World War Two and buried two husbands and two daughters. Lola Wasserstein was a survivor. I gripped her bedposts to channel her strength, her life force, her courage, her will. Help me grandma to get me through this. There were just too many changes and losses at once and no amount of tulips could make it better.Last spring, I walked through the streets of New York listening to walking meditations by Jon Kabat-Zinn. I saw the black iron bars of Gramercy Park as a sign. Vibrant azaleas and blossoms beckoned, but the gated park made the garden impenetrable. It was as if I was in jail, barred from the healing power of spring.Mindfulness helped me observe my sadness and give it the space to heal. When my divorce court date was set in Manhattan on the morning following our Gatsby lawn party in Vermont, I had no choice but to miss the party. Though I'd normally be the first one up for croquet in a bonnet strewn with flowers, last spring wasn't the time. I was dealing with too many transitions. I could not embrace the gaiety of the season. Yet a full year has passed and now I'm in bloom! I haven't lost 20 pounds or fallen in love or turned the inn into the thriving mecca it one day will be. What has changed is I have turned a new leaf. I feel like Margaret Mead discovering new things and I am grateful to Facebook  and The Huffington Post to have a forum to share my journey with others. Last spring I contracted from death and divorce. This year I expand and welcome the energy of spring.Back in Soho last week, I walked to Liberty Tower and saw the black sunken fountain memorial to remember those who died in the World Trade Tower tragedy. I looked up at the shining Freedom Tower, pointing fearless and bold, straight to the sky. I understood that we can simultaneously hold both: honor those we've lost while reclaiming our strength and going forward.So to anyone who feels glum or stuck, scared and anxious, remember to everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under heaven. My mother had me and my sister sing Turn, Turn, Turn at my Vermont living room bat mitzvah (yes, we wore overalls and the choreography included us literally turning.) There is a time to mourn and a time to dance. And just because it's spring outside doesn't mean it's spring in your heart, but that's ok. Sit it out a year and spring will be back to offer her bountiful gifts.And now like the robin, I have to sing. Though I gave up being a NYC songwriter last year to take on being a part-time family innkeeper in Vermont, last week I had the pleasure of writing a song for my son's 5th grade Medieval feast and skipping around his gym as a minstrel. This week I'm writing a custom song for a family from Argentina and Antwerp and their wedding in Israel. This weekend, I'm being flown to Raleigh, North Carolina to sing at a Moey's Music Party fan's second birthday! So I share this happy music video  celebrating spring from my kiddie rock days as my offering to the most powerful mother of all, Mother Nature. Thank you for this annual opportunity to stretch and grow anew. As Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote so simply, may we all bloom and grow forever."
1,WORLDPOST,'Arma Virumque Cano' - Militarism and Parades in Asia,"Franz-Stefan Gady, ContributorSenior Fellow, EastWest Institute; Editor, The Diplomat Magazi...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arma-virumque-cano-milita_b_7124196.html,"Military parades are an indispensable political platform for communicating power and ambition and are now amplified by the tools of mass media, which can orchestrate and glamourize rhythmic ranks of well-booted warriors and rolling chariots of gleaming steel.",2015-04-24,"Franz-Stefan Gady - Senior Fellow, EastWest Institute; Editor, The Diplomat Magazine",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5909f43814000025001a6518.png?ops=100_100,"In my life I have participated in several military parades. Of these, two stand out. As an officer candidate in the Austrian Army, I marched in step to the tune of the Radetzky March past a crowd -- my Uncle Winfried and Aunt Waltraud among them -- down an alley leading to Eggenberg Palace, in Graz. It was late fall and chilly dark. Half of the members of my company carried torches, which cast eerie shadows on the baroque exterior of the castle. The second was in late summer. I was commanding a section of an honor guard marching in step through the village of Hengsberg to a green meadow, where a few hundred recruits swore their military oath in front of relatives and local villagers. On both occasions, as we marched by, crowds spontaneously clapped, some shouting, ""Bravo, super Burschen!"" (Well done, fine boys!). I felt something like the spirited flush that once filled me -- God knows why -- when, as a boy, I watched John Wayne at Iwo Jima or Bataan. The shrill bark of red faced sergeants and long days of monotonous drill were for a brief moment forgotten. National military parades are a thing of the past in most of the West, but they are becoming a popular form of statesmanship in Asia. By year's end, lavish pageants of military hardware and marchers in formation will advance down boulevards of India, Pakistan, North Korea, China and Russia. However alluring and visually striking, these parades embody militarism, the deadly business at the heart of every sovereign state. And the term ""parade"" comes from the Latin word parare, ""to prepare."" Throughout history, parades have prepared citizens for war. When militarism and national insecurity intersect, as they seem to be doing today in Asia, carnage often follows. Contemporary leaders might recall Europe's experience in the late 19th and early 20th century of burgeoning military innovation and stockpiles of arms. The latest technology of human genius was harnessed and transformed into the most appalling annihilation of humankind as competing nation-states collided in two epic wars that risked toppling modern civilization. In fact, Europe's influence on parade marching in Asia today can be found in the marching techniques, which often feature variations of the Prussian goose step (Stechschritt), especially popular in China, Russia and North Korea. Of the goose step, George Orwell noted that it is ""one of the most horrible sights in the world . . . It is simply an affirmation of naked power; contained in it, quite consciously and intentionally, is the vision of a boot crashing down on a face."" Since the end of WWII, the nuclear threshold and the memory of 20th century conflagrations has checked militarism and limited hostile aggression to regional wars of greater and lesser ferocity. But endemic national disputes and the competition to field the most troops wielding the most sophisticated weapons has deflected global capital from a humane attention to crucial societal needs. The price of guns is a perennial sin tax of blood and treasure.Military parades are an indispensable political platform for communicating power and ambition and are now amplified by the tools of mass media, which can orchestrate and glamourize rhythmic ranks of well-booted warriors and rolling chariots of gleaming steel.In countries like China where only a figure for the topline defense budget is released, parades help show what taxpayer money is buying and boost national pride. After a seven-year hiatus, Pakistan is revised its Republic (Pakistan) Day military parade (see: ""With Military Parade, Pakistan Sends Message to Indian, Taliban""). Strained relations with its historical ally, the United States, has prompted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to probe Russian openness for compensatory arms and energy deals. And noting a Western tilt towards India after NATO's exit from Afghanistan, Sharif wanted to secure Chinese President Xi Jinping as ""Chief Guest"" of this year's ceremony, as both leaders posture for a strategic alliance comprising the Muslim world's first Islamic Republic and, thus far, its only nuclear armed state (China declined the invitation allegedly due to security reasons).Pakistan's archrival and rising superpower, India, held its 66th annual Republic Day parade in January in New Delhi. Another Chief Guest, Barack Obama -- the first American president to attend the event -- with First Lady, Michelle, applauded the troops with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a host of dignitaries. Both countries are seeking closer ties as the United States formulates the action steps of its emerging ""Pacific Pivot"" and India determines its place in a multi-lateral world marked by the growing rivalry between China and the United States.Russia will also hold a larger than usual parade to commemorate the 70th anniversary of end of WWII, the country's most destructive war. Putin has expanded Victory Day celebrations, feeding internal reactionary sentiment for Soviet era military prestige. After the blatant annexation of the Crimea and continued Russian support of separatist forces in Ukraine, the Russian President's annual bottoms' up of 100 g of vodka -- the daily ration of a soldier of the Red Army in WWII -- at the May 9th celebration will fuel speculation about Putin's latest economic directives to ""re-invigorate"" the Russian military and sustain the planet's largest nuclear arsenal (see: ""Putin's New 'Wunderwaffe': The World's Deadliest Tank?""). North Korea held its biggest parade to date in 2013, yet the auteurs of this year's spectacle, according to the North Korean media, aspire to outshine all past events. North Korean ideologues proudly espouse Seon'gun, ""military first,"" as state policy. Recently enthroned Kim Jong Un appears to have fortified his power base and proclaims Armageddon against all who would oppose the Kim kleptocracy and the Supreme Leader's statecraft of personal whim and nuclear blackmail. Fearing the hegemony of an ascendant China, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has sought to ease post-war constitutional restrictions on Japan's military and simultaneously boost a stagnant Japanese economy with its largest defense budget since World War II. Under the aegis of ""Abenomics,"" the Diet has approved an increase in military spending for three consecutive years. The Prime Minister annually reviews the nation's Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) but has thus far avoided an official visit to the Yasukuni Shrine-- a highly controversial monument to Japan's war dead -- though advisors speculate he may reconsider in the face of repeated scruffs with China over the disputed Diaoyu -Senkakus Islands, and Abe's perception of Japan's ""unrealistic pacifism.""In response, The People's Daily has voiced the Communist Party's plan to ""make Japan tremble"" with a prodigious military parade next September. After staging only three previous military spectacles since 1960, the People's Republic of China projects, in addition to the parade marking of the end of World War II, a triptych of martial extravaganzas over the next six years. Touting his domestic mastery and the steel and brawn of the largest armed forces in the world, President Xi Jinping will, for the first time in China's modern history, invite foreign heads of state to witness this tour de force in Beijing. Leaders of Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines may tremble as well. Military parades generate a festive enthusiasm that spirits participants and spectators into an illusive realm of shared human optimism. But just below the shouts and shine of cadenced joy, these spectacles harbor a ruinous cancer. A nation's embrace of armed might is a fatal greeting and inevitable farewell to arms and all that arms will bear.No one who has ever participated in a military parade can deny the rousing yet mind-numbing sensation that marching in perfect synchronization to the tune of martial music invokes, as well as the peculiar intoxicating bond that is forged between the soldier and the audience. During a parade march, one is not allowed to move one's head -- save the dramatic ""eyes right"" for the presiding leader -- and should only stare on the neck seam of the soldier in front, merely isolating single-mindedness by constricting vision. This peripheral blindness, however, works both ways. It affects the soldiers, yet also the onlookers, creating paradoxically what Harold Rosenberg called ""a herd of independent minds,"" which is swept along in a martial reverie. ""The look in all of your eyes made me cry. You seemed ready to go out there and fight,"" my aunt confided to me a few days after the torchlight parade at Eggenberg Palace. She was right. We were primed at that moment for war. In the aftermath of mortal labor there is a solemn military ritual for the casualties of human conflict.In June 2012, I stood in a long line of a few hundred American soldiers and contractors flanking left and right the main road of Forward Operating Base Salerno in Khost Province, Afghanistan. A casket draped with an American flag, in it the remains of a soldier who had died the day before, was slowly carried through the base. There was no music and no marching in step. A chaplain and a few soldiers of the unit he served escorted the casket to a C-130 transport plane waiting on the runway. A loudspeaker shouted out the commands, and even though I was wearing civilian clothes, I instantly assumed a military posture at the order of ""Attention!"" With no further thought, I also kneeled down at the command ""Prepare for Prayer!"" When I later wrote about my experience in a story for the Austrian Daily (see: ""Hero Ceremony am US-Stützpunkt""), many complained that I -- as a correspondent -- should not have participated in this ""hero ceremony."" I felt I almost had no choice. Parades, in one way or the other, are at the beginning and at the end of a soldier's life. Yet, they also can mark -- and this is what the world's leaders should keep in mind -- willy-nilly, the birth and death of states.

And it is obvious she has been severely patriarchalized by her religion. Often people like to say that women who speak against their own gender's intrinsic value, worth, and leadership ability are simply proving that sexism is legitimate and the men who relegate women to secondary, diminished positions are right. The Catholic church, run by all men who exclusively hold extraordinary political and economic power (and billions of dollars in the Vatican bank), has raised many girls to believe that this is how it should be: a man's world dominated by male thinking and action, ordered by a male God who made women lower than men and therefore not able to hold positions of formal leadership -- religious, and some believe, political and otherwise.I grew up in the deep American South in a conservative, fundamentalist evangelical environment that likewise taught me that I came as an afterthought to men in every way.

In the case of Nazi Germany, the history written by the victor is largely one of an ideologically coherent political party on a racially-driven quest for Teutonic world domination. In the newly-released Hitler's Shadow Empire: Nazi Economics and the Spanish Civil War, Pierpaolo Barbieri illustrates why history should be written by historians rather than mere victors by vividly and meticulously illuminating the two very different conceptions of a what a strong Germany meant in the Nazi Party's prewar years among the party's leaders. One faction believed that not only did the political acquisition of a territory still matter, but that it mattered most. Mass annexation was considered essential to the future of the German people. On the other hand was a faction defined in Hitler's Shadow Empire by the Führer's one-time Minister of Economics and President of the Reischbank, Hjalmar Schacht, who knew that without successful economic policy, land grabs meant little. Schacht advocated for an informal empire of economic rather than military dominance, similar to the colonial model and motivated by the prospect of new markets and natural resources. It was Schachtian economics, Barbieri suggests, rather than ideological fraternité that led Hitler to lend his decisive support to Francisco Franco on the eve of the Spanish Civil War. Had Schacht not been forced from the party in 1938, Nazi Germany's European expansion might have played out quite differently than it did.Hitler's Shadow Empire is gripping reading even for non-economic historians. Barbieri gives his economic history a social context, and the book is full of the kind of seemingly-insignificant anecdotes that can quickly morph into pivotal historical moments -- to wit, we learn that a prostitute in a love triangle at the highest levels of the Spanish government defused a coup attempt in 1932. I spoke with Barbieri about his re-framing of the relationship between two of the world's most despised men, the intrinsic danger of absolute power, and historical memory's very long shadow.Why do you think Hitler's alliance with Franco has been cast as ideological rather than economic? I think that when the time came for a democratic transition in Spain, at least some people thought it was most useful to portray Franco as much as possible as an ideological equal to Hitler, in order to color the birth of his dictatorship. The level of violence in the Spanish Civil War was so intense -- both sides committed unspeakable atrocities and Franco spent considerable resources during and after the War to retaliate against the vanquished. And then he ruled with an iron fist for no less than thirty years after Hitler died, which gave him the ability to carefully re-write the parts in his victory story that did not suit him. That obviously leaves a significant historical legacy and division, still deeply felt in Spain today. Given the deep-seeded and emotional nature of that division, I think saying that Hitler allied with Franco for resources rather than for ideological reasons might make some feel as though it degrades the direct link with which they associate two of the 20th century's most reviled dictators. You dedicate an entire chapter to July 25, 1936. What was so significant about that particular day?  That was the day that all of the European powers effectively decided who to align with in the Spanish Civil War and whether or not to intervene. And everybody made that decision trying to calculate what everyone else would do. It's striking that even without Twitter, the Internet, immediate information, the same interlinked decision-making was based on what the newspapers are saying on what your ministers are telling you, on what your allies are telling you, and of course your own prejudices. All these calculations were quite complex and involved chains of government decisions that were at times followed by leaders and at times completely ignored. I am very interested in how policy actually gets made. It is not ""France"" that decides, but one actor that coalesces with another actor and argues for something like a position at a meeting. It is far more granular than we might think. But then Hitler made the decision to back Franco on that day after coming out of a Wagner opera, and named the airlift of Franco's army from Morocco to Spain ""Operation Magic Fire,"" which was the theme of the opera. Hitler was obsessed with Wagner and the stories of redemption in his operas, and I think his decision to align with Franco that day was driven in part by a desire to play a decisive role in redeeming Germany from its diminished position in the world. After all, that is what at least in part drove his politics. Tell me about the divisions within the Nazi Party in the 1930s. It seems there were two very distinct ideas about what kind of might Germany should seek to amass. Both ideologies shared the goal of a powerful Germany. The faction of the party that eventually won out advocated for a policy based on Lebensraum, the idea that territorial expansion and conquest was essential for German strength and survival. The policy Schacht advocated for was based on a more informal empire, like the kind Hitler established with Franco's Spain, built on expanded access to export markets and resources. Its aims were economic rather than military, and it built on World War I ideas associated with Weltpolitik. Why did the Lebensraum faction win out?  In writing this book, the most interesting thing was trying to see how things ended up the way they did. If we look at history is a Borgesian garden of forking paths, what different choices might have been made to result in different histories? I think considering all of those possible different choices, rather than saying from 1933 on, Auschwitz was a forgone conclusion, gives a more interesting and honest view of what decision making is in politics and life. There were rational people, Schacht among them, running policy in the Nazi Party's early years, and its interesting to consider what might have gone differently had his more economics-oriented faction prevailed over the one that did. For the first four years the Nazi Party was in power, the Lebensraum rhetoric was mainly just that -- propaganda broadcast to the masses while more rational policies were actually being implemented at the top. At times Hitler himself disowned some of the extreme versions of these ideas, particularly support for ""autarky"" or economic closure. Schacht's fiscal policy and work projects like the Autobohn and the construction of the Luftwaffe worked well economically boosting jobs and growth, and won the party popularity. But when it came time to moderate that policy to make it sustainable, Hitler refused to do so. He fired Schacht and replaced him with someone who would never tell him something wasn't possible. He centralized all decision-making in himself, and the pragmatists were marginalized or left the party on their own. Once those traditional conservative members had left, all that was left were the zealots, who would never tell Hitler no, and for whom rationality was irrelevant.This sort of zealotry seems to have left room for very few checks on Hitler's power. There were eventually no checks on Hitler's power. He knew how to balance the competing factions within his regime by giving each the necessary illusion of power. But he was the one that made every decision -- he was ""the decider."" And by 1938, he was surrounded by people who were obsessed with him, who told him he was bigger than God, who could never tell him no. I think it is hard, particularly today, to understand the extent of personality cult in Nazi Germany. He began to believe his own success in foreign affairs, in a context where others were weak and his bluffs (in the militarization of the Rhineland, in the annexation of Austria, at the Munich Conference) all seemed to work seamlessly. This success in the foreign sphere seduced him and his closest entourage into thinking that he was the only one who was strong, and that it would always be that way. In the Middle Ages, whenever someone was made Pope, they had somebody who would whisper in their ear throughout the ceremony, ""sic transit gloria mundi"" (how fleeting the glory of the world) to remind him that even if he was God on earth, a day would come where he wouldn't be. And when you don't have that -- and Hitler certainly didn't have that -- you don't listen to the people who say no. And then you're living in a sort of an altered reality everyone has to live in for a little while before it inevitably comes crashing down.  After Schacht left, there was no one with significant power who told Hitler that what he was doing was economically unsustainable. When ideologues run policy, you get statements like the one from one of the heads of the Central Bank meant to quell public fear of inflation: ""If the Fuhrer says there's no inflation, there's no inflation."" Hitler could make his own reality in foreign policy, but economics isn't like politics. You cannot simply outlaw inflation. In the case of Nazi Germany, centralizing power in one man clearly had horrific results. Do you think that's always the case? What about societies that elect not to be democracies, not to have rights? I think one of the beauties of the American constitution is that it's built in anticipation of future weaknesses, rather than on the supposed perfection of the founding fathers. Even if you think you can trust your current leader with absolute power, how can you trust that the people who succeed them will be equally trustworthy? If you consciously try to give up your rights, you shouldn't allowed to, or at least not allowed to forever."

But I have one question.  How in the hell can anyone forget how we got to this point?,2015-04-24,Alvin McEwen - blogmaster of Holy Bullies and Headless Monsters,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578808c91a000025006fa7f5.jpg?ops=100_100,"As a gay man, I admit that I am enthused and encouraged by what I see as a more LGBT-inclusive American society.While we still have some kinks to work on and straighten out, I am happy with our progress. Just a decade ago, we wouldn't be talking about LGBT issues as openly as we are now. We have more public figures who are out from the get-go, rather than coming out after long rumors and speculation. And marriage equality is closer to becoming a 50-state reality sooner than some of us ever realized (fingers crossed).But I am nagged by something which is figuratively poking me in the back of the head with the urgency of a classmate eager to annoy the hell out of me.There is a brazenly dishonest new tactic emanating from the anti-gay right which must be called out on a larger scale. That lie is the idea that somehow the progression of marriage equality and popularity of the LGBT community is suddenly making them isolated and derided for supposedly simply stating their opinions. Suddenly the LGBT community is being portrayed as bullies seeking to shut anti-gay figures down and deride them for speaking against marriage equality and LGBT equality. It's a skilled talking point helped along by think tank finances, intellectuals paid by these finances and a ""news"" network which mistakes omitted information, one-sided interviews and sloppy (probably in some cases deliberately sloppy) journalism as conservative opinion and ideology.Almost weekly, we read or hear about anecdotal incidents drudged up by Tony Perkins and the Family Research Council, Ryan T. Anderson and the Heritage Foundation or Fox News personality Todd Starnes about supposed innocent Christians who are besieged by aggressive gays. Often times, the incidents are over-hyped, biased and without the nuance we should demand from journalism; the latter which we rarely receive until days later.The anti-gay right seem to be painting a portrait of victimhood in anticipation of further progress by the LGBT community and the goal is most likely to stop this progress.But I have one question. How in the hell can anyone forget how we got to this point? I mean really.For decades, anti-gay organizations and their supporters have portrayed the LGBT community as child molesting, diseased, sexually aggressive miscreants whose sole desire is to cause chaos before being sent to the lower pits of hell after we die for our supposed sins. Through lies, distortions and bad science, anti-gay groups made it difficult for laws to be passed to protect our interests, health and families. They created and repeated ad nauseam the false mantra that we are a ""public health hazard"" and our lives are fraught with pain, sadness, loneliness and early death.But suddenly, as if they are recreating the famous scene from the 1978 Superman motion picture in which actor Christopher Reeve soared through the air and flew backwards to alter history, anti-gay groups are attempting to rewrite the so-called culture war.They want the world to forget all of the ignorance they exploited, the lies they told and the tactics they undertook to dehumanize the LGBT community.They want us to forget the times when folks like Anita Bryant accused LGBTs of ""recruiting"" children to ""refreshen"" our ranks.They want us to forget the officials in the Reagan Administration who kept the president from adequately addressing the AIDS crisis in its early days.They want us to forget the names and faces of people whose lives were destroyed via homophobic violence or suicide most likely spurred on by the nods of societal homophobiaThey want us to forget all of the times when we fearfully hid in the closets, while being attacked by purveyors of junk science during Congressional hearings or had the quality of our lives reduced to fevered sexual fantasies on a day-to-day basis.And most of all, they want us to forget that all of this was done either directly by them or through their tacit approval.Sorry guys, you are not victims. You never were. You can't pretend that none of these things I just talked about didn't happen. You can't pretend that somehow where we are now when it comes to LGBT equality just happened in vacuum. And you can't erase your history of being bullies. I don't expect any of you to atone, but at the very least, you need to acknowledge.You can't escape the truth no matter how fast you run or how much influence you peddle to distance yourself from it.Don't mistake my words as some sort of call to violence or isolation against you. It's just to say that I'm hip to the game you are running. Nor am I the only one.So play this game as long as you can because sooner or later, all games must come to an end.And when THIS game ends, you will be the loser.LGBTs don't forget and we don't let others forget, either."

8,WORLDPOST,Understanding The Deadly Rise In Mediterranean Migration,Talia Lavin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mediterranean-migrants-greece_n_7128198.html,,2015-04-24,"Migrant children display on November 27, 2014 a sign upon their arrival in the Cretan port of Ierapetra. Around 700 migrants aboard a freighter that had been drifting in the Aegean Sea for two days began disembarking on the Greek island of Crete. The migrants from Syria, Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, include 'a lot of women and children', said Theodosis Kalantzakis, the mayor of Ierapetra. AFP PHOTO / COSTAS METAXAKIS (Photo credit should read Costas Metaxakis/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9a90b12300004301ea05d5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A few years ago, a photograph of a notorious mafia member hung in the office of the Hellenic Coast Guard Security Department. Next to it was a phrase that had often been cited at the time: “The gun trade is dead and the drugs trade has become very dangerous. The easiest money is now in trade of humans.” The cynical confession captures three major truths, one of the officers in the department told HuffPost Greece: the policies and measures currently in place against human trafficking are insufficient; the profits are bigger than ever; and the networks involved now constitute a major part of what we call organized crime.The drowning deaths of thousands of migrants in the Mediterranean over the past months have searingly illustrated the inability of the European community to demonstrate solidarity between member states and show a commitment to humanitarianism in the face of desperate people arriving in its backyard. Hundreds of people assemble around a map of the Mediterranean Sea on April 23, 2015 in Marseille, protesting against European immigration politics. (BORIS HORVAT/AFP/Getty Images)According to the International Organization of Migration (IOM), we are currently witnessing the biggest migration since the Second World War. The number of people who have abandoned their countries has risen to more than 16 million globally, while almost 33 million people have been forced into internal migration. Over the past year and a half, Greece and Italy, two countries considered gates to the European Union, have seen an unprecedented increase in the number of migrants arriving on their coasts. Greece and Italy, by virtue of their geographic position, bear much of the burden of receiving migrants trying to reach Europe via Turkey and North Africa. The migration flows towards the Aegean Sea and the Central Mediterranean are the highest that have been recorded in recent memory, according to the Greek coast guard and Europe's border control agency Frontex. More than 34,000 migrants entered Greece illegally by sea in 2014, compared to just 9,357 in 2013, according to the Hellenic Coast Guard. The 265 percent increase has impacted four islands in particular: Lesbos, Samos, Chios and Leros. Last year alone, their coastal authorities tracked down 27,378 migrants. The islands' capacity to take in migrants has been severely overstretched.Many say that number may continue to rise. Officials in Greece project the arrival of up to 100,000 migrants in 2015. Current trends confirm these calculations: during the first quarter of 2015, more than 10,000 migrants arrived in the country, the head of the Greek office of the IOM told HuffPost. These high numbers are unusual, since the primary season for migrant activity is usually from June to November.Italy, too, receives large numbers of foreigners; at least 18,000 migrants arrived in the country in the first quarter of 2015.  Deadly Voyages Across The MediterraneanThe rising number of deaths recorded in the Mediterranean Sea raises questions and concern about the way the crisis ought to be handled. The termination of Italy's Mare Nostrum rescue mission, which patrolled the Mediterranean, is thought to be a major factor in the increase in shipwrecks and the rise of the number of migrants who perish at sea.It is now estimated that for every 1,000 migrants that are known to have crossed the Mediterranean, more than 46 lose their lives in shipwrecks. The actual number might even be higher. Why People MigrateAccording to Greek coast guard officers, there are many reasons for the rising number of fatalities. The civil war in Syria continues unabated in its fifth year, with a devastating cost in human lives, unspeakable pain and horror for non-combatants.Many Syrians found refuge in surrounding countries like Turkey -- which hosts 1.6 million Syrian refugees-- and Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan. But conditions for many refugees in those countries have become more difficult in recent months. Egypt has altered its migrant policy, including by imposing visa obligations and revoking residence permits. Similar policies have been implemented recently in Lebanon and Jordan. New migrant policies in Iran have additionally led many Afghans who had found refuge in the neighboring country to seek their fortunes in Europe.The activities of the Islamic State militant group constitute an additional factor leading Middle Easterners, particularly Iraqis and Syrians, to seek safety in Europe. According to available statistics, 65 percent of those who have illegally entered Greece in the past months are Syrian war refugees.

(AP Photo/Francesco Malavolta)The Role of Organized CrimeWhen talking about organized crime and migrant smuggling networks, the phenomenon does not start or end on the coasts of Turkey or African countries. This is a “chain” of thousands of people covering massive swathes of territory. It starts with the first smuggler in some distant country who offers to help the migrant reach Turkey illegally; another who will take on the transit to Greece or Italy; and another who will arrange transportation to the desired destination, usually in northern Europe.Conflict and war, especially in the Middle East, have spiked demand and many migrant smugglers have seen their profits dramatically increase. “We are literally talking about a... dance of hundreds of millions of euros on a yearly basis,"" one coast guard officer told HuffPost Greece.  A protestor holds up a sign during a demonstration outside of an emergency EU summit in Brussels on Thursday, April 23, 2015. (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert)Methods of TransitThe smuggling networks use all means available to increase profit and decrease threats... for themselves, not for the migrants.Until the recent spike in crossings, the most common transportation method for migrants traveling from Turkey to Greece was to load men, women and children in a children's inflatable raft, without additional security measures or supervision. Migrants were given instructions to puncture the plastic upon arrival at the Greek coast, so that a mission tracking down migrants would convert to a search-and-rescue mission. At other times, smugglers have given migrants a small boat or a rowboat, and even an accompanying attendant -- usually a minor. The cost per person then rises to 2,000 or 3,000 Euros ($2,144-$3,216). The “ticket” price changes depend on the degree of risk, meaning the method of transportation, the offer of an attendant or not, the number of passengers, the distance between the Turkish and Greek coasts and weather conditions on the day of travel.Recently, however, there are signs that the smugglers' methods may have shifted, as many migrants are so desperate they are willing to pay no matter what. Cargo vessels have become a common method of transport, according to the European Commission. Since September 2014, 12 incidents with cargo vessels have been reported, with seven occurring in December 2014 alone. The trips, the European Commission says, cost between $5,000 and $7500 per person -- indicative of the massive potential profits involved in the enterprise.Greek coast guard officers told HuffPost that they can't say with certainty that cargo vessels are the new method used by the networks, but they acknowledge it is a prevailing tendency. “The major problem on these occasions -- and the smugglers know it very well -- is that the prosecuting authorities can’t stop and check a cargo ship or a big fishing ship unless there is a strong reason, as defined by international regulations,"" one of the officers said. ""There are rules allowing the free navigation, ships always have a flag of a foreign country and things are even more difficult when they are in international waters.”But beyond this apparent trend, the smugglers also appear to be borrowing methods used mainly by large networks of trade and trafficking of drugs. “We see that there are cargo ships functioning as a mother ship, as is true of cocaine and heroin trafficking,” the Coast Guard officer told HuffPost Greece. ""There are a large number of migrants on board the ship and afterward, in the middle of the open sea, the migrants are divided as cargo into smaller boats. Whether they want to, or not.”This article was originally posted on HuffPost Greece and was translated into English. It was adapted for an American audience. "

Copy space.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9eb3fd24000030009595b8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Achieving goals with ease is an art that many people are yet to master. If you are one of these people, you could be making one of these crucial mistakes. Take note.1. Don't take score too often.Dreams and projects can take time to grow. If you're constantly and obsessively checking for evidence that your desires are on their way to you and everything is going precisely to plan, you may end up feeling impatient and frustrated, which will in turn mean you are not in a good emotional place to continue taking action with enjoyment and ease.Of course you may need to check in with your progress towards your goals and revise your plan every now and then, but do it purposefully and spaced at healthy intervals.2. Don't get distracted by others.If you've ever swam laps in a public pool, you will know how tempting it can be to get distracted by someone in the next lane swimming who is swimming faster than you. Everyone has their own unique purpose and path to walk in this world, so try to stay focused on your own lane -- don't worry too much about what other people are working on or whether they're seemingly making more progress than you. You are doing things in your own time and in your own way, and that's exactly how it's supposed to be.3. Don't forget to celebrate along the way.Most people reserve celebrations for when they've finally reached the finish line of a goal or dream. There's absolutely no reason you can't celebrate each baby step you take along the way. In fact, taking a moment to celebrate your incremental accomplishments is a sure-fire way to boost your spirits and replenish your well of motivation.4. Don't put your happiness on hold.Many of us put our happiness on hold until a mythical day in the future when we will be slimmer, wealthier, more successful, much-adored and have ticked off a suitable number of goals. This is problematic for two reasons. Firstly, this day of finally ""having it all"" doesn't exist -- it's not an attainable reality, as you will always be giving birth to new desires and goals, and therefore the goal posts will always be moving. Secondly, it's critical to enjoy the journey towards your goals because the journey is all there really is -- the journey is life itself. This very moment that is happening right now is the only time you get to truly experience life itself in all of its beauty, power and glory.5. Don't try to force your actions.There is a big difference between taking inspired action in the flow, and exerting huge amounts of effort to force yourself into action with gritted teeth. Approach even the smallest of tasks with an attitude of service, love, care and enjoyment, and you will be amazed at how effortlessly things will begin to unfold before your eyes. Better still, at the end of the day you will feel energized, rather than drained.6. Don't loose sight of the bigger picture.Have you ever started out on the journey towards a goal, project or dream feeling hugely inspired and excited, only to loose steam and throw in the towel? It could be because you've forgotten about your big picture reason for taking action -- the vision that you're working towards, and the sweet feelings of joy, fulfillment or accomplishment you will experience in abundance once you've finished. Keep reminders of your bigger vision close by. When you loose focus, pause to reflect on what it would feel like to have already achieved your goal or dream right now. Try to embody this feeling for a few minutes, and let it spark a new wave of motivation inside of you.7. Don't hide in shadow work.Shadow work is the type of work that keeps us feeling really busy, but doesn't really achieve much -- like checking your Inbox incessantly or reading too many posts on social media. Shadow work is addictive because it feels much safer and easier than facing up to the daunting task of doing the real, powerful, sometimes scary work that will get us closer to our goals and dreams. But if you never take real action, you will never get to experience the changes you desire. Try scheduling in a block of time to complete your most important, valuable tasks before allowing yourself to have a break with shadow work.8. Don't feel you have to go it alone.Humans are naturally social creatures but many of us have been conditioned to avoid situations where we have to expose our true feelings, be open-hearted or ask for help. It's perfectly okay to reach out to others and ask them for advice, hands-on help or even just moral support -- and the more that you have the courage to do so, the more you will inspire others around you to do the same.Elyse is a writer and happiness teacher at NotesOnBliss.com and the creater of the Beautiful Life Bootcamp eCourse.

With its reliance on military and monetary aid from the US, and its extensive export to Asia, Europe, and North America, it's ironic, almost sardonic to think of the state of Israel as independent. But what country is independent if our world is globally interconnected? We are all so entangled that if one country, even as small as Greece, were to collapse, the consequences would be painful to billions around the world.Excerpt from The Place Where Peace Begins: Circles method organized by the Arvut Movement. But then, most of us don't live in the macro; we live in the micro, in our own little worlds. What makes us happy (even if momentarily) is not that our country's GDP has grown by 3% this quarter, but that we got a raise and make $3 an hour more than we did last year. If the conflict with our neighboring countries is escalating once again, it troubles me. But what troubles me much more is if my child is being bullied at school.Most of us are ordinary people, who worry about ordinary things. The problem is that ordinary solutions to ordinary problems don't work anymore. We have lost our sense of personal security, confidence, and our optimism is beginning to fade as it grows harder and harder to believe that things will get better tomorrow. These basic elements of confidence, security, and hope, constitute our sense of freedom, and we cannot be happy without them.When I consider the life we have in Israel compared to the life that Israelis had when the country was in its infancy, I feel embarrassed by how spoiled we have become. We have all the amenities of life, and even relative security, yet the founders of the country were much happier, with far less material goods, and far more insecurity concerning their future.But the founders had something that we have lost, a key element to happiness in life: They had meaning! They knew why they insisted on living here, and knew that they had no place else to go. We have lost it, but it is an imperative ingredient in one's happiness. Today's lack of meaning is so profound, and so prevalent throughout the world that people would do anything to satisfy it. They join ISIS or become political extremists, all for the sense of purpose and meaning that comes with fundamentalism. And those who do not opt for extremism, all too often find comfort in substance abuse and other self-destructive engagements.However, the solution is close at hand. We tend to forget it, but we all feel best when we are among close friends and family. When people accept us for who we are, we feel confident and free. Moreover, the feeling that we are worthy encourages our inherent desire to contribute our share, making us positively proactive in our communities.People with strong social ties live longer and are generally healthier. Such people are less prone to substance abuse or to various forms of extremism. In fact, even if they are already involved in self-destructive engagements, the most effective way to help them change is by assisting them in fostering positive social connections. Portugal's success in cutting addiction rates by half is proof that such methods can be implemented on a broad scale, and there are many more such as this one.If we are so dependent on good social ties, then how do we develop them, when we are so prone toward suspicion and alienation? The answer is easy: Instead of succumbing to pessimism, or trying to fight our self-absorbed nature (and rarely succeed), we should concentrate on nurturing a positive social environment, one that accepts and embraces everyone for who they are, and encourages people to contribute their skills to the benefit of society.In Israel, we have begun to facilitate through the Arvut (mutual guarantee) Movement a method called ""circles."" The idea is to gather a few people, often complete strangers, and invite them over to sit in a circle and join a discussion. The discussion follows a few simple, but critically important rules, and the results are astounding. Variations of this idea are performed in many places throughout the world, but here we are talking about taking complete strangers, even enemies, and dissolving their suspicion and animosity within less than an hour. In this clip, we interviewed Israeli Arabs vacationing in Eilat, a resort town in Southern Israel, after they participated with Israeli Jews in a circle. Their words speak for themselves.The circle guidelines are simple:1) Sit in a circle of 5-10 people, including the host. 2) The host asks a question that everyone answers in their own turn. 3) Everyone is in the circle equal; no point of view is more important or correct than another. 4) Speakers express their minds freely, but are not allowed to negate or argue with other's views. They are only allowed (and encouraged) to contribute their own thoughts to the collective pool of views. No answer is wrong or right; the idea is to contribute. 5) Limit the speakers to one minute each. This will prevent ""speech making"" that might disengage others from the conversation. 6) Optional: Use a ""speaking object."" Anything small will do, like a pen or a flower. Only the person holding it may speak, and the speakers pass it among them when they are done speaking.The questions are also important; they must encourage positive relations. For example, ""Why are positive social connections so important in our lives?"" is a good question for the beginning of a discussion. But ""What type of social connections can help us?"" is not recommended because the answers can go in many directions, and not necessarily socially constructive ones.The circles method is just one way to make our society more supportive and embracing. There are many others that can be implemented, but the important point to remember is that if we foster positive social ties, we will feel happy and free, strong and healthy. And this, at the end of the day, is all the independence that we need."

Since they have arrived without invitation their proposed immigration is technically ""illegal."" These people are described as ""refugees,"" and lately, given their strategy to enter Europe by crossing the Mediterranean, as ""Mediterranean refugees,"" even though many of them have only tenuous links to the Mediterranean Sea.Some in fact have been displaced by war and violence and forced to abandon their homes. Others are simply fleeing poverty and hopelessness for the promise of a better life in Europe. The EU's generous social welfare programs are a virtual guarantee of a better life than the one they left behind. The magnitude of the crisis has been underscored by the rising death toll that has accompanied the growing number of refugees attempting the dangerous crossing.In 2014, approximately 650,000 people sought political asylum in Europe. Approximately 35 percent, about 220,000, of them had been picked up by a combination of military patrol ships and various private and commercial craft as they attempted to cross the Mediterranean Sea. Most chose to cross in the relatively narrow central Mediterranean, where the North African shore is only 100 miles (Tunis to Trapani) to 300 miles (Tripoli to Sicily) from Europe and which is dotted with a number of island ""safe havens,"" Pantelleria, Lampedusa and Malta among the better known ones.In the short term, this ""Mediterranean Refugee Crisis"" has been facilitated by the civil wars in Libya and Syria and the resulting breakdown of governmental authority, the virtual abandonment of border controls and the concomitant rise of criminal gangs and jihadist groups that have stepped into the power vacuum for their own ends.  Mediterranean Maritime Transit RoutesIn the eastern Mediterranean, where roughly 20 percent of the refugees have originated, the bulk have come from Syria; victims of the four year long civil war. Most of the refugees have ended up in camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. These three countries are hosting over 3.6 million Syrian refugees. An additional 500,000 refugees are scattered across a broad range of other countries, with roughly three quarters of that number in Iraq and Egypt. An additional six million refugees remain displaced within Syria itself. Only a relatively small portion of these refugees have attempted the journey to Europe, most of them crossing the eastern Mediterranean to either Cyprus or Greece.In the central Mediterranean, where the bulk, about 80 percent, of the refugees are coming, Libya and to a lesser extent Egypt and Tunisia, has become the launching point for a pool of refugees being drawn from a broad area of central and North Africa. From Somalia and Eritrea on the Red Sea across the Sahel to the Gulf of Guinea, scores of Africans are making their way to North Africa's Mediterranean shore and the prospect of a European life.The smuggling operation consists of three distinct segments: the journey to the Mediterranean coast, the journey across the Mediterranean Sea and the journey across Europe. The organization of the various components is not entirely clear. It is unlikely that any one organization controls all three elements. More likely, there are informal links between various organizations with groups of refugees passed from one organization to another, much the same way that various criminal organizations work together in the transport of narcotics around the world.According to John Hooper, the Economist's Italy correspondent, Italian authorities believe that the human trafficking in Libya is controlled by four separate organizations. Virtually no additional details have been released pending further investigations by Italian police. The relationship between the Libyan based smuggling rings and their European based counterparts is unclear as is the extent of their cooperation. In addition to the ""main organizations"" there are a host of ""free lancers"" that are also involved in smuggling refugees.  Overland Transit Routes to the Mediterranean CoastThe costs for each segment of the journey can run from as little as 500 dollars to over 3,000 dollars. Costs are assessed both on the basis of an ability to pay as well as by the relative comfort of the journey. On the larger boats across the Mediterranean, the lowest paying customers are usually locked in the hold while top paying customers at least get to be topside. Even among human smugglers there is a distinction between first class and steerage, relatively speaking. In total, it may cost as little as a few thousand dollars or as much as 10,000 dollars a head to make the journey. Most of the refugees lack sufficient funds to pay the cost of transport. A significant portion of the funds that oil these smuggling operations originate in Europe among friends and relatives of the refugees. Hawalas, the informal word of mouth banking networks that have operated in the Middle East for centuries, facilitate the transfer of funds. Such transfers rely on long standing personal relationships between these ""bankers."" There is no electronic transfer, no SWIFT codes or routing slips, no paper or computer trail for authorities to track. While the unauthorized entry by migrants into Europe is illegal, providing funds to their smugglers is not. Ironically, Europe is itself financing its own invasion by illegal immigrants.Jihadist organizations operating in Libya are believed to be heavily involved in the human trafficking either by providing ""protection"" to the criminal gangs that are carrying it out or by organizing it themselves. Ansar al-Shariah, the Islamic State's affiliate in Libya, has a leading role in the smuggling of refugees into Europe. The Mediterranean portion of the illegal trafficking has been estimated to generate approximately 500 million dollars for the Libyan groups involved with it. The entire smuggling operation probably represents an activity generating in excess of a billion dollars for all of the parties concerned.  Central Mediterranean Maritime RoutesNot only has this illegal trade funded the operations of various jihadist groups but it has also provided a convenient means of potentially smuggling jihadists into Europe. Islamic State has boasted that it has smuggled over 4,000 of its supporters into Europe. Although this figure is most likely exaggerated, it is virtually certain that some number of jihadists have already entered Europe in this way. Virtually none of the refugees carry any documentation. Formal processing by immigration authorities has been hit or miss. Until quite recently, many refugees were not even finger printed by authorities. Between April 13 and 21, it is believed that as many as 1,300 refugees perished as a result of boats sinking while making the crossing. Four of the boats that sank were in the central Mediterranean while the fifth was off Cyprus. To date, over 1,500 people have perished, a seventeen fold increase over the comparable period last year and the ""Mediterranean refugee season"" is just barely beginning. The deaths have raised cries of protest across Europe and mobilized a broad range of humanitarian organizations to get involved in rescue efforts.The death toll, though tragic, misses the larger issue at stake here. By most accounts, 95 percent or more of the refugees are making it to Europe. Those figures are based only on the number of refugees being picked up by European authorities. If the number of refugees that escape detection is added in, and no one quite knows what that number is, then the percentage of refugees that survive the crossing is even higher.Even if not a single refugee was dying during the journey, the magnitude of the problem would not be any less critical. Europe cannot continue to absorb hundreds of thousands of refugees nor can the front line Mediterranean states, from Spain to Italy, Malta and Greece continue to absorb the costs of policing Europe's southern border or the burden of dealing with the Mediterranean refugee crisis.The death toll and the dangers and rigors of the journey are not enough to discourage migrants from making the dangerous journey. Italian authorities believe that there are half a million refugees on the southern shore of the Mediterranean ready to attempt the crossing this summer. Some estimates have placed the number as high as one million. Refugee Laden Boat in the Mediterranean Photo courtesy Marina Militare, Italy Moreover, the refugees entering Europe via the Mediterranean is only part of the problem. According to FRONTEX, the EU agency charged with managing Europe's border controls, ""The single biggest entry route for migrants into the EU is via international airports: most of those who currently reside in the EU illegally, originally entered in possession of valid travel documents and a visa whose validity period they have since overstayed.""The EU has been powerless to deal with the crisis. In part, because there is no consensus on what issues it needs to address. The deaths of refugees on the high seas have raised a storm of protest throughout the world and has been deeply embarrassing to Europe's elected leaders. The solution is easy enough, simply expand the number of boats on station in the central Mediterranean and deploy them closer to the North African shore. That's precisely what Italian authorities were doing before they pulled back from their forward deployments in the face of criticism from other European countries that their Mare Nostrum program, in plucking the migrants off the high seas was encouraging even more refugees to make the dangerous journey.On Thursday, April 23, EU leaders announced the expansion of the current Triton program to intercept refugee boats. The number of ships deployed and funding would be tripled under the new proposal, restoring the deployment to levels comparable to the previous, Italian, Mare Nostrum program. In addition, the search and rescue effort would be expanded to include the maritime transit routes to Greece as well. EU leaders also announced they would seek U.N Security Council authority to seize and destroy boats being used by the smugglers.  The problem is to either prevent the refugees from coming or to determine what to do with them once they are rescued. The fact is that no one wants these people. Europe, battling record high unemployment, stagnant economies, record government deficits and the steady growth of anti-immigrant parties has no appetite to accommodate a never ending stream of refugees.Repatriation is not always feasible. In many instances it contravenes existing EU laws and most of the time it's not certain where the refugees should or could be sent. In March, the EU floated the idea of setting up refugee camps in Tunisia and Egypt, supervised by those respective governments and financed by the EU, and repatriating the Mediterranean refugees there. The trial balloon went nowhere. While such a scheme might alleviate the problem in the short term, in the long term it would create even greater problems. Instead various EU leaders have announced that they are launching police investigations of the criminal gangs involved in the human trafficking and that they are targeting the leaders of these organizations for police and possibly even military interventions. On the April 21, Italian authorities publically announced the arrest of a Tunisian boat captain and his first mate on charges of aggravated manslaughter as a result of the deaths of scores of refuges they were carrying illegally to Europe. Such actions may make for great headlines but they are completely ineffectual. To begin with it is unlikely that criminal investigations of the various groups engaged in the human trafficking will yield much result. Likewise, the likelihood of any kind of military intervention in Libya, beyond, at best, a token air raid against some group's headquarters, is also highly unlikely. There is no support in Europe for any kind of military intervention in Libya and it is unlikely that any such intervention would do anything more than add to the chaos which already reigns there. Moreover, while the various criminal and jihadist groups are certainly facilitating this human trafficking, and are profiting mightily from it, they are simply responding to the demand for such services from the hundreds of thousands of would be immigrants. Arresting the leaders of these organizations, or even eliminating these organizations all together, will not eliminate the problem in the long run. It will simply set the stage for a new group of organizations to take the lead. Illegal Immigrants Arriving at the Italian Island of LampedusaAll over the world millions of immigrants are on the move, looking for safety and a better life for themselves and their families. Across the Mediterranean, across the Rio Grande, the Plata and the Padma, across the Indian Ocean or the South China Sea, the journey may be different but the objective remains the same. Mona Chalabi, writing in The Guardian, September 11, 2013, has estimated that there were 232 million immigrants worldwide as of 2013. Joseph Chamie, the former Director of the U.N. Population Department, believes at least 50 million of those immigrants are ""illegal"" or ""undocumented."" Other estimates have placed the number as high as 100 million. In most developing countries, illegal immigrants comprise between 1 and 4 percent of the population. The Department of Homeland Security has estimated the number of ""undocumented"" immigrants in the United States at around 12 million people, or about 3.5 percent of the population.In trying to resist the Mediterranean refugee phenomenon, Europe's leaders are attempting to resist powerful historical forces. They may be slowed down, even delayed, but they will not be overcome. More ships in the Mediterranean will not solve the problem of the Mediterranean refugees any more than more fences along the Rio Grande will solve America's illegal immigration problem.From one end of the globe to the other, ""have-nots"" are looking with envy at the lives of the ""haves."" This is not about ideology or politics. They are not revolutionaries looking to overturn the old order or seeking payback for the legacy of colonial imperialism, rather they are looking to join it and benefit from its bounty. In the giant, exclusive, gated communities that are the developed nations of the world, there is little appetite for new burdens. Indeed there is an ever growing desperation to preserve a lifestyle that their economies find increasingly difficult to finance. Europe's leaders will not solve the problem of Mediterranean refugees with desperate late night meetings or a never-ending stream of summits in Brussels. They can fantasize that money and maybe a little force would make the problem go away. It won't. The tide of refugees may ebb and flow but its progress will be relentless. They have history on their side."

What happens when we no longer have our phones as our armor? Are we even the same person when it comes time to remove the texting, and trade it in for person-to-person talking?We use one-word answers to explain who we are, where we are from, what we like and how we are feeling. We're losing the ability to express ourselves in person-to-person communication when there is not something to ""hide"" behind.Today, we are continuously so tapped into something that we lose our surroundings. We're plugged in all the time, but to our own little world. We're obsessed with what others are doing, but not the people right next to us. We sit at dinner parties covered in a glow of cellphone usage. We let ""Mr. or Mrs. Right"" walk right past us because we are swiping left and right. We're not calling our friends to say, ""hello,"" because we think we know what's going on in their lives through a series of pictures.We're losing real communication in exchange for a false sense of connection.We need to stop being so focused on the cyber world and start becoming present in the ""real world."" We need to lose our desire for ""false connections,"" so that we become more approachable, and ultimately find real connections. We need to understand being present does not include looking at our mobile devices. We need to start being more self-aware about the amount of usage we are giving our electronics.Personally, I've taken this all to heart for some time now, and have made changes in my own life, so that love, friendship and real relationships can become present in my life. I've made it of chief importance to see my friends, to find career opportunities that allow me to have more human interaction, and not be a part of the ever growing dating app world.Below are eight things that I would recommend trying out, so that you too, may find a real sense of connection, a greater appreciation of being present and an overall happier life. Some of these ideas seem like common sense, but you'd be surprised how many of us forget to implement these ideas.1. Stop Looking at Your PhoneObviously, I don't mean all together. Our phones make our lives a million times easier, but with that ease we are paying a huge price. We waste so much time gazing into the lives of others on social media that we forget we have our own lives to live, our own dreams to make come true, our own love stories to write.When you stop looking down, you start looking up. This is the greatest literal and metaphorical change you can make to your life. When you're looking at your phone, you're allowing a magical world to pass you by, and closing yourself off from endless opportunities. Look up, look left, look right. Hell, look anywhere besides down, all you will ever see is your phone and feet.You'll start to see many possibilities, people, and places you glanced over before in new ways.2. Make Your Phone Your Friend Not Your FoeIf you're going to spend time on Facebook, Instagram and all these other social media sites, they should be used as tools for inspiration, not harmful venues for you to feel insignificant, envious or jealous. Follow people that make you want to chase your dreams, provide motivation and act as examples.Sign up for newsletters or email notifications about what is happening in the world. Allow yourself the opportunity to become a more informed individual, so that you don't get stuck harping on unimportant and trivial things like what celebrities are fighting today.3. Unplug Your HeadphonesWe use our headphones as conscious and subconscious signifiers that we don't want to be approached, spoken to, or interacted with. I'd agree there are times this is a necessary action; I for one, like my time to be my time when I am at the gym. However, the problem arises when we're always closed off from others by plugging in our headphones.By removing your headphones here and there, you're allowing yourself to be more approachable, or even, GASP, approached. You're giving others an indirect message that you're open to real communication. You're allowing yourself to be even more present in your life. You're allowing for vocal interaction to be a thing.4. SmileIt's something that is so simple and easy to do, but something many of us don't do. We frown, implement ""resting bitch face,"" or do anything but smile. When you smile, you look welcoming, inviting and approachable.Smiling for one minute can literally change your entire mood. It makes you laugh at yourself, and you forget why you were doing anything other then smiling, and being happy. Smiling helps release stress, boosts your immune system and is a universal sign of happiness.Who wouldn't want any of those things?5. Stop Talking About the Things You Want to Do and Do ThemBy putting down your phone, you're allowing your time to be taken up by things that mean something to you, rather than simply ""wasting"" time. Many of us use our phones as ways to distract us from what is actually going on.Being fully present in the moment is something that this generation, my generation, has a hard time doing. We don't know how to simply wait for our friend or date to show up without playing on our phones. We don't know how to ask for help when we may need it. We think we see everyone else having it all together, so we should too.I know so many people, who have big ideas and dreams, but are afraid to go after them because they're scared. The people who've fulfilled their dreams have taken risks and reaped the rewards. They're the one's that you are staring at on social media, and think, ""I wish I had that person's life.""6. Stop Hiding Behind Your Phone When I was single and dating, I tried everything from Tindr to Facebook to meet guys, and it worked. I met a lot of dudes! We would connect through some form of texting, have nice conversations, and get to a place where we both wanted to go on an actual date. Crazy, I know!I'd be so pumped to meet this guy, who came across sweet, confident and cool, but the second we meet in person, Mr. Perfect became Mr. Boring, Mr. Quiet, or Mr. No Personality. I literally would think, ""Was that even you, who I was talking to?""We've become so used to having something to guard us from rejection that many of us end up with two personalities. One persona, who is probably more like the real us without any thought of judgment, and the other persona being one that is defensive and scared. I'm all for someone having confidence, but that confidence should be there when you are standing eye to eye with one another, not just typing words.7. Stop Using Dating AppsI've said this once, I'll say it a thousand times; if you're looking for a real connection, chances are, you're not going to find one by swiping through countless men or women.I know there's the exception to every rule, but if you're on number 100 of first dates than its time to retire the app, and start going out into the real world, putting yourself at risk to be rejected, and walking up to real people you find attractive for one reason or another.I deleted all my dating apps a long long time ago, and made myself say hi to guys I was interested in. It was scary, some flat out gave me the cold shoulder, but with each guy I walked up to it became easier and easier to say hi.I also don't think I would have necessarily liked specific guys I ended up liking in person had I first come across them online. There's a certain energy that can be felt when you first see someone you are attracted to in person that will never be obtainable through a screen.8. Stop Going for Instant GratificationWe're literally able to do just about anything through the Internet, our phones, or whatever electronic device you favor. We're presented with many opportunities because of our connectedness, but the problem is, we don't always give ourselves time to think. We act fastidiously because we can, not because we should. We give in to sudden urges and play mind-games with ourselves later, when it should be the reverse.We're not looking out for numero uno, ourselves, as best as we should because we ""can do now, and think later."" We need to remember that all actions, good and bad, come with some sort of consequence. Just because something sounds like a good idea at the time doesn't mean it is.Rebel Wilson says it best in Pitch Perfect, ""I sometimes have a feeling I can do crystal meth, but than I think, 'mmmm, better not.'""Ultimately, I don't think our generation is doing everything wrong. So many of us are using a number of these tools to better the world. We are making tremendous advances in technology, medicine, and an array of other areas, but we need to remember that everything that we think is helping us, can also be harmful in some way.Too much oxygen will suffocate you; too much water will drown you; too many vegetables will still make you overweight. Yes, these are extremes, but they are examples of how moderation is necessary, of how we need to be aware of what we're doing to ourselves, of how we need to look beyond our phones.I by no means am saying throw your phone out, or never look at it again, but I am saying that you would be surprised at how much beauty, joy, and life you miss everyday while looking down.Be aware. Be approachable. Be present.Who knows, your life just might change by looking up."

Uncomfortable because, as a daughter of a ""transparent,"" the tabloid tone of ridicule with which the speculation has been presented recalls the cruel words I heard behind my back growing up. It's amazing how well our muscles remember. Who would have thought that the fear and shame I once felt so viscerally in elementary school -- when someone would make fun of transgender people and I'd break out into a sweat, shallowly breathing, gnawing my fingernails until the subject changed -- could be conjured in an instant, twenty-five years later? Any psychologist on the planet, I'm sure.Of course this tone is not new, is not specific to the speculation about Jenner's gender. He has set himself up for this; ridicule and spectacle have surrounded the Kardashian/Jenner family for years because they have placed their private lives squarely in the public eye. Once one of the best American athletes, Jenner has undergone extensive plastic surgery and made frequent appearances on the reality television show ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians,"" leading people to jab at him for decades now. ""Bruce Jenner -- one of the greatest athletes of all time -- what has that show done to him?"" I said that once. I'm not proud, and I don't think I'm alone. It's only now that I have a knee-jerk reaction to the digs because I feel a personal connection. I've watched Jenner on the show for years; he and my father are similar in many ways. They are both pilots and athletes who obsessively tinker with their mechanical toys. They are focused, conservative, and introverted, traditionally masculine in many ways, and I'd imagine wouldn't care too much to be a trans advocate. I have seen my father in this man and in this discussion, and have been reminded of how she -- not famous -- has been spoken about. It's difficult to hear what people are saying and to not think they are saying it about my dad. Because aren't they?It's perhaps unfair, immoral, and cruel to speculate about someone's gender. What's more interesting to me is the significance of the discussion surrounding the mere possibility that Jenner is transitioning.On the possible transition, Dr. Katherine Rachlin, a psychologist and gender specialist in New York, was quoted in the New York Times as saying, ""It would be great to have celebrities who are respected going through gender transitions. I don't know if this falls into that. The whole thing seems pretty tabloid to me.""Rachlin's dismissal of Jenner as a suitable face for the trans community can be understood in the context of the challenges embattled, outsider groups have always faced. She is essentially asking the transgender equivalent of, ""But is it good for the Jews?"" In order to be included, marginalized groups have to make people feel comfortable, so they must choose the most respectable representatives for the tribe. Laverne Cox and Janet Mock are beautiful and glamorous; they make us feel comfortable. Jeffrey Tambor's character on ""Transparent"" is pushing it, but we know it is Jeffrey Tambor playing this character, so it's easier to swallow. Bruce Jenner is in a whole other realm that the world doesn't seem quite ready to handle. My father's transition was awkward to an outsider's eye. I once caught my step-brother imitating her voice, and my stomach still tightens at the memory. He exaggerated the high pitch in the same way In Touch Weekly featured Jenner's face with heightened colors of makeup. My father did not make everyone comfortable, but she's still a face in and of the trans community. My hope is that this whole ridiculous, invasive spectacle may help expand public understanding of transgender people. I worship Laverne Cox with the best of them -- I sat in a meeting with her once and was in awe of her strength, beauty, and articulateness -- but there's a whole other plebeian trans population out there -- people who aren't young, glamorous, or traditionally feminine. Jenner is no plebeian, I realize, but he's still different than many of the images involved in the trans discussion today, and for that I am grateful. So he, or at least the conversation surrounding him, is ""good for the trans.""It's great for them, really. Kim Kardashian alone has over 31 million followers on Twitter and 30 million on Instagram. This will amplify the conversation and expand awareness exponentially. Regardless of what Rachlin thinks the movement needs, the parade around Jenner puts the discussion directly in the faces of people who otherwise would not be involved.It's time we widen our scope and take a look at all the faces in a community. As much as we try to, we cannot curate humanity."
20,BUSINESS,7 Reasons Why Starting a Business Can Be Better for You Than Therapy,"Jenev Caddell, ContributorPsychologist, Author and Secret Weapon to Artists & Creative E...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/7-reasons-why-starting-a-_b_7121252.html,"At the end of the day, if you wish to be successful, you have no choice but to make peace with yourself, learn a thing or two, and move on, continually growing and embracing the process.",2015-04-24,Jenev Caddell - Psychologist | Author | Couples Therapist | Integrative Coach,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5901f8b42600001500c48037.jpg?ops=100_100,"Let me start this post by being clear that I am not slamming therapy. I have been practicing therapy for over a decade and know that it is a game changer for so many people. This process otherwise known as ""the talking cure"" has saved countless lives, of that I am sure.If you want therapy on steroids, try starting a business.Starting a business will bring up demons that you didn't even know you had. It can rock your personal life and cause you to examine and shift your relationships. It will cause you to get really clear on your priorities and what matters to you. It will force you to look at yourself in ways that the sacred space within the four walls of your therapist's office might not ever demand of you.And it will cause you to stretch in grow in ways you never saw coming.Some background:I'm a clinical psychologist by training, turned relationship coach for entrepreneurs. For graduate school, I had to see my own therapist. Honestly, I wasn't in a place where therapy was at the top of my list of things I wanted to do, but it was part of my training.I wrote that check (this was before you could put your therapy on a card) every week for $70 which was my shrink's reduced rate and a ton of money to me. I was barely making ends meet as a graduate student working at a $9/hour job at a coffee shop, accruing debt that I continue to pay off today.Did I learn anything about myself? Not much.Did I learn anything about therapy? Nothing significant that I didn't already know from my studies, my clinical training and work, and from having watched videos of the masters.I do think it's important for graduate students to get that kind of preparation, but to be honest, therapy didn't do much for me other than check off that box.Breaking out into the saturated market of coaching where I have had had to work harder to build a business than when I had a more formally recognized professional practice as a psychologist has been more of a wild ride of self-growth than the ""talking cure"" could have offered me.Here are 7 reasons why starting a business can be better for you than therapy:1. Business will help you truly know yourself.You can talk at your therapist all day long and get an understanding of who you are, but in the safety of a private relationship, there can still be room to hide from yourself.You will be the most successful in business when you discover who you are inside and out. You need to know how you come across to others, what makes you tick, where your areas of strength are and what you need help with. You need to know what lights you up so that you can go after it and share your passion with the world.Business gives you no other choice.2. Business will command that you trust yourself and believe in yourself.A good therapist will help you develop self trust and belief in yourself.A successful business, however, will command your self-trust and belief in yourself.You need to develop and use your intuition as you make big decisions and really put your skin in the game. You have to learn to stop listening to all of the noise around you and start trusting yourself. And you have to believe in yourself to stay the course. You need to be able to stand behind your message in the face of doubt from others around you, and more importantly, you need to eradicate whatever self-doubt you have.You are in business to be a leader and an innovator. You simply can't do this without belief in yourself. You can borrow your therapist's belief in you and use therapy as a vehicle to finally believe in yourself, but in business you have to live it.There is no alternate route.3. Business will challenge your relationships.Therapy undoubtedly heals broken relationships and can help you recognize which other relationships are no longer serving you.Business, however, will be a catalyst to rattle your closest relationships, even the ones that seemed like they were moving along just fine. As a result of your growth as a person in business, you will create strengthened relationships with some people, but you might separate from others. You will need to learn how to take care of this third party in your life without neglecting the closest ones around you.Caution: You might learn this the hard way.Business will be a stress in your life that forces you to really evaluate your relationships and improve the ones that are worth hanging onto, however difficult that might be.4. Business will make you express yourself and be vulnerable in front of strangers.If you have a good therapist, you have a safe place where you can express some of your deepest stuff. Being heard, seen and accepted by another human when you are at your most vulnerable can be one of the most healing experiences possible. Even with the safety of an excellent and supportive therapist, this kind of self expression can be extraordinarily difficult if you have experienced interpersonal trauma and have learned to rely only on yourself. When can finally fully reveal yourself to someone and still be accepted, the experience can be magical.In business, however, the perceived safety is stripped away and the experience becomes your self-expression to the world. Even for someone who with no problems trusting a few precious others, truly showing up in the world and revealing yourself through self-expression can bring up all kinds of inner gremlins.The more you show up and the better you can do it, the more successful you are.5. Business will cause you to grow in ways you never imagined.You can go through the motions in therapy and keep showing up week after week, feeling better and better about yourself, and if you're courageous and have a good shrink, you will do a whole lot of growing.In business, you have no choice but to stretch outside of your comfort zones and grow in ways you never anticipated. Whether it's showing up for your audience in a new way, learning technical skills that make you want to push your head through a wall, or finally letting go and giving up some control, business will demand you to stretch yourself and grow.6. Business might even get you back in touch with your spiritual side.Most therapists don't have room for God on their couches.But when you start a business, at some point you may start to panic. You have invested blood, sweat, money and tears into your business and maybe you start to question WTF you are even doing. You might just have a come to Jesus moment and try to call in a Higher Power.You start looking for signs from the Universe that you're on the right path. You start talking to psychics. You try to quiet your overused left analytic brain and start tapping into your intuition. You might even try to communicate with your Guides. You learn about energy, vibrations, and you aim to keep yours high, all while trying not to fall into the black hole of fear that can be part of your every day.And you know that the most successful people in the world meditate, so you do too.The result? You become much more spiritual in the process.Perhaps the most important lesson of all:7. To be most successful in business, you will need to embrace forgiveness.You are going to have haters, people who don't believe in you, people who make false promises, people who misrepresent you, people who try to get in the way of your success, and people who steal from you.You can learn from your experiences, but there is no room in business to ruminate on those experiences (for very long) if you wish to be successful. The solution? Forgiveness.More importantly, you will need to learn to forgive yourself. You're going to make stupid decisions. You're going to screw up lots. You will embarrass yourself. And you're going to make some really bad investments.The name of the game is persistence and tenacity, and this requires a hefty dose of compassion for yourself as you make bad moves left, right and center.At the end of the day, if you wish to be successful, you have no choice but to make peace with yourself, learn a thing or two, and move on, continually growing and embracing the process.Isn't that what therapy is all about?"
21,WORLDPOST,The Armenian Genocide and the Burden of Shame,"Heidi Boghosian, ContributorNew York City Attorney",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-armenian-genocide-and_b_7131564.html,"While many around the world hoped that President Obama would acknowledge the Armenian genocide by its 100th anniversary, it will be still be a victory if global awareness increases. Formal acknowledgement should follow after the shame is shared.",2015-04-24,2015-04-23-1429828040-9656868-BaidzarBoghosian.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-23-1429828040-9656868-BaidzarBoghosian-thumb.jpg,"A part of me cringed each time I uttered my last name in grade school. For just as soon as I said it, I was asked: ""What kind of name is that?"" Blank stares and silence usually followed when I said Armenian. I felt embarrassed by who I was because I couldn't explain it to my classmates. All I knew was that something unspeakable, something secret, had happened to the Armenian people. The only public reference I had was friends' parents cautioning fussy eaters to ""remember the starving Armenians.""Every week I overheard my father speaking Armenian on the phone with his sister Hasmig and mother Baidzar, the sounds of hard Ks, Vs and Zs, punctuating their incomprehensible conversation. Over time some of the words became familiar to me but the fact that I couldn't understand their language underscored how little I knew of my family history. Kept in the dark, how could I embrace my heritage?In the 1970s my father would proudly point out the occasional famous Armenian in popular culture--the actor Mike Connors (born Krekor Ohanian) of the television show Mannix, or Cher (born Cherilyn Sarkisian). He told me that there weren't many Armenians left in the world, alluding vaguely to the 1915 massacre of the Armenians by the Ottoman Turks. It was my mother, who was Irish, who explained--when we were alone--that as a teenager my grandmother had seen her family slaughtered on the steps of a church. She was taken as a slave into a Turkish household where for she served the woman of the household by day, then was forced to service the male by night. After three years, my grandmother and another Armenian girl from a few doors down were able to escape in the middle of the night. They ultimately made their way to an orphanage in Corinth. My grandfather Mesrop, who had fled to the United States during the genocide, paid for her passage from Greece. They married and moved to New Britain, Connecticut to work in the hardware factories.I was slow to learn about Armenian culture, one of the oldest settled societies in the world. Nonetheless, living with an Armenian father, I grew to understand key elements of that culture: tradition, modesty, personal reserve and propriety about the way certain things are done. Those traits help inform the reluctance of some Armenians to talk about the genocide, especially the details of how girls like my grandmother were abused.Armenians lived in the Caucasus region of Eurasia for approximately 3,000 years. Theirs was the first nation to adopt Christianity as its official religion in 301 AD. In the 15th century, part of Armenia was absorbed into the Ottoman Turkish Empire, ruled by Muslims. There, Armenians were viewed as Christian ""infidels,"" and treated unequally and unjustly. As the Ottoman Empire crumbled in the late 1800s, Turkish leaders were angered by Armenian efforts to secure civil rights. A state sanctioned program to suppress Armenian civil rights brought protests by Armenians and then massacres by Turkish officials. When the post-Ottoman Young Turks assumed power, their ""Turkification"" campaign deemed Christian non-Turks a threat to the new state. Turkish leaders sought to create a Pan-Turkic and Pan-Islamic empire consisting of Turkish-speaking Muslim regions in the Caucasus and Central Asia. On April 24, 1915, the Armenian genocide began with the Turkish government's arrest and execution of several hundred Armenian intellectuals, clergy, artists, poets, and others. Armenians were sent on death marches, often stripped naked, through the Mesopotamian desert without food or water, until they dropped dead. ""Butcher battalions""--violent criminals released from prison specifically for this purpose--carried out drownings, crucifixions, bayoneting, live burnings, and throwing off cliffs. By 1923, fewer than 100,000 Armenians remained in the Ottoman Empire.Many Armenian women genocide survivors were raped or forced into harems. Later, they were ashamed to talk about what they had experienced. The Turkish nationalist party's multi-pronged plan to render Armenians extinct included taking attractive Armenian brides and virgins into Turkish harems where many gave birth to children fathered by their masters. In Armenian Golgotha, Grigoris Balakian--an intellectual who was arrested in the earliest phase of the genocide--wrote: ""The young brides and virgins were yanked from the embrace of their crying mothers and taken to Turkish harems; even ten-year-old girls were subjected to all manner of savage, unbearable Turkish debauchery.""These practices, and other unconscionable acts, help explain why parents often spoke in Turkish or Assyrian instead of English or Armenian when discussing the crimes they experienced. They did not want their children to understand. Children of survivors describe the topic as secret or forbidden. Such absence of talk, and mystery about the genocide, contributed to perpetuating a sense of shame. Observers to the worst crimes of humanity--some burned alive, others poisoned by Turkish physicians and pharmacists or drowned, starved to death, or left to perish from disease--how could surviving witnesses not be haunted for the rest of their lives? On the centennial of the genocide, to help dispel the shame that some Armenians feel, it is time to talk openly about the genocide. This chapter in history--secreted away for a century--does not belong just to Turks and Armenians. It belongs in the moral consciences of all citizens of the world.The talking so necessary to help dispel the shame has started. On April 12, 2015 Pope Francis reaffirmed the Vatican's past position that Turkey committed the first genocide of the 20th century. In words that angered Turkey enough to recall its ambassador to the Holy See, the Pope said: ""It seems that the human family has refused to learn from its mistakes caused by the law of terror, so that today, too, there are those who attempt to eliminate others with the help of a few, and with the complicit silence of others who simply stand by.""While many around the world hoped that President Obama would acknowledge the Armenian genocide by its 100th anniversary, it will be still be a victory if global awareness increases. Formal acknowledgement should follow after the shame is shared."

I don't know what it's like in the rest of the country, but here in New York City, women (especially of the executive class) are demanding that guys get in shape -- I mean real true flat belly, rippling arms, kick ass form -- as they should. After all, guys, the women are out there each and every day busting their asses, literally, swimming, biking, running, yoga-ing, pilates-ing, barre-ing, boxing, Crossfit-ing, and lifting their way to a bikini body for summer. And what are we doing, generally? Sitting on our fat asses. Well, in the interest, and fairness of sex equality, us guys are finally being held, more and more, to the same Body Beautiful standards as women are. And guess what fellas? It's about time.I have been on my own belly buster quest since March 16th. I've given up meat, dairy, and most important of all, alcohol, for 60 days. I have committed to working out five times a week. Granted, that is a bit excessive for most of us, but for me, it works. I have more energy, I sleep better, and so far, I've lost 15 pounds. Oh, and I am getting a lot more female friend requests on Facebook, lately. Just sayin'.The best reason to get rid of your tire, dude, is your health. ""A big waistline puts you at increased risk for many health problems -- diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and stroke,"" according to Robert Eckel, MD, president of the American Heart Association in a Web MD article. As we get older, our metabolism slows down, and quite honestly, it becomes harder and harder to motivate to get out and work out, especially when you are, like me, in your 50s. The big exception to this rule is when you are single, and dating, and want to be with a woman who is in amazing shape, has an incredible intellect, and is full-on fun and full of wonderful energy and light. To be with someone like that, the treadmill is your true path to happiness. For us Baby Boomers, we have entered a period of time in our lives that I like to call The Third Third, which I wrote about in an article for Livinghealthy.com :""The Third Third, just to be clear, is the last third of our lives, and arguably the most important third of all. It's when we truly get the chance to live the lives we've always wanted to live. The First Third is all about Growing Up (from birth to college), the Second Third is all about Growing Out (career, marriage, family), so the Third Third is all about Growing In (wisdom, spirituality, being, Inner Self Happiness)."" Growing In, guys, means ""pulling in"" that gut of yours. Enough with the John Goodman look. You can do better than that. So this weekend, set down that can of beer, and get your ass off that couch and go for a run, lard ass. She'll love you for it. And you will be forever changed, for the better. And if you're in the dating game, when you look over at your significant other at the local pool, lake or beach, she will be sporting a bikini, not a one piece. Just sayin.'Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

It's amazing the difference six months makes in one so young. Last year I had to help her with everything and this year she wants to do things on her own. In the two weeks since the snow has melted and we've been able to use the play set, she's mastered the ladder steps. After the first couple of trips up, I realized I could step back, remove my hand from her back, even be across the yard, and she could make it to the top on her own.The slide has been another story. She sits down and inches herself to the edge, but her hands grip the sides and she stares nervously at the wood chips below. It must look quite steep and forbidding from her vantage point up there.I wait to see how she'll proceed and every time it's been the same. ""Mummy!"" A look at me that says, ""Help! I can't do this alone.""""Do you want me to hold your hand?"" I ask. A nod and little fingers spread wide as they reach for me. At first my grasp helps slow her down, makes the ride less scary, more manageable. But after several days of this I know she's nearly ready.She waits longer before calling for me. I can almost see her working up her nerve. Her little bottom starts to slide forward, but she quickly changes her mind and pulls herself back to her starting position. ""Mummy!""I take her hand, but this time I offer no resistance. She flies down, fingers gripped tightly to mine, and lands with a bump in the wood chips. She jumps up and smiles big. ""You can do this, you know,"" I tell her. ""You don't need my hand.""She climbs back up, gets into position. She looks nervous and excited, uncertain and eager. Exactly the way I'm feeling. Slowly her bottom half slides forward until -- finally -- she lets go.I stand to the side and watch her, at once proud and sad. She is growing up. Learning that letting go can be scary and exciting, but most of all, necessary.

My Barbie had a career. Sure, she dated Ken, but it wasn't like she was going to leave her job to marry him. (My friend Brandy's Barbie was always having babies and then Brandy did at 16.)I had a fairly elaborate imaginative position in our neighborhood. I pretended to be Madge from the Palmolive commercials. I listened to the woes of the ladies on our block while they soaked their nails in a knock-off brand of green dish soap. It's disturbing what a grown-up will tell a child impersonating a TV personality confidante.I put an ad in our local paper at 15 offering to do ""odd jobs."" Along with real employment, I got several ""odd job"" offers. (Think teenage girls and Facebook for the 1980's.)After graduate school, my jobs were all-consuming. I changed careers each time seeking greater fulfillment. Work defined me. I used to say things like: I'll never be a stay-at-home-mom; I can't learn how to cook; I will never home school; I can't start my own business. In the last eight months, I have learned how to do all of these.You would think after I said I would never marry a younger man or go blonde I would have learned my lesson. My husband, 14 years my junior, would actually be fine if I embraced my mostly gray hair.Last September, through a series of unwelcomed and unplanned for events regarding our then 7-year-old son's schooling, I stopped working and started home schooling. Technically, I suppose we are what I have come to learn is a unschooling/home schooling family. We use curriculum and child-directed activities.How had I never seen the acronym SAHM? The first time I saw it was in a email from a friend to me. I had no idea. I guessed it had to do with a sale at H&M.Like any job I've had, I did copious research in preparation. I would tackle this situation logically. But 7-year-old's are not logical. They don't give one whit that you have given up your identity or that you are sacrificing yourself for their well-being. So, don't point that out to them. It's the equivalent of blood in the water for sharks.At its most stereotypical, the home schooling community here is made up of Christians and hippies. I'm neither. Not surprisingly, the Christians are a little more organized. Or at least the one I met was. She made the mistake of giving me her email.Dear Mary,It is day five of refusing and arguing and I hit a wall. I want this to work. And I want to send him to military school today. That is sort of a joke.This is unsustainable. I am hoping I am not the worst homes schooling mother ever. I have cried more this week than maybe my entire life.Dear Kari,I would suggest that you give me a call, so that we can talk this through. It could be a number of things. I would be happy to help!So I called. Her first question to me on the phone was, ""What do you think the problem is?""The fact we were not friends or family made it easier to say, ""I think it's me.""""Oh good! This is going to be much less difficult to figure out."" ""Mary, I have never been at home all day with our son. What do you do for nine hours?""""Oh, my. That's quite a change, ""Well, how about some cooking?""""Yeah, I don't know how to cook.""[Audible gasp, but quick recovery.]""You have made it successfully to this point in your life not cooking, but your son should learn how to cook.""""Oh, God! Sorry about that, Mary! You're right! OK, sure, I bet I could do that.""And I did. Recipes are logical and they don't argue with you. Cooking takes time. The process slows things down. We bought aprons and a lot of things I had never known existed. We cooked. There was a reprieve from the battle.My husband was overjoyed at my new ability. He started wooing me like a besotted lover. While very Ira Levin, I decided to take it as a win-win. I needed the positive attention.Day-by-day life with my son and I is less butting heads and becoming more like the best, zaniest road trip buddy film ever sprinkled with days where I wonder if I am suffering from Stockholm syndrome.It has been a great school year.The down-size is a SAHM who home schools doesn't get paid. Hence the need for me to also work. First, I was resentful. Wasn't, I, The Great Sacrificing Mother, doing enough? Funny, how no one appreciates a martyr.The reality is I have always wanted to work for myself, but lacked the belief I could. The beauty here was the decision was made for me. When your available time are little blocks that cannot always be predicted you can only work for yourself. I am now a development consultant for small businesses. I love it and my clients. I also get a daily dose of adult contact that isn't about parenting.This year, I have finally learned not to say to the Universe: ""I will never insert-declarative-statement-here.""Instead I say: ""Thank you for letting me learn so many things I love doing in such a short time, Universe.""Some parts of this post were originally published on the author's blog: a typical son.

But there's something to be said for this meditative DIY craft. While Blake Lively took some time off after becoming a new mom, she found inner peace in knitting. Can you imagine being in her knitting circle?Companies like Wool and the Gang have reclaimed ""knitting"" as a fun and accessible activity. They create the opportunity to make warm and stylish garments for you and your loved ones. The benefits to knitting are endless; here are just seven reasons to pick up a pair of needles and try it for yourself.1. It Gives You A Sense Of Satisfaction There's an amazing sensation of satisfaction when you're creating something with your own two hands: from a ball of yarn and two needles you have created a wearable (hopefully) garment that will last you forever. Wear it with pride.2. It Can Make A Great DIY Gift There's a reason Etsy exists -- people love handmade items. Look no further for the perfect holiday or year-round gift; something made with love in every stitch is always a winner at the gift exchange.3. It Reduces Stress and Combats Depression As a pastime, the repetitive action of knitting is very relaxing. According to an article from CNN, the act of knitting (or crafting in general) has ""effects similar to meditation,"" which can ""reduce stress and fight inflammation."" Meditation can act as an antidepressant, and the ""motions of knitting activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which quiets that ""fight or flight"" response.4. It Saves You Money  Why spend hundreds of dollars on designer scarves and hats when you could make something of equally high quality on your own? Depending on the yarn you purchase (okay, fine, alpaca blends end up quite expensive), knitting your own accessories can save you lots of money. And let's be honest, you'll be a lot more careful about misplacing them!5. It Keeps You Busy While You Watch TV  Ever get the urge to eat as you're watching TV? Knitting gives you something to do with your hands that's not too attention consuming and that will actually feel enormously productive. With a little practice you'll be able to create a scarf in, like, three episodes!6. It Never Gets Boring There are endless patterns to try -- as soon as you master one pattern, you can always pick up another. From sweaters to mittens to socks, a world of warmth awaits. You can even knit tank tops or bathing suits if you're feeling wild!7. It's Social  The idea of ""stitch n' bitch"" is actually amazing. My college friends and I meet once a week to knit together and catch up. It's an amazing opportunity for a low-key hangout, and you can inspire each other with your projects.Whether you're already a knitter or if you're inspired to get started, check out your local craft store to pick up some yarn and needles.

The new store operated by Asrapport Dining Co. is the first store to be opened in Japan in 20 years. The Mexican-themed fast food chain entered the Japanese market in the 1980's but pulled out due to poor sales, operating stores only on restricted U.S military bases.

Hundreds of people lined up at the entrance of the restaurant, in Tokyo's hip Shibuya neighborhood, before the opening. Some of them reportedly got there the night before to be among the first to order. Taco Bell first opened restaurants in Japan in the 1980s, but then-owner PepsiCo closed all the locations after just a few years because sales were lower than expected, Reuters reports. Yum! Brands, the current owner of Taco Bell, has high hopes the chain will find more enduring success this time around. Though the company now derives the majority of its sales from locations outside North America, with KFC and Pizza Hut in China alone bringing in almost $7 billion of the company's $13.3 billion in revenues last year, Taco Bell remains a mostly American business. The Tokyo outpost of the chain is now just one of 26 locations outside North America. Even Canada only has 29 Taco Bells. But the huge crowds of people that greeted this Japanese store could be a sign that customers outside the United States are ready for Taco Bell.

The annual Dreamforce conference runs through October 16. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31fdb200000e800002093.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Equal pay for equal work isn’t typically a mantra you hear from the chief executive of a multibillion-dollar company. Yet Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is taking the radical step of reviewing employee salaries to ensure men and women are paid fairly.Benioff told The Huffington Post that he is methodically examining the pay of all 16,000 employees at his cloud-based software company to ensure pay equality. So far, Benioff said, he’s given some women raises. “I expect to be giving a lot more,” he said. He anticipates that the process will take a couple of years.""My job is to make sure that women are treated 100 percent equally at Salesforce in pay, opportunity and advancement,"" he said. Though he doesn't know what the pay gap between men and women is at Salesforce right now, ""when I’m done there will be no gap.""A lot of companies talk about what they’re doing for women, but few address the pay imbalance between the sexes so directly or comprehensively. Open conversation about salary is actively frowned upon in most workplaces. Keeping workers in the dark allows for wide differences in pay. “Pay is the third rail,” Benioff said. Nationwide, there’s a stubborn gulf between what men and women earn. In 2013, a woman working full time earned about 77 percent of what a man earned, according to census data. The wage gap persists for even the most elite workers. Ten years after finishing Harvard Business School, male graduates earn above $400,000 a year while female graduates stay at around $250,000, according to data from the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, cited by The New York Times in 2013. Economists give a mix of reasons for the difference -- women may gravitate to lower-paying industries or trade pay for flexible hours. Sex discrimination also plays a role. And crucially, women may not negotiate for higher wages. If a worker doesn't negotiate for higher pay in her first job, low wages could dog her for a lifetime.The interim CEO of Reddit, Ellen Pao, recently made headlines for trying to fix the pay gap at her company by banning negotiation during the hiring and recruiting process. “If you want more equity, we’ll let you swap a little bit of your cash salary for equity, but we aren’t going to reward people who are better negotiators with more compensation,” she told the Wall Street Journal. (Pao also was in the news for losing her sex discrimination lawsuit against Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.) It’s not clear if Pao’s method will be effective. The competition for talent in tech is so fierce right now, as New York Magazine's Daily Intel points out, it seems difficult to imagine that the best candidates will be OK not being able to negotiate their price. Others, including Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and comedian Sarah Silverman, are beating the drum for women to become better negotiators. “Sandberg has done a great job encouraging women,” Benioff said, referring to her now-classic corporate feminist tome Lean In and her outspoken advocacy for women in the workforce. Sandberg has encouraged women to push themselves forward and take a seat at the table.But women can’t do this alone, said Benioff. There are also things a company can do.Salesforce’s pay initiative is part of a wider company program called Women’s Surge, which Benioff put in place in 2013 after he began to wake up to the fact that there weren't enough women at his 16-year-old company. Benioff would look around at meetings that were made up of mostly men and think, ""This isn't right,"" he said. Overall, women made up just 29 percent of employees at Salesforce as of June 2014, according to company data. As part of the Women’s Surge initiative, Benioff is trying to make sure that women make up at least 30 percent of the attendees at any meeting, from large-scale management meetings with 500 to 1,000 attendees to product reviews with just 10 to 20 executives.Salesforce also deliberately ensures women are well-represented at its conferences, including its annual Dreamforce event -- a major tech industry confab. The company also has a women’s group called FemmeForce that does mentoring, nonprofit work and more. Benioff mentioned that he recently replaced a male speaker with a promising woman executive at a conference. He knew she would be a better speaker and typically wouldn’t get the opportunity due to her lack of seniority.When it comes to hiring and promotion, Salesforce has also made women a priority. “Not a single one of my execs hires or promotes without evaluating every woman candidate,” he said. Benioff said the practice has led to more promotions for women -- and more women hires in recent years.Still, his company has a ways to go. As of June 2014, men made up 85 percent of the leadership team at Salesforce.Given the overall dearth of women in the tech sector as a whole, however, women at Salesforce say the company is a sharp contrast to previous jobs. “I’ve worked with more women at Salesforce than I’ve worked with in my entire career,” Chief Marketing Officer Lynn Vojvodich told HuffPost.Like most women in tech, Vojvodich has spent her career surrounded by men. Before joining Salesforce in 2013, she held a coveted partnership at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Early on, she worked as an engineer in the construction industry, donning a hard hat and safety glasses. “I was the only woman in a room with 50, 60 people.” she said.Things are changing.The Gender Pay Gap, State by State "

Today, It's Still Not A 'Genocide.'",Sophia Jones,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/armenian-genocide-controversy_n_7121008.html,,2015-04-23,"FILE - This is the scene in Turkey in 1915 when Armenians were marched long distances and said to have been massacred. The U.S. House of Representatives may vote next week on a measure that could damage U.S. relations with critical ally Turkey: a resolution declaring the World War I-era killings of Armenians a genocide. House aides, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment, said Friday Dec. 17, 2010 that Democratic leaders have been discussing a possible vote with lawmakers. (AP Photo, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14a27240000320024fc72.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ISTANBUL -- On April 24, 1915, Ottoman Turkish authorities hauled off Daniel Varoujan, a leading Armenian poet of the time, along with over 200 other intellectuals in the capital Constantinople. To the crumbling Ottoman Empire, the poets, painters, writers, booksellers and politicians at the beating heart of the Armenian community posed too much of a threat. Soon, much of the empire’s Christian Armenian population would be targeted and nearly wiped out, accused of conspiring against the empire with the Russians. Many Armenians say the genocide was collective punishment for the actions of a few. In August, after a wave of deportations began that would force hundreds of thousands of Armenians on brutal death marches toward the Syrian desert, Varoujan was tortured to death, according to eyewitnesses at the time. Varoujan was just one of many men, women and children who lost their lives.This week, Armenians from around the world are gathering in Istanbul to commemorate the deaths of nearly 1.5 million Armenians who died in what would later be known by many -- but not by Turkey, the United States and some other countries -- as the Armenian Genocide. A century on, the killings are hardly a thing of the past, with sensitive geopolitics still fueling the controversy. Regardless of how it's labeled, here are some figures that explain the size and scope of this tragedy:The number of Armenians believed to have been killed between 1915 and 1917. “Rape and beating were commonplace,” wrote acclaimed historian David Fromkin in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book on the Ottoman Empire’s downfall, A Peace to End All Peace. “Those who were not killed at once were driven through mountains and deserts without food, drink or shelter. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians eventually succumbed or were killed.""An Armenian man in Istanbul, who as a schoolboy discovered his family was Armenian, told The WorldPost one story passed down to him by his parents: His grandfather, too exhausted to walk any farther in the death march toward the Syrian desert, refused to go on. He would rather drown than walk another mile to his death, he told the Turkish Ottoman guards. And so, the man says, they held his grandfather under the water until he was dead.The number of intellectuals reportedly rounded up by Ottoman Turks on April 24, 1915, in Constantinople (now Istanbul), kicking off what would become a massive wave of arrests, deportations and killings. Many of these Armenians were later deported and in many cases killed. Armenians commemorate the anniversary of the Armenian Genocide every year on April 24. “They took the intellectuals, the cream of the crop,” one Armenian book publisher who said his father, a baker, lived in Constantinople when the arrests took place, recently told The WorldPost. “They took the head and left the body.”The number of dead bodies reportedly found in 1916 in a mass grave in Maskanah,  a northern town in what is now modern day Syria, according to Jesse B. Jackson, U.S. consul in Aleppo. ""As far as the eye can reach mounds are seen containing 200 to 300 corpses buried in the ground,"" he said in a cable to Washington. The number of Armenians who died during this period due to war and disease, according to Turkey, which vehemently denies the 1.5 million figure. “According to independent researchers, 300,000 Armenians lost their lives because of the war and disease,” reads one Turkish state-provided textbook for high school students. “But during that time, Armenians killed 600,000 Turks and forced 500,000 Turks to leave their land.”The number of Armenians living in the Ottoman empire before 1914, according to the University of Minnesota’s Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies. The number of Armenians still left in the Ottoman Empire in 1922. The number of nations that officially recognize the Armenian Genocide. The list does not include the United States, Israel and many others who on the centenary are grappling with labeling the killings a genocide. Germany is expected to finally do so on the anniversary.The Armenian Genocide still remains one of the most bitterly contested events in history, especially for Turkey, fiercely defensive of its Ottoman past. If President Obama decided to label the 1915 killings as genocide, already strained relations would likely only worsen with Turkey, where the United States has an important air base in the south, close to Syria. Turkey and the U.S. government have butted heads over the Syrian crisis, with a U.S.-led coalition targeting solely Islamic State extremists, while Turkey insists military efforts must also focus on bringing down Syria's Bashar Assad. The United States has said Turkey, hosting over 1.7 million desperate Syrian refugees, has failed to do enough to counter extremists who often cross its border into Syria with ease. The White House doesn’t want to use the fateful “g” word because it would anger the wrong people.That’s essentially what officials said Tuesday when faced with increasing pressure to label the mass killings a genocide.Citing “regional priorities” in its decision not to say the killings amounted to genocide, the U.S. government insisted it would urge “a full, frank, and just acknowledgment of the facts,” according to a White House statement. The decision angered many Armenians in the United States and abroad who say they had hoped President Barack Obama would use the centennial as an opportunity to put things right, considering his track record of acknowledging the genocide prior to assuming the presidency. There is real concern in Turkey that legal ramifications of calling the 1915 massacres a ""genocide"" could lead to costly reparations.In a recent column in the Daily Sabah, a Turkish newspaper known for its staunchly pro-government rhetoric, one columnist wrote that the genocide claimed by Armenians is just a ruse by the Armenian diaspora and descendants in Turkey to tear apart the country and take over Turkish territory.While Turkey in recent years has taken more conciliatory steps towards addressing the killings of Armenians, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan making what was considered to be a groundbreaking speech last year in which he offered condolences to the descendants of those killed, tempers have recently flared. With the lead-up to the 100-year anniversary, Turkey has furiously defended itself from genocide claims, lashing out at the Pope and the European Parliament for their views on what is widely seen as a systematic slaughter. ""Concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it,"" Pope Francis said earlier this month after calling the killings the first genocide of the 20th century. Ankara then recalled its ambassador from the Vatican.Turkey's Erdogan dismissed the genocide debate, just as the European Parliament voted on April 15 to call the events of 1915 a genocide. On Wednesday, Turkey said it was pulling its ambassador to Austria over the debate. While Turkey acknowledges that some Armenians died -- calling them casualties of war, disease and chaos of the time -- the state says that since the deaths were not methodically planned to wipe out Armenians, it does not add up to genocide. ""It is out of the question for there to be a stain, a shadow called 'genocide,' on Turkey,"" Erdogan said last week.""Nick Wing in Washington, D.C., and Burak Sayin in Istanbul contributed reporting. This story has been updated to clarify that while Germany does not currently call the Armenian massacres a genocide, it is expected to do so soon.More from the WorldPost on the Armenian genocide:"
29,WORLDPOST,Why Well-Being Is a Skill That Can Be Learned,"Richard J. Davidson, Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/well-being-skill-learned_b_7102636.html,"We need to shift our thinking about well-being from a static ""thing"" to a set of skills that can be learned and cultivated over time -- a notion supported by a growing body of scientific evidence I've outlined as an author of this year's World Happiness Report.",2015-04-23,in making this photo no grain has been trampled down... ;),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc149f22400003200382b35.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""I kept doing the body scan to feel calm,"" a fifth grade student explained to my colleagues as he recollected coping with a stressful situation at home. A ""body scan"" involves checking in with your body and noticing how it feels in the present moment. There's no action required other than observing experiences as they unfold.As a neuroscientist applying the insights of my center's research to the real world, including in classrooms, I hear similar stories from people of all ages expressing a desire to calm their minds, to take baby steps to reduce negative emotions, improve well-being and respond with resilience to factors outside of our control. In this case, a student took a practice he learned in school, saw the value in it, and called on it as a coping skill during a moment of adversity.This example is one of many that demonstrates the need to shift our thinking about well-being from a static ""thing"" to a set of skills that can be learned and cultivated over time -- a notion supported by a growing body of scientific evidence I've outlined as an author of this year's World Happiness Report, alongside expert authors Jeffrey Sachs, John Helliwell and Richard Layard, who contributed sections on economics and well-being.Suffering -- a key detriment to well-being -- can, in many cases, be out of people's personal control, whether it's the millions who are starving or live in war zones or in places that harm health. ""Exercising our minds should be approached much in the same way we exercise our bodies.""Yet in addition to these forms of suffering, we've found that our thoughts can also be a source of enduring suffering in both the mind and body.If we take a step back and conduct a ""global body scan"" -- simply observing what's there -- we're faced with the reality that mental health and behavioral disorders result in more than 180 million disability-adjusted life years globally per year (one unit equals losing one year of healthy life or living two years with a 50 percent disability). Indeed, we have an uphill battle on our hands, but we're at a point where scientific understanding can produce real change in people's lives. I believe that exercising our minds should be approached much in the same way we exercise our bodies.In the report, Brianna Schuyler and I hone in on our neuroscientific research and that of colleagues around the globe. Although the name of the report focuses on ""happiness,"" we chose to expand the focus to include well-being, because many psychological definitions of happiness suggest a transitory state. For instance, a person can experience sadness as a response to a tragic situation and respond in a context-appropriate way with sadness, but still have high levels of well-being. Similarly, someone can experience moments of happiness, yet still have low levels of well-being. We're offering four key constituents of well-being grounded in neuroscientific research that are not typically included in most scales and measures. Evidence suggests mental training and learning skills in these areas can make a difference in improving well-being and even rewire areas of the brain. 1. Sustaining positive emotion. Our first proposed component of well-being is the ability to sustain positive emotion. Whether it's savoring that last bite of dessert or carrying the enjoyment of an activity with friends or family with you in the hours following, prolonging positive emotion has been shown to improve psychological well-being. In studies examining the brain's response to positive images (for instance, a mother embracing her infant), we found that people with more sustained levels of activity in the ventral striatum, an area linked to positive emotion and reward, report higher levels of psychological well-being and display lower levels of cortisol (a stress hormone that's good in moderation, but problematic in excess). In another study, we discovered that prolonged marital stress was related to a decreased ability to sustain positive emotion in the brain, which we think might create a susceptibility to depression.2. Rebounding from negative emotion. The second component of well-being that we focus on is a person's response to negative emotion. Science in this area suggests resilience, or how quickly a person recovers from adversity, can result in a person experiencing less negative emotion overall and may even have protective properties against mental health disorders. But for some with depression who ""can't shake that feeling"" after a negative experience, areas in their brain related to strong emotion remain active longer after the negative event has ceased. The same has been found in individuals with higher levels of neuroticism.When it comes to building skills in this area, we found people with a greater purpose in life (based on a questionnaire) show increased resilience and greater well-being. If we can find ways to cultivate purpose, we may also promote well-being. There's also promising evidence suggesting certain types of mental training to help cultivate the skill of resilience and facilitate more rapid recovery from negative events. 3. Mindfulness and mind-wandering. As the flurry of media attention to the topic of mindfulness attests, mindfulness-based practices of all types have now entered the mainstream. Data show that when people are really focused on what they're doing, and their minds are not wandering, they actually feel better about themselves. Studies show that mindfulness -- being in the present moment -- can lessen our tendency to want and desire things we don't have. The popularity of mindfulness meditation has resulted in a variety of resources to cultivate and practice the skill on one's own via healthcare programs, online apps and local meditation communities. Arianna Huffington's ""Thrive"" offers much on this topic from a first-hand experience. 4. Caring for others. Prosocial behaviors such as empathy, compassion and gratitude comprise another component of well-being. There's substantial evidence to suggest that engaging in acts of generosity is a very effective strategy to increase well-being. I call it a double positive whammy because, by being generous to others, you benefit them and yourself. Studies, including one from our lab, show that compassion training -- a form of meditation in which one generates positive wishes for another being -- primes a person's ability to empathize with others and to engage in pro-social behavior aimed at decreasing others' suffering. So what does this all mean?We're only just beginning to understand how the mind works and how it shapes the human experience, but there's a growing understanding -- and resources -- to allow us to take control of our minds and of own well-being. Will you take control of yours?"

Nor is it reasonable to hang one's hat on the belief that Iran will moderate its behavior if both its diplomatic and financial isolation is ended.",2015-04-23,2015-04-21-1429645639-3770413-IranBillafpbff7f191ea5dc11a8d1d746270ab7bfc3c1f911e.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-21-1429645639-3770413-IranBillafpbff7f191ea5dc11a8d1d746270ab7bfc3c1f911e-thumb.jpg,"Having already negotiated terms that would leave its nuclear-related infrastructure intact, Iran shifted their focus to securing sanctions relief. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared during a recent televised speech, ""The goal of the negotiations was to remove the sanctions!"" He wasn't referring to a gradual or phased lifting of international economic pressure as President Obama previously suggested; he demanded an ""immediate annulment of all sanctions."" True to past form, the White House seems poised to cave on this issue as well. It is unfortunate because sanctions are America's only insurance policy that Iran will keep up their end of the bargain -- and even then it is dubious insurance at best.The United States' position has been that nuclear-related sanctions will be suspended only after Iran fulfills its nuclear-related obligations. To meet that bar, the six world powers known as the P5+1 have argued that Iran must grant international inspectors access to any possible military sites involved in its nuclear program. Only with a thorough accounting of all Iranian nuclear activities will it be possible to verify their compliance during the term of a deal. Iran, however, has no intention of complying. On Friday, Reuters reported that Iran is continuing to stonewall the International Atomic Energy Agency in coming clean on their past nuclear activities. This, despite the White House claim in 2013 that the interim agreement with Iran would lead to ""increased transparency and intrusive monitoring of its nuclear program."" This behavior from Iran has been the rule, not the exception.One might expect such action would harden the American position in the negotiations but incredibly, it has had the opposite effect. In a Friday press conference, President Obama admitted, ""Our main concern here is making sure that if Iran doesn't abide by its agreement that we don't have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops in order to reinstate sanctions. That's our main concern."" In other words, Mr. Obama is more concerned with internal P5+1 negotiations over sanctions relief than he is with Iran over the terms of the deal or its current actions. As part of the 2013 interim agreement with Iran, Washington provided some sanctions relief in exchange for some very modest restrictions on the expansion of Iran's nuclear program. The uneven trade surrendered key American leverage, implicitly recognized an Iranian right to enrich uranium, and in the process, set Iran's economy on a path to recovery. By playing that card too early, the U.S. now lacks a key bargaining chip to offer as an inducement for more necessary Iranian concessions.The Obama administration originally pledged that the paltry sanctions relief provided for in the first six months would only equal $7 billion but instead it amounted to around $11 billion. The two negotiation extensions provided Iran with a total of $7.8 billion in additional sanctions relief. While that was enough to alter Iran's economic footing, it is nothing compared to the financial windfall Iran is set to receive if more sanctions evaporate. To put it in perspective, removing oil sanctions alone would provide Iran with $1.6 billion a month, or $56 million per day, according to Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh. Yet these numbers do not dissuade the White House. As part of a plan to phase in sanctions relief, the Wall Street Journal reported that Obama plans to start with Iran's frozen oil revenue and will provide between $30 billion and $50 billion just for capturing Iran's signature on the deal. That gift would boost Iran's GDP by 10 percent overnight.Absent a credible military threat, there is no reason to believe that Iran will come clean regarding its nuclear program if Washington surrenders its remaining leverage. Nor is it reasonable to hang one's hat on the belief that Iran will moderate its behavior if both its diplomatic and financial isolation is ended. That is a recipe for increased corrosive Iranian behavior in a region already sliding under the Islamic Republic's boot.Like any clause contemplated in a deal with Iran, removing sanctions should be behavior-based, not an automatic reward for reversible promises. Despite wishful thinking in the White House, once sanctions are lifted they will never ""snap back"" because such mechanisms do not exist. To avoid a colossal perversion of diplomacy, Washington should seek to keep oil-based sanctions in place for as long as possible and only dole out such relief in exchange for Iran's verifiable compliance.Matthew RJ Brodsky is a Senior Middle East Analyst at Wikistrat and former Director of Policy at the Jewish Policy Center in Washington, DC.

By 2010, Gosling was leading the tragic ""Blue Valentine"" and (pseudo-) Robert Durst biopic ""All Good Things"" (with his only real misstep marked by ""Crazy Stupid Love""). For the former, he and co-star Michelle Williams spent the time between their courtship and breakup scenes modeling the life they might have lived in a Pennsylvania house with their movie daughter. Although, that methodological effort is apparently less exciting than the fact that Gosling actually built the kitchen table Noah makes for Allie in ""The Notebook"" (and then dated McAdams in real life for four years).  Gosling's entire ethos is built on an idea of what might have been. ""He's a meta movie star, doing serious work behind a leading-man mask,"" Alex Pappademas wrote for The New York Times around the release of ""The Ides of March"" and ""Drive."" Pappadamas compared Gosling to Clooney, an actor who built a perception of leading-man qualities, then pursued roles out of the mainstream, unaffected by their potential to flop. Yet, Gosling never built the sort of legacy Clooney is supposedly resting on. For a while, he was famous because he seemed like he might be our next Clooney or Cruise. But we have yet to procure that next-generation leading man. Gosling's entire ethos is built on an idea of what might have been. Some of the reviews of the twisted, experimental ""Lost River"" recoil at the fact that such non-traditional thoughts could live inside Gosling's handsome head: ""Is Ryan Gosling's Lost River Crazy Brilliant or Just Plain Crazy?"" Richard Corliss headlined his review for Time. Well, it isn't profitable: so far, ""Lost River"" has grossed $38,964.Gosling does things like interact with the ""Hey, Girl"" meme, seemingly in an attempt to dismantle his persona. Yet, unlike James Franco, whose efforts build upon the mythos, Gosling's attempts to refute his publicized identity seem to hit an impenetrable Noah Calhoun forcefield. At this point, he's not rallying against ""The Notebook,"" but trying to build a new career in its looming shadow. With each feminist quote shared on a hunky Gosling photo, that 10-year-old perception of him grows ever stronger. Despite his efforts to pursue creative efforts like ""Lost River,"" ""The Notebook"" craze isn't over. It still isn't over.Middlebrow is a recap of the week in entertainment, celebrity and television news that provides a comprehensive look at the state of pop culture.

33,GREEN,"A Call to Foundations to Step Up Giving, Act on Climate","Justin Guay, Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-call-to-foundations-to_b_7087958.html,"It's time foundations stepped up their game when it comes to climate.

They delivered their message in The Chronicle of Philanthropy (read the op-ed here) in what amounts to a philanthropic call to arms when it comes to fighting climate change. Put simply, their message is that the challenge we face is too great for philanthropy to be sitting on the sidelines.So what exactly is their point? Well, it's the fact that less than 2 percent of all philanthropic dollars are being spent in the fight against climate change. That's right, 2 percent. That's an appallingly low investment in the greatest battle of our time.Of course, how philanthropy spends its money matters too (as David Roberts explains so well here). It's not just about big checks; it's about small details. That's a big reason I'm bullish on the use of innovative tools like program-related investments to unlock clean-energy access markets for the poor in emerging economies. Because if we get the details right, if we ourselves become more innovative, we can use this increased investment to help accelerate a disruptive, distributed clean-energy future that can radically alter our present course.But the foundation community is simply not investing enough. Not even close. That's why Hewlett and Packard are stepping up and asking others to join them to stave off runaway climate change before it's too late.They made their call now because methane bombs are exploding in parts of Siberia known as ""the end of the world."" Because California is in an epic drought that threatens the very foundation of our water supply. Because climate change refugees are no longer a theoretical future construct but real people looking for new homes, now. Because it's the right thing to do.Now, I'm about as cynical a climate advocate as there is. So I'm not a big fan of scare mongering, because I honestly just tune it out. But it's important to be grounded in reality, one in which we are playing chicken with a future laden with destruction, disease, and displacement. That's the freight train headed our way.But that need not be our future. The truth is that we have more than a fighting chance. In fact, I think the clean-energy revolution is inevitable. Nowhere will you find as resounding a case as BNEF founder Michael Liebreich's recent tour-de-force rundown of clean-energy trends. As his data-driven analysis clearly shows, we are now in a time of disruption, a time when dinosaurs will die, innovators will flourish and the only certainty is dramatic change -- a change that will not be linear, mind you.So for me it's not if but when. But there's the rub. We are in the waning minutes of the fourth quarter. We're still in the game, we're putting points on the board, we're coming back, but we don't have a lot of time. That's why we need to dramatically accelerate that transition. We simply can't wait for market trends alone to deliver us from our fate, let alone expect that.That's why we need bold visionaries willing to take this bull by the horns, people and institutions willing to invest in our future and fight the forces that seek to keep us mired in the past. We need those whose values are rooted in ""tolerance for risk, and a willingness to make big bets on problems worth solving,"" as Larry Kramer and Carol Larson so aptly put it. We need philanthropy to step up.If ever there were a problem worth solving, it's this one. If ever there were a time worth solving it, that time is now. The Hewlett and Packard Foundations are in. They're ready to act on climate. Are you?"
34,FIFTY,Why Women Over 50 Need To Declare Pride In Their Bodies,"Carol Parker Walsh, ContributorAuthor, Speaker, Image Professional",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/curvy-women-_b_7086924.html,"Women in their 50s are in a precarious position of not being old enough to be seniors but too old to be considered youthful.

I love it because it's a bold declaration of my pride in my body and my curves. But that's only a part of me. I'm proud that I'm 50 years young and still here to love and enjoy life. In fact, I should have a shirt that says ""50...Curvy...and Fabulous"" because that's exactly the way I feel. It's also the reason I decided to start blogging. I've reached a weird place in my life where I don't often see myself represented and/or the representations are unfavorable. Women in their 50s are in a precarious position of not being old enough to be seniors but too old to be considered youthful. In many ways we're invisible. We are constantly in search of other faces and role models that represent these ""tweener"" years in a youthful yet sophisticated manner. When you add curviness to the mix, the representation becomes even smaller and less flattering. The intersection of age and curviness is a relatively invisible segment of the fashion industry and blogging community with only a handful of representatives. The curvy community on a whole is very much present and have become social advocates and activists for #bodypositivity, #bodyconfidence, and the #vbo (visible belly outline). The gorgeous Tess Holiday started #effyourbeautystandards and made history when she signed with a mainstream modeling agency as a size 22. On the age front #advancedstyle has moved 60-70+ year old models and fashionistas back into the limelight through representation in documentaries, Ari Seth Cohen's photography and Iris Apfel's feature in Kate Spade ads. I'm inspired by the change and encouraged for the younger generation coming of age and even myself as I move into my second life, or third act as it's sometimes called. However, it's at the intersection of these two places that I still feel a void. What makes this particular segment of the population unique? Perimenopause, menopause, hysterectomies, hot flashes, children entering college, aging parents considering retirement communities, pending retirement, hormones, estrogen patches, gravities perpetual tug on every inch of our bodies, unexplained weight gain, forgetfulness and weaker eye sight just to name a few. And yes, I said just to name a few. For a lot of women at this stage in life all of the above issues take precedent over fashion and style and the clothing selection in stores don't do much to encourage an effort. I'm loving the blogs by those 40+ and 50+ year old women who are reclaiming their sense of fashion and sharing it with the rest of us. I'm adding my images and voice to the mix by including the curvy perspective. Finding a selection of clothing that represents both my age and size in a sophisticated, edgy, fun, and on trend manner remains frustrating. I hope to remove that frustration and present images that will give my sisters some hope, ideas and inspiration. As a social psychologist I'm aware of the importance of positive representation and its impact on the health and well-being of women. It actually aids in identity formation and the development of a positive self-esteem, which guards against things such as high blood pressure, hypertension, and high blood pressure. It's my hope to continue the forward motion of positive and empowering advocacy, particularly (and proudly) at the intersection of age and curviness.Yep, I think I need a t-shirt that says ""50...Curvy...and Fabulous!""

35,FIFTY,Why Being 'Respectable' Is Overrated,"Joe Seldner, ContributorJournalist/Producer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/respectability-overrated_b_7080358.html,"Respectability takes many forms. When you grow up a certain way, it's expected that you'll travel a certain path: serve on boards, go to cocktail parties, attend important conferences, maybe even give a TED talk if you really have made it (after all, what could possibly be more important?) I grew up on that path, but deviated from it, first because of circumstances, then by choice.",2015-04-23,2015-04-16-1429205297-3279679-manstandingalone.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-16-1429205297-3279679-manstandingalone-thumb.jpg,"A while ago, I wrote that while most of my business school colleagues spent years amassing their millions, I was out becoming an expert of dating.This, of course, was an exaggeration -- on both counts. Some of my friends didn't make millions (though plenty did), and I was doing much more than dating, and in fact had many jobs working with many accomplished people in arenas my classmates would consider respectable. (I suspect that if any of my classmates read my dating columns, they would shake their heads at the very idea that I would write about something so lowbrow instead of emerging markets or trends in high tech.)Then, recently I guy I know was named president of a prestigious local non-profit arts organization. He's a nice fellow, well-educated, with modest professional accomplishments. In fact, except that he is younger than I, we come from very similar places.All of this got me to thinking about respectability, specifically, about living or not living a life of conventional respectability, particularly when everyone thinks you should.The key word, I suppose, is conventional. Respectability takes many forms. When you grow up a certain way, it's expected that you'll travel a certain path: serve on boards, go to cocktail parties, attend important conferences, maybe even give a TED talk if you really have made it (after all, what could possibly be more important?). I grew up on that path, but deviated from it, first because of circumstances, then by choice and temperament.I served briefly on a couple of minor boards, but would find myself looking outside during endless meetings and wishing I was out there and not stuck in a room posing as respectable while listening to debates about ""best practices."" Truth be told, I probably should not have gone to business school -- I'm guessing the school would concur -- especially one where the expectation was that you would achieve great things in, well, business. I always felt like an outsider there.So after the pricey schools and the good (or good-sounding jobs), I found myself longing for something different. And something different found me. Divorce led to raising my kids alone which made reevaluating and reinventing myself a necessity rather than a luxury. That path I had been on was no longer within my reach, and honestly, no longer attractive.During what should have been prime earning years (whatever that means) I was scrambling to provide for my kids as best I could. Respectability now was measured by doing whatever was necessary to keep the family whole and as happy as possible.I tell my kids the story of applying for a job driving the cart that picked up golf balls at a local driving range. Our long custody battle had just ended, and my bills had grown from hilly to mountainous. When I interviewed for the job, the guy looked at my resume, then at me, and muttered something not quite flattering.Apparently I was overqualified. But if I had been offered the job, I would have jumped at it. In 10 years, I had gone from country clubs and premieres and the brink of unlimited possibilities to hoping someone would hire me to pick up golf balls. My intellect was still the same. My energy level was if anything, higher than before. I hadn't fallen into substance abuse (had never been that type anyway, but now I couldn't afford it even if I wanted to!) Once I emerged from that particularly bleak period, I found out something revolutionary. Not only was I good at being resourceful and following a different path. I enjoyed it.Wearing suits to work, wishing I could be invited to world economic forums, joining a country club (again, like substance abuse, beyond my financial grasp) held no appeal. Respectability meant something very different at 50 than it had at 30 or 40. I remember dating a woman for several months who had a place in the Hamptons where we would go every weekend to party with the same people over and over. And over. I would endure this, then slip away from the party and walk along the beach. She thought I was being anti-social. Quite the contrary. I love being with interesting people. It's just that these people were having the same conversation every weekend, which always revolved around who they knew. A few years ago, I worked for a guy who obsessed about respectability. He boasted about being able to skip the plebeian security lines at airports and being told by friends that he should run for office. That was all fine. It apparently worked for him.Living a respectable life and living an interesting life are by no means mutually exclusive. I did both for a long time. I don't miss traditional respectability. I would miss interesting. Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter | Earlier on Huff/Post50:"
