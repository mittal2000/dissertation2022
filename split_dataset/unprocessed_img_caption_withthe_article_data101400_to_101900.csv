A memorial service is scheduled Saturday, Oct. 18, 2014, in Foley's hometown of Rochester, N.H., on what would have been his 41st birthday. Foley was abducted in Syria on Thanksgiving Day 2012, and a video by Islamic State militants that purported to show his killing by the militant group was released Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2014. (AP Photo/Steven Senne, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c28c200000300000dd38.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -– The horrific deaths of James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria brought worldwide attention to the dangers journalists face in war zones. The beheadings reflected an alarming trend in 2014 in which international journalists were increasingly targeted and killed. There were at least 60 journalists killed globally in connection to their work in 2014, according to an annual report from the Committee to Protect Journalists, an organization that advocates for press freedom around the world. The latest death was Afghan cameraman Zubair Hatami, who died Saturday from injuries he sustained in a Taliban attack. Committee to Protect Journalists is still investigating whether the deaths of 18 journalists were related to their work. Reporters Without Borders recently cited 66 journalist killings in its 2014 survey. The difference likely results from each organization's methodology and the ongoing investigation of some cases. Syria, mired in civil war since 2011, ranked as the most dangerous country for journalists for the third year in a row. Seventeen journalists were killed in the war-torn country this year, bringing the total to 79 in the conflict. The organization found four journalists and three media workers killed covering the war in Gaza, five journalists in Iraq, and five journalists and two media workers in Ukraine. While this year’s overall toll is down from the 70 killed in 2013, the Committee to Protect Journalists found that international journalists were more frequently targeted this year than in the past. “Reflecting in part the increasingly volatile nature of conflict zones in which Westerners are often deliberately targeted, about one quarter of the journalists killed this year were members of the international press, about double the proportion CPJ has documented in recent years,” the report concluded. “Over time, according to CPJ research, about nine out of every 10 journalists killed are local people covering local stories.”As threats against international correspondents grew in 2014, the organization noted that “the overwhelming majority of journalists under threat for their work continue to be local.”"

Pillaging has threatened tombs in the desert town of Palmyra and Roman temples have been damaged.The report documented widespread damage to cultural heritage sites including UNESCO World Heritage Sites, mostly in the northern city of Aleppo.Both sides in the conflict have used ancient fortresses as military bases. The army has positioned snipers on Aleppo's Citadel, one of the oldest and largest castles in the world.Insurgent forces also overran the 900-year-old Crac des Chevaliers Crusader castle. The army retook it in March but only after months of bombardment.The satellite imagery also found that sites in Raqqa and the millennia-old oasis city of Palmyra have been exposed to major damage. The ancient city of Bosra and abandoned settlements from the Byzantine period in Syria's north have been damaged as well, according to UNITAR.Radical Sunni Muslim insurgents have also destroyed ancient sites which they consider to be heretical.Maamoun Abdulkarim, head of Syria's antiquities and museums, told Reuters last year that tens of thousands of artifacts spanning 10,000 years of history had been removed to specialist warehouses to avoid looting.The United Nations says more than 200,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict, which began in March 2011 with popular protests against Assad and spiraled into civil war after a violent crackdown by security forces.

2,WORLDPOST,Cemetery in the Sea Betrays Europe's Moral Crisis,"Hans Lucht, ContributorAuthor; anthropologist; senior researcher, Danish Institute fo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cemetery-in-the-sea-betra_b_6368422.html,"As the year draws to an end, Europe's commitment to its humanitarian values is haunted by an unprecedented number of refugees drowning in the Mediterranean Sea.",2014-12-23,"In this photo released by the Italian Navy Thursday, March 20, 2014, migrants stand on a dinghy after being rescued along the Mediterranean sea. Italian authorities say they have rescued more than 4,000 would-be migrants at sea over the past four days as the war in Syria and instability in Libya spawn new waves of refugees. The numbers of migrants reaching Italian shores generally rises as warm weather and calm seas make the Mediterranean Sea crossing from North Africa easier. But the U.N. refugee agency says the 2014 numbers represent a 300 percent increase over the same period in 2013. (AP Photo/Italian Navy)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc142db260000350070a5d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last Tuesday, a baby boy was born on an Italian Navy ship in the Mediterranean. The mother, a young Eritrean woman, was among 430 refugees picked up in the Straight of Sicily, as she made the dangerous trip to Europe from Libya. The boy was baptized by the on-board chaplain and with the mother disembarked on the island of Lampedusa. Unfortunately, many boat refugees are not that lucky. Migrant deaths in the Mediterranean are now approaching 3,500 in 2014, new numbers show. In November alone, defying autumn storms, 10,000 people arrived by sea in Italy, adding to the more than 160,000 people who have arrived in the country throughout the year. It's difficult to understand that it's only a year ago that a ""shocked European Union president, José Manuel Barroso, laid roses on the coffins of hundreds of dead Eritreans refugees on Lampedusa and said that he would step up efforts to save people in distress on the sea. ""The E.U. cannot accept that thousands of people die at its borders,"" he said. Yet the effect of fresh images of refugees on the Mediterranean, holding up their babies on the high seas in the hope that at least the children will be shown mercy, has not prompted response - rather, the effect has been numbing. The suffering and death are, to a growing extent, viewed as inevitable and perhaps a necessary evil that Europe has accepted as the warrant of its own continued prosperity. The tragedy on the Mediterranean is becoming the strip tease of European humanism, to paraphrase Jean-Paul Sartre's famous preface to Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth. The strip tease of a special variant of European postcolonial humanism that Sartre called, ""an ideology of lies, a perfect justification for pillage: its honeyed words, its affectation of sensibility were only alibis for our aggressions."" These aggressions are perhaps most clearly echoed in the rhetoric of the English Home Secretary Theresa May, who argued that the U.K. would not support the new FRONTEX Triton rescue operation on the Mediterranean because rescue operations only attract more refugees. Apart from being an unsubstantiated and dangerous narrative, the moral and political message is clear: The natives understand only one thing and that is excessive violence. Let them drown in the sea and before long, the rest of them will understand that Europe shows no mercy. Though startlingly brutal, this position is in fact a quite logical response to the challenge of the ""migration crisis."" It's a reversion to the old colonial narratives that are perhaps not as deeply buried as Europe would like to think.For the migrants, these deadly sea journeys -- though not political acts per se -- are powerful acts of iconoclasm that break with the limitations put on their lives. To them, these journeys give hope in the sense that for all the might and power of Europe and the private security companies, it is still possible to transgress the borders that keep them imprisoned in poverty or conflict. The journeys give hope that it is possible to practice the unthinkable and to one day live in peace and respect despite all the disproportionate obstacles and hurtful discourses.Even our increasing compassion fatigue can't completely eliminate a sense of unease at the thought of dead bodies piling up on our doorstep. Perhaps deep down, we sense that their journeys are justified -- that they have the right to seek their fortune or to escape conflict because we have plundered their continent or brought about the very wars they flee from through misguided military interventions or eroded local lives through alliances with damaging industries. Or simply because we recognize that in order to become the person you have to be, and that you have the right to be, as we keep telling them, you have to reject what others make of you -- whether it is illegal immigrant, terrorist, slave or animal.When Jean-Claude Juncker earlier in the year ran for president of the European Commission, he argued that, as a Christian democrat, he would never ""accept that people drown in the sea trying to reach Europe's shores."" He said he would be ""big on big issues and small on small issues"" -- immigration being one such big issue. His first opportunity to live up to those words has not been promising. When Juncker took over the Italian rescue mission Mare Nostrum, he cut the budget by two thirds and restricted the operation to Italian waters. At the most crucial time, Juncker chose to be small on big issues.Because Europe has abandoned people on the high seas, the rescue of refugees and migrants is now the responsibility of Mediterranean nation states that, like Malta or Libya, are clearly not cable of managing their vast search and rescue zones -- or in the hands of the merchant fleet. But migrant boats are often filled with people who need urgent medical attention, pregnant women or even newborn babies, as in the example from last week. Even if many merchant captains take their responsibility seriously, rescuing up to 200 freezing and traumatized refugees on the high seas is clearly not an appropriate task for an oil tanker or a fishing vessel.As refugees drown by the thousands because they have no safe or legal means of travel, a divided and reluctant Europe has no answer to this moral crisis that defines our time except to look away. But a strategy of avoidance will not work; migrants and refugees will keep coming when the weather calms down in the spring because the reasons for fleeing are as strong as ever. Europe has to decide whether the Mediterranean Sea should be a place of life and hope or an even deeper graveyard where, eventually, also European humanism will be laid to rest."

She follows in the footsteps of other fearless women in every field of endeavor who paved the way and broke down barriers of all kinds. Each of the following fearless women has been inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Match the woman with her accomplishment:____ 1. The first U.S. woman to win an international pilot's license. ____ 2. The first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. ____ 3. The first woman to swim the English Channel, breaking the previous record by nearly two hours. ____ 4. The first woman to run the Boston Marathon. Today, she encourages women worldwide to run and has a clothing line named for her Boston Marathon bib number -- 261 Fearless. ____ 5. Afflicted with polio as a child, she was known as the fastest woman in the world and was the first American woman to win three gold medals at a single Olympics. A. Kathrine Switzer B. Gertrude Ederle C. Amelia Earhart D. Wilma Rudolph E. Bessie ColemanDetermined to get her pilot's license, Bessie Coleman studied French and moved to France after being denied that privilege in the U.S. due to her race. In 1921, she became the first African-American (and also the first African-American woman) to receive an international pilot's license. Commercial flight was not yet a reality, so to make a living as a pilot, Coleman became a barnstormer -- flying stunts and performing for paying audiences. The dream of ""Queen Bess,"" as she was known in the newspapers, was to open a school for black pilots. Her untimely death meant she did not live long enough to realize her dream. In 1926, when Gertrude Ederle became the first woman to swim the English Channel, the commonly held belief was that women couldn't accomplish that feat. Her 1925 attempt had been unsuccessful, but she was fearless. In 1926, she had to swim 35 miles to cover the 21-mile distance because of the unfavorable weather. Ederle was an expert and well-honored swimmer by the time she swam the channel, holding 29 different national and world amateur records. In 1924, she had received a gold medal at the Olympics as a member of the freestyle relay team and two bronze medals. The so-called ""Queen of the Waves,"" Ederle later became a swimming teacher. Amelia Earhart followed in the footsteps of Bessie Coleman. Earhart took flying lessons when she was in her early 20s and soloed in June 1921. She became the first woman to fly across the Atlantic as a passenger aboard a 1928 flight from Newfoundland to Wales that took almost 21 hours. A founding member of the Ninety-Nines, an international organization of licensed women pilots, she was determined to pilot a plane across the Atlantic and deserve the fame that she had attained. In 1932, she became the first woman to fly alone across the Atlantic as well as the first woman to have made the crossing twice. Her 1937 attempt to fly around the world was not successful and ended with the disappearance of her plane. Earhart understood the risks of what she was doing. She said ""Please know that I am aware of the hazards. I want to do it because I want to do it. Women must try to do things as men have tried. When they fail, their failure must be a challenge to others."" Wilma Rudolph had to overcome physical challenges as well as racial barriers on her way to becoming the fastest woman in the world. The twentieth child in a family of 22 and a sickly child, Rudolph was stricken by polio. Through the determination and support of her mother and family, a diagnosis that she would become unable to walk did not materialize and by age 12 she could walk without braces, a crutch or corrective shoes. Home schooled for much of her childhood, Rudolph discovered her athleticism when she entered high school. She played basketball and her talent for running was discovered during her sophomore year. At age 16, she won a bronze medal at the 1956 Olympics as a member of the relay team. That set the stage for her triumph at the 1960 Olympics where she became the first American woman to win three gold medals. Rudolph's inspirational story made her a star during those first televised Olympics. Rudolph's fearlessness also inspired generations of women athletes who came after her. When K.V. Switzer filled out her application to run the Boston Marathon, she wasn't being secretive, that was how Kathrine Switzer signed her name. The first woman to run the Marathon, she had help in fending off the race official who tried to remove her from the race, and successfully completed the event. Switzer became -- and remains today -- a huge advocate for women worldwide to run. Credited with helping establish the women's marathon as an Olympic event, today she is associated with a clothing line, 261 Fearless, carrying the number of the bib she wore in that history-making 1967 Boston Marathon.

Twice a year, Live in the Vineyard welcomes music industry executives and lucky radio contest winners for four days of delicious food, fabulous wine and beautiful serenades by up and coming as well as established artists.This year, I had the chance to speak to many of the artists that performed, and what I found was the most touching (and authentic) collective theme: the desire to move people, to inspire people, to make a difference with their music. Interview after interview involved an outpouring of the most heart-centered desire to share with the world the artists' true vulnerabilities and humanity, the hope to reach people with a message that they're not alone in feeling what they feel, experiencing what they're experiencing, dealing with the bumps and fireworks and roadblocks and disappointments of life.I have had the privilege of becoming friends with the founders of Live in the Vineyard, Bobbii Hach-Jacobs and Claire Parr, and have known them both to be some of the most open-hearted, loving, inspirational women I know. But to find that the superstar artists they hand pick to join them at this special event reflected an aligned energy was surprising, and wonderfully refreshing.Teenager Sydney Sierota, lead singer of Echosmith, shared with me that the hit Cool Kids was born out of the desire to share a message that she and her siblings felt strongly about -- that it's okay to be yourself, that you should accept yourself just as you are. Bea Miller told me how much she wants her music to help people ""get through the day, to deal with how they're feeling."" She told me that she appreciated listening to the radio and hearing her own story shared reflected in the lyrics of her favorite artists, and that she wrote her hit Young Blood because she wanted to do the same for others. ""I felt really alone in how I was feeling, and I wrote the song because I wanted others who were feeling the same to know that they weren't alone."" Ingrid Michaelson told me how much it means to her to know that she's affecting someone's life in a meaningful way. ""I'm not a doctor,"" she said, ""I'm not saving someone's life in that way, but I have been told on numerous occasions that it has even come to that for some. I know that music is really powerful, and when I realize just how powerful it is and really let it in, it's heavy!"" And YouTube sensation Alex G shared with me how important she feels it is for us all to share our stories--and that she tries to do that in her music. ""It's comforting to hear others' stories,"" she told me. ""It gives people hope knowing that other people are going through the same things you are,"" she said. ""The thing I want to do the most is be a light in people's lives,"" Alex shared. ""I want to move people to do things that they love. To inspire them to take risks, be vulnerable and brave."" And that's exactly what she's doing herself.It's one thing to listen to a song and feel moved by the lyrics, to feel that you're a part of some universal human story. It's another to know that the artists singing that song are really in it with you, that their words are more than beautifully strung melodies expertly arranged and produced to hit just the right note of trendy and radio-worthy. Thanks to Claire Parr and Bobbii Hach-Jacobs for creating a truly one-of-a-kind, transformative experience--I can't wait for their next event in the Spring.

The answer is simple: money.,2014-12-23,"US President Barack Obama speaks during a meeting with leaders from the Trans-Pacific Partnership at the US embassy in Beijing on November 10, 2014. Top leaders and ministers of the 21-member APEC grouping are meeting in Beijing from November 7 to 11. AFP PHOTO/Mandel NGAN (Photo credit should read MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31876220000bb01dbc83f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In recent weeks many labor, environmental and consumer groups have stepped up their criticisms of the Obama administration's plans for pushing fast-track trade negotiating authority. The purpose of fast-track is to allow the administration to negotiate to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Pact (TTIP) and then hand both deals to Congress on a take it or leave it basis. Under the fast-track rules there would be no opportunity for amendments or delays. The deal must be voted up or down in a narrow time-frame. The idea is that with the bulk of the business community promising large campaign contributions to supporters and threatening to punish opponents, most members of Congress would find it difficult to vote no. Furthermore, the elite media can be counted on to do its part. It will use both the news and opinion sections to denounce opponents of whatever deal is produced as Neanderthal protectionists. As Thomas Friedman once famously said in reference to his support of CAFTA, ""I didn't even know what was in it. I just knew two words: free trade."" Others in the media may be too sophisticated to express themselves so bluntly, but undoubtedly most share Friedman's view. Under such circumstances, there will be few politicians prepared to stand up for principle or their constituents and vote against the pacts regardless of what it is in them. Since many traditional Democratic constituencies strongly oppose these deals it is reasonable to ask why the Obama administration is so intent on pushing them. The answer is simple: money.There is a well-known argument for free trade familiar to anyone who sat through an intro econ class. Free trade allows countries to specialize in the goods and services in which they are best at producing. They can then trade for other items. This makes the world richer.While not everyone gains in the textbook story, the winners are supposed to gain enough that they compensate the losers and still be better off themselves. This could then mean that everyone is better off.The real world trade story is considerably more complicated, in part because the winners never actually compensate the losers, but that is really aside the point here. In TPP and TTIP we are not talking about the textbook trade story. The actual trade barriers between the United States and the countries in these deals, with few exceptions, are already quite low. This means that there is little to be gained by lowering them still further. TPP and TTIP are about getting special deals for businesses that they would have difficulty getting through the normal political process. For example, oil and gas companies that think they should be able to drill everywhere may be able to get rules that prevent national or state governments from restricting their activities. This could mean, for example, that New York State would have to compensate potential frackers for the ban that Governor Cuomo imposed last week.Similarly, the financial industry will be looking to roll back the sort of regulations put in place through Dodd-Frank and similar legislation in other countries. Again, if governments want to ensure that their financial system is safe, they may have to pay the banks for the privilege. The pharmaceutical industry and entertainment industries will get longer and stronger patent and copyright protection. And the food and pesticide industries will be able to able to limit the ability of governments to impose safety and environmental regulations. Best of all, these trade deals will set up a new legal structure that goes outside existing system in the United States and elsewhere. All the businesses that didn't think German or British courts could be trusted to give them a fair deal can turn to the investor-state dispute settlement tribunals established as part of these trade pacts. These tribunals will effectively make their own law. The trade deals allow no appeal back to U.S. courts or the courts of any other country that is included.In short, these trade deals are a real bonanza for business. And it is a bonanza that the Obama administration is betting that they will be happy to pay for big time when it comes to the 2016 elections. It takes lots of money to run a campaign. If the Democrats can show business that it can come through for it pushing massive trade deals like TPP and TTIP, then they expect that the businesses that benefit will reward them at campaign contribution time. That's the basic story behind these trade deals which would otherwise look like both bad politics and bad policy for the Democrats. President Obama and other party leaders are prepared to ignore whatever harm the deals will do to the country and the world, with the hope that they amply rewarded in campaign contributions."

A county attorney spokesman said the case would remain under investigation and that new charges could be filed at a later date.But Dennis Wilenchik, a lawyer for the Flakes, said the case should never have been brought in the first place.""There was never any probable cause for these charges, and nothing will ever change that,"" he said.The sheriff's office has said the kennel's owner told investigators that overheated conditions were caused by a power outage from one or more of the dogs chewing through an electric cord. But that explanation could not be substantiated, sheriff's officials said.An attorney for the dogs' owners said his clients were stunned that the case was being dismissed.""The dogs were their family members. This is just a kick in the gut for everyone,"" said John Schill, who represents the pet owners in a civil lawsuit against the Flakes and Hugheses. (Editing by Steve Gorman and Paul Tait)"

Roll dough into a 16"" x 7"" rectangle. Bake the tart blind as per the instructions before proceeding with this recipe.Step 2: To make the Chantilly - Place the heavy cream, sugar, vanilla and cardamom in the bowl of an electric mixer and whip at medium speed until thick and ribonny. Refrigerate until ready to use.Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).Step 3: To make the frangipane - Place the hazelnuts and sugar in the bowl of a food processor and process until the hazelnuts are very finely ground. Transfer to the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the soft butter and Poire William. Whip at medium speed until the mixture is creamy, about 1 minute. Add the egg and continue whipping at medium speed until thick and ribonny, about 2 more minutes. Spread the hazelnut frangipane in the prepared tart shell.

Slightly spread the slices and arrange them on top of the frangipane.Step 4: Place the cold butter, Poire William, lemon juice and sugar in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture starts to foam, stirring continuously. Transfer to a small bowl and brush the pears with half the mixture. Bake the tart for 30 to 35 minutes until the frangipane is golden. Remove from oven, brush the pears with the balance of the butter-sugar mixture and let cool to room temperature.

13,CRIME,New York City Mayor Calls For Pause In Protests After Police Killings,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-de-blasio-nypd-protests_n_6370594.html,,2014-12-23,"NEW YORK, NY - DECEMBER 19: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks at a promotion ceremony for New York Police Department officers on December 19, 2014 in New York City. The promotions come on the heels of weeks of protests in New York over the decision of a Staten Island, New York grand jury decision not to indict a police officer in the death of Eric Garner. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2c4602500003500374a0c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - New York Mayor Bill de Blasio implored protesters on Monday to wait until after the funerals of two policemen shot dead in an ambush before resuming rallies that have roiled the city and beyond over the deaths of black men at the hands of police.But de Blasio's plea was quickly dismissed by several activist groups that vowed to continue protests that have stirred the city daily after grand juries chose not to indict police officers who killed Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.""It's a time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things we will talk about in due time,"" de Blasio said in a speech to a charity with close ties to the New York Police Department, two days after Rafael Ramos, 40, and his partner, Wenjian Liu, 28, were killed.  The men were shot as they sat in their patrol car in Brooklyn, and their deaths electrified tensions that had been coursing for months between City Hall, the police department and the reform-minded protesters who voted for de Blasio in large numbers.Similar protests, some of them violent, have taken place across the United States, provoking a bitter debate about how American police forces treat non-white citizens that has drawn in President Barack Obama and his attorney general, Eric Holder.Even de Blasio's assurance on Monday that he would attend the slain officers' funerals, normally an unquestioned mayoral duty, took on a political charge. Earlier this month, the city's largest police union said the mayor had abandoned the police and urged members to sign a letter insisting that the mayor stay away from their funeral should they be killed while on duty.Police identified the killer as Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who wrote online that he planned to avenge the deaths of Garner and Brown, who were both unarmed black men killed by white officers. Brinsley killed himself with a shot to the head soon after.""Let's comfort these families, let's see them through these funerals,"" de Blasio said in his speech, hours after visiting the officers' grieving families with Bill Bratton, the police commissioner. ""Then debate can begin again.""But the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist representing the families of Garner and Brown, said de Blasio's call was too nebulous to heed.""Is a vigil a protest? Is a rally?"" Sharpton said in a telephone interview, calling de Blasio's comments ""an ill-defined request.""Sharpton, who joined Garner's relatives over the weekend to denounce the slaying of the officers, said he would not change planned prayer vigils at the scene of Garner's death and elsewhere over the coming days to mark the family's first Christmas without him.A ""CHILL"" ON SPEECHThe Answer Coalition, an activist group, denounced the mayor's plea as an ""outrageous"" attempt to ""chill"" free expression. It said it had no intention of cancelling a long-planned protest march on Tuesday evening.At least one small candle-light vigil called for by a separate coalition of groups took place in Brooklyn on Monday evening, an organizer said.De Blasio's remarks came two days after his tense relationship with the city's police unions and rank-and-file officers hit its lowest ebb when two union leaders said the mayor had ""blood on his hands"" for the officers' deaths.The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and the Sergeant's Benevolent Association have accused de Blasio, a Democrat who ran for office on a platform of police reform, of helping incite a loathing of police through public remarks noting that he understood some of the protesters' grievances.Even if protesters say they will not be quieted, the heads of the city's police unions had agreed to suspend any lobbying efforts tied to the protests until after both officers are buried, Bratton said.Investigators said a video on Brinsley's cell phone showed him filming a protest against excessive police force at New York's Union Square Park.Rejecting the unions' arguments, de Blasio said the attack should not be tied to the recent protests, which in New York have been largely peaceful. But some protesters said the mayor sent the opposite message by using Brinsley's actions as a reason to temporarily stop protests.The grand juries that considered the killings of Brown and Garner decided the police officers involved broke no laws. On Monday, a Milwaukee prosecutor said a police officer there would not be charged for the fatal shooting of a black man in April.The officer in the Milwaukee shooting, who was white, was fired in October for failing to follow police procedure. As in the Garner and Brown cases, the U.S. Justice Department is now considering whether civil rights laws were broken in that case.(Additional reporting by Sebastien Malo in New York, Bill Trott, Susan Heavey and Ian Simpson in Washington and Richard Weizel in Milford, Connecticut; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by Howard Goller, Grant McCool and Ken Wills)"

With less than a week until Christmas, traditional high street retailers already under pressure from online shopping, will be hoping that the retail sales boost generated by Black Friday will continue. (Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f633200000c10101897b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This piece first ran on the On Being website  I played the Christmas game when my children were little. I was not reckless with the sense of wonder that collects around Santa Claus and the Baby Jesus and, alas, morphs the two together. I bought presents. Some years I even decorated a tree. Though some years I could let their father do this -- a rare plus of raising children in two households. As he is an Episcopal priest, they would also go to church with him, leaving me to stew in my Scrooge-friendly juices.Don't get me wrong. I enjoy giving gifts. I think ritual is essential to human flourishing and to family life. We need more of it. I have a deep reverence for the incarnational heart of Christianity. I even still recognize faint glimmers of these impulses in the trappings of Christmas as we know it now, 21st-century style. But I think this season has more overwhelmingly become a distortion of them -- a distortion of us as a culture, as humans, as families. And I for one am done.Why do I dislike Christmas now? Let me count the ways.I don't like -- don't approve, refuse to throw myself into -- the spirit of obligatory gift-giving. In my lifetime, this has become existentially linked to a commercial orgy that has now even co-opted the ritual angle. We have Good Friday and Maundy Thursday; we have Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Unlike Good Friday and Maundy Thursday, however (though like ""fiscal cliff"") these terms are repeated and reported by the most serious of journalists. Like all mantras of ritual, they work on us from the inside. They are an economic event by which we measure a certain kind of cultural health.This form of cultural health is not health at all. It is overwhelmingly an exercise in excess and trivia.When I was growing up, even in a financially comfortable family, we waited all year for the new bicycle, the new Barbie, the new book. Christmas was a reward for a kind of patience. It was, in some sense, an exercise in delayed gratification. Those gifts were even presumed to be a reward for a year of goodness -- a proposition, to be sure, that always had its fluff factor.But we who are fortunate to have money to spend on Christmas presents inhabit a world now where the new bicycle -- in modern-day translation: the new phone, the new video game, the latest greatest shoes -- are purchased on demand throughout the year. I routinely wake up to find that my teenaged son has left my laptop desktop open to the ""checkout"" page, usually of a sports clothing website, where he has graciously filled in all the fields but my credit card number. I don't always buy what he wants, but I cave in more than I'm happy to admit. That's January through November.Then there is the religious distortion of Christmas. Good Christians out there who do this with dignity, I don't mean you. In most of the churches I've attended as an adult, Christmas is dressed up as a children's holiday. A play. Not really for grown ups, not really about us. Make no mistake, I've teared up at that re-enactment of the manger scene many times myself, especially when my own children were sheep. It does not begin to do justice to the message of God become human.When I became a mother for the first time, I was studying at Yale Divinity School, learning vocabulary like ""Christology"" -- all the ways Christians have pondered the complex notion of Christ as both fully divine and fully human for the past two thousand years. So it was with incredulity and not a little annoyance that I found myself, in a state of severe sleep deprivation, singing ""Away in a Manger"" where ""the little Lord Jesus no crying he makes."" Please.More recently, there is also the maddeningly superficial way we've thrown other holidays into the mix, subsuming them all into general cultural buzz. The December that the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal was full-blown, my daughter traipsed through the house playing with her imaginary friends and singing ""Oh Monica! Oh Monica!"" to the tune of ""Oh Hanukkah!""Here's what I take seriously. There is something audacious and mysterious and reality-affirming in the assertion that has stayed alive for two thousand years that God took on eyes and ears and hands and feet, hunger and tears and laughter and the flu, joy and pain and gratitude and our terrible, redemptive human need for each other. It's not provable, but it's profoundly humanizing and concretely and spiritually exacting. And it's no less rational -- no more crazy -- than economic and political myths to which we routinely deliver over our fates in this culture, to our individual and collective detriment.So here's what I'm thinking about this Christmas. Recently I followed up on a promise I've been making myself for years: to wash and sort and give away all the good clothing my kids have outgrown as they've left childhood behind. It's embarrassing that I never took the time to do this all along. In the course of digging around for where to donate, I stumbled on the site of a charity that works with homeless teenagers. It turns out that they're not asking in the first instance for all these Levis and good-as-new, cool t-shirts. They're asking for donations of socks and coats. They're asking for newly purchased underwear, noting that most of us take for granted our ever-renewable supplies of clean underwear that fits.I'm not going to buy any presents this year. We will go shopping as a family for these homeless teenagers, and I'll try to be honest about the equivalent I would spend on my own children on the commercial holy days if I believed in them. I report this in some hope of feeding a little rebellion I sense many of us are quietly tending. But I also make it public to be sure I follow through.As I said, we need each other. And that impulse, surely, is deep in the original heart even of the most secular things like Santa Claus and surrounding your home with lights: examining what we are to each other and experiencing that, sometimes when we do this, something transcendent happens."

City officials began posting notices on hand built structures, tents and tree trunks warning the 200 residents of what is likely the nation's largest homeless encampment that the bulldozers are coming. People living in the Silicon Valley camp must be out by Thursday, Dec. 4 or face arrest for trespassing. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1d29725000036003844c4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Mary WisniewskiCHICAGO, Dec 23 (Reuters) - For Teresa Sigerson, a former waitress who has lived under a Chicago expressway bridge for three years, the camp she shares with eight others provides shelter, companionship and some measure of security.""There's safety in numbers,"" said Sigerson, 51, who begs during the day and sleeps between concrete bridge pillars under a highway northwest of downtown. ""Everything's convenient here - you're by the stores, the highway.""This year, Sigerson almost lost her space when construction began on tall concrete barriers on the raised slabs where the homeless were make their beds. The project, which was halted this summer, was meant to dislodge the decade-old camp in Chicago's Avondale neighborhood.Across the United States, local governments are moving to prevent outdoor camping by the homeless, according to advocates for the nation's nearly 600,000 homeless, estimated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.Government officials say they are trying to limit outdoor camping for the health and safety of the homeless and other residents. But homeless advocates say the bans are not a solution to homelessness and further stigmatize the poor.Over a third of U.S. cities impose citywide bans on public camping, a 60 percent increase in such ordinances since 2011, according to a 2014 survey of 187 cities by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty.More than half the cities surveyed, 57 percent, prohibit camping in certain public places. Such bans have climbed by 16 percent over the past three years, the study found.Rather than being exposed to bad weather and crime in camps, city officials say, the homeless are better served in city shelters, where they can sleep in beds and eat regular meals.One of the most visible moves against camps occurred earlier this month in San Jose, California, where a site known as the ""the Jungle"" was cleared out for safety and environmental reasons. Before the city took down the camp, however, a $4 million program was established to help find housing for 200 former residents, said Ray Bramson, the city's homelessness response manager.""The best long-term solution is to get people the support they need - then they won't be outside,"" Bramson said.But Dr. Robert Okin, a psychiatrist and homelessness expert, said the camps are a symptom of the lack of affordable housing and other services. Disbanding them doesn't solve the problem, it just disperses it, he said.""It may be a solution to an eyesore, but it's not a solution to homelessness,"" he said.Others say the bans or barriers are part of an effort to criminalize behaviors associated with the poor, such as panhandling.""We basically think what's driving this is that visible poverty is bad for business and bad for tourism and detracts from efforts for cities to revitalize their urban cores,"" said Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty.Chicago, which estimates it has about 6,300 homeless, doesn't ban outdoor camping but tries to connect people sleeping outside with services, said Matt Smith, spokesman for the city's Department of Family and Support Services.In the case of the camp where Sigerson sleeps, local officials were concerned about the health of the homeless, while also aware that the site could make some passersby uncomfortable, said Martha Ramos, chief of staff for Alderman Rey Colon.Construction of the barriers began in May but was halted in June after police complained that it had created a hazard because the sidewalk could no longer be seen from the street.Some of the homeless wound up leaving the camp. Others stayed, including Sigerson, who said shelters kicked people out as early as 5 a.m., leaving the poor with nowhere to go at that hour.Sigerson said her underpass community has rules of behavior, including keeping the area clean and not talking to passersby unless they speak first.""We don't want to scare people,"" she said.(Editing by Douglas Royalty)"

But thanks to some of Ms. Grande's fans and their YouTube accounts, we've recently discovered yet another talent of hers: she can do some seriously incredible celebrity impressions. The videos show a younger Grande belting out pop hits before her songs were topping the charts. Take for example, her Britney Spears impersonation.  If you pressed play and closed your eyes, you would totally think that was Spears singing ""Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman."" Admit it:Grande even does justice to Shakira's signature sound: Here's a five-minute mashup of the singer doing various impressions. Warning: her crying baby impression at the 1:41-minute mark is so good you might be convinced there is an infant in your house:"
