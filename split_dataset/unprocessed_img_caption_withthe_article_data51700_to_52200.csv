She challenged this before a French court, which referred the case to the European Court of Justice.“There is nothing to suggest she was unable to perform her duties as a design engineer because she wore an Islamic headscarf,” Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston wrote.Opinions by the Court’s advocates general are advisory but it usually follows their advice in drawing up a final ruling.While a company could impose a neutral dress code if it pursued a legitimate aim, Sharpston said it was hard to see how such a measure could be seen as proportionate in the present case.France bars civil servants from wearing clothing indicating religious belief, such as a headscarf or a Jewish skullcap, but not employees in the private sector. Companies can set dress codes but their exact legal status is disputed. (Reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; Editing by Tom Heneghan)"

We’re tracking toward our forecast,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Joe Rixey, who heads the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency, told Reuters at the Farnborough International Airshow.Rixey said the total could still fluctuate, depending on what happened in the fourth quarter.Britain’s vote to leave the European Union should not affect its relationship with the United States, or potential future arms sale, Rixey said, citing two large UK arms purchases of Boeing Co equipment announced on Monday.“I’m personally not viewing any impacts to our current relationship with the UK,” he said.Global demand for U.S. helicopters and other weapons remained strong, Rixey said.Rixey has launched 40 separate initiatives to streamline the foreign arms sales approval process and respond to criticism about delays in handling a sustained high volume of requests.U.S. industry officials and top military officials have become increasingly vocal in expressing concerns about delays in approving fighter jet sales to U.S. allies in the Gulf and other deals.Rixey said he was working closely with industry officials to understand their concerns, but it was important to look at each case individually. He said his agency does not make policy determinations, but simply facilitates sales once they are approved by the U.S. State Department, Pentagon and White House.He declined to comment on the Gulf sales that have stalled for well over a year now, including a $4 billion deal to sell 36 F-15 fighter jets to Qatar and a $3 billion deal to sell 24 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to Kuwait, both built by Boeing Co .“Anything that is in foreign policy review is actually part of the deliberate conversation,” Rixey said. “When we get stalled there, the system is not broken, but actually acting as intended. We’re having a debate about foreign policy.”Rixey urged companies to “take the emotion out of it” and be as specific as possible about their concerns.He acknowledged that increased demand for U.S. weapons was creating strains for the government agencies that must evaluate such requests and then process the resulting contracts.“It’s not broken but it’s certainly burdened, with $47 billion (in arms sales approvals) in FY15, and we’re approaching $40 billion this year,” he said. “We’ve got to make sure that we get better.”He said the agency was working to improve training for the workforce and help ensure better contracting outcomes.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) endorsed his Democratic primary rival Hillary Clinton for president, the former secretary of state’s team paid a subtle tribute to the senator’s small-donor-driven campaign. When Clinton supporters go to donate to her campaign, they’ll now see the option to give exactly $27 ― the amount Sanders often cited as the average donation to his campaign. Sanders shattered fundraising records throughout the Democratic primary, reaching 1 million donations faster than President Barack Obama’s record-setting 2008 and 2012 campaigns and frequently outraising Clinton. The vast majority of those contributions were from people giving less than $200, and the $27 average donation statistic (which appears to be what the average amount hovered around over time) became a common refrain to highlight the size and scope of his support base. Clinton’s campaign noted that success, and actually used it to improve the secretary of state’s own performance with small donors. The new $27 donation option on her website is a signal that the campaign would like that trend to continue. Sanders’ digital fundraising manager highlighted the nod Tuesday after using the new button to make a donation:During Clinton and Sanders’ joint appearance Tuesday, Clinton tipped her hat to the senator’s grassroots campaign.“Throughout this campaign, Senator Sanders has brought people off the sidelines and into the political process,” she said. “He has energized and inspired a generation of young people who care deeply about our country.” Read more on Sanders’ endorsement here."

When he took the podium in New Hampshire, Sanders laid out the case for Clinton very much in his own terms: noting the achievements he made in advancing the party’s platform and praising Clinton, but sticking largely to policy points. Though one recent survey shows Sanders supporters shifting to Clinton, not all of his boosters were convinced. “Senator Sanders had to play ball with a political machine and in many ways chose a noble path, considering he could have easily torn down this machine at the convention,” emailed H.A. Goodman, a widely read pro-Sanders blogger whose takes on the senator’s electoral inevitability went viral and, in some quarters, provoked genuine amusement. “I will always love Bernie, and respect all he’s done to make a positive impact in the world and within the Democratic Party,” Goodman added. “However, neocons and Henry Kissinger are on Clinton’s team, and I feel Clinton is lying about the TPP and the notion she’d ever put Wall Street bankers in jail, along with other concerns. Since I feel Clinton is more militant than even Trump, and since she voted for Iraq and just recently advocated sending American ground troops abroad, I actually view Trump as the lesser evil.”Goodman added that he would vote for the Green Party’s Jill Stein or perhaps write in Sanders when he casts a ballot in November. “I truly fear Clinton,” he said.The blogger is very much in the minority. For all the talk of disunity in the ranks, Sanders supporters have followed the usual patterns of campaigns past. According to a recent Pew Survey, they’ve flocked to Clinton more quickly than Clinton supporters moved to Obama in 2008. Those numbers will only improve for Clinton as the election nears. But the sense of disappointment that some of these Sanders supporters felt ― bordering on abandonment and dismay ― underscored that there is a universe of politically attuned people who will just want no part of this campaign now that their candidate is gone. And one liberal group has even said it will stage a bean-fueled “fart in” at the Democratic National Convention this month. Tim Black, a progressive podcast and video host based in Maryland, said Tuesday that he’s struggling with Sanders’ endorsement of Clinton. “It feels like politics. It feels like Bernie said what he needed to say, and I just can’t get behind that,” Black said. Black added that the Democratic Party platform concessions Sanders has won could be “wooden nickels” and that he didn’t like Clinton’s reticence on decriminalizing marijuana, among other things. But he said he hadn’t totally made up his mind to vote for Jill Stein and is willing to at least listen to Clinton between now and November.“She’s saying the right things,” Black said, “but we have to feel that we can believe that she would bring those things to fruition.” "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Why did Yale University have a stained-glass window depicting slaves in a cotton field ... in 2016?A former dishwasher for the school, Corey Menafee, found himself asking the same question last month when he broke that window. Menafee is now unemployed and facing charges. The 38-year-old was in court Tuesday on a felony charge of criminal mischief and a misdemeanor reckless endangerment charge. He has not entered a plea, according to the New Haven Independent. Menafee, who is black, was arrested on June 13 after breaking the window with a broomstick.He says he made a quid pro quo arrangement with Yale University: The school would ask the state not to pursue criminal charges if he quit. So Menafee resigned. The charges, however, were not dropped.Menafee said he even signed a document spelling out the agreement, but did not have a copy of it.After Menafee’s court appearance Tuesday, Eileen O’Connor, Yale vice president for communications, said in a statement to the Independent that “the University will not advocate that the employee be prosecuted in connection with this incident and is not seeking restitution.”The window was located inside Calhoun College, named for former U.S. Vice President John C. Calhoun. Calhoun was an advocate for slavery during the 19th century, and students contested the name of the school just last year.Menafee said he found the image on the window “racist and very degrading,” and that’s why he chose to break it.“I took a broomstick, and it was kind of high, and I climbed up and reached up and broke it,” he told the Independent. “It’s 2016, I shouldn’t have to come to work and see things like that.”A GoFundMe account has been set up to support the father of two while he’s unemployed, as well as a petition to dismiss all charges.“If Yale wants to do the right thing, we will help them,” said Menafee’s lawyer, Patricia Kane. “There was an agreement for him to give back his job in exchange for not being prosecuted.”Supporters of Menafee gathered in the courtroom on Tuesday. His resignation and subsequent court appearance has ignited outrage from the campus, local community members and beyond.Activists and judicial marshals in and outside the courthouse called for “freedom” and “justice for Corey Menafee!”“I didn’t realize what I did had such an impact on other people,” Menafee said. More supporters on social media hailed Menafee as a hero.Whether or not you think Menafee is heroic, offensive images like the one on that window should not still exist. Yale University says it plans to remove stained-glass windows depicting Calhoun before the fall semester begins."

16,POLITICS,What We Talk About When We Won't Shut Up About Vice Presidential Speculation,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vice-presidential-speculation_us_57850e42e4b0ed2111d79a45,This media obsession is mostly performance art -- but with a dash of hopefulness.,2016-07-12,"Some in the media are saying that Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has a ""95 percent"" chance of being Donald Trump's running mate, whatever that means.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57853f5c1a000024006f9fe4.jpeg?cache=zA9827wnsn&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sometime very soon, we’re going to find out if Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin was correct when he predicted that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton would name “a prominent Republican” to be her vice president. This would be a staggeringly strange thing for Clinton to do, given a couple simple facts: First of all, the role of the vice president is to serve as the chief executive in the event of the president’s death or incapacitation, and secondly, the Democratic Party establishment will probably prefer this running mate be a Democrat, the better to keep doing Democratic party stuff should something terrible occur.So Halperin’s prediction ― which he’s famously based on “instinct and a little bit of reporting” ― is likely to come to naught, just like his 2012 hunch that Mitt Romney would choose Ohio Sen. Rob Portman as his running mate, and his 2008 conjecture that Barack Obama would name Indiana Republican Sen. Dick Lugar as his.But I’m not here to bury Mark Halperin, because let’s face it, he is hardly alone in the world of outlandish vice presidential augury. Throughout the run-up to the 2012 election, supposedly serious people traded in speculation that Obama would kick Joe Biden off the ticket in favor of Hillary Clinton, because people at Beltway cocktail parties were talking about it. In 2004, the New York Post ― billing it as an “exclusive” ― announced on the cover of its tabloid that Democratic nominee John Kerry had definitely picked Missouri Rep. Dick Gephardt as his running mate, when he’d actually picked North Carolina Sen. John Edwards. (""We unreservedly apologize for our mistake,” said Post editor Col Allan, no doubt ruing the missed opportunity to just run something racist in the front of his broadsheet.)Heck, I will confess to you that I once said Mitt Romney was going to choose New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte as his vice president. I went on to provide a list of reasons why, speaking out loud and with real intensity. I don’t know what possessed me to assemble an argument for Ayotte’s candidacy. It was like an odd dream I’d had ― a dream that ended when I came to find out that the Romney campaign’s internal nickname for Ayotte was “the energy vampire.”Why do we bother making ornate vice presidential prognostications? What would have been lost if the New York Post had just waited a few more hours to run its story? What benefit is there to being right in making a projection about such a low-stakes matter? Is it all about that little burst of brain-chemical cocktail that races into our veins when we perceive ourselves to be on the razor’s edge of political prognostication? Because it can feel really good in the moment, when we are cogitating on the matter. Later, however, it becomes one of those things we in which we regret having indulged.The reason I’m wondering about this is because right now, the media is fixated on who presumptive GOP nominee and detached Kuato Donald Trump might choose as his vice president. Over the past few weeks, the presumed apple of Trump’s eye has shifted to one person or another. At one point last week, Newt Gingrich was the presumed favorite. For a brief, mad moment, some guy named Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn was said to be in, like his last name. And while Trump is bad at most aspects of campaigning, he is really, really good at playing a media that’s seething to know who he’ll pick as his partner in (probably actual) crime:You’ll likely encounter headlines like this in the wild: “Report: ‘95 percent probability’ of Pence as Trump VP.” Where does that come from? Well, this story exists because the Washington Times got a convention delegate named James Bopp on the record, and he assigned that probability to Trump picking Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate based on an abrupt change in Trump’s schedule and the fact that Indiana’s House Speaker, Brian Bosma, hit him up for advice on running for governor. In essence, this is based on multiple layers of some random person’s presumptions.Really, this “95 percent probability” number is just one man’s 50-50 crapshoot combined with a healthy dash of bravado. It could be correct, or not, and there are plenty of opinions one way or the other. Which is probably the whole point: All that we in the media ask of the world is to be given a bright, shiny ball with which to play, to be replaced with a brighter, shinier ball the minute it seems we might get bored.Let’s face it, vice presidential speculation wouldn’t exist if those of us in the political media weren’t in a mad dash to put on the best display of performative savviness ― and the veepstakes squarely hit the sweet spot where pseudo-intellectual posturing and impossibly low stakes squarely intersect. We know that being correct will earn us a tiny gold star, while our harmless cock-ups will be quickly forgotten.Typically, when we begin the veepstakes season, we like to form lists of potential candidates that are designed to demonstrate that we’re fully in tune with polite unanimity, but also stylishly daring. This allows us to have polite panel discussions where we all basically agree while also having a moment to bask in the depth of our super-substantial thoughts.Basically, we talk about potential V.P. candidates the way armchair movie critics talk about the Coen Brothers’ filmography: See, we all agree with each other on the consensus picks ― those sturdy elders and zazzy up-and-comers that Beltway wags fixate on as potential ticket-fillers at the nascent stage of the presidential primary, as well as the occasional primary loser who nevertheless showed a little vice presidential potential. But we also have a vested interest in showing off just how knowledgable we are about arcana, and how we have great command of the obscure. Along the way, we trade in folk wisdom about vice presidents. Maybe some governor could help the candidate pick up a swing state’s electoral votes! Maybe a general, or a businessman, could fill in the nominee’s knowledge gap. Perhaps what the candidate needs is a vibrant dash of racial or gender diversity! We stroke our chins over these and other magic criteria, bound in the belief that somewhere out there exists a rug that will bring the whole room together. We cling to these beliefs against the urgings of political scientists reminding us that they are mostly bullshit. And these beliefs persist in spite of the fact that over and over again, they don’t bear fruit.And that is, perhaps, the most ironic thing about our obsession with vice presidential contenders. Once the candidate is named and they’re out hustling, we discover they are only really intriguing when they fail. We notice when they don’t deliver their home state’s votes, when their super-specific cache of knowledge pales in comparison to their overall lack of depth, and ― yes ― when they single-handedly decimate the last hopes of Sen. John McCain. That’s when they are interesting.What’s more, for all of our talk, we would never in a million years credit the vice presidential candidate for the success of his or her ticket. It just doesn’t happen. We’re all too drunk on Great Man Theory, the broad sweep of capital-H History, and all those enduring myths about Great Communicators and Fireside Chatters to ever rob a victorious presidential candidate of the credit. No one in their right mind would contend that Barack Obama won two elections because of something Joe Biden did. And yet, here’s the thing about all this time we spend picking through bird entrails in an attempt to divine a candidates’ help-mates: It might be one of the least cynical activities in which the people who cover politics engage. It’s definitely one of the only times we aren’t wholly fiending on failure and inadequacy like hopped-up schadenfreude junkies. At the root of our obsession lies a naive belief that there’s someone out there who can fill in all the gaps, square all the circles, and knit up the ragged hem of the weird egomaniacs who believe they deserve to run the free world.So dream those dizzy dreams, Mark Halperin. And keep a little hope alive that there might be some player-to-be-named who can arrive on the scene to lend coherence to the election season spectacle. Here in 2016’s presidential cycle, which often feels like the final season of a television series that’s gone way off the rails, we need to cling to these beliefs as long as we can, especially now that we’ve got a funny feeling about what’s to come.Sorry, Mike Pence!

Nzinga said he and the Panthers plan to leave Cleveland on Sunday, the day before the convention officially opens.His group plans to join a “black unity” convention in Cleveland that will hold a series of protest events in the city from this Thursday through at least Sunday.“We are there to protect… (the black unity) event. We are not trying to do anything else,” he said. “We are going to carry out some of these great legal rights we have ― to assemble, to protest and (to exercise) freedom of speech.”“Black Power” groups promote defense against racial oppression, with some advocating for the establishment of black social institutions and a self-sufficient economy.The New Black Panther Party became active in 1990 and has long espoused black separatist ideology. Founding members of the 1960s Black Panther Party have denounced the New Black Panther Party as racist, but Nzinga says his movement does include original Black Panther members.The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate group watchdog, describes the New Black Panther Party as “a virulently racist and anti-Semitic organization whose leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews and law enforcement officers.”But the center said the group has not been found to have actually carried out any violent attacks.Nzinga complained that his group is regularly demonized. “When we use our rights, the police want to take it away from us and they can’t,” he said. “We protect our community and they make us the villain.”Law enforcement officials say the New Black Panther Party and other black militant groups have not been implicated in any attacks against police since the 2014 police killing of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri. They also say the groups played no roles in last week’s attack in Dallas.Nzinga says his group has grown amid racial tensions in the wake of a series of police killings of black men in the past two years. The Southern Poverty Law Center says the number of black militant chapters around the country grew from 113 to 180 in 2015.The center says there are 892 hate groups total nationwide and at least 998, anti-government “patriot groups.” It says white hate groups, such as the Aryan Brotherhood, have a much longer track record of carrying out violent attacks than black extremist groups.(Reporting By Ned Parker; additional reporting by Daniel Trotta.; Editing by David Rohde and Stuart Grudgings)"

21,POLITICS,The Latest From Ruth Bader Ginsburg On Donald Trump: 'He's A Faker',Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ruth-bader-ginsburg-trump-faker_us_5785122ce4b07c356cfe8a2d,"The real estate magnate hit back, calling Ginsburg's comments ""highly inappropriate.""",2016-07-12,Donald Trump's latest formidable opponent: Ruth Bader Ginsburg.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578519b31a00002700dd0e74.jpeg?cache=hgUMNWSMxQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg can’t stop, won’t stop speaking her mind on Donald Trump.In an interview with CNN published Tuesday, the Supreme Court justice of over 22 years continued her recent pastime of assailing the presumptive Republican nominee for the presidency, calling him “a faker.”“He has no consistency about him,” Ginsburg said during a talk with veteran Supreme Court reporter Joan Biskupic. “He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego.”Ginsburg’s comments will certainly give ammunition to the court watchers and legal experts who say she’s crossing ethical lines in her criticism of Trump, and that she might need to recuse herself should an electoral dispute between Trump and his rival, Hillary Clinton, reach the high court in the lead-up to November.Trump himself jumped into the controversy on Tuesday, calling Ginsburg’s remarks in the thick of a presidential election “highly inappropriate” for a sitting Supreme Court justice.“I think it’s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court, Trump said, according to The New York Times. “I couldn’t believe it when I saw it.”Ginsburg’s remarks, which some view as unprecedented, began last week with a pair of interviews where the 83-year-old spoke candidly about where she stood on the celebrity businessman and what his presidency might mean for the future of the nation and the Supreme Court.“I can’t imagine what this place would be ― I can’t imagine what the country would be ― with Donald Trump as our president,” Ginsburg told the Times in an article published Sunday. “For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be ― I don’t even want to contemplate that.”In an earlier interview with The Associated Press, Ginsburg said she didn’t even want to ponder the “possibility” of Trump as the country’s chief executive.Supreme Court commentators and judicial ethics observers across the political spectrum have said Ginsburg is stepping over the boundaries of what is appropriate for members of the federal judiciary ― who are unelected, have lifetime tenure and are expected to rule independently of their individual politics and biases.Trump himself seemed to hint at this with his reaction to Ginsburg’s remarks.“That she should be saying that? It’s so beneath the court for her to be making statements like that,” Trump told the Times. “It only energizes my base even more. And I would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible.”Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law, is one of the few who have risen to Ginsburg’s defense. In an opinion piece for the Times, he argued that comments like Ginsburg’s are beneficial for the political discourse.“I think it is valuable for people to hear what the justices have to say on important issues,” Chemerinsky wrote Tuesday. “As a lawyer and as a citizen, I’d always rather know what justices and judges think rather than have enforced silence and pretend they have no views.”But it’s possible that neither side is exactly right, and that this debate may transcend judicial ethics and the normal relationships between coequal branches of government.As one commentator put it, Trump is indeed such an extraordinary and unusual political actor that maybe Ginsburg felt compelled to make her extraordinary and unusual comments ― with an eye toward defending her institution and the values she holds dear.“The tricky thing is that the biggest threat to the rule of law right now happens to be a presidential candidate,” Gregory Lipper, a lawyer and longtime Supreme Court watcher, tweeted Tuesday.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
22,TRAVEL,Disneyland Shows Off New Details Of 'Star Wars' Themed Land,Ed Mazza,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/disneyland-star-wars-concept-art_us_57847eb3e4b0ed2111d7683b,You will soon be able to pilot the Millennium Falcon.,2016-07-12,"New concept art shows details of the upcoming ""Star Wars"" themed land at Disneyland.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57847f221a000024006f9d1e.jpeg?cache=IjDSGacIqY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Disneyland has unveiled new concept art showing off more details about the most anticipated park project in the galaxy: the “Star Wars” themed land currently under construction in Anaheim.The image above was released online on Monday and posted on the fence near the construction zone.“Nestled between towering spires of rock, this thriving port contains a seemingly familiar architecture of markets, landing zones and buildings,” Disney’s Erin Glover wrote on the theme park’s blog. “Look closely and you may find hints of some of the thrilling experiences that are coming.”Here’s a closeup of the Millennium Falcon attraction, which will feature a ride where guests can pilot the famed Corellian YT-1300 light freighter: This area looks like a marketplace, and will likely house plenty of opportunities to separate visitors from their money: The area with the least detail might be the most interesting ― the ride informally known as the “Battle Escape” attraction. It will certainly get a snazzy new name at some point: Although little is known about this ride, Disney has said “visitors will find themselves in the middle of a tense battle between stormtroopers and Resistance fighters.”MiceChat reported earlier this year that the attraction will have the the biggest show building of any ride at Disney’s two California theme parks and will “dwarf even the largest backstage buildings for Anaheim’s other massive E Tickets like Pirates, Indy or Radiator Springs Racers.”Disney has not yet announced an opening date for the 14-acre “Star Wars” themed land; a similar themed land is under construction at Disney’s Hollywood Studios in Orlando. Outside of “Star Wars,” the new artwork also showed something else that will interest Disneyland fans:This doesn’t look like any of the watercraft that currently cruise the Rivers of America. Some commenters on the official Disney blog said it looked quite a bit like one of the keel boats from the old Mike Fink attraction, which closed after one of the vessels overturned in 1997.It’s not clear if this was just an Easter Egg in the artwork or if Disney was planning to resurrect the beloved attraction for the newly shortened Rivers of America.

23,SPORTS,NBA Free Agency Winners And Losers,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nba-free-agency-winners-losers_us_57826188e4b0344d514fb2bf,"The NBA's ""second season"" trumps all.",2016-07-12,Steph Curry and Kevin Durant help make the Warriors the most lethal offense in league history.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5783c86e1a000023006f9a90.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whether or not you enjoy the NBA, you can’t deny the reality that no other league does free agency quite like it does. And that’s not even counting the spectacle that is the NBA draft. This has become even more undeniable with the inflated salary cap ― which will raise to a staggering $108 million for the 2016-17 season. The 2016 version of the NBA’s “second season” has been a whirlwind of utter madness. Let’s take a look at the winners and losers.WinnersWarriorsNo need to get cute here. Landing a top-three NBA player who at 27 years old is just now entering his prime will make you a winner any year. Kevin Durant shocked the world when he chose to head west and join forces with Steph Curry and the record-breaking 73-win Warriors ― the same Warriors that vanquished Oklahoma City in the Western Conference finals. From a basketball standpoint, landing KD is pure nirvana. The flexibility he provides for Steve Kerr to go small ― Durant at the four and Draymond Green at the five ― is a counterpunch to Cleveland’s small lineup, and anyone else’s for that matter. To put it simply, all the shots that Harrison Barnes (now a Dallas Maverick) missed during the finals will now go to Durant. Moreover, Golden State now possesses perhaps the three best shooters in the world. That’s a scary thought.What’s also scary is the highway robbery GM Bob Myers pulled off by inking veteran center Zaza Pachulia to a three-year, $15 million deal. The sentiment around the league is that adding Durant is a severe blow, but stealing Pachulia ― an excellent team defender and rebounder ― is an absolute dagger.PacersIndiana may not be able to beat the Cavs just yet, but it certainly narrowed the gap between itself and Boston, along with Toronto. The trio of Thad Young, Al Jefferson and Jeff Teague all represent upgrades, particularly for a team that ranked 17th in field goal percentage last year. Young’s presence as an athletic, two-way wing who can play off of Paul George is a coup given the influx of wings needed in today’s game. Jefferson may not even start, but he’s the rare NBA big who can still get a bucket with his back to the basket. And Teague, who is just 28, has firmly cemented himself as a tier-two lead guard, a significantly better player than George Hill.Celtics Al Horford may not do anything at an elite level, but he does a whole lot of things really well. Horford’s diverse skill set ― shooting, passing, rebounding ― will allow Brad Stevens to run even more great offense and have the confidence in a reliable defensive center, despite Horford not being a rim protector. Boston has used this summer to build for now (think Horford) and in the future (think about the seemingly endless assortment of draft picks). Danny Ainge has to be thrilled knowing that he has a dynamic young backcourt featuring Avery Bradley and All-Star Isaiah Thomas, both of whom suffered injuries in the playoffs. Thomas will especially benefit from playing with a four-time All-Star center like Horford, who is just 30.Every Single Free Agent!We’ve seen our fair share of inflated contracts before: Jerome James, Erick Dampier and Adonal Foyle all come to mind. And yet, never before has it been so fortuitous to be an NBA free agent. Take career backup point guard Matthew Dellavedova. The Aussie tested the market last summer, only to find scant interest and resign for one year and a measly $1.2 million with the Cavs. Now, after seeing a reduced role with the world champs, Delly inked a four-year, $38 million deal in a sign-and-trade with Milwaukee. Delly’s former teammate, 7-foot-1 center Timofey Mozgov, signed a $64 million deal with Jim Buss and the rudderless Lakers. That’s the same 29-year-old Mozgov, by the way, who played all of 25 minutes versus the Warriors throughout the entire finals.Then we have Evan Turner, a fine NBA guard by any metric but hardly an offensive ace. Turner, though, signed for $70 million with Portland over four years. And of course, how could we forget Barnes? After a miserable postseason in which the 24-year-old endured severe shooting dips across the board, he was rewarded with a max contract worth $94 million with Dallas. Mike Conley Jr.Five years, $153 million: It’s the single largest contract in league history! It doesn’t belong to LeBron, or MJ, or Bird, or Magic, or Kareem, or Kobe.It belongs to Michael Alex Conley Jr.!This is hardly an indictment of Conley ― he’s a terrific NBA point guard. But 153 million bucks to a guy who’s never made an All-Star Game? I get it: The All-Star Game is about the fans and I’ve long lobbied for the 28-year-old Conley as an upper-echelon triggerman. But, even at his best, is Conley a top-20 NBA player? As we said, pure insanity. LosersAny Player Not From This EraThe further you go back, the worse it gets. Think about Bill Russell. The guy won 11 championships ... 11! He made $24,000 ― throughout his entire rookie season! How about Oscar Robertson? The one player in history to average a triple-double. Not much different than Russell. Magic Johnson, the architect of the Lakers’ famed Showtime dynasty, and perhaps the greatest player ever, for that matter: He famously signed a 25-year, $25 million contract. It was an unprecedented move in 1981. Even in today’s dollars, that’s peanuts to current NBA players.Thunder If signing Durant makes you the definitive winners, then losing him surely makes you the definitive losers. Such is the harsh reality for Sam Presti and the OKC Thunder. In the span of weeks, the Thunder has gone from one of the few real title contenders to playoff hopefuls, wondering if perhaps it needs to deal Russell Westbrook before he surely walks as a free agent next summer. The truth of the matter for the Thunder is that all of this could have been avoided if management hadn’t been so thrifty with its money. OKC didn’t want to pay James Harden and has been paying for that error in judgment ever since. Think about this: Presti dealt a perennial All-NBA player long before he could even legally drive a rental car. Durant, a once-in-a-generation type of talent, is now gone, and soon, so too will be Westbrook. In other words: Close the book on this team.Daryl Morey Nobody has been more critical of the Houston Rockets GM than me. And it’s about to get worse. How in the world can Morey justify spending $133 million on two players (Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon) who have missed a combined 173 games over the last three seasons? It’s inexplicable.Oh, and don’t forget that both Anderson and Gordon ― equal as defensive matadors ― were rewarded with four-year deals. Morey is undoubtedly an innovative thinker and he’s made stellar decisions in the past ― i.e. trading for Harden and drafting Chandler Parsons ― but the Rockets are quickly heading to mediocrity after being on the doorstep of the finals just two short years ago.BullsThis is not about Derrick Rose. Both sides needed a fresh start. But if we know anything about Jerry Reinsdorf, it’s that he doesn’t want to rebuild. We learned that in the early 2000s, and history is repeating itself in 2016. The Bulls, who missed the playoffs last season, made a colossal mistake by signing native son Dwyane Wade to a two-year, $47.5 million deal. It’s not that Wade doesn’t have any good basketball remaining on his 34-year-old legs. He proved to us last season that he remains one of the premier two guards in basketball. The Bulls, however, are not winning with Wade, just as they weren’t winning without him. In addition, they now possess a backcourt of Wade and Rajon Rondo (who quietly put together a productive season in Sacramento), neither of whom will ever be confused with knockdown perimeter jump shooters.To win in today’s NBA game requires shooting ― guards that can stick it and bigs who can extend the court ― and Chicago not only brought in two guards who can’t shoot 3s, but it also traded its best shooter in Mike Dunleavy Jr. in order to clear cap space for Wade. What’s more is that executives John Paxson and Gar Forman lost Pau Gasol to the Spurs, who was easily their best passer and best shooting big.Correction: A previous edition of this article incorrectly stated that the Bulls traded Pau Gasol. It has been corrected to state that Gasol signed with Spurs.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

It’s not that Wade doesn’t have any good basketball remaining on his 34-year-old legs. He proved to us last season that he remains one of the premier two guards in basketball. The Bulls, however, are not winning with Wade, just as they weren’t winning without him. In addition, they now possess a backcourt of Wade and Rajon Rondo (who quietly put together a productive season in Sacramento), neither of whom will ever be confused with knockdown perimeter jump shooters.To win in today’s NBA game requires shooting ― guards that can stick it and bigs who can extend the court ― and Chicago not only brought in two guards who can’t shoot 3s, but it also traded its best shooter in Mike Dunleavy Jr. in order to clear cap space for Wade. What’s more is that executives John Paxson and Gar Forman lost Pau Gasol to the Spurs, who was easily their best passer and best shooting big.Correction: A previous edition of this article incorrectly stated that the Bulls traded Pau Gasol. It has been corrected to state that Gasol signed with Spurs.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

In a statement provided to The Huffington Post, Harteau wrote that she did not condone her officers’ actions, but understood why they were upset. She also stated that although the off-duty officers were working for the Lynx, not the police department, at the Target Center that night, she expected more dutiful and professional behavior from them:Although these officers were working on behalf of the Lynx, when wearing a Minneapolis Police uniform I expect all officers to adhere to our core values and to honor their oath of office. Walking off the job and defaulting on their contractual obligation to provide a service to the Lynx does not conform to the expectations held by the public for the uniform these officers wear.The officers, working as contracted security for the Lynx, left their posts after Lynx players held a pregame press conference to speak openly about racial profiling and the recent murders of Philando Castile, Alton Sterling and five Dallas police officers. The players also wore T-shirts featuring Castile and Sterling’s names and “Change Starts With Us” and “Black Lives Matter” graphics. The Dallas Police Department shield was also featured under Sterling’s name in a display of unity. Black or white, policeman or not, their message was clear: Racism and senseless killings in the United States will only subside if both civilians and law enforcement communicate clearly and amicably. “This is a human issue and we need to speak up for change, together,” Lynx forward Maya Moore said at the pregame presser. Dr. Louis Porter II, the executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage, echoed Moore’s remarks over the phone with HuffPost.“I commend the Lynx for speaking out and taking a stand. It’s really a time for us as a community to come together and address this,” he said. More critically, however, Porter was dismayed at the officers’ divisive actions, especially because the players’ shirts paid tribute to Dallas’ police officers. “Walking out of the game was not helpful and did not advance the discussion. It was counterproductive,” he concluded. Harteau’s and Porter’s stances on the matter sharply contrast with that of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis. Lt. Bob Kroll, the union’s president, who in June called Black Lives Matter “a terrorist organization,” commended the officers for walking out. “If [players] are going to keep their stance, all officers may refuse to work there,” he said to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in a report published on Tuesday. Going even further, Kroll disparaged the WNBA franchise, saying, “They only have four officers working the event, because the Lynx have such a pathetic draw.” Reached by email on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department was unable to comment on any potential discipline for the officers or Kroll’s suggestion that all officers may stop working at the Target Center. The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis did not immediately return a request for comment from Lt. Kroll. Chief Harteau’s full statement can be read below:While I do not condone the actions of the officers, I realize how every member of law enforcement throughout this country, including myself, is feeling right now.

28,ENTERTAINMENT,'Mr. Robot' Shows How Girls Run The (Tech) World,Sara Boboltz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mr-robot-portia-doubleday-carly-chaikin_us_576c3e25e4b017b379f550e8,"“To me, it was just like, ‘Of course that character exists!’""",2016-07-12,"Portia Doubleday and Carly Chaikin in ""Mr. Robot."" ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5783eeba1b00002700f6d447.jpeg?cache=QNuXadMKiN&ops=crop_68_60_997_660%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"At a time when there is no shortage of depressing news on the state of women working in technology or, well, working pretty much anywhere, the tech-literate women of “Mr. Robot” are an optimistic respite. We first see Angela Moss (Portia Doubleday) holding an agitated conversation with her boss after a well-coordinated hack against their company’s biggest client. Her childhood friend Elliot (Rami Malek), also the show’s narrator, introduces her as “a bit high-strung” yet still “one of the good ones” as she struggles to clean up the cybersecurity mess. We first glimpse Darlene (Carly Chaikin) in a dilapidated arcade, tapping away at her laptop. Later, she confronts Elliot, leaning moodily against the arcade with a cigarette. “Cut the bullshit,” she demands, ending with an insult ― “dickhead” ― before stalking away. As the hacker drama’s two female leads, Angela and Darlene make for nicely rounded characters. Angela’s journey through Season 1 sees a capable yet not fully confident cybersecurity professional become just that, and someone who now makes seemingly impossible decisions on her own. Daredevil malware hacker Darlene, although not undergoing such a radical transformation as Angela, is fleshed out ― without giving too much away — through her backstory over the season, revealing her ties to Elliot and other characters. Of course, “Mr. Robot” is a show about Elliot. It tells the story of fSociety, a group of hacker-activists attempting to erase consumer debt held by one evil conglomerate, E Corp. Elliot and a small group of others, including Darlene, join the group led by a mysterious man named Mr. Robot (Christian Slater), while Angela unknowingly skirts its sharp edges. The show spends most of its time on Elliot’s mental instability along with his and Mr. Robot’s extensive planning, but subplots featuring its supporting women are often more compelling as they’re caught up in a few legally dubious plots of their own. When female characters are still often relegated to girlfriend, wife and mother roles, “Mr. Robot” offers a nice change.“There’s so many scripts that I read that have ‘romantic interest,’ ‘romantic interest,’ and that defines the character that you’re playing, that they’re just a ‘romantic interest,’” Doubleday told The Huffington Post. “And I remember when I sat with Sam [Esmail, the show creator] after the pilot, he was like, ‘No way.’”Of the few TV series revolving around tech and business, fewer show women working in these environments in roles central enough to the plot that we see them develop over the course of a season. HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” for example, while brilliantly parodying the ineffable California tech scene, has faced criticism over its lack of female characters, however accurately that may reflect reality there. It was nice that “CSI: Cyber” featured one woman hacker, although the show was canceled after two seasons. Women characters have less to contribute to “Billions,” set on Wall Street, and they behave similarly on the white-collar-crime-related melodrama “Suits.” Unsurprisingly, an analysis by FiveThirtyEight found that female characters are second-most underrepresented in “business” roles. (The first-most underrepresented profession for women, oddly, is bartending.)Having worked on the USA series for nearly two seasons — Season 2 airs beginning July 13 ― the “Mr. Robot” stars offered up a little advice to aspiring showrunners on writing lady characters.“I think with any show or film or project, what people respond to the most is emulating real life,” Chaikin told HuffPost. “And in real life, women are in the tech world, they’re more competent than men ― equal if not more competent than men.” Doubleday agreed, saying “a lot of trends [in writing women] play into stereotypes that are of the past.” That is, women in business and tech aren’t shown on screen because they don’t work in business and tech off screen.Chaikin explained how, in fact, her character didn’t even strike her as unusual when she first read the script, only realizing it afterward when others pointed out the rarity of Darlene-types on TV.“To me, it was just like, ‘Of course that character exists!’ Because that person exists in real life,” she said. “Mr. Robot” Season 2 debuts Wednesday, July 13, at 10 p.m. ET on USA."
29,POLITICS,Anti-Trump Delegates Plot Their Final Stand,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anti-trump-convention-rules_us_5785631ce4b0867123dece7e,"Unless they muster at least 28 votes in a key committee this week, they cannot deny Trump the nomination",2016-07-12,Republicans working to deny Donald Trump the presidential nomination face a key hurdle this week at the Convention Rules Committee in Cleveland.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― Just blocks from the arena where Donald Trump is to become the Republican Party’s nominee for president, the resistance movement trying to stop it from happening is plotting its final stand.On the 16 floor of a century-old skyscraper, a handful of staff for Delegates Unbound sit at laptops, making phone calls and sending emails to the 2,472 GOP delegates. More volunteers are on the way to the newly rented office suite, it is promised. But even with dozens manning the phones and computer keyboards, anti-Trump leaders concede it will not be an easy fight.“It’s very important for the world to see ― that not every Republican is in lockstep with Donald Trump,” said Delegates Unbound leader Dane Waters, explaining why the fight is worth having, even if it fails.What gives Waters and his allies hope, though, is that Trump does not command the personal loyalty of a majority of the delegates. Unlike a typical Republican nominee who has been active in local politics for years before moving up the ranks, Trump started his run with no grassroots support. Instead, he relied on his celebrity to win primary votes, and that hasn’t always translated into backing from traditional Republicans, who make up the vast majority of the convention delegates.“If Donald Trump truly has the support he says he has, he shouldn’t be concerned if delegates vote their consciences,” Waters said. “Whatever they’re saying, they’re concerned.”Randy Evans, an RNC member from Georgia who has been keeping a careful tally of the nearly 2,500 delegates, said that although 1,457 are currently required by party rules to vote for Trump, the celebrity businessman could only count on 888 delegates loyal to him personally in a rules battle. But Evans said Trump can also rely on 903 delegates who will do whatever Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus wants, with the remaining 800 supporting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other former candidates.“The combination of Reince Priebus delegates and Trump delegates will give him well over two-thirds,” Evans said.And that’s the main problem Delegates Unbound and the allied Free the Delegates groups confront: They must overcome not only the Trump campaign ― which appears to be spending more organizational effort holding onto the nomination than fighting Democrat Hillary Clinton ― but the RNC itself.Priebus called the dump Trump efforts “mostly chatter among sore losers” on Sean Hannity’s radio talk show Monday. And in the RNC Rules Committee meeting Tuesday, chairman Bruce Ash scolded Republicans still attacking Trump. “Some of our party have decided they know better than the voters,” he said.To succeed, the anti-Trump groups face a two-step process. The first takes place this week, in the Convention Rules Committee, which is charged with drafting the rules guiding next week’s nominating convention. One of those rules will address whether the delegates must vote according to the results of their home states and congressional districts, as the RNC rules for this election have stated, or if they can instead choose to vote their conscience, if they feel they cannot support Trump.Colorado delegate and Free the Delegates founder Kendal Unruh originally had hoped to nail down votes from 57 of the 112 committee members, enough to pass her proposed “conscience clause” exception. With the committee’s approval in hand, she argued, the full convention would readily follow.But in recent days, Unruh has instead emphasized her confidence in winning 28 votes ― enough for a “minority report” that would require a full vote of the convention.All 2,472 delegates must approve the rules on the first day of the convention. RNC members said they are not worried about the dissidents somehow prevailing with just a minority report, which is likely to get voted down well outside of evening, prime-time hours.“Basically, who cares?” said one top RNC member on condition of anonymity. “I think this thing has run its course.”The anti-Trumpers enjoyed one high point this week: a ruling from a federal judge striking down a Virginia law requiring delegates to vote for the winner of the state’s primary. Some two dozen states have similar laws, and Trump opponents hope that delegates will be more willing to declare their independence once they understand they will not face prosecution.“Nearly everyone who is not a Trump delegate is opposed to Trump. There’s a huge softness with Trump delegates,” said Gordon Humphrey, a former New Hampshire senator who is working with Waters in Cleveland this week.Humphrey said he understood those who argue that the delegates’ job is to reflect the choice of voters back home. But with a “sociopath” like Trump, the rules have to be different, he said.“In a normal year, with a normal candidate, that would be a simple process. The convention ratifies the will of the people,” Humphrey said. “This is not a normal year. We do not have a normal candidate. We have an abnormal candidate.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

In June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that flour produced at a General Mills plant in Kansas City, Missouri, was probably the source of an E.Coli outbreak that had sickened 38 people in 20 U.S. states.About half of the 38 sickened people reported cooking with flour before becoming ill, General Mills previously said. About half of this group reported using a General Mills brand.No illnesses reported to date have been connected to the cake mix brands, General Mills said in a statement on Monday, adding that none of the company’s other mixes were included in this recall.For details on the affected mixes, visit General Mills’ site here."

Voters are more concerned about violence against police than violence by police. And a majority of residents in many European countries view immigrants as a threat. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, July 12, 2016. VOTERS ARE SPLIT BY PARTY ON RACIAL DISCRIMINATION - Hannah Hartig, John Lapinski and Stephanie Psyllos: “In the wake of several shooting incidents, a majority of American voters (52 percent) agree that racial discrimination against blacks in this country is an extremely or very serious problem….Just over half of registered voters think racial discrimination against blacks in this country is an extremely or very serious problem. A quarter think racial discrimination is a somewhat serious problem, and 22 percent do not think it is a serious problem. The results vary by party, however. Among Republicans, 42 percent think racial discrimination against blacks is a not so serious or not at all serious problem in this country. Just under eight in 10 — 77 percent — of Democrats think racial discrimination is an extremely or very serious problem. Half of Independents think it is an extremely or very serious problem.” [NBC] VOTERS ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST POLICE THAN ABOUT POLICE BRUTALITY - Eli Yokley: “In the days since the mass shooting in Dallas, Texas – the deadliest day for law enforcement since 9/11 – more voters said violence against the police is a more serious concern than police violence against the American public….More than half of voters, 56 percent, said they had very serious concerns about violence against police, concerns that were expressed by 57 percent of white voters, 53 percent of Hispanic voters and 52 percent of African American voters. But only 45 percent of voters said they view police violence against the public as a very serious fear, a view shared by 78 percent of African American voters but just 39 percent of white voters.” [Morning Consult] HILLARY CLINTON IS STRUGGLING TO WIN OVER SOME MILLENNIALS - Julie Pace and Emily Swanson: “Hillary Clinton is struggling to make inroads among young Americans who overwhelmingly supported Bernie Sanders during the Democratic presidential primary, a worrisome sign as she tries to reassemble the coalition that twice propelled Barack Obama into the White House. Opinions of Clinton among young Americans vary by race and ethnicity, according to a new GenForward poll of adults ages 18 to 30. The majority of the nation’s younger blacks and Asian-Americans have a favorable impression of Clinton, but the presumptive Democratic nominee struggles with whites and Hispanics. Just 26 percent of young whites and 49 percent of Hispanics have a positive opinion of the former secretary of state. Both groups overwhelmingly say she is not trustworthy….The GenForward poll found that among those who preferred Sanders in the primaries, only half are prepared to say they’ll back Clinton in her general election face-off with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. About a quarter say they won’t support Clinton, and nearly a quarter say they’re not sure.” [AP] But she’s doing well among college-educated white voters - John McCormick: “Hillary Clinton is crushing Donald Trump among college-educated white voters, a group Mitt Romney easily won in 2012 and one his Republican Party has carried in presidential contests for decades. White voters with at least a college degree—a group that represented more than a third of the 2012 electorate—back Clinton over Trump 48 percent to 37 percent, the latest Purple Slice online poll for Bloomberg Politics shows. Romney won that group by 14 percentage points, according to exit polls….Since 1952, no Democratic presidential candidate has won college-educated whites, according to American National Election Studies data and exit polls reported by the Atlantic.” [Bloomberg] EUROPEANS EXPRESS FEARS OF TERRORISM, NATIONALIST SENTIMENTS - Samantha Neal: The resurgence of nationalist sentiment that catalyzed the Brexit vote is prevalent in other European countries, according to a Pew Research report released on Monday. The sentiment is linked overwhelmingly to fears of increasing refugee populations, terrorism, and resistance to cultural diversity. An overwhelming number of Europeans perceive a powerful link between the recent surge of refugees and the threat of terrorism ― majorities of respondents in eight of the ten European nations surveyed believe that incoming refugees increase the likelihood of terrorism in their country. The negative perception of refugees extends beyond security considerations ― many Europeans believe them to be a cause for economic concern. Fifty percent or more of respondents in half of the nations polled believe refugees will take away jobs and social benefits. When it comes to crime, the link to refugees is far less salient. However, almost half of respondents in Italy and Sweden say that “refugees are more to blame for crime than other groups.” [Pew] UNINSURED RATE AMONG AMERICANS STANDS AT A RECORD LOW OF 11 PERCENT - Stephanie Marken: “In the second quarter of 2016, the uninsured rate among all U.S. adults remains at the trend low of 11.0% reached in the first quarter of this year. This is down from 11.9% in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was prior to when health plans purchased through government exchanges during the most recent open enrollment period took effect in early 2016….Across income groups, the uninsured rate has declined the most among those living in households making less than $36,000 annually. In the fourth quarter of 2013, 30.7% of these individuals were uninsured, compared with 20.4% of in the second quarter of 2016….The uninsured rate has also declined precipitously among Hispanics and blacks since the fourth quarter of 2013.” [Gallup] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who is leading the effort, told The Huffington Post. The senators are also hoping to capitalize on attention surrounding the investigation of Exxon Mobil Corp. by several state attorneys general over allegations that its scientists knew about climate change even as the company publicly disputed the science.Exxon Mobil has denied those allegations, and says probes into the matter violate the company’s free speech rights.Whitehouse had 17 other senators lined up to speak about climate change on the floor this week. The senators, he said, are all drawing connections between fossil fuel companies and the various think tanks and front groups they have funded.“It looks like it has a lot of heads, but its all the same beast,” he said.Whitehouse has been on a lonely Senate crusade to keep the discussion about climate change going ― this week, he’ll deliver his 144th speech on the topic.Whitehouse, along with fellow Democratic Sens. Ed Markey (Mass.), Brian Schatz (Hawaii), Barbara Boxer (Calif.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Al Franken (Minn.), plus Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), also introduced a resolution condemning companies that engaged in a “sophisticated and deceitful campaign that funded think tanks and front groups, and paid public relations firms to deny, counter, and obfuscate peer-reviewed research; and used that misinformation campaign to mislead the public and cast doubt in order to protect their financial interest.”Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) introduced a concurrent measure in the House.The resolution doesn’t call out Exxon Mobil by name, but it urges “fossil fuel companies and allied organizations to cooperate with active or future investigations.”"

35,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Endorses Hillary Clinton For President,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-endorses-hillary-clinton_us_56e98f60e4b0b25c91841bdd,"“In these stressful times for our country, this election must be about bringing our people together, not dividing us up,” Sanders said.",2016-07-12,Bernie Sanders' candidacy was far more successful than many pundits expected.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578511bf1a00002600dd0e2b.jpeg?cache=JkU0QaBDqB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has endorsed presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for president.“Secretary Clinton has won the Democratic nominating process, and I congratulate her for that,” Sanders said. “She will be the Democratic nominee for president and I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next president of the United States.”Sanders thanked those who voted for him during the Democratic primary ― especially the people of New Hampshire, where he got his first primary win, and his home state of Vermont. He also warned against presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, arguing the business mogul would be bad for working families, calling Trump’s economic policies “reckless.”Sanders slammed Trump’s anti-Mexican and anti-Muslim comments, claiming the GOP hopeful would divide Americans.“In these stressful times for our country, this election must be about bringing our people together, not dividing us up,” Sanders said. “While Donald Trump is busy insulting Mexicans, Muslims, women, African Americans and veterans, Hillary Clinton understands that our diversity is one of our greatest strengths. Yes. We become stronger when black and white, Latino, Asian American, Native American – all of us – stand together. Yes. We become stronger when men and women, young and old, gay and straight, native born and immigrant fight to rid this country of all forms of bigotry.”Clinton thanked Sanders for his support while acknowledging their former rivalry.“Being here with him in New Hampshire, I can’t help but reflect how much more enjoyable this election is going to be now that we’re on the same side,” she said. “Now, with your help, we are joining forces to defeat Donald Trump, win in November and together build a future we can all believe in.” She also praised Sanders for his advocacy and his ability to get people more engaged in politics, thanking him for his ""lifetime of fighting injustice.""""Over the years I've gotten to know him as a colleague and a friend,"" she said. ""His reputation for passionate advocacy hasn't always made him the most popular person in Washington. But you know what? That's generally a sign you're doing something right. And throughout this campaign, Senator Sanders has brought people off the sidelines and into the political process. He has energized and inspired a generation of young people who care deeply about our country.""Clinton had already secured the majority of pledged delegates, making her nomination all but official. A self-described democratic socialist, Sanders was not initially seen as a threat to Clinton’s path to the White House. But the senator’s progressive message, focused on righting the wrongs of economic inequality, struck a chord with many voters. Sanders picked up an early win in New Hampshire, a victory few pundits would have predicted months earlier. One month later, he stunned with a victory in Michigan, despite polls showing a huge lead for Clinton. That win, apparently bolstered by Sanders’ criticism of U.S. trade policy, emboldened his campaign to gun for the rest of the Midwest. “These states in the Midwest are going to respond to us and our message in the same way Michigan workers did, and that is, ‘We need an economy that works for all of us and not just the 1 percent,’” Sanders said.Clinton swept the March 15 primaries, however, winning Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio. And as she continued to dominate in big states, Sanders struggled to keep up in the delegate count.Nevertheless, Sanders held on. While Clinton took home most of the delegates in big states like Pennsylvania and New York, Sanders had a series of wins in smaller states from the end of March through mid-May. But while it remained nearly impossible for Sanders to overtake Clinton in the pledged delegate count, he vowed to stay in the race until the convention, hoping to flip unpledged superdelegates to his side.After Trump became the GOP’s presumptive nominee, Sanders hoped to convince voters he’d have a better chance at defeating the hotel magnate in November’s general election. But as primary season came to a close, Clinton still came out on top in the delegate race.Sanders announced his presidential bid in April 2015, touting himself as a progressive alternative to the perceived inevitability of a Clinton nomination.“People should not underestimate me,” Sanders told The Associated Press. “I’ve run outside of the two-party system, defeating Democrats and Republicans, taking on big-money candidates and, you know, I think the message that has resonated in Vermont is a message that can resonate all over this country.”The senator gained momentum throughout the summer and fall, picking up a host of big-name endorsements including former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, economist Thomas Piketty and celebrities like Killer Mike, Spike Lee and Sarah Silverman.Throughout the campaign, Sanders sought to convince voters that Clinton was too beholden to corporate interests to adequately represent working-class Americans, pointing to donations from Wall Street executives. He also pressed Clinton to release the transcripts of lucrative speeches she made to Goldman Sachs. Clinton, in turn, accused the senator of smear tactics, denying donations had influenced her policy positions.Clinton and Sanders also frequently tussled over issues like health policy and gun violence. However, the key difference between the two candidates was one of vision. HuffPost’s Jonathan Cohn explained:Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were really arguing over something very basic.Paige Lavender contributed to this report."

Pat McCrory (R) said that immediately releasing police camera footage is ""extremely unfair to our law enforcement officials.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57850b011a00002700dd0e0a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed a bill into law on Monday that makes police dashboard camera and body camera footage exempt from the public record.House Bill 972 does make such video accessible to people who can be seen or heard in it, along with their personal representatives ― but they must file a request to obtain the footage. If the request is denied, the petitioners must go before the state’s superior court. Requests can be denied if the recording is part of an active investigation or to protect a person’s safety or reputation, among other conditions. Prior to Monday, there was no uniform state law establishing whether police camera footage was in the public record, though police departments often considered police camera footage to be part of an officer’s personnel file and thus private.The new law now removes any lingering doubt: Such recordings are not public records. They can be made accessible to certain individuals, but only under the stringent conditions described above.North Carolina Department of Public Safety Secretary Frank L. Perry said in a statement that the law “strikes a necessary balance between maintaining the confidentiality of law enforcement recordings when necessary to protect an ongoing criminal or internal investigation and the need to provide for an expedited and simplified process for disclosure.”The law sharpens guidelines for the release of footage and “advances uniformity, clarity, transparency and timeliness where previously none of these were well defined in state statute,” he added.“If you hold a piece of film for a long period of time, you completely lose the trust of individuals,” McCrory said. He added, however, that officials have learned that “if you immediately release a video, sometimes it distorts the entire picture, which is extremely unfair to our law enforcement officials.”Protests calling for justice in the police shootings of two black men and the massacre of five police officers last week may have helped motivate McCrory to sign the bill.Alton Sterling, 37, was shot and killed by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, last Tuesday. Philando Castile, 32, was shot and killed by police in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota, the following day. On Thursday, five Dallas police officers were shot by a sniper following a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest.Graphic cell phone video footage of Sterling and Castile’s deaths have also made national headlines. “It was news that shook this nation. It was news that shook communities. It was news that shook law enforcement communities throughout the United States and right here in North Carolina,” McCrory said. “Sadly, our country and state have been through these types of situations before. We’ve learned from them, we’ve recovered from them and we’ve united after them. I’ve seen it firsthand as a mayor.”McCrory also instituted the Blue Alert System on Monday, which will help catch anyone who plans to attack or harm public safety officials.North Carolina isn’t the only state to extend extra ― and sometimes redundant ― protections to police officers recently. In May, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) signed a bill making all attacks on law enforcement officers, firefighters and EMTs a hate crime, though state law had already established harsher punishment for the murder or assault of police officers. By adding an extra level of protection for police, the bill’s proponents argued, the state was showing much it values law enforcement officers. For McCrory, the goal appears to be simpler. “My goal is to protect those who protect us,” McCrory said at the bill’s signing. He added that the law is fair for everyone, and that “it’s better to have rules and guidelines with all this technology than no rules and guidelines whatsoever.” Bills like HB 972 may appear to send a strong message after the massacre in Dallas, but police officers’ risk of being killed in the line of duty actually fell last year. In 2013, the FBI estimated that 27 officers were killed ― a 50-year low. That number rose to 51 in 2014 and dropped to 41 in 2015. “Body cameras should be a tool to make law enforcement more transparent and accountable to the communities they serve, but this shameful law will make it nearly impossible to achieve those goals,” said Susanna Birdsong, policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina.“People who are filmed by police body cameras should not have to spend time and money to go to court in order to see that footage,” she said. “These barriers are significant and we expect them to drastically reduce any potential this technology had to make law enforcement more accountable to community members.”“We are equally concerned about the loss of dashcam [footage],” Mike Meno, communications director for the ACLU of North Carolina, told The Huffington Post.Meno said the organization is asking anyone who has an issue obtaining footage from any law enforcement agency in the state to contact them. The ACLU will also be reminding North Carolina citizens that they have a right to film their encounters with the police.“Citizens having smartphones in their pockets empowers them to hold police accountable,” Meno said. While police camera footage does help the public hold police officers accountable, it rarely leads to indictments or convictions. In 2015, only 15 officers were indicted on murder or manslaughter charges for on-duty killings of civilians ― and 10 of the cases involved video.That’s a sharp increase from the prior average of less than five indictments per year over 10 years. But still, no police officers were actually convicted on murder or manslaughter charges in 2015. North Carolina’s new law will go into effect on Oct. 1.Correction: A previous version of this story mischaracterized the prior legal status of police camera footage. The story was also updated after publication to include a statement from Frank L. Perry."

The group’s debut track hit No. 1 in multiple countries, catapulting a previously unknown band into the spotlight. “It was wonderful. You gotta be gracious,” lead singer Nasri Atweh (who professionally goes by Nasri) told The Huffington Post during a recent AOL Build. With the success, though, came a few haters, and the members of MAGIC! found themselves on the receiving end of criticism from some listeners simply tired of hearing the song.“It wasn’t fun when people said we sucked because we had a hit,” Nasri added. “It made no sense. But it made sense in a lot of ways because it’s everywhere and it’s annoying you. After a while and you keep hearing the song, you’re like, ‘I hate those guys!’” Even Nasri, who says the track originated from the “childish side” of his imagination, didn’t love the song at first. “I did not think that song was a hit ... I didn’t like it. I grew to like it more,” he said. “I started to appreciate the song that we had written ― like, ‘You know what? This is really fun and interesting. It’s got a nice twist and it’s making people feel good.’ And it grew on me.” Nasri says “Rude” was one of those “fictional” songs he tends to write, a few of which are on the group’s new album, “Primary Colors,” which surfaced earlier this month. “After having a song as big as ‘Rude,’ we kind of established an audience and that audience likes a little imagination and something catchy and fun. And for us, we have a few sides as a band,” Nasri said. “One side is a highly musical side as being educated musicians and the other side is a pop side ― a side that loves that simplicity, too. So this album has a little bit of both.”Those sides can be heard across the entire album ― from the fun ‘50s-inspired “Red Dress” to “No Sleep,” which Nasri wrote the day his son was born. “Whenever [I’m] writing something, I’m not sure which side of my personality is going to show up,” Nasri said. “Sometimes sarcasm shows up and sometimes it’s emotional credibility and sometimes it’s musical credibility.”MAGIC! hopes fans latch on to this new album.“We just have to be patient over the next two or three months and let it digest,” said Nasri.And as for those “Rude” skeptics? “You gotta accept positivity in your life. You can’t look at it as negativity,” Nasri said. Check out the AOL Build interview with MAGIC! below."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5783ff9c1a00002700dd0beb.jpeg?cache=RHThIxP88f&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Christian hip hop artist Lecrae has often been vocal about standing up for black lives on social media and beyond. And in the days since the police shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, the Grammy-award winning musician has once again used his social media presence to talk about systemic racism and the Black Lives Matter movement.On Instagram on Thursday, the father of three criticized his Christian fans who accuse him of spreading a “divisive message” and ask him to “just stick to the gospel.”“True faith stands up for the oppressed and the broken...” he wrote in a post. “Christians saying that ‘preaching the gospel is all we need’ ignores how sin affects infrastructures and societal systems. “If you ever trusted in anything I’ve said, if you’ve used my words to stir your hope or joy, then trust that same voice now,” he continued. “This is an epidemic that school books or church services haven’t taught you.”Read the full post below. Earlier in the week, the musician also tweeted that the freedom America celebrates on July 4 doesn’t apply to everyone. The tweet quickly went viral. In an op-ed about race relations he later wrote for Billboard, he explained his reasoning: “I posted a picture of slaves in a cotton field instead because that was the vantage point of my ancestors on July 4, 1776. They weren’t free.” The rapper, whose fan base reportedly includes many white evangelical Christians, wrote in the Billboard piece that many of his supporters were upset by that tweet. When Lecrae talks about race on social media, he often gets pushback from fans who claim he’s teaching a divisive message that is causing more racial tension. The comments in his posts are often littered with sentiments like “The race card needs to go, and Christ needs to be at the center,” or “How is saying that all lives matter selfish and rude?”But, the rapper wrote, “There’s a difference between creating division and exposing the division that’s being ignored.” For Lecrae, understanding begins with humility and with listening to voices you may not agree with. It takes humility, he writes, to hear another person’s vantage point and life story. “A lot of times, when you don’t have to deal with some of the circumstances that affect minority culture, you just don’t think they exist. This is a conversation I have with lots of my white friends all the time,” he wrote. “When I share my experiences with them, they’re like, ‘Oh. Really?’”Statistics show that there is a difference in the way white and minority Protestants perceive police brutality towards black lives. According to a 2015 study conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute, 57 percent of white evangelical Protestants believed the killings of black men by police in Ferguson, New York and Baltimore were “isolated incidents.” In contrast, 70 percent of minority Protestants ― including black, Latinx, Asian Pacific Islanders, and mixed-race Protestants ― agreed that these deaths are part of a broader problem and a pattern of injustice towards African Americans.From his advocacy online, it’s clear that regardless of the opinions of his critics, Lecrae is intent on doing his part to close this gap in understanding.“This is a moral issue across the board for humanity,” he wrote in the Billboard op-ed. “If you subscribe to any moral code that says you should care for humanity, obviously black people will fit into that category. So why would you not advocate for justice and truth unless you have something to lose?”"

They weren’t free.” The rapper, whose fan base reportedly includes many white evangelical Christians, wrote in the Billboard piece that many of his supporters were upset by that tweet. When Lecrae talks about race on social media, he often gets pushback from fans who claim he’s teaching a divisive message that is causing more racial tension. The comments in his posts are often littered with sentiments like “The race card needs to go, and Christ needs to be at the center,” or “How is saying that all lives matter selfish and rude?”But, the rapper wrote, “There’s a difference between creating division and exposing the division that’s being ignored.” For Lecrae, understanding begins with humility and with listening to voices you may not agree with. It takes humility, he writes, to hear another person’s vantage point and life story. “A lot of times, when you don’t have to deal with some of the circumstances that affect minority culture, you just don’t think they exist. This is a conversation I have with lots of my white friends all the time,” he wrote. “When I share my experiences with them, they’re like, ‘Oh. Really?’”Statistics show that there is a difference in the way white and minority Protestants perceive police brutality towards black lives. According to a 2015 study conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute, 57 percent of white evangelical Protestants believed the killings of black men by police in Ferguson, New York and Baltimore were “isolated incidents.” In contrast, 70 percent of minority Protestants ― including black, Latinx, Asian Pacific Islanders, and mixed-race Protestants ― agreed that these deaths are part of a broader problem and a pattern of injustice towards African Americans.From his advocacy online, it’s clear that regardless of the opinions of his critics, Lecrae is intent on doing his part to close this gap in understanding.“This is a moral issue across the board for humanity,” he wrote in the Billboard op-ed. “If you subscribe to any moral code that says you should care for humanity, obviously black people will fit into that category. So why would you not advocate for justice and truth unless you have something to lose?”"
41,THE WORLDPOST,Iran Indicts Renowned Canadian-Iranian Professor Homa Hoodfar,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/homa-hoodfar-iran-jailed_us_5783ad8fe4b0c590f7ea1b66,"Her niece says Iranian media is accusing the professor of ""fomenting a feminist revolution.""",2016-07-12,"Islamic scholars wrote an open letter to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, imploring him to intervene in Hoodfar's case.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578542161a000024006f9ffc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Canadian-Iranian anthropologist Homa Hoodfar, an expert in the study of women in Muslim societies, was indicted on unknown charges in Iran on Monday. The 65-year-old author and professor emerita at Montreal’s Concordia University now sits in Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison, while colleagues and family fervently campaign for her release.Iran’s indictment of Hoodfar and several other dual-nationals this week follows her arrest on June 6 after months of monitoring and questioning from security forces. Hoodfar had previously been set to leave Iran in March after a brief trip visiting relatives and conducting academic work, when family members say Revolutionary Guard officers seized the professor’s passports, along with her research papers and computer. Authorities repeatedly summoned Hoodfar for interrogation over the next few months ― asking questions including “Are you a feminist?” ― and barring her from leaving the country, according to Amnesty International. Despite the arrest and indictment, rights groups say Iran hasn’t released any official charges against Hoodfar. She has also been denied the ability to consult with her lawyer, Hoodfar’s niece Amanda Ghahremani told The WorldPost.“While the prosecutor makes this announcement through the media, neither Professor Hoodfar’s lawyer nor her family have been informed of the actual charges against her. Her lawyer has not had access to her file and has not been allowed to discuss the accusations with his client,” Ghahremani, who has a background in international law, said in an emailed statement.Since Hoodfar’s arrest, Iranian media has also accused her of “fomenting a feminist revolution,” Ghahremani told Canada’s CBC. Much of Hoodfar’s academic work has focused on the role of women in Muslim societies, including how Western depictions of Muslim women often propagate colonialist stereotypes. At the time of her arrest, Hoodfar was conducting historical research on women’s involvement in Iranian elections, according to Amnesty.Hoodfar’s arrest and indictment have led to an international outcry calling for her release. Statements from Hoodfar’s family and Concordia earlier this month both condemned her arrest as unconstitutional, and Amnesty International has listed her as one of its prisoners of conscience. An open letter from a dozen Islamic scholars to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also called for Hoodfar’s release and for the dismissal of all charges. Supporters have created a website and social media campaign using the hashtag “#FreeHoma” to lobby for her release.While Hoodfar holds Canadian, Irish and Iranian nationalities, Iran doesn’t recognize multiple citizenships. Canada also does not have formal diplomatic ties with Iran, although the country’s Global Affairs department has said that the case is a priority. Iran’s indictment of Hoodfar is part of a string of recent arrests of dual-nationals within the country, including three dual Iranian citizens on Monday.Analyst Haleh Esfandiari, who herself was imprisoned in Iran for 105 days in 2007, wrote in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal that these arrests “reflect a paranoia” about outside influence infiltrating Iranian society."

It was not clear whether they were the same incidents reported by the coast guard.Italy has been on the front line of Europe’s worst migration crisis since World War Two, which is now in its third year.More than 67,000 seaborne migrants had arrived in Italy by early July, according to the International Organisation for Migration, and 2,499 had died attempting the crossing.

Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai is spending her 19th birthday in Kenya Tuesday visiting the world's largest refugee camp to draw attention to the global refugee crisis, especially as Dadaab camp faces pressure to close after a quarter-century. (AP Photo/Khalil Senosi)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Malala Yousafzai was all about celebrating her birthday on Tuesday, but, as usual, wasn’t all that interested in presents or parties.The education advocate turned 19, and marked the milestone by visiting the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya, and speaking out for the girls who will be left with minimal options once the camp is shuttered. “We should not ask children who flee their homes to also give up their dreams,” Yousafzai said in her address on Tuesday. “We must recognize that the young people in this camp are future leaders on whom we will all depend for peace.”The U.N. declared the advocate’s birthday an international holiday, aptly called Malala Day. Last year, Yousafzai marked the day by opening a school for Syrian refugee girls. More than 350,000 people live in Dadaab, the largest refugee camp in the world, and the Kenyan government announced last month that it will be closing it, along with the country’s other refugee camps by next year. The refugees will most likely go to Somalia, a transition many of them fear due to the continued violence there.For young girls, going to the neighboring African country also comes with the added concern of losing out on learning opportunities.To underscore those fears, the Nobel Peace Prize winner shared a story about Rahma, a girl who arrived to Dadaab at 13 and had never been to school up until that point. Determined to learn, she enrolled in school, caught up with her classmates and eventually graduated from primary school.But when her family went back to Somalia last year, she couldn’t find another school to attend. Rahma’s father told her she couldn’t learn anymore, and demanded that she marry a man who was more than 50 years older than she.Rahma snuck out of her house and took an eight-hour bus ride back to Dadaab just so she could continue learning.Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban in Pakistan for speaking out for girls’ education, criticized the world for its lack of empathy for refugee children.“The world fails to recognize that it’s not these children’s fault that they are refugees,” she said.Yousafzai called on world leaders to make a greater investment in education for children living in conflict, an endeavor that would cost $8.5 billion a year.“The world can easily afford it,” she said, “and it is a great injustice that this money and more is not being spent to educate girls like Rahma.”Yousafzai joins a lenghty list of advocates who are fiercely opposed to the closing of Dadaab.“Moving ahead with a forced shutdown of the camps would create a humanitarian disaster of massive proportions,” Mark Yarnell, senior advocate at Washington, D.C.-based Refugees International, told the WorldPost last month. The government said the decision was motivated by the “very heavy” economic, security and environmental burdens of the camps. But the implications for the refugees who will be displaced could be catastrophic.“They should not be forced to move,” Yousafzai told the Associated Press. “I want to make sure that these girls don’t become a generation lost and there are alternative facilities for them to continue with their education.”"

Some background: In June, Australian Football League presidents Eddie McGuire and James Brayshaw made a horrendous joke about drowning female journalist Caroline Wilson. Fast forward to this week’s episode of “Q&A,” where an anti-violence activist asked the panel what they thought about the joke.Panelist Steven Price minimized the awful comments. “If you listen to that broadcast in context, it was a bunch of blokes laughing about things they shouldn’t have laughed about...I think far too much was then made of it,” he said.Fellow panelist Van Badham had a fiery response, calling Price out for dismissing what was a hugely problematic joke in a country where domestic violence against women is a very serious issue. (In fact, the anti-violence activist who had asked the question in the first place lost his sister in a gruesome murder at the hands of her male partner.) But in calling out Price, Badham endured a ludicrously sexist response that many women are all-too-familiar with: Price had to make the situation about him. “Don’t tar me with their brush,” he said.“This man has given us an extremely upsetting story about what happened and you are defending yourself in the context where we have to have a conversation about cultural attitudes that treat women differently,” Badham responded. But it actually got worse. Price decided that Badham was simply “being hysterical.”That’s right, folks. If you are a woman who speaks passionately about social issues that, for you, are literally life and death, you are hysterical. If you defend women from jokes about their own drowning, you are hysterical. If you try to get through a response without letting insistent manterruptions stop you, you are hysterical. On Tuesday, Badham wrote a passionate response to the incident for The Guardian. She wrote:Steve Price was making the discussion all about himself, his feelings, his concern that just because he was making excuses for Newman and Maguire, he might be “tarred with the same brush”.Badham is fortunately well-versed in fielding mansplanations ― she’s well-known for her epic eye-roll on live television earlier this year.

Italy's banking crisis is a problem for them all.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578520ac1a000023006f9f20.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When United Kingdom voters chose last month to leave the European Union, the popular wisdom was that it was an act of economic self-harm for Britain.Now it appears that the U.K. may be taking down the continent along with it.The so-called Brexit, or British exit from the EU, has provoked uncertainty that is hastening the crisis facing Italian banks. That, in turn, has European leaders worried about another continent-wide financial crisis.Italy’s major banks, including UniCredit and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, are teetering under the weight of the 17 percent of their loans that borrowers have stopped repaying. For some perspective, just 5 percent of Americans’ loans had gone bad at the height of the financial crisis in 2008-2009.As the Associated Press explains, the Brexit prompted concerns that a “slowdown in trade with Britain would only increase the bad loan problem” in Italy.The Wall Street Journal noted the Brexit “has compounded the strains on Europe’s banks in general and Italy’s in particular,” threatening to “spark a crisis of confidence in Italian banks.”As one expert told the outlet:“Brexit could lead to a full-blown banking crisis in Italy,” said Lorenzo Codogno, former director general at the Italian Treasury. “The risk of a eurozone meltdown is clearly there if Brexit concerns are not immediately addressed.”Having exhausted more conventional tools, including a “bad bank” to absorb the non-performing loans, the Italian government wants to bail the banks out. But the European Union, led by the continent’s powerhouse, Germany, has warned the Italian government that doing so would violate EU rules. They want Italy to do a “bail-in” instead, wherein banks take from borrowers’ deposits to shore up their balance sheets. But such a move risks provoking a run on banks, which would require even more extraordinary stop-gap measures.The crisis in Italian banks is not just about narrow economics. It is about whether the EU will continue to function as a political entity ― or if the Brexit is the first pulled thread in a slow unraveling of the world’s largest single market for goods and services.So far, Northern European nations have handled the Italian situation the way they dealt with the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath ― treating issues as the come up in a series of seemingly endless miniature emergencies. Germany, in particular, has been intent on disciplining the financially distressed Southern European nations to avoid future misbehavior, whether it’s the practical course of action or not.For example, the E.U deferred dramatic intervention in Greece’s debt crisis until the last moment in 2010, when the problem finally became unavoidable. Since then, it has pursued a policy of forcing Greece to take out new loans to pay off its old loans on steeper terms, with only a prolonged recession to show for it.Many observers in Greece last week said they think the Italian banking crisis is another breaking point for the old approach to punishment and austerity. The rise of various far-right movements across Europe suggests that this approach is not especially popular, they noted with a hint of vindication. "
