Sarsour is one of the civic and religious leaders who signed a letter declining an invitation from Mayor Michael Bloomberg to attend an interfaith breakfast in protest of recent revelations about the New York City Police Department's surveillance activities. (AP Photo/Henny Ray Abrams)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e6915e42600000223b62dd8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- A few years ago, the New York City Police Department was eager to infiltrate Brooklyn's Arab American Association. Leaked department files even proved that the police sought to place an informant on the board of the community group, which has been active in opposing NYPD surveillance.But when a man chased two of the association's employees down a busy street on Wednesday, shouting Islamophobic epithets and threatening a beheading, the cops were nowhere to be seen, according to the group's executive director, Linda Sarsour.Sarsour said that while she's grateful that the department brass swung into action after a chance meeting later that day, others in her situation shouldn't have to wait more than 45 minutes for help. Bay Ridge, where the association is located, has been roiled by a spate of anti-Muslim outbursts this summer.""This usually doesn't happen to community leaders -- it usually happens to ordinary people,"" said Sarsour. ""I called like any person who called 911 would.""Sarsour said she was leaving her group's headquarters in Bay Ridge on Wednesday shortly after noon when she noticed a man leaning up against its storefront. She had a bad feeling and asked her group's deputy director, Kayla Santosuosso, to call the police.But before the cops could come, ""the guy just gets up with tons of energy and starts chasing us down the street,"" she said. ""He's like, 'I'm going to cut your head off, so I want to see how your people feel about that.'""The man also lobbed a heavy city trash can at Sarsour and Santosuosso, Sarsour said. Neither were harmed.Sarsour, a well-known Muslim activist, wears a hijab, and she said she is ""100 percent"" sure it was an Islamophobic comment. ""What I was wearing -- obviously he knows I'm Muslim,"" she said. She also alleged that the man called her an ""Arab bitch.""After being chased, the pair fled to a business across the street and called 911 again, pleading for help.Thirty minutes passed, and the police still failed to show, Sarsour said. So instead, she went to them. According to Sarsour, she came upon two officers in a nearby bagel store who said they had been dispatched to her address.Sarsour said the pair gave her a ""lecture"" about what she should have said to the dispatcher. The officers finally came to talk to Santosuosso at the association office after waiting 17 more minutes.From the start, Sarsour had been on her way to a prearranged forum in Manhattan on police-community relations. When she got there, she recounted her story to four ""horrified"" NYPD deputy commissioners, she said. A hate crimes unit and community relations officers were dispatched.Police have arrested 45-year-old Brian Boshell in connection with the incident, NYPD spokeswoman Sophia Mason told HuffPost. Boshell has been charged with criminal possession of a weapon, two charges of menacing with a weapon, aggravated harassment as a hate crime, aggravated harassment, menacing as a hate crime, and menacing, Mason said.Mason told HuffPost that the officers Sarsour encountered in the bagel shop were not responding to the call for help.She could not explain why an officer did not respond more quickly to the original 911 call."

(Photo by Joel Auerbach/Getty Images) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb76c082400003100570425.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Many people who hoped Michael Sam would be the ""Jackie Robinson"" for LGBT inclusion in sports, a key civil rights issue of his generation, are disappointed that he was cut from the roster of the St. Louis Rams. While there are many variables in a decision to cut a high profile player, the root causes of Sam's release may be clearer than we dare admit. In the NFL, there are limits to inclusion. The problem lies in a conflict between Baby Boomers, who lead the teams, and Millennials like Sam, who know little of the bigotry that colors the perspectives and actions of older generations.By most accounts, Michael Sam should have been a shoe-in for a top draft pick, as the All-American and Southeastern Conference defensive player of the year. But Sam, who had taken the bold step of publicly announcing that he is gay prior to the draft, was selected 249th out of 256 picks by a team that didn't need him. Rather than being drafted by a team where he could shine, he was chosen as the last man on a deep and competitive defensive bench that rendered him superfluous from the start. The issue isn't why the Rams released Sam; the issue is why he wasn't picked up earlier in the draft. Some will claim homophobia on the part of team scouts, coaches and owners as the reason Sam was not drafted earlier by a suitable team; others will suggest that Sam undercut himself by ""coming out"" so publicly before landing a contract and proving himself on the field. Unfortunately, both may be true, but the issues are more nuanced. Sam's coming out was undoubtedly a bigger deal to Baby Boomers (born between 1946 and 1964), who run the teams and have long histories with societal limitations placed on individuals based on their sexuality than it was to Millennials (born 1981 or later), who don't share this history. Data show that just 38% of Baby Boomers versus 70% of Millennials support marriage equality, which is a good barometer of how the two groups are divided on social issues more broadly.Further, Millennials are substantially different than their parents. Millennials are more liberal in their thinking, and see big government as necessary to support society, two things that Baby Boomers generally reject. Millennials view ""coming out"" as living in truth, authenticity and wholeness. They largely reject the sense of hetero-normative privilege that undergirds American society. For many, the events of Ferguson, Missouri were a profound experience with our nation's underbelly of bigotry. The difference between the bias displayed in Ferguson and that of the NFL in dealing with Sam is that in Ferguson, this bias was more outwardly evident. In Sam's case, bigotry was silent, yet no less profound, facilitated by a decision not to sign a great pick because he's gay. Corporations understand that by 2020 Millennials will account for 88.5 million people in the U.S., far surpassing Baby Boomers, and that with such numbers Millennials will control the social and economic substance of the nation. By 2019, the earnings and spending of Millennials will outpace Baby Boomers in what will be a dramatic shift of economic dominance. The reluctance of suitable teams to engage Sam suggests that the NFL has not grasped the significance of America's changing demographics. Now the NFL faces a conundrum that corporate America has spent millions of dollars addressing over the past decade: How to adapt to the Millennial mindset.Sam, too, bears some responsibility for what happened. As a strategic matter, coming out prior to getting signed by and incorporated into a team was a mistake. His celebrity status exacerbated feelings that he was more focused on being a gay icon than a football player, for which he gained detractors. But Sam's biggest mistake may have resulted from his generational optimism that does not see bias where it sometimes exists, that believes in being authentic as elemental to living freely, and that sees diversity in all of its iterations as a social good. Yet, Sam could not be a Jackie Robinson because unlike Robinson, he had no ""Branch Rickey"" in a seat of power who was willing to put their professional standing on the line to make the NFL more inclusive. Robinson, through Rickey, was supported by a bold MLB, whereas Sam encountered a weak and conflicted NFL. The NFL should recognize that the degrees of separation between overt bigotry and unconscious biases may be few, and the effects equally harmful. If a team failed to draft Sam based on his sexual orientation, the team discriminated against him and should consider the rightness of its actions. Michael Sam should be celebrated for living in his truth and given every opportunity to pursue his dream on the field.To the NFL's credit, Sam has been signed by the Dallas Cowboys' practice team, and has another shot at integrating the NFL. For him to be a successful champion of LGBT inclusion in professional football, however, he must have a ""Branch Rickey"" who will have the courage to blaze new trails with him. Who in the Cowboys franchise will step into those shoes?"

JohnsonSept 4 (Reuters) - The Oakland Raiders have agreed to pay $1.25 million to settle a lawsuit brought by 90 members of the team's cheerleading squad who alleged they were underpaid or faced lengthy delays in receiving their wages in violation of California labor law.The settlement, which requires court approval, was announced by the Raiders and the Raiderettes in a joint statement on Thursday and followed similar suits filed since January by cheerleaders for several other National Football League franchises.The litigation has focused attention on the working conditions of NFL cheerleaders who, unlike professional football players, are not represented by a labor union.""The settlement will resolve disputed claims regarding payment for hours worked, including practices and appearances, expenses, interest, and penalties under the California Labor Code,"" according to the joint statement.The two sides said the class-action case was the first ever filed in the NFL challenging cheerleader pay practices.The settlement covers four seasons. It would pay an average of $6,000 to each Raiderette for each season she worked from 2010 to 2012, and $2,500 per cheerleader for those who worked in the 2013-2014 season.The original plaintiff, referred to in the lawsuit as Raiderette Lacy T., who worked last year, said the team had paid individual cheerleaders only $1,250 for an entire season and withheld wages until the end of the season.The Raiders, in July, offered its new cheerleading squad a contract that nearly tripled members' pay, the Los Angeles Times reported.In April, a wage theft lawsuit brought by five former cheerleaders with the Buffalo Bills prompted the cheering squad there to suspend operations for the team's upcoming season that starts this month.A lawsuit against the Cincinnati Bengals in February said individual cheerleading pay there was less than $2.85 an hour, significantly under Ohio's minimum wage of $7.85.One New York Jets cheerleader said in her lawsuit she and her teammates were paid a flat $150 fee for games in 2012 but were not compensated for practice time, travel time and other work, putting her compensation below the state minimum wage.A hearing on the Oakland settlement in Alameda County Superior Court is slated for Sept. 26.

He also raised the possibility of hot pursuit operations in Syria or assisting other rebels fighting IS there.British Prime Minister David Cameron, who failed to win parliamentary backing for military action in Syria last year, was more cautious about participating in armed action, saying: ""We are not at that stage yet.""The British public is deeply wary of foreign military intervention after London joined Washington in the 2003 invasion of Iraq based on false information about weapons of mass destruction. France, which opposed that operation, is more open to overseas action.Obama drew criticism last week for saying he had not yet developed a strategy for confronting the Islamic State in Syria, which has provoked public outrage in the West with the gruesome beheading two U.S. journalists.The United States stressed the need for a comprehensive approach in the talks on Friday and acknowledged that action against IS in Iraq would have implications in Syria as well.""We are going to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL, the same way that we have gone after al Qaeda,"" Obama said in some of his toughest comments since Washington began air strikes last month to halt the Islamists' advance in northern Iraq.""You initially push them back, you systematically degrade their capabilities, you narrow their scope of action, you slowly shrink the space, the territory that they may control, you take out their leadership, and over time they are not able to conduct the same kinds of terrorist attacks as they once could.""In an attempt to counter the threat of U.S. and European militants returning from the region to attack the West, NATO announced plans for allies to share more information on westerners fighting for the militants.A man with an English accent was filmed beheading the U.S. journalists and Britain raised its terrorism alert last week to its second-highest level over the threat posed by IS, meaning it assessed a strike was ""highly likely"". STRATEGY TIME?European officials said Cameron and Hollande, the leaders of Europe's main military powers, told Obama in private meetings that Washington had to do more than simply conduct air strikes on IS targets in Iraq and needed an overall strategy.""It can't be just 'let's go and bomb a few targets and see what happens',"" said one Western defense official familiar with the talks among allied leaders.A British official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ""There is a growing sense that this is going to take more than we are doing... but it needs to be a measured, cautious approach.""Though it was unclear how many nations would ultimately join Washington in supporting military operations in Iraq, Kerry and Hagel set out the limits of such action at a hastily arranged meeting in Newport - no land forces.""Obviously I think that's a red line for everybody here: no boots on the ground,"" Kerry told the meeting. Obama said Kerry would visit the Middle East to help build a broad-based coalition to tackle the militants.British and German ministers warned that it would be a long campaign to push the Sunni militants back after stunning gains they have made in Syria and Iraq, drawing volunteers from many countries including in the West.Kerry said he hoped the allies could develop a comprehensive plan for combating IS in time for this month's annual U.N. General Assembly session in New York.Turkey, which attended the talks, has been struggling to staunch a flow of foreign jihadists across its border with Syria. Hagel travels to Turkey next week.A statement issued by Hagel and Kerry after the meeting said the coalition would need to go after IS finances, including any trade in petroleum products, and discredit its ideology.

The violence comes as part of the mass demonstrations led by cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri and opposition politician Imran Khan that demand Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif resign. (AP Photo/Anjum Naveed)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13ce72400004f0024f038.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Mehreen Zahra-MalikISLAMABAD, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Weeks of mounting anti-government protests in Pakistan had been enough to convince five of the powerful army's 11 Corps Commanders that it was time for them to step in and force embattled Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to resign.According to a minister close to military circles, top generals met in the garrison city of Rawalpindi at the end of August as demonstrations raged in nearby Islamabad. Thousands of protesters had just tried to storm Sharif's residence.At the tense, four-hour conclave, Pakistan's democratic process was once again in peril, with the military pondering another intervention in a country that has seen power change hands more often through coups than elections.But army chief Raheel Sharif decided the time was not right to overthrow the civilian leadership, and moved to quell any disagreement in his ranks by overruling the hawks and declaring the crisis must be solved through politics, not force.Soon afterwards, the army issued a brief statement, reaffirming its commitment to democracy, and the threat of a coup, at least for now, had passed.The minister, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of discussing the inner workings of the military, said at least five generals had been pushing for weeks for the army to take a more ""active role"" in defusing the crisis.""The time for the army to be neutral is over,"" was how the minister summed up the message from dissenters around the table.Two military sources confirmed this version of events. They, like the minister, spoke on condition of anonymity.A senior security source added: ""Raheel Sharif is not interested in direct intervention. The tanks aren't going to come rolling in. This army believes in compromise.""The army's media wing confirmed Sunday's meeting but declined to share details. Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told Reuters the army was a ""monolithic institution"".""What comes out from the army is ultimately one opinion,"" he said. ""And ... they have supported democracy."" BIDING HIS TIME?General Sharif, who is not related to the prime minister, may simply be biding his time.If, with the help of tacit military support, Nawaz Sharif does manage to ride out twin protest movements led by cricketer-turned-opposition leader Imran Khan and activist cleric Tahir ul-Qadri, he is expected to emerge a diminished figure.It would allow the armed forces to assume greater control of policy areas they most covet - security and foreign policy - and leave it to civilians to face public anger over internal problems such as a faltering economy and widespread power cuts.A government insider told Reuters in August that Sharif had been assured by the military he would not be asked to step down and that there would be no coup. But in return his government would have to ""share space"" with the army.Under the agreement, Sharif would be subservient to generals on issues he had wanted to handle himself - the fight against Taliban militants, relations with arch-foe India and Pakistan's role in neighboring Afghanistan after NATO combat troops withdraw at the end of 2014.The army chief's cautious stance may have been linked to the strong show of support for the prime minister this month in parliament, where politicians lined up to back him.General Sharif also inherited the current team of commanders from his predecessor when he took over the top job last year, making him less secure of his position, insiders said.But with five top security officials due to retire next month, he has a chance to appoint his own men.""It's hard to imagine an army chief trying to actively intervene or do something drastic when he isn't 100 percent sure his team will back him,"" said a defense ministry source.""Next month ... he will have four of his own Corps Commanders. He'll have his own intelligence chief. Then he'll be a man to watch out for.""Spy chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, one of the five departing officers, was among those pushing for the prime minister's ouster, according to three senior government sources.""It is not the army but elements within the ISI that have been backing Imran to get rid of Nawaz,"" said one of the sources, referring to Pakistan's most powerful security body, the military's Inter-Services Intelligence agency.A senior ISI official said: ""It is baseless to say the ISI is involved, but the fact is that this government has not delivered. No one will support it unconditionally.""Khan, who like Qadri accuses the prime minister of rigging the 2013 election and demands that he steps down, denies acting on anyone's orders. HOPE QUICKLY FADEDA year ago, few would have predicted that Nawaz Sharif would be in such trouble.Back then, he had just swept to power for a third time in a milestone poll that marked nuclear-armed Pakistan's first transition from one elected government to another.But in the months that followed, Sharif, who crossed swords with the army in the past, moved to enhance the influence of the civilian government in a country ruled by the military for more than half of its brief and turbulent history.Sharif further irked the generals by putting former military head and president Pervez Musharraf, who ended Sharif's last stint in power in a 1999 coup, on trial for treason.His principle goals were to improve trade relations with India, convince Afghanistan that Pakistan would not meddle in its affairs and find a negotiated peace settlement with Islamist Taliban insurgents fighting against his rule.But with the more conservative-minded military back in the driving seat, it would be much harder for Sharif to deliver on the rapprochement with India that he promised Indian officials when he won the election.It could also affect how Pakistan emerges from a regional tussle for influence in Afghanistan once the majority of foreign soldiers serving there return home.""Nawaz is the biggest loser here,"" said a government official. ""Coup or no coup, the democratic transition has been badly disrupted."" (Writing By Mehreen Zahra-Malik; Editing by Mike Collett-White)"

[HuffPost]Democrat to challenge ruling - Alexandra Jaffe: ""Kansas Democrats were up in arms, and Taylor himself said shortly after Kobach announced his decision that he’s going to contest it, noting the fact he was told by an elections official the document he submitted Wednesday was sufficient to remove him from the ballot. 'I am planning to challenge the ruling of the Kansas Secretary of State, who serves on Pat Roberts’ Honorary Committee,' Taylor said in a statement...It’s still unclear what a legal challenge would entail, however, or how long they’ll have to file a complaint, but the window appears to be narrowing by the day. Kobach said Thursday that because military ballots have to be sent out 45 days before the election, and printing takes some time, 'everything has to be set by September 18.'"" [The Hill]Lessons from history - Daily Kos Elections blogger Taniel examines ""the recent history of comparable situations"" where the candidate drops out but their name remains on the ballot: ""My conclusion is that we shouldn't expect Taylor to get a significant percentage of the vote: Most voters desert candidates who have dropped out but whose name remains on the ballot. Most voters also abandon major-party candidates who have been clearly supplanted by a third-party or independent candidate, even when the major-party candidate continues campaigning. (While Taylor will cease his campaign, these cases are useful in providing an upper limit of what Taylor may get.) But these examples also signal that we should still expect Taylor to receive a small share of the vote, which could impact the outcome of the election if it is close."" [DailyKos]'So how do you poll this?' - That's what FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten asked of his followers on Twitter. HuffPollster put the same query to a set of campaign pollsters for both Democrats and Republicans via email. All agree that the first vote question should replicate the choices that voters will see on the ballot. Most also argue for additional probes to gauge where choices might be heading as voters learn that Taylor has dropped out of the race, but they differ on the best approach. Several said they would include some sort of informed vote explaining Taylor's status to try to anticipate facts that most voters will inevitably acquire. -Jon McHenry (R), North Star Opinion Research: ""I would ask a three-way ballot first: 'If the election for U.S. Senate were being held today and the candidates were (ROTATE: Pat Roberts, the Republican, Chad Taylor, the Democrat, and Greg Orman, an Independent) for which candidate would you vote?' Then I would ask: 'If the election for U.S. Senate were being held today and the candidates were just (ROTATE: Pat Roberts, the Republican, and Greg Orman, an Independent), for which candidate would you vote?' I think you have to take into account that Taylor will be on the ballot, but you also want to see where the ballot might be heading. Anyone polling the race is going to want to track the change on the three-way to see if Taylor drops to nothing as we get into October.-Mark Mellman (D), The Mellman Group: ""Tough situation....I'd probably do 2 horseraces....one just as it appears on ballot, first .....folks either know or don't that Taylor withdrew...then a second one where we say he has withdrawn but is on the ballot....and see how much difference there is."" -Nick Gourevitch (D), Global Strategy Group: ""I would ask 3-way straight up to get unbiased read (some voters may know Taylor withdrew but others will not and important to get a read without telling them). Then would say 'as you may know, Democrat Chad Taylor withdrew from the race but his name will still be on the ballot and you can still vote for him. Knowing this, who would you vote for?' This would simulate the effect of the electorate knowing that Taylor is out (as I would guess that Orman will likely try to communicate that to Dems). Then I might ask Taylor voters on a follow up who they would vote for if Taylor's name didn't appear on the ballot."" -Alex Lundry (R), Target Point: ""This is easy. If your name is on the ballot and there is an R or D next to it, then you're on my survey ballot.""-Celinda Lake (D), Lake Research Partners: ""This is a case where online polls and IVR [automated, recorded voice surveys] may be more accurate than phone polling. I might split sample the ballot and ask half the voters with the democrat named and half with the democrat only if someone volunteered it. This may be harder to poll right now and may be easier to poll later."" -Jon Anzalone (D), Anzalone Liszt Grove Research: ""I think you have to approach it that by the end of the election 95% of voters will know the Dem is out of the race. The Indie will communicate that, if not in broadcast, in the mail and paid phone and field program (especially if the Dem party gets involved). So given that I think I would address it in the intro. 'As you may know, there is a U.S. Senate race in Kansas this November. The Democratic nominee, Chad Taylor, recently announced he is withdrawing from the race. If the election where held today, for whom would you vote -- (rotate) Pat Roberts a Republican, Greg Orman, an Independent or Chad Taylor, a Democrat?' (I would leave him in just to see what he gets and if respondents ask about him would have them say 'Democrat Chad Taylor withdrew from the race but his name will still be on the ballot'). Then I would do a two-way with Roberts and Orman. Not perfect but Taylor will pick up some votes.""Enten got similar responses on Twitter:-Logan Dobson (R), The Tarrance Group (pollster for Pat Roberts): ""Put me on team poll the ballot. I want the results of the question that will actually be in front of them...if voters are informed, that'll show up in the results. no need to do it for 'em...the problem with asking an ""informed"" ballot on the poll is that not all the actual voters are going to BE ""informed"" in the voting booth"" [@LoganDobson here, here and here]-Dan Cassino , agreeing with Dobson: ""I'm with you - items [should] be as close to the ballot as possible.

[@skoczela]HOW KANSAS COMPLICATES SENATE PROJECTIONS - The possibility that independent candidate Orman could win in Kansas, and that Republicans could win a total of 50 Senate seats elsewhere, creates a special challenge for those attempting to quantify the probability of a GOP majority. To complicate things further, three prominent models are making different assumptions about what Orman might do in a stalemate scenario: -Josh Katz: ""The Upshot’s Senate forecasting model is shifting the Kansas Senate race from Solid Republican to Tossup, setting Mr. Roberts’s chances of losing his seat at 38 percent...Perhaps the greatest complication of all is that Mr. Orman has not specified which party he’d caucus with should he win. In a recent interview, he suggested that he’d join whichever party had the majority, and — for the time being — we’re using this assumption for the simulations in our Senate model. This is the reason we’re currently forecasting a slightly decreased likelihood of the Republicans’ ending up with 51 seats (which had previously been the most likely outcome in our forecast). Assume for a moment that Orman wins. If Republicans end up with 51 seats, then we assume Orman will caucus with the Republicans, giving them 52 seats. If Republicans end up with 50 seats, Orman’s intentions are not clear. We’re currently assuming that he’ll caucus with Democrats, given his previous history as a Democrat and that he is replacing the Democratic candidate as Roberts’s chief opponent, keeping the Republicans at 50 seats and — with Joe Biden’s tiebreaking vote — giving Democrats control of a split chamber."" [NYTimes]-Nate Silver: ""This is an extremely difficult race to forecast, but pending further information, our model gives Orman about a 45 percent chance of winning....What about that instance where Republicans are stuck on exactly 50 seats without Orman, while Democrats are at 49? In that case, Orman’s decision would determine Senate control. If he joined the Democrats, the Senate would be split 50-50 and Democrats would represent the majority party because of the tiebreaking vote of Vice President Joe Biden. If he joined the Republicans, they’d control the Senate 51-49. Our assumption is that there’s a 75 percent chance Orman will caucus with the Democrats should that situation arise. This is similar to the assumption we made for King two years ago."" [538]-David Jarman on the DailyKos Poll Explorer forecast: ""The switch to a two-way race between Roberts and Orman, where Orman has a 10-point lead, dramatically changes the trajectory of the Kansas race. Where the Democrats previously had a 5 percent shot of winning the race, they now have a 54 percent shot!...Here's where the modeling gets tricky, and it starts to cross over from mere poll aggregation into game theory...[under the scenario where] Democrats win 49 seats, Republicans win 50 seats...There's no 'clear' majority (in other words, if Orman throws in with the Democrats, the Dems will have a majority because of Biden; if he throws in with the Republicans; the Republicans will have a majority), and Orman needs to go one way or the other, unless fellow indie Angus King decides to leave the Dem caucus and join Orman on a two-person magical unicorn ride. Our model, awesome as it is, still can't predict Orman's state of mind, so in all 49 D/50 R scenarios, we're allowing Orman a 50 percent chance of caucusing with the Dems and 50 percent chance of caucusing with the GOP.""

But that has done nothing to boost overall economic optimism. For Americans, jobs are only part of the economic picture: 56% say their family’s incomes are falling behind the cost of living. That is about as many as said their incomes were falling behind in October 2008 (57%), during the Wall Street financial crisis. And 45% say they have experienced one or more serious financial hardships – such as a job layoff, an inability to pay for health care or trouble with a collection agency – over the past year. Among those with low family incomes (less than $30,000 a year), fully 66% have confronted at least one serious financial problem."" [Pew]OBAMA'S APPROVAL HITS 38 PERCENT ON GALLUP - As a handful of news outlets including the New York Post, The Washington Times, the Daily Caller and Breitbart note, this is tied with his record low rating, which Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport attributes partially to a string of foreign policy crises. [NYPost]Is it a 'blip'? - Jonathan Bernstein: ""BHO Gallup approval down to 38, post-2011 low (almost certainly just a blip, watch polling averages, etc.)...Unlikely he's dropped ~4 pts. Could certainly be indication he's dropped some."" [@jbplainblog]What the polling average says - HuffPollster's Obama approval chart shows Obama's approval so far remaining steady at just below 43 percent, even with the chart set to ""less smoothing"" to allow for the possibility of a sudden change. It also shows how tracking polls can vary on a day-to-day basis -- which is why an unusually high or low number, while it can be a sign of future change, may also be statistical noise. [Pollster chart]POLL FINDS ARKANSAS A DEAD HEAT - Mark Preston: ""Rep. Tom Cotton has a 2-point advantage over Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor in a new CNN/ORC International poll of the political knife fight for the U.S. Senate seat in Arkansas. Cotton's 49%-47% edge over the incumbent falls well within the survey's 4.5% margin of error, essentially making this race, which will help determine who controls the Senate, a dead heat two months before Election Day….The poll shows that each candidate is winning his party's traditional political voting blocs, except Cotton appears strong with a key subset of the national Democratic Party's most faithful supporters -- a data point that is likely to raise a red flag among party elders and strategists. While Pryor holds an 8-point advantage over Cotton with likely women voters overall, Cotton is favored by likely voters among white women by 11 points. Losing a key constituency to an opponent by such a large margin could be devastating."" [CNN]Previous surveys also show a close race - HuffPost Pollster's model, not yet include the CNN/ORC, gives Pryor a 53.8 percent chance, or essentially even odds, of winning.

(AP Photo/Mark Duncan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d50b1f000040022574a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A California bill that supporters say could have shifted campaign finance into a new era of transparency was instead involuntarily withdrawn last week -- and the activists behind the bill are blaming the labor unions that united against it.Authored by Democratic state Sens. Mark Leno and Jerry Hill and sponsored by the California Clean Money Campaign, Senate Bill 52, known as the DISCLOSE Act, failed last week in the state Assembly's final voting period of the legislative session. The bill would have required all political advertisements to prominently display the names of their three biggest funders, rather than allowing the contributors to conceal their identities and interests by hiding behind a front group with a vague name like ""Californians Against Higher Taxes.""""The California DISCLOSE Act is by far the strongest on-ad disclosure law in the country, stopping ballot measure ads from deceiving voters about who paid for them by hiding their original funders in fine print behind purposefully misleading committees and front groups,"" California Clean Money Campaign president Trent Lange told The Huffington Post on Thursday. ""It can be a model for the nation.""The bill was endorsed by more than 400 progressive groups, as well as by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the California Broadcasters Association, which hasn't supported a disclosure bill in two decades. Aside from the conservative Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, the only groups in opposition to the bill were labor unions, including two of the state's largest, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the California Teachers Association, Lange said.On August 14, after the labor unions had declared their formal opposition to the DISCLOSE Act, three of the 12 Democratic assemblymembers on the Assembly Appropriations Committee unexpectedly did not vote in favor of the bill. State Assemblyman Sebastian Ridley-Thomas (West Los Angeles) voted against it, while state Assemblymen Bill Quirk (Fremont) and Jimmy Gomez (East Los Angeles) abstained, a move that Lange called as good as a no.Although the bill still had the support it needed to move forward out of committee, it would not have passed with the necessary two-thirds support in an Assembly floor vote had Quirk or Gomez continued to abstain, so Leno and Hill withdrew it instead.Daniel G. Newman, president and co-founder of MapLight, a nonprofit that tracks spending and influence in politics, told HuffPost that when unions take a stance, lawmakers may vote in their favor to ensure their support.""Labor unions are one of the largest funders of political campaigns in California, and the SEIU and the California Teachers Association are among the biggest unions in the state,"" Newman said. ""If you want to win an election in the California legislature, you need to raise a lot of money, and the No. 1 place politicians get that money is from interest groups. So that means a Democratic candidate is dependent on union money to get elected or re-elected.""Ridley-Thomas and Gomez were not able to comment on their votes before the time of publication. A spokesman for Quirk's office said that Quirk supported the intent behind the bill but ""wanted additional time to consider the support and opposition arguments before committing his vote.""Why would labor unions unite so strongly against a bill calling for more transparency? In an undated letter to the California Assembly obtained by HuffPost, the SEIU warns that the process of obtaining and reporting information about who's funding ads could prove to be too costly for any but the most well-funded campaigns, and that the DISCLOSE Act would thus put smaller campaigns at a disadvantage.In another letter, obtained by Salon, the CTA reportedly argued that the DISCLOSE Act would violate free speech laws. On its website, the CTA suggests that campaign finance transparency is already sufficiently covered by the Political Reform Act of 1974.But those explanations aren't satisfying to the campaign finance reformers who backed the bill and who say they'd asked the unions to suggest an alternative approach.""People don't understand how organized labor leaders not only opposed SB 52, but declined for over a year to propose a solution that wouldn't allow original funders to hide behind layers of front groups,"" Lange told HuffPost, adding that the bill's authors even incorporated an additional 18 amendments at the suggestion of the unions. ""Everybody keeps asking us if that means that labor wants the ability to conceal this crucial information from voters, and I don't know what to tell them."" Neither the SEIU nor the CTA returned a request for comment.Whatever the motivation of the labor unions opposing the bill, Lange told HuffPost that the bill's failure to move forward will do a huge favor for corporations with more controversial interests at stake. He pointed to Prop 29, the failed 2012 measure to increase cigarette taxes, which he said had led two-to-one in state polls until $66 million in opposing ads went live with the fine print ""Paid for by Californians Against Out of Control Taxes and Spending."" The ads' actual funders were Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds Tobacco.Labor groups ""are supposed to stand up for the interests of regular working people, the vast majority of which support disclosure of the true identity of the largest donors to political ads,"" San Francisco activist Joni Eisen said in a email read on KALW radio on Tuesday. ""Why is labor on the side of the Koch brothers, big oil, big pharma [...] on this issue? What do they want to hide?"""

As Kohen notes, Rivers' humor was similar to the new, conversational style pioneered by Woody Allen and took cues from Phyllis Diller's self-deprecating one-liners, but she did it with style -- in a little black dress and pearls.""I wanted to be an actress. And when I would make the rounds to the agents, I would always make the secretaries laugh so they would remind the agent about me. Then someone said, 'You can make a little money, your'e funny. A friend of mine is a stand-up, they make $8 a night. You should go down and be a stand-up.' And I thought, 'How great, I can do that at night and make the rounds during the day.' And that's how I started in comedy.""As Joan continued to work on her comedic voice and did a brief stint at Chicago's ""Second City,"" she started to realize how different her act was from the standard material of the time, particularly in her rejection of the accepted notion of how a woman was supposed to think.""I was talking about having an affair with a married professor and that wasn't a thing a nice Jewish girl talked about. And I was talking about my mother, desperate to get my sister and me married. I was talking about my gay friend Mr. Phyllis, and you just didn't talk about that. It sounds so tame and silly now but my act spoke to women who weren't able to talk about things. How nice it was to have a girl that's fairly attractive stand up and say, 'My mother wants me to get married but I don't want to,' or 'I hated this date.'""As she hit her stride, she came to understand that she was part of a new wave of comedians who used the truth to their advantage, played up their own faults and insecurities and didn't rely on stagnant formats of the past.""And when I heard Lenny Bruce I suddenly realized, I'm absolutely on the right track here. I had seen Lenny Bruce very early on when I was on a date. He was just talking about the truth: he wasn't doing mother-in-law jokes, because he didn't have a mother -in-law. He was talking from his life experiences. I thought to myself, 'My God, he's doing what I""m doing.' I was talking about things that were really true.""For more of Joan in her own words and a thorough history of the American comedian, check out ""We Killed."""
