0,HEALTHY LIVING,Having Insomnia Might Mean Your Brain Works Differently,"Christopher Wanjek, Live Science",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/people-with-insomnia-may-be-wired-differently_us_570563d7e4b0a506064e0148,Blame the neural circuit of your personal sleep control.,2016-04-11,New research suggests impaired white matter tracts in the brain might be what causes restless nights for people with insomnia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5705728b150000ad000b4368.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To sleep, perchance to dream … and to keep your brain working: Scientists have long known about the importance of getting a good night's sleep to improve memory, learning and mental health.But the underlying cause of primary insomnia — a chronic inability to sleep soundly that's not associated with the use of stimulants, or medical disorders such as depression — has eluded researchers.Now, a small study comparing healthy participants to patients who have primary insomnia has found that the people with insomnia have weakened neural connections to and from the thalamus, the region of the brain that regulates consciousness, sleep and alertness.The researchers could not determine whether these weaker connections were the cause of the insomnia or the result of a chronic lack of sleep. But the work may offer important clues to the origin and treatment of the sleeping disorder, according to experts in the field who were not associated with the study.The results of the study were published online today (April 5) in the journal Radiology. [7 Strange Facts About Insomnia]More than one-quarter of the U.S. population reports an occasional inability to sleep well, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This type of insomnia can be caused by a host of factors interfering with sleep, such as drug use, stress, pain, allergies, Parkinson's disease and depression.But about 3 to 5 percent of adults have primary insomnia, according to a 2002 study by researchers at Stanford University. The diagnosis is based largely on ruling out known causes for the insomnia. Treatments include behavioral therapy, such as relaxation techniques. Doctors sometimes prescribe sedatives, but such drugs can become addictive or lose their effectiveness over time.In the new study, researchers in China examined 23 patients with primary insomnia and 30 healthy volunteers. All of the participants completed standardized questionnaires concerning their mental health and sleeping patterns. Each participant also underwent brain MRI with a specialized technique called diffusion tensor imaging, a sensitive tool that can probe deeper than the basic brain structure revealed by MRI to see how well neurons are connecting.The researchers' goal was to assess the connectivity of the brain's white matter tracts, which are ""bundles of axons, or long fibers of nerve cells, that connect one part of the brain to another,"" said Shumei Li, a researcher at Guangdong No. 2 Provincial People's Hospital in Guangzhou, China, and the lead author of the study. ""If white matter tracts are impaired, communication between brain regions is disrupted.""And that is what the researchers may have found among the patients with primary insomnia. Compared to the healthy participants, the insomnia patients had significantly less white matter integrity in several right-brain regions and the thalamus, which houses ""important constituents of the body's biological clock,"" Li said.The extent of these abnormalities in the thalamus and connected regions was associated with the duration of the patients' insomnia and their self-rated scores on the depression scale, Li said. The worse the neural connections, the worse the sleep and depression.Dr. Max Wintermark, a professor of radiology at Stanford School of Medicine in Stanford, California, who was not part of the study, said the research was important for understanding the cause of primary insomnia but that ""it must be taken with a grain of salt.""The MRI-based diffusion tensor imaging technique can be affected by numerous factors, such as the age of the patient and the type of MRI machine, Wintermark told Live Science. ""We don't fully understand normal variation in the scanning,"" he said, adding that the technique is still only used as a research tool, not for diagnostics in the clinic.Wintermark said he would be interested in seeing a larger study based on these results, particularly to see whether the white matter tracts improve with treatment for insomnia.Li said that one of the limitations of her team's study was that it was too small to determine cause and effect or whether abnormalities in white matter tracts can be reversed. She, too, would like to follow a larger group of patients before and after treatment to see if the white matter tracts improve as the insomnia improves, she said. [5 Things You Must Know About Sleep]Li sees her group's work — overseen by Dr. Guihua Jiang, a researcher at the same hospital — as promising but in the early stages. The study results hint that the underlying cause of white matter abnormalities may be a loss of myelin, the protective coating around nerve fibers.""The mechanism underlying insomnia [and] sleep is quite complicated,"" Li told Live Science. ""The exact neural circuit of sleep control still needs to be further investigated by other techniques in terms of function and neurophysiology.""Follow Christopher Wanjek @wanjek for daily tweets on health and science with a humorous edge.

If her dazzling performance at “Broadway Backwards” on March 21 is any indication, the two-time Tony Award winner will be back with the same vigor and vim that’s made her a star for over 60 years when she takes the Carlyle stage April 19. “An Evening of My Favorite Songs,” she said, is very much a “trip down memory lane” through her beloved turns in the original casts of “West Side Story,” “Bye Bye Birdie,” “Chicago” and, most recently, “The Visit.” With such a wealth of material to draw from, Rivera hopes the intimate space will cast many of the best-known songs from those musicals in a new and thrilling light.“I’ve been fortunate enough to work with some of the greatest in the business. It’s wonderful to go back and revisit these pieces, and hopefully we’ll bring some nice memories back to the audience,” she told The Huffington Post.It’s been almost a year since Rivera was last seen on Broadway in “The Visit,” John Kander and Fred Ebb's dark, challenging musical that faced its share of struggles during its 15-year journey to the Great White Way. Rivera’s co-star, Roger Rees, withdrew from the production because of an illness just weeks before it closed in June 2015; he died July 10.Still, most reviews of “The Visit” offered praise for Rivera, who starred as a wealthy widower seeking deadly revenge on a former lover who betrayed her. She remains hopeful that she’ll be a part of a future incarnation of the musical, possibly in Europe.“It’s had its hard time, but what director John Doyle and the cast did with that show was just so wonderful. It’s an amazing story and, very much, the subject of today,” she said. “It’s very European. They don’t put dimples in cheeks and chins; they just tell it like it is. I like stirring up people’s feelings like that.”As she looks to the future, Rivera said she only hopes to “pick my feet up, put them down, and wake up every morning breathing and laughing.” She’d also love to work with “Hamilton” creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda, who she called “a great theater person and a very bright man.”There are, of course, other things on her mind, too. Pointing to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, she said, “I would like very much for this world to attempt to straighten itself out a little bit. There are many more important things to think about than my career at this point. There are too many things to pray for, and that’s a big one.”As to what keeps her motivated after 60 years in show business, Rivera said, “Everything – absolutely everything.

Every year, hundreds of thousands of people flock here to enjoy the week, but it’s hard to understand what’s really worth seeing around the city among the 1250 events of the Fuorisalone. Here is a rational guide to the most interesting installations, divided by area.5 VIE People go to this district between Via Santa Marta, Via Sant’Orsola and Piazza Affari to get lost in its warren of workshops, stores and botteghe, and to see what happens when traditional craftsmanship meets contemporaneity. Because of this, it has become the symbol of the Doppia Firma district, at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana (Piazza San Sepolcro 1), that has involved designer and art masters tied to the Cologni Foundation. Together they have created a collection of 16 pieces that translate ancient materials and techniques into contemporary forms (they will then be sold on Yoox.com). “Tradition and technology” is also the theme of the collective exhibit at the Palazzo Litta, which will stage an African village 2.0 conceived by Francis Kéré. Be sure not to miss the exhibit at the Palazzo Turati, Via Meravigli 7: this magnificent residence (never open to the public) will showcase the works of 125 Dutch designers in a surprising dialogue with Flemish artwork. At Rossana Orlandi (who also did the interior design of a penthouse in the Libeskind Residences at CityLife, which can be visited by appointment), there will be a parade of talents (be sure to check out Anotherview, digital windows that present a different landscape every day).BRERA This is the area of the showroom of the big brands (if you walk from Via Solferino to Via Pontaccio you’ll find “cult” names like Boffi, MissoniHome Flaminia, Agape, Kerakoll and UnoPiù Moroso, to name only a few). But Brera has always been the city’s creative heart as well, where the focus is experimentation. So here you’ll find the very talented students from the ECAL in Lausanne with “When Objects Dream” in Via dell’Orso (a project that draws us into the “psychology of objects” to call their role into question in a connected future), the Danes from Mindcraft at the Circolo Filologico at Via Clerici 10 (the exhibition, curated by GamFratesi, the winners of last year’s Milano Design Award, stages a huge brain in which every creative field contributes to an ensemble that is greater than the sum of its parts) and the collective exhibition between high-tech and hightouch by the Atelier Clerici, curated by Space Caviar (Via Clerici 5).Lastly, it is worth exploring “50 Manga Chairs” by Nendo at the Chiostro Minore di San Simpliciano, with 50 chairs by Japanese designers made for the Friedman Benda gallery in New York.PORTA VENEZIA The opening of one of Milan’s “secret” places is the main attraction of the Porta Venezia In Design area. The main draw here—because it has been closed since the Nineties—is the Albergo Diurno (inaugurated in 1926 and now being restored). Not only because this is a unique opportunity to see a treasure designed by Piero Portaluppi (who also designed the magnificent Villa Necchi, also close to Porta Venezia, where “Back Ahead – New Austrian Design Perspectives” is being staged), but also because of the project it is hosting: a collection of objects made by the young designers of the Creative Academy (a school in the Richemont group) using evocative but overlooked materials like natural sponge, soap and honeycomb fabric. The second is the Palazzo Serbelloni, where Lasvit is presenting Via Lucis, light sculptures in glass designed by visionaries such as the digital guru Moritz Waldemeyer, the interior designer Andre Fu and the fashion designer/artist Maurizio Galante (trivia alert: the installation will be on the Napoleonic floor of the building, where Napoleon stayed).LAMBRATE As always, you go to Ventura Lambrate to see new talents fresh out of school, along with the most daring experimentation, often blended with high-tech concepts. The symbolic event is “Poetry – 21 words for...” organized by Logotei. The theme is poetry+design and on stage we will see a machine that prints words on sand, hybrid materials that grow on the skin of those who wear them and architectures made entirely of fabric. The Design Academy of Eindhoven (at the Lavanderia at Via C. Arrighi 10) proposes reflections on the subject of touch (curated by Ilse Crawford and Thomas Widdershoven). Be sure not to miss the garages of Via Ventura and Via Massimiano, where hundreds of young designers are showing their works for the first time.ZONA TORTONA The district that is the very emblem of the Fuorisalone has plenty to offer: from well-known designers to emerging ones (at the Spazio BASE in Via Bergognone, with FabLab of OpenDot and DesignersBlock, and at Opificio31 with the young Chinese from Oo! China organized by Sarpi Bridge). Among the stars are the Dutch artists Maarten Baas, one of the most sought-after international talents in design art (at Via Savona 33), and Marcel Wanders with Moooi, who at Via Savona 56 is staging blowups of the photographer Rebecca Bathory used as a background for his furnishings.

7,WOMEN,Man-Free Uber Alternative Hits The App Store This Month,Jenavieve Hatch,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/man-free-uber-alternative-hits-the-app-store-this-month_us_5707ed3ae4b04bf520ff5d7d,"Ladies, your Chariot for Women has arrived.",2016-04-11,Nervous about taking an Uber? Chariot for Women has your back. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570813232e00006400950ce9.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new women-only ride share app is launching in an effort to offer a safer transportation alternative for women.Chariot for Women launches on April 19, and will work in the exact same way as GPS-based ride shares like Uber and Lyft -- with one major difference: only women will be able to drive, and only women and children are able to be passengers.The app was created by Michael and Kelly Pelletz, a married couple whose income depended on Michael's driving for Uber after the crumbling of his family business. According to the Chariot for Women website, as a driver, one experience left Michael particularly unsettled: He picked up a young man in his 20s, who he soon realized was seriously inebriated and who became somewhat aggressive. Michael nervously sought help from a police officer. ""How would a woman handle that situation, especially when I was so nervous myself?"" Michael wrote.Earlier in his Uber driving career, his wife told him that she would like to drive as well, but was too nervous and scared to do it. With this in mind, and shortly after his first ""unsafe"" Uber experience, the couple decided to develop the app and connected with an eager business partner who helped them bring it to market.The drivers' identities on Chariot for Women are confirmed with background checks via Safer Places, Inc., in addition to random daily background checks. ""As a ride share driver, driving for another ride share service once you pass the lenient screening, you could get a DUI a week later and no one would know,"" Michael told The Huffington Post. The random daily background checks are an extra step to ensure the safety of anyone getting into the car. Uber, a leader among ride share apps, currently has a catalogue of thousands of sexual violence-based complaints in its customer service system, according to a BuzzFeed News report last month. BuzzFeed acquired screenshots of Uber's internal data that showed that 6,160 complaints came up under the search term ""sexual assault,"" and 5,827 complaints came up with the term ""rape.""According to Michael, people are looking for an alternative, so the demand for an app like Chariot is there. ""I started this company eight weeks ago and we have had tremendous response from across the globe. We have literally hundreds and hundreds of women signing up daily. Four days ago over 1000 drivers applied in one day,"" Michael told HuffPost. And Chariot for Women not only aims to make ride sharing safer for passengers, but levels the playing field for women who are looking to make an extra income by driving at night -- something that could otherwise pose a safety risk with Uber or Lyft. The incentive is definitely there. ""Drivers will have the ability to earn a very nice income as we cap how much we take per day,"" Michael said. Chariot keeps 25 percent of the first $100 -- but after the first $100, only keeps two percent of the remaining fares for the rest of the day. An added bonus, two percent of every trip's fare will go directly to a charity that benefits women. ""Before the passenger can request a ride they have to choose where the two percent goes,"" Michael told HuffPost. Passengers will have a choice of 10 charities from which to choose. ""This company is like a baby to my wife and I,"" Michael said.

8,WOMEN,Man-Free Uber Alternative Hits The App Store This Month,Jenavieve Hatch,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/man-free-uber-alternative-hits-the-app-store-this-month_us_5707ed3ae4b04bf520ff5d7d,"Ladies, your Chariot for Women has arrived.",2016-04-11,The app will launch for iOS and Android users on April 19. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5707fa851e0000b3007068f8.png?cache=LCRgMp9vwU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new women-only ride share app is launching in an effort to offer a safer transportation alternative for women.Chariot for Women launches on April 19, and will work in the exact same way as GPS-based ride shares like Uber and Lyft -- with one major difference: only women will be able to drive, and only women and children are able to be passengers.The app was created by Michael and Kelly Pelletz, a married couple whose income depended on Michael's driving for Uber after the crumbling of his family business. According to the Chariot for Women website, as a driver, one experience left Michael particularly unsettled: He picked up a young man in his 20s, who he soon realized was seriously inebriated and who became somewhat aggressive. Michael nervously sought help from a police officer. ""How would a woman handle that situation, especially when I was so nervous myself?"" Michael wrote.Earlier in his Uber driving career, his wife told him that she would like to drive as well, but was too nervous and scared to do it. With this in mind, and shortly after his first ""unsafe"" Uber experience, the couple decided to develop the app and connected with an eager business partner who helped them bring it to market.The drivers' identities on Chariot for Women are confirmed with background checks via Safer Places, Inc., in addition to random daily background checks. ""As a ride share driver, driving for another ride share service once you pass the lenient screening, you could get a DUI a week later and no one would know,"" Michael told The Huffington Post. The random daily background checks are an extra step to ensure the safety of anyone getting into the car. Uber, a leader among ride share apps, currently has a catalogue of thousands of sexual violence-based complaints in its customer service system, according to a BuzzFeed News report last month. BuzzFeed acquired screenshots of Uber's internal data that showed that 6,160 complaints came up under the search term ""sexual assault,"" and 5,827 complaints came up with the term ""rape.""According to Michael, people are looking for an alternative, so the demand for an app like Chariot is there. ""I started this company eight weeks ago and we have had tremendous response from across the globe. We have literally hundreds and hundreds of women signing up daily. Four days ago over 1000 drivers applied in one day,"" Michael told HuffPost. And Chariot for Women not only aims to make ride sharing safer for passengers, but levels the playing field for women who are looking to make an extra income by driving at night -- something that could otherwise pose a safety risk with Uber or Lyft. The incentive is definitely there. ""Drivers will have the ability to earn a very nice income as we cap how much we take per day,"" Michael said. Chariot keeps 25 percent of the first $100 -- but after the first $100, only keeps two percent of the remaining fares for the rest of the day. An added bonus, two percent of every trip's fare will go directly to a charity that benefits women. ""Before the passenger can request a ride they have to choose where the two percent goes,"" Michael told HuffPost. Passengers will have a choice of 10 charities from which to choose. ""This company is like a baby to my wife and I,"" Michael said. ""I am truly humbled by the response from not just women, but from the hundreds and hundreds of men thanking me for giving them the peace of mind knowing their wife, mother, daughter, grandmother, friend will now be able to travel in the safest way available in the industry."" Here's hoping. "
9,POLITICS,Here's What It's Like To Lose An Election By 4 Votes,Sam Stein and Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/closest-election-history_us_57091e67e4b0885fb50d40e3,Spoiler: It sucks.,2016-04-11,"Grier Hopkins, with the Karl Kassel campaign, left, and Ben Brown, with the Republican Party, center, watch as Becky Weimer with the State Division of Elections counts votes at the Division of Election office in Juneau, Alaska Tuesday Dec. 9, 2008. Kassel lost the election by just two or four votes (depending on who's counting). Needless to say, there was a recount.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are a few ways that a candidate for public office can brutally lose an election. You can be caught in a sex scandal -- physical or online -- forcing you from the race under an avalanche of moral judgement. That certainly isn't a fun way to suffer defeat, as Anthony Weiner can attest. Another terrible way to lose would be to get caught cheating, either during or after the fact. Going to jail because you broke campaign finance law is not, exactly, enjoyable or good for one's career goals. Jeff Smith has written a book about it.Absent incarceration and humiliation, however, the most excruciating loss that you can suffer in politics is to lose by an incomprehensibly small margin. Close defeats gnaw on the losing candidate's psyche and can lead them to replay certain moments from the trail, wondering what the butterfly effect would have been if they'd just knocked on a few more doors or kissed a few more babies or called third cousins and asked for their vote.Former Vice President Al Gore to this day doesn't really talk much about his 2000 election defeat. We know. We've tried to interview him about it. But there are others who have suffered even closer losses than Gore.Karl Kassel ran for state house in Alaska in 2008. Out of the about 10,000 votes cast, he came up two or four short, depending on who is doing the counting. It was one of the closest elections in American political history. And, really, there isn't much room for another election to claim that honor. In his interview on this week's episode of our ""Candidate Confessional"" podcast, Kassel relived his run for office -- from the trail to the night of the first certification, when he was down by just one vote, 5,018 to 5,017 -- and the recount that took place after. In the process, he explained all the accompanying drama, emotion and, ultimately, heartache that comes with getting this close to winning, only to fall short. ""It was hard. It was hard on all of us,"" he said. ""I felt like I let [my staff] down. That I should have done more. I should have knocked on one more door. I should have written one more letter. ... Two votes, please. You can think of a thousand ways to make up two votes. And, you know, I felt like I had really let down these people who had worked so hard.""Listen to the podcast above, or download it on iTunes.

10,QUEER VOICES,"T.R. Knight Sounds Off On Backlash To Equality, New Projects",Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tr-knight-backlash-equality_us_5708fbeee4b01422324922eb,"He says working with James Franco is ""the cherry on top of the cherry on top of the cherry.”",2016-04-11,"""I think the more people come out, [the more it] changes it. Every single time somebody comes out, it changes, I feel.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570bd0d9150000ee010b4876.jpeg?cache=E5ZxJw017h&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"T.R. Knight winces just a little bit when he hears himself described as “brave” for having come out as gay back in 2006 while he was co-starring in ""Grey’s Anatomy""— a time when there were far fewer television actors who were out. Knight had been the subject of anti-gay slurs uttered by ""Grey’s"" co-star Isaiah Washington — infamously referred to in the media as “Isaiah-gate” — and as the story went public Knight felt compelled to be honest.“I hear that word [brave] and, with all due respect, it's hard for me to hear that because it was just — I had to do what I had to do for me,” he said in an interview with me on SiriusXM Progress. “To me it was — that decision was pretty clear.”Ten years later Knight is winning accolades for his performance in the critically acclaimed ""11.22.63,"" an eight-part Hulu ""event series"" based on the Stephen King novel and starring James Franco as a high school teacher who goes back in time to stop the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Knight reflected with me on his life and career over those ten years as well as on the enormous progress on LGBT rights that has occurred.""I think it's wonderful that things have changed so much in such a short amount of time.” he said. “I am married now because we can — it's legal! I think it's long overdue."" But it's disheartening, he emphasized, to see a backlash — not just to LGBT rights, but in so many areas with regard to social justice.""Obviously there's still so much to change, but you know, it’s difficult because it's so frustrating at times,"" Knight said. ""It's hard to see and appreciate how much change there is sometimes because I consider the struggle for equal rights for gay people — it’s thrown in with misogyny, that's thrown in with racism, that's all kind of part of this bag. And as excited and happy as I am that finally we have the right to get married, to also to be facing what we're facing politically, and hearing every day on the news, recently, with all of this bile coming out of people's mouths, it's really hard... But I think there are bigots everywhere.”""And [the bigotry] is getting a platform that I'm hoping will force discussions and we'll have an outcome that is much better than it seems at times,"" he continued. “I like it when there are pops of moments, when equality for women or for the races or for gay people or for transgender people — it's amazing when those moments pop. You're feeling like you're living in a world that makes sense to me. And it's kind of hard to understand something else.”Regarding homophobia in Hollywood, Knight believes that despite his experience in 2006 with Isaiah Washington he’s been fairly insulated from bias because he’s a character actor.""Without sounding Pollyanna, I have never been told if [homophobia has [prevented me from being cast],"" he said. ""So I have no idea if it has. Also, I'm not -- I do think it's different for character actors. I think we've got maybe a little farther way to go, but I think things are [also] changing for people who maybe, like, you know, happen to be molded and have very movie-star looks. I think the more people come out, [the more it] changes it. Every single time somebody comes out, it changes, I feel.”Knight's been ecstatic about his role in ""11.22.63"" and portraying the very dark character of salesman Johnny Clayton, a spurned husband who faces off with James Franco’s character, Jake Epping.“You could tell right away that it was one of those exciting roles that you probably won't get,"" he recalled of auditioning for the part. ""But you are so happy to just get to audition for it, and then it's all happened. At the risk of sounding trite, it’s still one of those projects that I can't believe I was able to be a part of.”Working with Franco, who's become an icon for many gay men because he often challenges homophobia and breaks down barriers, is, Knight enthused, “the cherry on top of the cherry on top of the cherry.”""He's just very respectful and he's a great guide,"" Knight observed of Franco, who also directed one episode of ""11.22.63."" ""He has the soul of an artist and he happens to be a movie star. And, often times, they don't always go hand-in-hand. I think he's a fascinating combination. His support of his projects is pretty outstanding.”As the Hulu limited series comes to an end, Knight's already been cast in a new project for ABC, ""Broken,"" a drama series pilot co-produced by Reese Witherspoon and starring Anna Paquin, who herself came out as bisexual in 2010. ""Talk about dark -- it's called 'Broken,' which a lot of the people in it are -- the characters, not the actors,"" he explained with a chuckle. ""It's so cool to get a script you're just really excited about. And especially to go from '11.22.63' and then have this be the next -- I dunno, I think I'll wake up soon from this dream."""
11,POLITICS,How Volunteers Helped Families Trapped In Immigrant Detention Centers,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/family-immigrant-detention-volunteers_us_57081462e4b0885fb50d202a,They didn't want vulnerable women and kids to go through a difficult process alone.,2016-04-11,Detained immigrant children line up in the cafeteria at the Karnes County Residential Center.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Until last August, Andrés Abella had never been away from his children for more than two days. He hadn't visited a family immigrant center, and, as a journalist by training who now works for a nonprofit, is not an attorney. But he felt drawn to volunteer for a grueling week at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, where he could assist legal teams providing services to immigrant women and children who were locked up there. The Chilean native took time away from his job at the Catholic Legal Immigration Network to help with translation, paperwork and anything else needed for families seeking asylum in the U.S.It was a striking experience for him, particularly knowing his 5- and 7-year-olds were back home, able to go wherever they wanted. ""Being away from your family and seeing all these little kids -- at one point it hit me hard,"" he said.Abella is part of a massive effort to bring in volunteers -- attorneys, legal assistants and more -- to help women and children in immigrant detention centers. More than 700 volunteers have traveled to facilities in Texas to work long hours for at least a week, helping nearly 8,000 families start the process to seek asylum, according to the CARA Pro Bono Project. The attorneys and other volunteers have donated more than $6.75 million of their time, the group estimated -- a staggering figure for what they say is a staggering problem: women and children being held in immigrant detention. ""To me, it's really sad that we're having to do this at all, because family detention is not something that should even exist,"" said Dree Collopy, an attorney who visited the Texas facilities in February. Immigration officials opened a temporary family detention center in Artesia, New Mexico, in June 2014, during a surge in the number of families and unaccompanied minors being apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border. Detaining families in mass numbers was a break from past Obama administration policy -- early in his presidency, the administration shut down the controversial T. Don Hutto Residential Center, infamous for putting children behind barbed wire fences. The only family immigrant detention center left as of early 2014 was a 100-person facility in Pennsylvania. The 2014 border crisis led to a huge upswing in the number of women and children held in immigrant detention. Many of them were and still are seeking asylum from their native countries in Central America.Few of them had legal representation to navigate the complicated laws to get relief -- it's not guaranteed in immigration proceedings, even for unaccompanied children. Women and children are far more likely to be ordered for deportation if they do not have representation, according to a 2015 report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.The pro bono effort to help families in detention started with Artesia, where the American Immigration Lawyers Association organized volunteers who traveled there, usually on their own dime, to meet with the women and children, and help them present their cases. Collopy canceled a vacation in September 2014 -- it would have been her first in about a year and a half -- to go to Artesia instead. ""As someone who has the legal skills and the language skills to help these women and children, I feel that morally I have to do my part by going down there and using those skills to help them,"" Collopy said. The Artesia facility closed, but family detention moved elsewhere: to new centers in Dilley and Karnes, Texas. The pro bono work moved there, too, and the CARA Project was announced on March 31, 2015.Its work hasn’t stopped since, despite some legal and policysteps toward reducing family detention. The administration is continuing to back family immigrant detention, although it has worked to get women and children out of the centers more quickly, and might make other reforms.CARA is a joint project of four groups: Catholic Legal Immigration Network (CLINIC), the American Immigration Council, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES), and the American Immigration Lawyers Association.They arrange for attorneys, paralegals, social workers, translators, medical workers, teachers and others to go to Texas for a week or more to assist families in detention. Volunteers arrive on Sundays and go through a training and then are in the detention center around 7:30 a.m. on Monday, telling women what CARA does, helping them fill out paperwork and getting their stories. If attorneys believe the women have a case for credible or reasonable fear to pursue asylum -- as they say is most often the case -- they prepare them for interviews with immigration agents, and help them appeal if they are denied. More than 90 percent of women they work with are approved to move forward with their asylum claims after their credible fear interview, said Katie Shepherd, the managing attorney of the CARA project at Dilley.She and a handful of other CARA staffers live in a house together in Dilley -- another works down the road -- and work most of the time: half days on Sundays, and often 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. or 11 p.m. every weekday. It's not just the long hours that are difficult for both volunteers and staff, it's also the pace and the number of cases, Shepherd said.""I look at the volunteers sometimes by Friday and I'm like, 'Holy crap, is that what I look like every day?'"" she said. ""We put them to work, for sure."" She came to Dilley for the first time last September, while she was based in Houston and working in private practice. She started going to the detention center about every other week, and started working for CARA full time in December. ""To me, this is the front lines of refugee and asylum work, so it makes sense to me to be here,"" Shepherd said. ""This is why I went to law school; this is the population I want to represent.""The groups estimated that lawyers had donated nearly 20,600 hours, which works out to about $5.15 million in billable hours at a rate of $250 per hour, a number they came to using the median from a 2011 study from the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Non-lawyers worked about 21,400 hours and, assuming an average pay of $75 per hour — likely low for some of the volunteers, according to organizers — donated an estimated $1.6 million in time.The need still outweighs the amount of assistance, though, Abella said. ""With all of the resources we're trying to pull together to this effort,"" he said, ""it never seems that we have enough people helping, because it's way too many people [being detained].""-- -- --"

13,BUSINESS,Verizon Workers To Strike This Week If They Don't Get A Contract,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/verizon-strike_us_570c1557e4b0885fb50e080a,It would be the biggest U.S. strike since 2011.,2016-04-11,"The same workforce now threatening to strike went on strike in 2011, in what was the largest worker strike since 2004. That strike lasted two weeks.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570c15e2150000ad000b492e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Labor unions representing 40,000 Verizon workers say they will carry out the largest U.S. strike in five years if they can't reach a deal with the company by Wednesday.The workers are members of the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Mostly technicians and customer service reps on the East Coast, their last contract expired in August.The unions say that negotiations have stalled as the company seeks concessions at the bargaining table. Bob Master, a CWA official, said the union is concerned about a lack of layoff protections for newer workers in the proposal, and the possibility that employees could be required to work far from home for two-month spells, among other sticking points.In a statement, Marc Reed, Verizon's chief administrative officer, said the company was committed to the bargaining process, ""but now union leaders would rather make strike threats than constructively engage at the bargaining table."" (The Huffington Post's parent company, AOL, is owned by Verizon.)The two sides have been tangling over a new contract since last summer; unions say the company is being greedy, and the company says the unions are being stubborn. This wouldn't be the first time Verizon workers launched a major work stoppage. The same workforce went on strike in 2011, in what was the largest worker strike since 2004, according to Labor Department data. That strike lasted two weeks and involved 45,000 workers.Isaac Collazo, a Verizon technician and CWA member in Manhattan, said workers like himself did not want to go on strike, but they were willing to in order to stave off concessions. Collazo said he was most concerned with the lack of layoff protections and the possibility of having to work far from home for weeks at a time.""Nobody wants to go on strike -- we all have responsibilities,"" said Collazo, a 19-year Verizon veteran. ""People are concerned. They know the company wants a lot from us. Some things you just can't give into.""Verizon said that a strike would pose a ""hardship"" on the company, but that it had ""contingency plans"" in place to fill the strikers' roles with thousands of non-union replacement workers. The company said it has offered a 6.5 percent salary increase over the course of the contract, and retirement benefits it described as ""competitive."" But the unions say the proposal includes freezing pensions at 30 years of service, and hiking health care costs on retirees. According to Master, workers who came on with the company after 2003 would not be protected from layoffs under the proposal, and ""that's the vast majority of the workforce,"" he said."

Yet, we'd spend most of our allowances on the latter so we could show off all our strawberry, melon and grape-flavored lip oils during recess.Our lips looked and felt super shiny, but that's pretty much all those drugstore lip oils were good for back then. Jane Park, the CEO and founder of Julep cosmetics, has modernized this classic beauty product into a skincare treatment with a bit of luxury.Behold, Julep Lip Oil and Tinted Lip Oil Treatment.Growing up in Korea, Park's mother used to slather oil all over their lips. ""People often only focus on protecting and taking care of their face and neck, and often forget about the lips,"" she says. ""I've been using oils to cleanse my skin, nourish it and moisturize my whole life!""According to Park, most lip treatments act as a barrier to protect skin from the outside elements. She adds, ""What most people do not know are that these protecting formulas aren't able to sink into the skin to treat and heal.""Julep Lip Oil and Tinted Lip Oils use a combination of four pure oils (camellia, avocado, rosehip seed and grape seed) that are commonly found in Korean skincare products to deeply hydrate skin and enhance your natural lip color. Park explains, ""Camellia oil, which smooths and plumps lips from the inside out, is sourced from Korea's Jeju Island (a hot vacation spot). Grape seed oil is another ingredient that is essential to this product. It's pulled directly from the actual grape skin making it so the oils are able to dive down deep and absorb easily.""Even though these lip oils have strong Korean roots, Park reveals she didn't want to confine them to that label because most of the time no one understands what that really means. ""My goal is to give people the best ingredients to achieve the best results,"" she says. To get the most out of the tinted lip oils, Park recommends prepping your lips with a scrub before swiping on.

15,SPORTS,Cardale Jones Just Tore Into The NCAA For Exploiting Its Athletes,Justin Block,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cardale-jones-rips-ncaa-for-exploiting-college-athletes_us_570be174e4b01422324991bb,"""It's deeper than athletes thinking we should get paid.""",2016-04-11,"Cardale Jones, a football player who was once a ""student-athlete,"" seems happy to shed the ""student"" tag. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570be2591e00008700706b76.jpeg?cache=bqSVBiOGTm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Ohio State quarterback Cardale Jones is out of college and well into his 2016 NFL Draft preparations, but he's not leaving his NCAA eligibility behind without first letting his real feelings about the organization be known.As a freshman in 2012, Jones infamously tweeted a very pointed question towards the entire college sports establishment, asking why he needed to go to classes when the only reason he came to Ohio State was to play football. A natural follow-up question to that would be, and if I'm only here to play football, which is a huge revenue generator for my school, where's my cut of the money?Jones left Ohio State in January after his junior season of football, and is now free to really go after the NCAA. And on Monday, he did just that, speaking out on Twitter against how the college sports system exploits the lives of college athletes under the veil of amateurism.Ultimately, Jones' arguments won't change a thing, and actually, many people oppose paying college athletes, according to an October 2015 YouGov and a March 2014 Washington Post-ABC News poll. But Jones is far from the only former college athlete to feel exploited by the NCAA system -- a truth most famously laid bare by the Ed O'Bannon lawsuit over the use of NCAA football and basketball players' images and likenesses without compensation. Jones' point about the NCAA controlling the lives of its athletes bears some truth as well, as it can be and has been reasonably argued that NCAA schools unfairly control what student-athletes eat and when they can practice and play.There are many NCAA rules, but perhaps most notable is the one that requires a player to sit out a year if he wants to transfer schools, supposedly to protect the athlete's academic standing and allow him or her time to get used to a new campus. Many players think that's wrong, and a March 2016 lawsuit filed by a former Northern Illinois University punter is challenging that rule on anti-trust grounds. Jones is clearly overjoyed to once and for all escape the NCAA, and many more big-time college athletes are likely to follow with the same degree of jubilation. Especially when there's life-changing money to be made at the next level -- money that's not the NCAA's. "
16,TECH,Snapchat Might Be Killing Facebook In One Important Way,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/snapchat-versus-facebook_us_570ba9c9e4b0885fb50d76ec,Is the world's biggest social network in trouble?,2016-04-11,There are some things you might be more likely to share on Snapchat than Facebook.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570bac48150000ad000b47fc.jpeg?cache=OQ7nIxcEvZ&ops=crop_110_700_2515_1620%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Facebook rules the Internet, but there might be challengers to the throne.""Intimate sharing"" is declining on the social network, according to a report in Bloomberg last week. The article cites ""people who are familiar with the matter"" and claims Facebook users have become less inclined to share personal updates about their lives as they become online friends with more people. Meanwhile, people are sharing that type of content on platforms like Snapchat and the Facebook-owned Instagram.While you'd be wise to question anonymous sources voicing criticism about one of the most important tech businesses in the world -- because yes, a lot of people have skin in this game -- the idea is corroborated by two other sources. In an article on The Information, reporter Amir Efrati cites internal Facebook data that show this type of personal sharing on Facebook dropped 21 percent from 2014 to 2015. And last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off a demo of a new version of his company's app that places far greater emphasis on personal sharing.All this to say: While Facebook boasts well over a billion users around the world, those users are only particularly valuable if they're creating unique stories that keep their friends coming back to the app. That's part of the reason why Facebook suddenly introduced expansive new live video features last week -- watching your friends (or even strangers) do interesting things in realtime might be enticing enough to keep people coming back.But let's get back to Snapchat for a minute. The app has seen strong growth in two important populations: people between the ages of 18 and 24, and people between 25 and 34. Recent data from ComScore, a web analytics firm, show that Snapchat's reach grew substantially for both populations between 2013 and 2015.The app is nowhere close to overtaking Facebook in terms of overall popularity, but maybe that's kind of the key. If you're a young person, you can Snapchat yourself partying or lying around in your underwear or face-swapping with an image of Danny DeVito and never have to worry about your mom or uncle or high school English teacher seeing it.Snapchat allows you to post little video snippets or photos publicly if you want, but you can also just send them to individual friends. The appeal there is obvious: You're totally in control of your image through every step of the process, and there aren't any cumbersome privacy controls to fiddle with.Still, to corroborate my thesis, I reached out to Genna Cifelli, a college teen (and my future sister-in-law) who has a smartphone surgically grafted onto her palm. (No, not really.) I asked her where she's more comfortable sharing ""personal"" photos and video: Snapchat or Facebook?""Snapchat 100 percent,"" she said via alarmingly swift text message. ""Main reason is Facebook includes people that aren't actually my friends/are family members while Snapchat doesn't.""""Second, who posts videos on Facebook?"" she added. ""FB for people I know is mainly used for events, every time I post photos on there it feels like a chore. And then also on Snapchat you can see who viewed your stuff which is way better if you're gonna post something personal IMO.""That's just one opinion, but it's a compelling one that lines up with the expert analysis. I've written before that we're all just living in Facebook's world, but an important caveat didn't occur to me then: We can move if we want to. Platforms like Snapchat present compelling alternatives for specialized sharing, and while Facebook will likely continue to grow, it remains to be seen if it can reclaim its position as  the  place to share personal news.A representative for Facebook did not respond to request for comment from The Huffington Post about a decline in personal sharing on the platform."

During a sketch with the cast of ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,"" Anna Kendrick joked about finding her co-stars Zac Efron and Adam DeVine dates for the award show. ""I scoured every dating site available -- Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, JDate, Craigslist, Angie's List -- to find Adam and Zac a couple of dates for tonight's show,"" Kendrick said. ""I picked out four potential dates for these guys and I'm going to let you, the audience, pick the two winners. Let's bring out our lucky girls!""After Kendrick's announcement, four girls with prosthetic pregnant bellies walked out onstage. Three of the girls sported various mismatched outfits showing off their stomachs, while one girl was dressed in an orange jailhouse jumpsuit. The only guy accompanying the girls was wearing a white tank top, gold chain and backward hat. ""OK, these are not the girls I picked for the MTV date contest,"" Kendrick said.""No ma'am, we're here to audition for '16 and Pregnant,'"" one of the girls said in a Southern drawl while smacking on gum, as another whooped and cheered. Out of all the networks to make a ""joke"" about teen pregnancy and the show ""16 and Pregnant,"" MTV should know better. After all, the network began airing the ""documentary series"" in 2009, tracking the lives of pregnant teens as they faced countless hurdles in their lives. ""Each story offers a unique look into the wide variety of challenges pregnant teens face: marriage, adoption, religion, gossip, finances, rumors among the community, graduating high school, getting (or losing) a job,"" reads the synopsis of ""16 and Pregnant."" ""Faced with incredibly adult decisions, these girls are forced to sacrifice their teenage years and their high school experiences."" But apparently, if you're MTV, airing the show gives you license to make fun of the girls at your own award show and reduce them all to white trash stereotypes. A few members of ""16 and Pregnant"" and ""Teen Mom"" were in the audience and we're wondering how they feel about the sketch right about now. "

""However, in this situation, we believe that the extent of the response was absolutely unwarranted.""In the half-minute video, shot by an unidentified student at Rhodes Middle School on March 29, Kehm is seen grappling with the student, Janissa Valdez, in a school hallway, picking her up and throwing her to the ground.The girl lies motionless while the officer handcuffs her. She then gets up and is led away by the officer. The video does not show what led up to the incident or what followed.Martinez said Kehm produced an ""inconsistent"" police report. School district officials said the Texas Rangers, a statewide police agency, is also looking into the matter.""We want to be clear. We will not tolerate this behavior,"" Martinez said.Kehm has declined to comment on the incident.Bexar County District Attorney Nico LaHood says his office is also conducting an investigation to determine if criminal charges are warranted.The video has fed into a national debate over the role of police in schools and the proper procedure for dealing with unruly pupils by school officials.Almost 31,000 police officers are at U.S. public schools, according to the U.S. Department of Education, and incidents of violence by officers in schools, especially against minorities, have raised concerns."

As a result, financial executives dominate the regional Fed banks’ boards of directors, giving them an outsized role in key decisions like the selection of the banks’ influential presidents. Four of the current presidents are alumni of Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs.Fed Up and other progressives argue that the present governance structure undermines the Fed’s role as a regulator of the country’s financial institutions. These critics also argue that the influence of big banks tends to make Fed officials more sensitive to concerns about inflation, even as they hear little from ordinary workers affected by nominal changes in the unemployment rate.Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth economist and former adviser to the Fed chair, who authored the proposal, said on a call with reporters that the changes would bring the Fed’s structure into line with major central banks in other countries. He mocked the plain conflict of interest inherent in giving the financial industry so much power over an institution charged with regulating it.“It should be amazing for people in the public that banks actually own shares in the Fed. A lot of people would be shocked to hear that,” Levin said.“It would be like if lawyers owned shares in the FBI,” he added.In the new system Levin devised, the selection process of the regional banks’ directors would be supervised by the Washington-based Federal Reserve Board of Governors, with involvement from individual governors and members of Congress in the relevant Fed bank’s jurisdiction. The majority of each bank’s directors would need to come from small businesses and nonprofits. These more diverse boards, in turn, would have to make public their process for selecting a bank president.Members of the Fed Board of Governors, unlike the regional Fed banks, are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, which is one reason why Fed reform advocates consider them more accountable to the public.Levin and Fed Up made clear that they view the new governance structure as a way of generating greater ethnic and racial diversity among Fed officials as well. Levin noted that in the Fed’s existence of more than a century, not one of the regional Fed presidents has been African American.Levin called the statistic “clear evidence that something is broken.”In making the Fed a public institution, the modified system envisioned by Levin would subject the regional Fed banks to the Freedom of Information Act and the oversight of the Fed Board of Governors’ inspector general.The entire Fed, including the Fed Board of Governors, would also undergo an annual review by the Government Accountability Office, a government body tasked with evaluating the efficacy and accountability of federal agencies.In addition, Levin’s plan changes the terms of both regional Fed bank presidents and Fed governors to seven years. Currently, regional Fed presidents serve for five years, and can be reappointed to a second term -- which almost always occurs, thanks to a process that Levin and Fed Up say is typically no more than a formality. Fed Board governors now serve 14-year terms.The Federal Reserve Board of Governors declined to comment on the reform plan. But Fed chair Janet Yellen has condemned legislation in the past that would audit the Fed’s finances, claiming it would “politicize” the institution’s decisionmaking. Yellen’s stance suggests she would likely oppose the even broader GAO review.Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who was a top economist at the Fed for many years, said of the reform plan that he is “more concerned that there are already too many limits on the Fed’s power to help the economy.”Gagnon nonetheless said he views most of the new proposals favorably. His biggest specific objection is to the plan’s seven-year term limits, which he worries would open the Fed up to more political pressure by allowing a single president to decide its makeup.The rollout of the Fed Up-backed proposal is timed -- and packaged -- to encourage presidential candidates to speak out. The coalition sent out model questions for the candidates to accompany the release of the reform proposal.“It is important that we have a president who sees the need for sensible, pragmatic, nonpartisan reforms that will put the Fed on a path to serve the public for the next hundred years,” Levin said.Warren Gunnels, top policy adviser for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), joined the call to express support for the spirit of Fed Up’s proposed reforms.Sanders “believes we need to structurally reform the Fed so that it is a democratic institution that is responsive to ordinary Americans not just CEOs on Wall Street,” Gunnels said.Gunnels would not say if Sanders endorsed the proposal, however, claiming the senator needed more time to review it.He instead pointed to the Federal Reserve platform Sanders laid out in a Dec. 23 New York Times op-ed. In the column, Sanders says he would bar financial industry executives from serving on the boards of regional Fed banks altogether, make Fed assistance to banks contingent on concrete measures of service to the public, such as lending to low-income workers, and preclude the Fed from raising its benchmark interest rate until unemployment is below 4 percent.Ady Barkan, Fed Up’s campaign director, said that the coalition had invited all five presidential candidates to join the press call, but only Sanders' campaign had agreed to participate.Hillary Clinton’s campaign did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment on Fed Up’s proposal, nor did the remaining Republican presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) and Donald Trump.Getting Democratic politicians, in particular, to make the Fed a policy cause could prove a difficult task for a number of reasons.In recent years, Fed reform has tended to be the province of conservative lawmakers eager to rein in the Fed’s unprecedented efforts to aid financial institutions and stimulate economic demand in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Democrats have cast themselves as defenders of the Fed in those circumstances, since the central bank’s actions were viewed as crucial to the recovery.It doesn't help matters that the Fed is an issue that's simply not on the public’s radar.And there is also the risk of being seen as breaching protocol by commenting on an independent, nonpartisan institution.“I don’t think many voters understand enough to care about it,” Ari Rabin-Havt, a progressive radio host and onetime aide to Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), said in an interview earlier this month. “The people who do care about it somewhat, view it as a ‘temple.’”But economists and policy experts argue that it would be a mistake for Democrats to ignore the Fed. “Central banks became and still are the only game in town” when governments want to boost economic demand and employment, according a column by New York University economist Nouriel Roubini. That's partly as a result of the ideological backlash across the developed world against using public spending as a fiscal stimulus, and the delayed effect of other reforms. And the Fed is especially important in the American context, because the government is likely to remain divided regardless of who wins the presidency, narrowing the possibilities of ameliorative fiscal measures.“If the economy starts to weaken again, we cannot trust Congress to act,” Mike Konczal, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, said earlier this month. “We will need a Fed that is ahead of the curve.”Short of embracing reforms to the Federal Reserve’s governance, Democrats could make a bigger issue out of the two empty Fed governor seats. President Barack Obama named nominees for the positions many months ago, but Senate Republicans have failed to give them hearings.Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon, said he is “wary” of the candidates even articulating what kind of people they would nominate to the Fed Board of Governors lest they jeopardize the central bank’s independence. But he said calling for filling the empty governor seats is fair game.“I would like [the presidential candidates] to at least say that we should have a Fed at full power, because that’s what makes for effective monetary policy,” Duy said earlier this month. “That should be a priority for Democrats and Republicans.”"

21,BUSINESS,"Yikes, Paul Krugman Really Doesn't Understand Dodd-Frank",Zach Carter and Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-krugman-dodd-frank-shadow-banks_us_570bd7ace4b0836057a1c658,"And just a few days ago, he flubbed the history of the financial crisis.",2016-04-11,Drawing a line between banks and shadow banks is so yesterday's regulation.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570bda4a150000ad000b4899.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Paul Krugman does not seem to understand the very financial regulations he claims to support.Following up on his Friday column in which the liberal economist flubbed the basic history of the financial crisis, Krugman returns Monday with a column promoting certain rules required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation. These rules are a much better approach to financial reform than breaking up big banks, Krugman argues, because they will constrain risk and excess across the entire system.The trouble for Krugman? Those tough rules would in fact require regulators to break up big banks, if they ever got around to implementing them.""Making the breakup of big banks the be-all and end-all of reform misses the point,"" Krugman writes. ""What we need is regulation that limits the risks from nonbank institutions — and the 2010 financial reform tries to do just that. The way it does this is by allowing regulators to designate some firms 'systemically important,' meaning that, like A.I.G., their failure or the prospect thereof could threaten financial stability. Once an institution is so designated, it is subject to extra oversight and regulation.""There's something inherently contradictory about Krugman claiming on Friday that too big to fail is not that big a deal and insisting on Monday that it is very important to implement strong new regulations for too-big-to-fail firms. The extra Dodd-Frank oversight he applauds includes the requirement that big banks prepare ""living wills"" that explain to regulators how they can be safely unwound without a government bailout if they ever get into trouble. If a living will is formally rejected by the Federal Reserve as untenable, then the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. can go about dismantling the company.In a joint statement issued in the summer of 2014, the FDIC told 11 firms that it found their living wills ""not credible"" and the Fed ordered them to ""take immediate action"" to improve their plans. In those plans, many of the same firms that were bailed out in the financial crisis were saying they could fail safely in a future crisis, even though they are now bigger and more complex than they were in 2008.But instead of initiating the process of dissolving the firms, the central bank just asked them to file new plans, warning that if banks failed to be ""responsive to the identified shortcomings, the agencies expect to use their authority ... to determine that a resolution plan does not meet the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act."" Yet when banks refiled in the summer of 2015, the Fed did not take that action, choosing instead to sit on the plans. In November, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that regulators were asking for ""very substantial changes"" to these living wills. The Fed is thereby trying to dodge some very difficult decisions. If the central bank just did its job, the nation's largest financial institutions would soon be on their way to being broken up.So in short, Krugman is saying: Don't break up the big banks. Instead, closely follow a set of important rules that would ultimately require the big banks to be broken up.This isn't a brilliant and unique observation on our part. Financial reform advocates have understood how these rules should work for years. Alexis Goldstein tweeted the same point to us before we got around to writing it up:Krugman spends the rest of Monday's column fabricating controversy around the common usage of the word ""bank."" Breaking up ""banks"" misses the point, he says, because some big and dangerous financial firms technically do not have a banking charter from the federal government. This is silly, because nobody who thinks Bank of America is too big to fail is going around insisting that the government leave poor AIG alone, just because one has been formally designated as a bank holding company and the other hasn't.What's more, Krugman's insistence that talking about big banks misses a key point itself misses a key point. The Fed has already recognized that many of those ""shadow banks"" from the 2008 crisis that he's concerned about need to face stricter standards previously reserved for plain old banks. The Fed now formally classifies Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as bank holding companies, subjecting them to tougher rules. And Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America.So if you say, “Break up the banks,” you're also saying, ""Break up some big things that used to be shadow banks, too.""And that seems like something Paul Krugman would agree with.Clarification: A previous version of this article stated that the Fed had deemed the plans ""not credible."" It was the FDIC."

As the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to decide the legality of strict Texas abortion restrictions, women's healthcare providers have launched a campaign across the state trying to win support to keep their clinics open.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570bc003150000ad000b4830.jpeg?cache=PjX3j0XpSn&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even as scores of U.S. abortion clinics have shut down, the number of doctors trained to provide the procedure has surged – but only in some parts of the country.Two little-known training programs say they have expanded rapidly in recent years, fueled by robust private funding and strong demand. Launched nearly a quarter century ago amid protest and violence, the programs now train more than 1,000 doctors and medical students annually in reproductive services, from contraception to all types of abortion, according to interviews with Reuters.But their impact is limited. Most of the doctors end up working near where they train, not in several Southern and Midwestern states that have imposed waiting periods, mandated counseling and enacted other controls.""I don’t think we have a provider shortage anymore,"" said Sarah W. Prager, a University of Washington Medical School professor. ""What we have is a distribution problem. We have a lot of providers in some of our city centers, but in rural areas there are very few people willing or able to provide care.""Texas is emblematic of areas of scarcity. More than half the clinics in the state have closed since 2013 when a law went into effect that required clinics to meet surgery center standards and abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges.In its first abortion case in nearly a decade, the U.S. Supreme Court is considering whether the Texas law violates the right to abortion. The case focused attention on a decline in clinics in the United States. According to a survey by the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization that supports abortion rights, the number of clinics dropped nearly 40 percent after peaking in 1982.MORE TRAININGMedical Students for Choice was started in 1993 by a student at the University of California, San Francisco. The nonprofit now has 185 chapters and a $1.4 million annual budget funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Rockefeller Family Fund and others.Last year, it sent 137 medical students and residents for abortion training, more than twice as many as in 2010. Its two-day and three-day Abortion Training Institute has received 321 applications so far this year, surpassing the 228 who applied in all of 2015.The Kenneth J. Ryan Residency Training Program was started in 1999 by Uta Landy, who ran one of the first abortion clinics after the procedure was legalized.While obstetric-gynecology residencies are required to offer abortion training, not all do. The Ryan program has helped set up and expand family planning and abortion training at 85 teaching hospitals - including 31 since 2010 - which train about 1,000 residents a year.The program declined to discuss its budget or funding. It is a part of the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco, which does not disclose contributions at the program level.Tax disclosures show the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, which supports abortion rights, donates to many of the universities that host Ryan program training. But it does not disclose the purpose of those donations, and representatives did not respond to phone queries.UNEVEN IMPACTAt a hearing before the Supreme Court in March, lawyers for clinic operators argued that the new standards in Texas caused or contributed to the shutdown of 22 clinics. The Texas state solicitor general argued that Whole Women's Health, the lead plaintiff in the case, failed to show that the law was the only reason the clinics shut down.A study funded by abortion rights groups recently reported that waits in Texas grew as long as 23 days, and some women have traveled more than 250 miles to get an abortion.Some doctors also travel to bring abortion services to areas where they are scarce. Bhavik Kumar went to New York for Ryan residency training because it was not offered at his Texas medical school. He returned to Texas and travels more than 2,000 miles a month providing abortions at clinics in San Antonio and Fort Worth.""Rights are being taken away from not just patients but us as well,"" Kumar said. ""A lot of us are angry. We're trying to get back what the opposition has taken.""Randall K. O'Bannon, director of education and research for the anti-abortion National Right to Life organization, said the training programs are recruiting medical students with rhetoric he views as dishonest.""They have been promoting and recasting the image of the abortionists in the United States,"" O'Bannon said. ""They want to make them appear more noble - heroic. But they're not.""Lois V. Backus, executive director of Medical Students for Choice, said the students who go the extra mile to seek training are heroes who ""deserve the gratitude and admiration of all of us for their willingness to meet all the needs of their patients.""Landy, the Ryan program founder, said laws limiting abortion are stoking interest in training.""The more controversy there is,"" she said, ""the more motivation, commitment and passion grows and responds.""Most of the new providers are women, who comprise 80 percent of ob-gyn residents. Some, like Jennifer Conti, are vocal about the need for women to have access to a full range of reproductive care. Growing up in a traditional Mexican-American family, Conti opposed abortion as ""this hypothetical thing that bad people did."" But her views changed in her teens when an acquaintance got pregnant.Now, as an ob-gyn, she teaches and provides reproductive care, including abortion, at Stanford University School of Medicine, and she writes for Slate and other outlets.""There is a new generation of activist doctors,"" said Lori Carpentier, who runs Planned Parenthood clinics in Michigan. ""They choose to do terminations of pregnancies because it is a deeply held and passionate belief that women should have access to care.""(Reporting By Jilian Mincer; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Lisa Girion)"

24,POLITICS,UNC Has No Idea How To Enforce The New Anti-Trans Bathroom Law,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unc-north-carolina-hb2-law_us_570819a4e4b0885fb50d2301,"The new law has a major hole in it, and it's unclear whether universities will punish trans students for using the ""wrong"" bathroom.",2016-04-11,University of North Carolina President Margaret Spellings doesn't know how her campuses are supposed to enforce a new discriminatory law. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570aeced2e00002d00950dc4.jpeg?cache=jA5bX9r6r1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A controversial new law in North Carolina that dictates where trans students at public colleges can go to the bathroom does not include anything about how universities should enforce it. The absence leaves the question unanswered about whether trans students would be punished for using a bathroom matching their gender identity, rather than what's written on their birth certificate. Margaret Spellings, president of the University of North Carolina, sent a memo on April 5 advising campuses to follow HB2, or the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act. The new law requires public schools and universities to limit usage of multi-occupancy bathrooms and locker rooms by biological sex. So a trans student who was born male, but now identifies as a woman, would have to use the men's rooms, and vice-versa. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the state and UNC on behalf of a student and two employees of the UNC system, claiming the law violates federal civil rights laws. Yet in Spellings' memo, she seemed to suggest the university system has no idea whether it will punish trans students who defy the law, and use the bathroom or locker room that matches the gender they identify with. Indeed, in a separate note from UNC-Chapel Hill Chancellor Carol Folt and other campus administrators, they noted that they have no guidance on how to enforce rules about bathrooms and changing facilities. In an FAQ section of her memo, Spellings wrote: Does the Act address enforcement of the bathroom and changing facility provisions? Answer: The Act does not contain provisions concerning enforcement of the bathroom and changing facility requirements.In Folt's April 8 campus-wide email, referring to new restrictions on bathrooms and locker rooms, she wrote:We have been asked how the University intends to “enforce” this provision of the law. As noted in the memorandum, the law does not contain any provisions concerning enforcement.Folt added that the university is in a ""complicated and uncertain legal environment"" under HB2, and administrators do not agree with the new law. Her email was co-signed by Provost James W. Dean, Jr., Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Winston Crisp and Vice Chancellor for Workforce Strategy, Equity and Engagement Felicia A. Washington. The Huffington Post asked officials with the UNC system on Friday whether they were advising campuses to punish trans students who use a bathroom that HB2 forbids them using, or if there was any plan for enforcement.UNC spokeswoman Joni Worthington responded that the law ""confers no authority for the University or any other public agency to undertake enforcement actions."" The UNC system is advising campuses ""to take appropriate steps to inform students and employees about the location of bathrooms designated as gender-neutral, but there are no plans to monitor bathroom use,"" Worthington added. The only bathrooms that are allowed to be gender-neutral on UNC campuses are single-occupancy ones. Enforcement provided for North Carolina's new bathroom law stands in contrast to a similar proposal in Kansas that would essentially award $2,500 to a person who turns in students they see using the incorrect rest room, according to the bill's standard.But there's nothing in North Carolina's new law about what the state or authorities should do if someone uses what the legislature has declared is the ""wrong"" bathroom for them. Several police departments told Mother Jones they have no idea how they're going to enforce the bill's bathroom provisions, except to say they might end up having to respond to complaints, if they arise. ""It is absurd,"" Shane Windmeyer, head of LGBTQ student rights group Campus Pride, told HuffPost. ""Basically the state of North Carolina passed a law that has no enforcement, strikes fear and threatens safety for trans and LGBQ people, and has negatively impacted the state economy. It makes no sense. The political motivations are highly suspect and lawmakers need to be held responsible.""Even without formal enforcement mechanisms in place, officials with the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group, told HuffPost it worries that schools may still suspend or expel trans students who use the bathroom they feel most comfortable with, and police could arrest people for charges like disorderly conduct or criminal trespass. Chapel Hill officials said they will continue to share concerns they have with the new North Carolina law with the UNC system administration, and some of the consequences the flagship university is facing, noting in their April 8 email ""the impacts to Carolina go well beyond the personal toll.""""There are implications to us,"" the UNC-Chapel administrators said, ""ranging from conferences that will no longer send delegates to North Carolina and our campus; concerns and a pause among some prospective students, faculty, researchers and staff; current and prospective donors who are signaling a reconsideration of their gifts; grants and relationships with businesses that are now in jeopardy; and more.""_______Tyler Kingkade covers higher education and is based in New York.

Critics describe the interrogation method as torture, and President Barack Obama banned such practices, which also included rectal feeding, sleep deprivation and sexual humiliation, soon after taking office in 2009. And just last year, a ban of such techniques was overwhelmingly passed in the Senate. But billionaire demagogue Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the two leading Republican presidential candidates, have opened the door to the possibility of bringing back some forms of so-called “enhanced interrogation” techniques in the fight against terrorism.Republican front-runner Trump has pledged that he would seek to broaden the nation’s laws so that torture, including but not limited to waterboarding, would be allowed. Following the Brussels attacks in March, Trump said if laws were expanded, he would “do a lot more than waterboarding.”Cruz, whose own father was tortured in Cuba, has said that he does not consider waterboarding to be a form of torture. During a recent presidential debate, Cruz said he “would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use” but said that, as president, he would “use whatever enhanced interrogation methods we could to keep this country safe.”Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who trails behind Cruz and Trump in polls, has been more vague than his Republican rivals for the White House. When asked about the issue in February during a town hall event, Kasich was critical of using torture because it can produce “false information.” But he also made room for engaging in some harsh questioning tactics as president, citing the main character of the fictional television series “24,” arguing that “if there is a Jack Bauer moment, I gotta find out what the heck is going on.”The issue of severe interrogation methods has not been a prominent one on the Democratic side of the race to the White House, but former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have condemned their use, both strong supporters of Obama's torture ban.Sanders also voted in favor of last year's Senate amendment banning the tactics.Clinton recently said that the practice is counterproductive in the fight against terror and that, if elected president, her administration would not ""condone or practice"" torture anywhere in the world.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The cavities were so extensive that they were into the nerves of multiple teeth,” Strickland told the station, calling their story “malicious” and its effects “devastating.”The fabricated story that Grigsby spilled to the press led to an immediate loss of business, negative online reviews and even the loss of an employee who cited the negative media attention for quitting, the complaint argues. PREVIOUSLY:It’s the stuff of nightmares.An Indiana man says a dental appointment to remove four wisdom teeth left him covered in blood, in a coma, and missing all of his teeth.“He had been put into a medically induced coma and he was lying there crying,” Donny Grigsby’s wife, Amanda, told WRTV. “This menace needs to be stopped.”Grigsby, 36, was under the knife for five and a half hours during the March procedure at Columbus’ White River Dental, his wife said.When she went to check on him she said she called for an ambulance after finding him covered in blood.Asking what happened, she said the doctor told her that they removed all of his teeth because they were afraid that an infection from an abscessed tooth would spread.Back home and using an oxygen tank because of blood clots triggered by the surgery, Grigsby expressed the emotional suffering he has experienced.""I'm so ashamed because I have no teeth now, I woke up with no clothes on. I'm scared,"" he said. ""I just want to get teeth in my head and go on.""In a statement, White River Dental cited patient-doctor confidentiality laws, which prevent them from publicly commenting on Grigsby's case without his written approval.They added that each of their patients have their treatment explained to them before procedures take place, and that in addition they sign consent forms.""I, as well as all of our well trained staff, strive in every situation to make sure the patient and/or legal guardian understands all issues that may arise prior to accepting the treatment plan, as well as making sure they understand our due diligence in securing positive final results,” Dr. Aaron Strickland said in the statement.Grigsby and his wife said they plan to file a malpractice suit against the office."

Sam Wang and Nate Silver disagree on whether Donald Trump can get to a 1,237-delegate majority. And most Americans are unaware of the Panama Papers leak. This is HuffPollster for Monday, April 11, 2016. SANDERS REACHES A NEW HIGH IN NATIONAL POLLS  - Jeff Stein: ""The Huffington Post's polling average currently shows Bernie Sanders just 2.5 percentage points behind Hillary Clinton among Democratic voters, which is his best performance ever. Remember, he started the campaign more than 50 points behind Clinton...Back in February, shortly after Sanders crushed Clinton in New Hampshire, one Fox News poll put him ahead by 2 points among Democrats. She then proceeded to clobber him in several major statewide victories, accumulating a delegate lead that now looks virtually insurmountable. But now things appear to have tightened again. Most recent polls do still show Clinton ahead of Sanders, but three conducted in the past few weeks have shown Sanders narrowly on top."" [Vox]But the results don't translate to his share of the vote - David Wasserman: ""Sanders’s reliance on extremely low-turnout caucus states has meant the pledged delegate count overstates his share of votes. To date, Sanders has captured 46 percent of Democrats’ pledged delegates but just 42 percent of raw votes. So even if Sanders were to draw even in pledged delegates by June — which is extremely unlikely — Clinton could be able to persuade superdelegates to stick with her by pointing to her popular vote lead. Sanders already has a nearly impossible task ahead of him in trying to erase Clinton’s pledged delegate lead. He’s down by 212 delegates, meaning he’d need to win 56 percent of those remaining to nose in front…Including caucus results, Clinton leads Sanders by almost 2.4 million raw votes, 9.4 million to just more than 7 million, according to The Green Papers. ...But in the long run, even if he were somehow to win more pledged delegates, he’d probably still wind up short in the popular vote.""

That's all there is to it (and you can unsubscribe anytime).CAN TRUMP WIN A MAJORITY OF DELEGATES? - Sam Wang says yes: ""If current polls accurately measure voter behavior, then Donald Trump would get a median of 1,356 delegates – almost 120 more than the 1,237 he needs for a first-ballot victory at the national convention in Cleveland. For this probability to drop to 50% [from 92 percent], his national lead would have to drop by 8.0% – this is Trump’s Meta-Margin, a measure I have previously developed for general-election Presidential races. However, if Cruz’s overperformance continues, Trump’s lead would narrow considerably, to a count of 1,280 delegates and a Meta-Margin of 2.0%. After allowing for Cruz’s potential overperformance, the probability of a Trump majority is 70% – probable but uncertain. Under such closely divided conditions, the outcome won’t be known until the last primaries, on June 7th."" [Princeton] Nate Silver disagrees - According to FiveThirtyEight's projections, Trump is currently underperforming the targets he needs to win a majority. He currently has 92 percent of the delegates he needs to stay on track to win 1,237 delegates in the primaries. Over the weekend, Silver shared a projection via Twitter predicting that Trump will only reach 1,199 delegates. [538]CLINTON BEATS TRUMP ON MOST ISSUES - Julie Pace and Emily Swanson: “In a stark warning for Donald Trump as he eyes a possible general election showdown with Hillary Clinton, Americans trust the Democratic front-runner more than the Republican businessman to handle a wide range of issues — from immigration to health care to nominating Supreme Court justices. Even when asked which of the two candidates would be best at ‘making America great’ — the central promise of Trump's campaign — Americans are slightly more likely to side with Clinton, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll. The survey does reveal some potential trouble spots for Clinton. Trump is nearly even with her on whom Americans trust to handle the economy…And despite Americans' overall preference for Clinton on a host of issues, just 20 percent say she represents their own views very well on matters they care about, while 23 percent say somewhat well. But as with most issues addressed in the AP-GfK poll, the numbers for Trump are even worse.” [AP]State polling shows Trump remaining divisive in the GOP - Fox News polls of New York and Pennsylvania released Sunday asked respondents how they would feel if the general election was between frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. In New York, 74 percent of Democratic primary voters said they would be satisfied, while17 percent said they would seriously consider voting for a third party candidate. Among likely Republican primary voters, fewer would be happy: 69 percent would be satisfied and 22 percent would seriously consider a third candidate. Five percent each of Democrats and Republicans just wouldn’t vote at all. In Pennsylvania, 71 percent of Democratic primary voters would be satisfied, 21 percent would consider a third party candidate and 4 percent would abstain from voting. That drops to 65 percent satisfied among Republican primary voters, with 23 percent willing to consider a third party candidate and 7 percent who wouldn’t vote. [Fox News New York poll, Pennsylvania poll]AMERICANS ARE BARELY AWARE OF THE PANAMA PAPERS - HuffPollster: ""According to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, just one-third of Americans say they’ve been following the Panama Papers 'very closely' or even 'fairly closely.' Two-thirds aren’t following the story closely at all, or weren’t even aware of it….Even those who are following the story at least fairly closely aren’t all that heavily invested. About one-third say they’d be outraged if the accusations are true, with 47 percent saying they’d merely be bothered and 10 percent that they wouldn’t even be particularly bothered.

While in emergency mode it was fuel intensive.""It was the quick response and determination of the engineers throughout the weekend that led to the recovery,"" NASA officials said in a release. ""We are deeply appreciative of their efforts, and for the outpouring of support from the mission's fans and followers from around the world.""Mission operations engineers say they are now working to download data as it’s sent from the spacecraft. They noted in a previous release that it takes about 13 minutes for a signal to travel to the spacecraft and back because of its distance.""Once data is on the ground, the team will thoroughly assess all on board systems to ensure the spacecraft is healthy enough to return to science mode,"" the statement said.As soon as that's a success, the team will work to begin another portion of Kepler's ""K2"" mission.

While in emergency mode it was fuel intensive.""It was the quick response and determination of the engineers throughout the weekend that led to the recovery,"" NASA officials said in a release. ""We are deeply appreciative of their efforts, and for the outpouring of support from the mission's fans and followers from around the world.""Mission operations engineers say they are now working to download data as it’s sent from the spacecraft. They noted in a previous release that it takes about 13 minutes for a signal to travel to the spacecraft and back because of its distance.""Once data is on the ground, the team will thoroughly assess all on board systems to ensure the spacecraft is healthy enough to return to science mode,"" the statement said.As soon as that's a success, the team will work to begin another portion of Kepler's ""K2"" mission.

34,THE WORLDPOST,David Cameron's Tax Returns Raise Many Questions,"Joon Ian Wong, Quartz",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/david-cameron-tax-returns-questions_us_570bf808e4b014223249b21d,Cameron released the document in the wake of the Panama Papers leaks. It shows the PM received a very large cash gift from his mother in 2011.,2016-04-11,"Prime Minister David Cameron released his tax returns in an unprecedented move on Sunday, following allegations about his late father in the Panama Papers revelations.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570bfed32e00002d00950f98.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UK Prime Minister David Cameron took the unprecedented step of releasing a summary of his tax returns from the past six years today (Apr. 10), in response to his late father being named in the so-called Panama Papers for setting up an offshore fund.The document, prepared by the prime minister’s personal accountants, show no evidence of illegal activity. It was also revealed that Cameron received an additional £200,000 ($283,000) cash gift from his mother in 2011. That transfer has prompted further questions around the source of cash gifts worth £500,000 ($706,000) from Cameron’s parents, and whether they were linked to offshore holdings. Earlier, Cameron had admitted to profiting from a stake in his father’s offshore fund Blairmore Holdings, which he disposed of before taking office.The British media, including BBC News, the Sunday Times and the Guardian, are reporting that Cameron’s mother, Mary, made the gift of £200,000 to Cameron in two payments in May and July 2011.Cameron would not have to pay the £80,000 inheritance liable on the gift if Mary lives until 2018, seven years after the gift was made. Mary’s gift is on top of a £300,000 inheritance from Cameron’s father, Ian, who died in 2010.Inheritance tax on gifts in the UK attracts up to a 40% tax rate. But the gift is tax-free if it’s less than £325,000, and passes the “seven-year rule,” where the giver lives for more than seven years after making the transfer. If the giver dies during the seven years, the gift attracts taxes on a sliding scale of rates.According to the Sunday Times, Cameron received “preferential” interest rates at a British high street, or retail, bank because he had a large amount of savings. An estimate by the Guardian puts his savings at £120,000. Here’s a chart of the interest he earned:The filing also shows that Cameron and his wife Samantha earned nearly £100,000 annually from renting out the London property they vacated after Cameron took office. He also took advantage of a tax reduction worth £20,000 set up specifically for the prime minister in 1947. He used the deduction for one year and then voluntarily cancelled it out by declaring the equivalent amount of taxable income in subsequent years. He waived the deduction last year.The leader of the opposition Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, told the BBCin response to the tax filing that inheritance tax rules should possibly be examined. He said Cameron needed to release more tax documents and that he should be questioned in parliament about his stake in Blairmore.“I want to see the papers. We need to know what he has actually returned as a tax return. We need to know why he put this money overseas in the first place, and whether he made anything out of it or not before 2010 when he became prime minister,” Corbyn told the BBC. Corbyn himself has said he would publish his tax returns soon.Cameron has said he didn’t know if the inheritance he received from his father originated from off-shore funds. “I obviously can’t point to every source of every bit of the money and dad’s not around for me to ask the questions now,” he told ITV.Cameron today (Apr. 10) announced a government taskforce led by the tax authority to investigate tax evasion and money laundering by parties linked to the Panama Papers. He said £10 million in funding had been set aside for the taskforce.Cameron is the first British prime minister to publish his tax records.

If two-thirds vote in favor, the impeachment will be sent to the Senate.If the upper house decides by a simple majority to put Rousseff on trial, she will immediately be suspended for up to six months while the Senate decides her fate, and Vice President Michel Temer will take office as acting president.It would be the first impeachment of a Brazilian president since 1992 when Fernando Collor de Mello faced massive protests for his ouster on corruption charges and resigned moments before his conviction by the Senate.Rousseff's chief of staff Jaques Wagner said the president was ""perplexed and saddened"" by the committee vote. A former leftist guerrilla, she has denied any wrongdoing and rallied the rank and file of her Workers' Party to oppose what she has called a coup against a democratically elected president.Rousseff, caught in a political storm fueled by Brazil's worst recession in decades and the country's biggest corruption scandal, has lost key coalition allies in Congress, including her main partner, vice president Temer's PMDB party.The rift between Rousseff and her vice president reached breaking point on Monday after an audio message of Temer calling for a government of national unity was released apparently by mistake, further muddying Brazil's political water.Temer's 14-minute audio message sent to members of his own PMDB party via the WhatsApp messaging app showed he was preparing to take over if Rousseff is forced from office.The audio was posted on the website of the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper and confirmed to Reuters by Temer's aides as authentic. Aides said it was accidentally released and they quickly sent another message asking legislators to disregard it.In his message, Temer said he did not want to get ahead of events, but he had to show the country he was ready to lead it if needed.""We need a government of national salvation and national unity,"" Temer said in the audio. ""We need to unite all the political parties, and all the parties should be ready to collaborate to dragBrazil out of this crisis.""Rousseff's chief of staff called the vice president a ""conspirator"" and said he should resign if Rousseff survives impeachment.""Having joined the conspiracy, he should resign when it is defeated, because the climate will become unbearable,"" Wagner told reporters.Wagner said the government will continue working to muster enough votes to block impeachment in the lower house, encouraged by the fact that in committee the opposition had not won the two thirds it will need in the plenary.The committee vote, however, is expected to sway undecided lawmakers to vote for Rousseff's removal, said Claudio Couto, a politics professor at the Fundacao Getulio Vargas think tank.""It has a snowball effect. With each approval, the chances of impeachment clearing the next chamber increases,"" Couto said. ""The wider the margin, the more momentum impeachment will gather.""POLARIZED COUNTRYThe latest moves in Brazil's political crisis have the country on edge as it faces not only a government meltdown but its worst recession in decades. The political chaos in the capital, Brasilia, is playing out less than 100 days before the nation plays host to the first Olympic Games to be held in South America - an event that will cast the world's eyes on Brazil.The battle over Rousseff's impeachment has polarized the nation of 200 million people and brought the government of Latin America's largest economy to a virtual standstill.The proposed impeachment is also taking place as Brazil faces its largest corruption investigation, targeting a sprawling kickback scheme at state-run oil company Petrobras.Prosecutors say billions in bribes were paid over several years and have implicated not only members of Rousseff's Workers' Party but members of the opposition leading the charge to impeach her.Eduardo Cunha, the speaker of Brazil's lower house, a Rousseff enemy who is guiding the impeachment proceedings, faces charges of accepting millions in bribes in connection to the Petrobras case, while the head of Brazil's Senate is also caught up in the investigation.To battle to prevent impeachment approval in the full lower house vote, Rousseff's government is trying to win over lawmakers by offering government jobs that became vacant when the PMDB quit her governing coalition two weeks ago.The Brazilian real  strengthened nearly 3 percent before Monday's vote to an eight-month peak on expectations that the committee would decide to impeach Rousseff. Investors are betting that her removal will issue in more business-friendly policies to pull Brazil's economy out of a tailspin(Additional reporting by Brad Brooks in Brasilia and Pilar Olivares in Rio de Janeiro; Writing by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Alistair Bell, Peter Cooney and Michael Perry)"

""EM (emergency mode) is the lowest operational mode and is fuel intensive. Recovering from EM is the team's priority at this time,” NASA stated in a release. The agency has not released an explanation for why the spacecraft would shift into emergency mode on its own.Unfortunately, its location -- 75 million miles from Earth -- is only making the situation more challenging for scientists. That distance makes real-time communication impossible. ""Even at the speed of light, it takes 13 minutes for a signal to travel to the spacecraft and back,"" NASA said.The spacecraft, launched in 2009 to seek out Earth-like planets with its telescope, was last confirmed to be fully operational on April 4. NASA scientists didn't discover that it was in emergency mode until they pointed Kepler's telescope toward the center of the Milky Way for a new mission.The spacecraft has had problems in the past. While it was designed to observe planets for up to six years, two of its reaction wheels failed four years into the mission, in 2013. As a result, it could no longer stay pointed at a target without drifting off course, NASA said.Fortunately, it had completed its primary mission by then, detecting nearly 5,000 exoplanets.Scientists were also able to find another use for the telescope, repurposing it for the new ""K2"" mission in 2014 so it can continue to search for exoplanets while conducting research on young stars, supernovae and other astronomical objects."

""You can't really describe the emotions and feelings.""We all go out there and try to play good golf. Fortunately today was my day. It was a very surreal day when you look back at the ebb and flows.""Willett's participation at this year's Masters had been in doubt last month with his wife scheduled to give birth on Sunday, but their baby boy arrived early -- 12 days ago.Spieth, bidding for a second consecutive wire-to-wire win at the Masters and a third major title, had to settle for a share of second place after carding an adventurous one-over 73 that included a quadruple bogey and seven birdies.NIGHTMARE SEVENThe American world number two had stormed five strokes in front with nine holes to play and victory seemingly assured when he bogeyed the 10th and 11th before running up a nightmare seven at the par-three 12th.""It's tough, it's really tough,"" Spieth told CBS Sports about his stunning three-hole collapse, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Pretty sure I'll be disappointed with that one.""A very tough 30 minutes for me that hopefully I will never experience again.""Finishing level with Spieth at two under was England's former world number Lee Westwood who, still seeking a first major title after recording 17 top-10 finishes during a stellar career, returned a 69.England's Paul Casey (67) and Americans J.B. Holmes (68) and Dustin Johnson (71) tied for fourth at one under while Rory McIlroy, seeking to complete a career grand slam of the majors, returned a 71 to share 10th place.After three rounds of strong gusting winds, the players were greeted by the coldest temperatures of the week but the calmest conditions as Sunday's final round got under way with an abundance of compelling possible storylines in the melting pot.For the first nine holes, Spieth was his usual unflappable self as he mixed five birdies with a lone bogey and several clutch putts to reach the turn five strokes clear at seven under, seemingly in total command.However, the 22-year-old Texan bogeyed the 10th, after bunkering his approach, and also the 11th, after his tee shot sailed right into the trees, before the tricky 12th took an even more severe toll.After hitting successive shots into the waters of Rae's Creek in front of the 12th green, Spieth found a back bunker with his fifth en route to a mind-boggling seven, falling back into a tie for fourth at one under.Though he did well to rebound with birdies on both par-fives, the 13th and 15th, he also bogeyed 17 after bunkering his approach and was never able to catch Willett, who picked up shots at the 13th, 14th and 16th to give himself a cushion.(Editing by Frank Pingue)"

Police said they were investigating the killing as a possible case of road rage.Smith, who played on the New Orleans Saints team that won the Super Bowl in 2010, was traveling in a Mercedes in the city's Lower Garden District shortly before 11:30 p.m. CDT (0430 GMT) on Saturday when his car was rear-ended by a Hummer.Smith, 34, exchanged words with the driver of the Hummer, who took out a handgun and shot him several times, New Orleans Police Department spokesman Juan Barnes said in a statement.Smith was drafted by the Saints in 2004 after playing college football with Ohio State.

It hit a nerve with him because two of his sisters have Type 1 diabetes.“That first word just automatically brought the picture of both sisters in my head, and I was taken aback,” he told the local Jacksonville TV station. “Just the struggles they went through and all the doctor appointments they had.”He wrote back on the cup: ""2 of my sisters are diabetic, so ... not funny.""The St. Augustine store's manager appeared surprised over the label and told the local reporter that they ""definitely don't condone"" such actions and would look into what happened.The customer said he believes that he was unfairly and inappropriately judged by a Starbucks employee and wants to make sure that it doesn’t happen to him or anyone else again. He noted that he didn't personally go into the store to place the order, but had a co-worker pick it up for him as part of a group order.A Starbucks spokesperson confirmed to The Huffington Post that the message had been printed in the store. Some online users suggested that the label had been written by a customer who was placing the order online.""We strive to provide an inclusive and positive experience for our customers, and were disappointed to learn of this incident,"" the company said in a statement. ""We've since connected directly with the customer to apologize for his experience, and with our partners (employees) to ensure this does not happen again.""That Starbucks beverages contain a lot of sugar -- which in some cases can cause health problems -- shouldn't be a surprise. Some of their beverages have been found to contain more sugar than a milkshake.A ""grande"" white chocolate mocha, which the Florida customer ordered, has 470 calories and 59 grams of sugar, according to Starbuck’s website.That tops the daily maximum amount recommended by the American Heart Association. For men, it's 45 grams (nine teaspoons) or 30 grams (six teaspoons) for women.Sugar-rich diets can contribute to a number of health conditions, including diabetes, obesity and some cancers.But according to the American Diabetes Association, high-sugar diets aren't the only thing that can be blamed for the disease. When it comes to Type 1 diabetes -- which the Starbucks customer said his sisters have -- most people inherit risk factors from their parents.""The myth that sugar causes diabetes is commonly accepted by many people. This is a complicated issue,"" the ADA states on its website. ""Eating sugar has nothing to do with developing type 1 diabetes. Type 1 is caused by genetics and other unknown factors that trigger the disease.""However, the ADA warns that sugary drinks have been linked to developing Type 2 diabetes. As a prevention, they advise limiting sugar-sweetened beverages.For those already living with Type 2, the association advises saving sweets and desserts for special occasions and keeping portions small when indulging.But it's not just the total sugar content people should watch out for.""If you don't have a lot of time when reading labels, simply look at the total carbohydrate in a food,"" the association suggests. ""The total carbohydrate includes starch, fiber, sugar and sugar alcohols. It is more helpful to check the total carbohydrate because it includes both sugar and starch. If you only look at the sugar content, you are not accounting for the starch in a food.”"

A new survey out from The Leadership Conference Education Fund -- the education and research branch for the civil rights coalition The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights -- takes a look at the opinions and concerns of parents of color who have kids in school.Researchers behind the survey contend that while students of color now constitute a majority of kids in public schools, their opinions are rarely represented. The survey -- which sought responses from a sample of 400 African-American and 400 Latino parents -- was designed to gain a greater understanding of what these families want out of the public school system. Surveyed parents, who spanned a range of incomes, see that their children often receive the short end of the stick when it comes to school resources. Over 80 percent of African-American parents and over 60 percent of Latino parents said that they don't think schools in their communities receive the same levels of funding as schools in white communities.Similarly, an overwhelming number of parents from both groups said they think schools in low-income communities have fewer resources than schools in wealthy communities. Indeed, 14 states have school funding formulas that provide less funding to school districts with the poorest students, according to a March report from the Education Law Center. In general, most surveyed black parents said they do not think kids from their communities are receiving a comparable education to the one white students receive, even though they have generally favorable opinions of the individual schools their children attend. Latinos were more optimistic about the education their community members receive, unless their kid goes to a mostly low-income school.Respondents who expressed seeing racial inequities in schools said they blame schools' lack of resources and lower teacher quality. A recent report from the Center for American Progress found that poor students and students of color were more likely to have less effective teachers.Some respondents in the new study -- especially African-American parents -- said they think their kids are victims of racism and racial bias. While a majority of African-American and Latino parents said they think schools are trying their best to help students, a third of Black respondents and a quarter of Latino respondents said they don't even think schools in the U.S. are really trying to educate kids from their communities. Regardless, these parents -- who the survey refers to as ""new majority parents"" -- believe their children are not held to high enough standards, and should be challenged more. They ranked school safety, high-quality teachers and academic rigor as the most important characteristics in great schools. Wade Henderson, president of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said his organization commissioned the poll to jump-start a conversation ""about education policy, one that’s inclusive of communities of color."" ""I know firsthand how elusive the effort to provide quality education has been, particularly for communities of color,"" Henderson said on a call with reporters. ""Concentrated poverty, race and systemic discrimination, sometimes unconscious bias, come into play and affect the allocation of resources, both financial and personnel."""
