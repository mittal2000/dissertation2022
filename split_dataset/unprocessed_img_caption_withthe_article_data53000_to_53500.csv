2,POLITICS,A Whole Bunch Of Influential GOP Latinos Aren't Backing Trump,Nico Pitney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-latino-republicans_us_5771a73ae4b0f168323aae61,"""We're at the very end of the rope of waiting to see that Donald Trump will do the right thing.""",2016-06-28,Leslie Sanchez attends an event organized by Voto Latino.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5771b14b1500002b006c87a8.jpeg?ops=crop_0_103_2220_1380%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Bettina Inclan-Agen has devoted her career to GOP politics. She is the daughter of a Cuban mother and a Mexican father, and this time four years ago she was overseeing the Republican National Committee's outreach to Hispanic voters. Today she doesn't know if she can support her party’s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump. ""This is the first time in my life that I don't know what to do,"" Inclan-Agen said about voting in November. ""The thing that bothers me the most were his comments about the judge,"" she said, referencing Trump's statements that a Mexican-American judge was biased because of his heritage. ""Having a kid, I thought, what if my son was 10 years old?"" she said. ""How do I explain that to him? How do I explain that this guy who is running for president doesn't see you as an American because your family's from Mexico?""Trump desperately needs a strong showing with the Latino community if he is to have a chance in the general election. But without top Latino Republican officials amplifying his message or activating their networks of donors and supporters, an already difficult task may become nearly impossible.For this story, The Huffington Post interviewed and surveyed public statements by 49 of the country’s most influential Latino Republicans, as identified by the conservative site Newsmax. Three-quarters of them either explicitly stated they are not currently supporting Trump or would not comment on his campaign at all.Of the remaining 11, three said they will support “the Republican nominee” without citing Trump by name, and five others said they support Trump despite having major reservations.That leaves just three of 49 who are willing to support Trump by name with no major reservations: Jennifer Korn, deputy political director at the RNC; Rep. Alex Mooney, a tea party-backed freshman congressman from West Virginia; and Gus Barreiro, a former state legislator from Florida.“I'm not on the anti-Trump movement like some of my colleagues who I talk to every day, but I'm far from an endorsement,” said Leslie Sanchez, a Republican commentator for CBS News, echoing the views of many of these notable Latino conservatives who are skeptical of Trump. None of these top figures said they will support presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. But they are highly critical of Trump, both because they are offended by his “abhorrent racist rhetoric” (as Sanchez put it) and demoralized by his campaign's poor engagement with broad swaths of the electorate -- including, but not limited to, Latinos.“Trump is having a maddening effect of turning solid red states purple. Areas that should not have gone in that direction for the next 30 years, he's managed to do in about four months,” Sanchez said, citing survey work she did in Texas in April.“Some of the Republican pollsters I talked to there said this should not be happening for at least a generation by natural demographic growth,"" she added. ""Trump has accelerated that by underperforming in traditionally conservative Latino households."" A number of influential Latino Republicans have firmly ruled out supporting their party’s presumptive nominee. “I think Donald Trump will be a train wreck for America. I have no respect for him,"" said megadonor Felix Sabates. Referencing his two young daughters, Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida remarked, ""I could never look them in the eye and tell them that I support someone so crass and insulting and offensive.""Some go even further. Wealthy Latino GOP donor Mike Fernandez offered to support Trump ""when hell freezes over."" ""Oh, no, but is that not where he resides?"" he added. Conservative activist Lauro Garza regularly describes Trump as an operative of white supremacist groups.Still others have adopted what might be described as quasi-nonendorsements. “I will vote for him,"" said Rep. Bill Flores of Texas, ""but in terms of getting my endorsement, I don’t endorse people that bash a judge based on his ethnic heritage.""When asked merely to clarify whether former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has publicly backed Trump's campaign, a Gonzales aide told HuffPost, ""He has no position.""The majority of these conservative Latinos hold out hope that Trump’s campaign might eventually shift its tone and tactics. “I feel there are some very valid aspects to his candidacy,” New York Assemblyman Pete Lopez said. “However, I am concerned about his conduct and his demeanor. I would say to him: ‘self-discipline, self-control need to be a part of engaging meaningfully in this arena, and you can show strength but you don't need to be diminishing people as you do.’”Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes released a statement in May lauding the jurists who Trump said he would consider appointing to the Supreme Court. But an aide to Reyes, Alan Crooks, told HuffPost the statement should not be mistaken for an endorsement: “The Attorney General believes that the Republican positions are very important to the Latino community, but he needs to feel more comfortable in order to endorse Trump, which puts him in a difficult position.” Also, he said, Reyes “would have liked to have seen a Latino” on Trump’s list of potential Supreme Court nominees.Several Latino Republicans consider Trump the lesser of two evils. “I'll take a gamble voting for Trump, as opposed to the crook, Hillary, and her Wall Street paymasters,” conservative activist Jason Mattera said. ""I do not like all of Mr. Trump's ideas,"" added Carlos Perez, a Florida radio host and former Reagan aide who likened Trump to Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. ""He has to calm down his temper. However, in comparison with Hillary, there is no comparison.""Indeed, some of the sharpest critiques of Trump have come from prominent Latinos who are now supporting him. This includes GOP ad-man Alex Castellanos, who earlier dubbed Trump a “strongman” who is “not a Republican or a conservative,” but is now overseeing a pro-Trump super PAC; Idaho congressman Raul Labrador, who has called Trump’s rhetoric “morally abhorrent”; and New Mexico Lt. Gov. John Sanchez, who said he will be supporting the Republican nominee despite his ""inaccurate and really divisive"" statements.Their conversions may be a source of optimism for Trump's camp, a sign that leading Latino Republicans might come around in the end despite their displeasure with his campaign.But the shift can also happen in reverse, as demonstrated by Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, who initially endorsed Trump before backing off earlier this month. ""I will not defend the indefensible,"" he said in a statement.Current Trump skeptics said time is running out for him to make changes.""We were waiting to see if Donald Trump would tone down the rhetoric, if he would be more inclusive, if he would bring in women and Latinos to higher-level capacities in strategy, media-buying, communications, political outreach within his campaign organization,"" Sanchez said.""Right now, the Latino conservative business leaders I speak with are willing to be convinced, they are open-minded, they are waiting for that engraved invitation to be part of a larger campaign. At every turn the Trump effort is silent,"" she added.Like several others, Sanchez pointed to July's Republican convention as a singular opportunity for Trump to course correct.""We're at the very end of the rope of waiting to see that Donald Trump will do the right thing,"" she said. ""Increasingly I am fearful that's not going to happen.""In the meantime, preserving the GOP's Senate majority and winning other down-ballot races have become top priorities. So is coming to terms with the prospect of sitting out a presidential race.""My grandfather was a political prisoner in Cuba,"" Inclan-Agen told HuffPost. ""From my first memory, I recall him talking about how great America is; how in this country we have the right to vote; how my family was exiled from their country and they didn't have any political power; how they didn't have this right to vote. The thought of not exercising that power is chilling to me.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
3,COLLEGE,"Thomas Pogge Has 'Done Damage' To Yale Philosophy Department, Colleague Says",Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thomas-pogge-yale-philosophy_us_57716225e4b017b379f6b9f4,More professors are vowing to not work with the well-known philosophy professor in light of recent allegations of sexual harassment.,2016-06-28,Thomas Pogge was accused of sexual harassment at Yale in 2010 and when he was a professor at Columbia University in the 1990s.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576431882200002d00f81a0f.jpeg?cache=mqo8L6HW5t&ops=crop_0_171_800_593%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"World-famous ethicist Thomas Pogge has crossed the line and violated professional standards, the former chair of the Yale University philosophy department said. ""It's pretty clear that he's engaged in some pattern of behavior -- the precise contours of which remain contested -- but they nevertheless strike me as inappropriate and need to be condemned by the profession,"" Shelly Kagan, a philosophy professor at Yale, told The Huffington Post in a new interview.Pogge was accused of sexual harassment at Yale in 2010 and when he was a professor at Columbia University in the 1990s. The allegations were first reported last month, and he is additionally accused of several instances of behaving inappropriately toward young graduate students. Pogge has denied any wrongdoing. Kagan, was previously served as an acting chair of Yale's philosophy department, was one of 169 philosophers who signed an open letter last week denouncing Pogge's conduct with students and calling on the academic community to respond, regardless of whatever action Yale may take. A majority of Pogge's colleagues in the Yale philosophy department put their name on it, and the total number of academics signing the letter now tops 1,000.""There's no question he's done damage in my department,"" Kagan said. ""I'm confident that's why so many of my colleagues signed the initial letter.""Kagan said he's particularly worried about the allegation that Pogge wrote letters of recommendation for people ""for whom he had little or no academic contact, perhaps as part of maintaining or initiating a sexual relationship."" ""And that means it calls into question the value of letters he has written or might yet write for undergraduates or graduate students in our own department, which then harms the reputation of our students, and makes it difficult or impossible (or less attractive) for our students to work with him,"" Kagan said in a follow up email elaborating on this point. ""All of which makes it less useful (or worse) to have him as a colleague. Now much of this sort of damage gets done regardless of whether these charges against Thomas are true: it suffices that there is a pattern of behavior that makes them credible.""Meanwhile, several prominent philosophers have declared they do not want to be involved with him anymore. French social scientist Dan Sperber declined an invitation to take part in a conference that Pogge is helping organize for spring 2017. In his response to the invitation from an Italian academic, Sperber called Pogge's involvement in the conference ""just sick.""""Professor Pogge should not, until he has cleared his name (if he can), even think of organising an academic conference: asking people to participate to a conference of which he is a co-organizer is tantamount to asking them to pretend that Prof. Pogge's moral authority is not at issue, that, for instance, the academic benefit conferred by such an invitation couldn't be used by him as what he might consider an aid to seduction and what might be better described as a tool of sexual harassment,"" Sperber wrote in his emailed reply, according to a copy shared with HuffPost. ""To accept such an invitation is, in fact, to give him tacit support,"" Sperber continued. ""When, moreover, the conference involved is intended to honor the legacy of a man of such moral integrity as Albert Hirschman, this is just sick.""(Hirschman was an economist who often focused on Latin America and helped Jewish refugees escape persecution.)Melissa Williams, founding director of the Centre for Ethics at the University of Toronto, shared a copy of a letter she wrote to Pogge in which she admonished him for his ""long train of abuses"" and inappropriate behavior with young students. As long as ""you continue to deny that your conduct has been seriously problematic,"" many colleagues will ""have no choice but to refuse association with you,"" she wrote. An unscientific poll of 497 readers of Leiter Reports, a popular blog in the philosophy community, found about 30 percent said they either would not assign Pogge's work anymore over the allegations, or were unsure if they would. _______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter, focusing on higher education and sexual violence, and is based in New York.

Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to resign, triggering a leadership contest in his ruling Conservative Party.Though widely expected, the Labour vote of no confidence underscores the depth of oppositionCorbyn faces. The non-binding vote, however, does not automatically trigger a leadership election. CORBYN DEFIANTCorbyn, who voted to leave the EU in a 1975 referendum, said he would not resign as leader.""I was democratically elected leader of our party for a new kind of politics by 60 percent of Labour members and supporters, and I will not betray them by resigning,"" he said.""Today's vote by MPs (Members of Parliament) has no constitutional legitimacy.""Parliamentary colleagues have called on Corbyn to quit after more than 20 of his policy team publicly resigned. He was laughed at when called to make a speech in parliament on Monday, before attending a private meeting where more than a dozen lawmakers pleaded with him to quit.His opponents in the Labour Party question whether he can ever win over voters in the party's heartlands.Corbyn has previously said he would stand again if the party did call a leadership contest. A leadership contest would have to take place if 51 or more Labour lawmakers pledge their support for an alternative candidate.But Corbyn retains support among many party members and registered supporters outside parliament and they help to elect any new leader.If Corbyn is challenged and retains power, the party could face further turmoil at a time when many Labour supporters say it should be focusing more than ever on challenging the Conservative government and offering ways to overcome Britain's post-referendum crisis.(Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Gareth Jones)"
7,THE WORLDPOST,A Makeshift School In Aleppo Offers Safer Education Amid Bombings,"Alessandria Masi and Lindsey Snell, Syria Deeply",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/makeshift-school-in-aleppo_us_57714146e4b0dbb1bbbb2564,"Over the past two years, bombs and shelling have made it too dangerous for students to attend official schools in Aleppo",2016-06-28,"A school-aged child navigates through rubble and barbed wire in Aleppo, Syria, Feb. 11, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577142361a00002800ceb3bc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the past two years, bombs and shelling have made it too dangerous for students to attend official schools in Aleppo city, so a group of volunteer teachers decided to open their own.ALEPPO, SYRIA – Adnan was in fifth grade when an airstrike destroyed the government-run school he attended in Aleppo city. He survived, but his education was put on hold. It was 2013, and for the next three years, schools in Aleppo would be frequently targeted by Syrian government airstrikes or hit by opposition fire. Education became a risk that Adnan could no longer take. Today, Adnan attends a makeshift school in a secluded, bombed-out residence – but he’s only in sixth grade.“I’d be in a later school year but the Assad regime destroyed our school,” Adnan told Syria Deeply from his classroom in Aleppo’s old city. “Before this we had no schools, three years ago we got no education.”Attacks on schools in Aleppo have continued for years, putting children at risk and forcing many schools to close. Roughy 40 percent of schools in opposition-controlled areas of Aleppo have been shelled at least once and enrollment has dropped to 6 percent, according to Save the Children.Adnan was among the 94 percent of Aleppan students out of school, until two volunteer teachers gave him a safer place to learn.Two years ago, Abu Ibrahim, a teacher from Aleppo’s old city, and another teacher found the partially demolished home where Adnan now goes to school. Together, the two transformed the residence into a makeshift school, so children in the neighborhood could continue to learn without the fear of an aerial attack.Today, Abu Ibrahim and some 11 other volunteers teach between 300 and 400 children at Al-Shabha primary school.“The children can’t go to the government schools because they’re always bombed … there could be rockets at any time,” Ibrahim told Syria Deeply. “We’ve been here doing this for two years, 12 teachers with no payment at all. Two years of volunteer work for the kids to save them from illiteracy.”Syria has lost more than a quarter of its schools in the war. As of the start of 2016, at least 6,000 schools in Syria – roughly one in four – had been destroyed by violence or transformed into military bases or shelters, according to a report from UNICEF. In 2014 alone, at least 130 children were killed in attacks on schools.“Bombing near a school is utterly outrageous, but it is becoming the norm in Syria, where all parties to the conflict show complete disregard for the safety and sanctity of school buildings,” Martha Myers, country director of Save the Children in Syria, said in a statement condemning the bombing of an Aleppo school in December 2015. That bombing killed two female teachers, two men and a toddler.One particularly deadly attack came in April 2014, when a car bomb hit a primary school in Aleppo city killing 33 children and injuring another 40. About a month later, an airstrike hit another school in eastern Aleppo during an art exhibition, killing 30 children.That month, the threat of airstrikes on educational facilities became so grave that the Free Aleppo Governorate Council, a local group that runs parts of opposition-controlled Aleppo city, was forced to close all the schools.With the official schools under threat of attacks, or closed, thousands of teachers and students in Aleppo have been forced to continue their education in makeshift classrooms – some of them even operating underground to avoid the threat of bombs overhead.Some of these makeshift schools are supported by local and international nongovernmental organizations. Syrian NGO Kesh Malek operates nine schools in opposition-controlled Aleppo city that provide education to some 3,300 students. The schools are an alternative to the official government-run schools, “which have been targeted by regime shelling and are close to areas that are unsafe,” according to Kesh Malek’s website.“The worst case scenario is [President Bashar al-Assad] is going to target schools. Right now none of our schools have a yard. We don’t have sports or this kind of activity,” Kesh Malek executive director Marcell Shehwaro told Reuters.But many schools, like Al-Shabha, are run by groups of volunteer teachers. Educators are forced to raid the remnants of closed or destroyed government-run schools for supplies. Some schools operated by the Syrian opposition get books and supplies printed in Turkey.After a government school in the neighborhood was bombed two years ago, Ibrahim and one other teacher salvaged whatever materials they could from the building. They took whiteboards, books, furniture and whatever educational materials they could find to set up the makeshift facility.But the teachers’ efforts are only a drop in the ocean when it comes to the education crisis facing Syria today, Abd Sattar Mubarak, an English teacher at Al-Shabha, told Syria Deeply.“The fact is, Syria is destroyed,” he said. “The scientific talents and great minds are fleeing.”This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply.

I wanted to stay away from necessarily telling all those [paperwork] steps that we get to be so familiar with when dealing with the immigration process and focus on the feelings and how long it takes and how many pieces to the puzzle there are.""And for Medina, who is openly gay, what was at stake during the process went beyond job opportunities and financial stability. Being able to live in the United States permanently meant living in a country where she was less afraid to be herself and love whomever she wants to love.""As much as I miss being in Colombia and as homesick as I get, I cannot find the freedoms that I have here in my day-to-day life there,"" she said. ""It’s just the simple things. The being able to rent an apartment without anybody rolling their eyes at you, being able to walk hand in hand with my partner... it’s having the possibility of thinking of having and raising a family. It’s the possibility of getting married.""But her immigration process came with some heartbreaking sacrifices. During her more than 10 years in immigration limbo, Medina said she wasn't able to leave the country, not even to visit her ailing grandparents. ""Throughout that time I lost my grandparents, who were essential in my upbringing, and I wasn’t able to go be with them for their last days or even their funerals because of waiting for this visa,"" Medina said. ""And to me, that’s inhumane.... I mean I lost them, I’ll never see them again and I wasn’t able to be with them, and all because I wanted to remain here legally and make my life in a place that would offer me freedoms and qualities I couldn’t be granted in my home country. So I find that incredibly frustrating, if not heartbreaking, because I know I’m not the only one who has been in that situation.""But the award-winning cartoonist and children's book illustrator stopped short of condemning the immigration system, saying, ""I’m not going to replicate the resounding 'the immigration system is broken.'"" However, she did stress that the process is a lot more complicated than many immigration hard-liners make it out to be. ""I think people more than anything don’t know how the process works until they go through it,"" she said. ""So I can’t really blame them for saying 'Oh, just go and stand in line and ask for the paperwork' and it’s not that way. For example, I’m still a resident and very eager to become a citizen, but I still have to wait two more years to apply. So it’s not like I can stand in a line at an office and decide whether I can get a visa or become a resident or become a citizen. I still have to comply to the process, it’s very long and it takes a lot of time, and it’s such a huge [financial] investment.""And Medina's story and comic is proof of just how complicated and tedious the immigration process can be for some, even for a person who considers herself ""one of the lucky ones.""Take a look at her full story in the comic below.

Feingold is running to retake his old Senate seat from Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who defeated Feingold in 2010. During his 18 years in the Senate, Feingold was known as one of the chamber's most progressive members, and this time, Democrats see him as one of their top candidates. ""Russ isn't afraid to stand up for what he knows is right, even when it isn't popular,"" Obama's fundraising email reads. ""He was the sole senator to vote against the USA PATRIOT Act, and one of very few who stood in opposition to the war in Iraq. Russ also took an early and loud stance in support of marriage equality for gay Americans, and he wasn't afraid to work with me, side by side, to get the Affordable Care Act passed -- helping insure millions of Americans.""In supporting Feingold, Obama joins Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has fundraised for the Wisconsin Democrat this year and spoken highly of Feingold's record in the Senate. HuffPost Pollster's average of public polling in the race shows Feingold with a nearly 9-point lead over Johnson.Feingold endorsed Hillary Clinton for president last week, but Johnson has had some trouble embracing his own party's presumptive presidential nominee. Johnson has said that he won't endorse Donald Trump, although he is supporting him. ""To me, 'endorsement' is a big embrace. It basically shows that I pretty well agree with an individual on almost everything. That's not necessarily going to be the case with our nominee,"" Johnson told CNN last week, although he'd previously said he would endorse his party's nominee. ""I'll certainly be an independent voice. Where I disagree with a particular nominee, I'll voice it. Whether it's Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump or somebody else, I'll voice those disagreements."""

The practice has angered both animal-rights activists who say it exploits wildlife and exhibitors who describe the process as unfair and arbitrary.In the last five years, the vast majority of the estimated 1,375 endangered species permits granted by the Fish & Wildlife Service involved financial pledges to charity, according to agency documents reviewed by Reuters.For a $2,000 pledge, the Fish & Wildlife Service permitted two threatened leopard cubs to be sent from a roadside zoo to a small animal park. After a $5,000 pledge, the agency approved the transfer of 10 endangered South African penguins to a Florida theme park.An application now under final consideration would permit a South Carolina safari park operator to send 18 endangered tigers to Mexico to participate in a multimillion-dollar movie – for a $10,000 donation to charity.Craig Hoover, a senior Fish & Wildlife Service official, said his agency considers many factors before granting an endangered species permit – among them, a species’ biological needs, threats and population size. Charitable contributions to conservation programs are just one factor in granting permit evaluations, and not a requirement, he said. “It’s not necessarily all that is considered,"" said Hoover. ""There may have been an education component, an outreach component, a captive breeding component.”""INDIRECT BENEFITS"" TO WILDLIFEUnder the Endangered Species Act, exception permits may be granted only “for scientific purposes or to enhance the propagation or survival of the affected species.”According to a recent Fish & Wildlife Service document reviewed by Reuters: “Very few of the Endangered Species Act permits that we issue have direct benefits to the species in the wild. Most applicants provide an indirect benefit, such as monetary support, to meet the enhancement requirement.”Late Friday, U.S. Representative Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat who serves on the House Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees, asked the agency to halt the practice.Boyle said exemptions to the endangered species law are intended for humanitarian or environmental purposes, such as providing medical attention to a wounded animal, not commercial uses. He said the charity pledges are “unreliable at best and amount to an empty promise in exchange for an exemption to our bedrock species conservation law.”The agency usually does not try to independently confirm that donations are actually made or that the charities, often located overseas, are worthy, an agency document says. “Typically, we rely on the applicant,” the document notes. Hoover said applicants supply this information through annual reports and agency grant programs.""PAY TO PLAY"" FOR ELEPHANTSLast year, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sued the Fish & Wildlife Service over a 2014 endangered species permit issued to Tarzan Zerbini Circus of Webb City, Missouri. The permit allowed Tarzan Zerbini to take two elephants, Shelly and Marie, on a Canadian circus tour - on the condition that it pledge $15,000 annually to an elephant charity and raise another $50,000 annually from patrons.“We call it ‘pay-to-play’ because that’s what exactly what’s going on, allowing these people to promise money in exchange for being able to harm endangered animals,” said PETA general counsel Jeff Kerr. “The Fish & Wildlife Service is actively conspiring and cooperating with people to violate the Endangered Species Act through this program.”The agency defended itself against PETA’s claim that the process is illegal, but the lawsuit apparently triggered a government investigation of Tarzan Zerbini's financial pledge. Records show the service determined that the circus had only contributed half the amount promised and had raised little, if anything, from patrons. On April 21, the permit was suspended. Last week, PETA withdrew the lawsuit.Larry Solheim, a Tarzan Zerbini consultant who served as general manager for 26 years, said the circus made good-faith efforts to comply with its pledges. He said honest mistakes and misunderstandings caused the other half of the money to be contributed late and said technical issues hampered efforts to raise the $50,000 from patrons.Solheim said the concept of requiring conservation efforts is a good idea. But he described the permit process as too focused on foreign donations. He called it “a game” that can resemble “political extortion.”“You’re just essentially buying a permit if you pay this conservation fee,” he said. “It’s just totally subjective – if they want to have this kind of requirement, they need to have clear guidelines.”John Cuneo, whose Hawthorn Corp leases endangered animals to circuses and is often criticized by PETA, said he has lost business for failing to promise to make the charitable payments.“It makes me so mad,” Cuneo said. “It feels like a scam.”Hoover, the agency official, said PETA and the animal exhibitors are wrong.""TIGER ISLAND""“We would deny any form of ‘pay to play policy’ is in place, formally or informally,” Hoover said. He added: “We would deny that we tell people they must"" make charitable contributions, ""but if they are engaging in activity where the import or export isn’t contributing to conservation, then there must be some other means by which they must be contributing conservation.”The permit application to send 18 tigers to Mexico for a Hollywood movie was filed by Bhagavan Antle, who operates the Myrtle Beach Safari in South Carolina. Antle declined to name the people behind the movie, which is tentatively titled ""Tiger Island."" The plot revolves around tigers living on an abandoned island, and a group of children who end up shipwrecked there.The permit is still pending, but records show that Fish & Wildlife officials directed that Antle confirm a pledge of $10,000 to charity and a promise that the movie will have a conservation theme. He has agreed to do so, and said he thinks the agency's process is good because it helps endangered animals. Antle said $10,000 is a fair contribution for the right to use 18 tigers on a multimillion-dollar motion picture.“The movie company thinks it’s a hardship – to spend $10,000 for what used to be free,” Antle said. But he added, “If it becomes a big hit movie, that will change more hearts and minds than a $10 million contribution to conservation.”PENGUINS TO MIAMILast year, the Fish & Wildlife Service approved the sale of 10 African penguins from a California theme park to the Miami Seaquarium.“We are thrilled that our guests will be able to observe these fascinating creatures and at the same time learn about this endangered species and what we can do to help preserve our feathered friends,” Andrew Hertz, the Seaquarium's general manager, said in a press release in February. A spokeswoman said Hertz wasn't available for an interview.The sea park built a new exhibit for the birds called “Penguin Isle,” a spectacle that includes a 9,000-gallon pool with an acrylic underwater swimming tunnel, allowing visitors to come “face to face” with the penguins, the release says. The Seaquarium, which averages about 600,000 customers a year, charges $99 for a family of four.As part of the endangered species permit approval, the seller agreed to make an annual contribution for five years to a South African charity that rescues penguins soiled by oil spills.The annual pledge: $1,000.(Edited by Michael Williams)"

U.S. officials are worried that the mcr-1 gene may find its way into CRE bacteria, potentially creating bacteria resistant to virtually all types of antibiotics.Scientists have been tracking the mcr-1 gene's movement around the globe since it was discovered last year in people and pigs in China.The latest U.S. finding of mcr-1 came as part of a global effort called the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, led by Mariana Castanheira of JMI Laboratories based in North Liberty, Iowa.Researchers tested 13,525 Escherichia coli and 7,481 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from patients collected last year from hospitals in the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, Europe and North America.Of these, 390, or 1.9 percent, were resistant to colistin, and 19 of these isolates tested positive for the mcr-1 gene.Samples carrying the gene came from 10 countries and included some from each region. Only one came from the United States.

Wade, striking down two provisions of a restrictive Texas abortion law that closed dozens of abortion clinics in that state and put women's access to safe, legal abortion at risk. In deciding that the law placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions, the Court provided what is being hailed as a historic victory for reproductive rights in that state -- and beyond. And on the ground in Texas, where things had looked pretty grim until Monday's ruling, abortion care providers are cautiously optimistic about what the decision means for them, as well as what it means for other states with similarly restrictive laws that will now be much more difficult to uphold.We spoke with two employees of the Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas about why the decision is such a huge victory for abortion rights -- and for their ability to simply do their jobs.Rachel Bergstrom-Carlson is the health center manager for the South Austin clinic's ambulatory surgical center. As such, she manages the abortion care site at that location.HuffPost: How are you all feeling in Texas today? Bergstrom-Carlson: It's been very emotional, more than I had thought it would be. After I got over the initial shock of the decision, I was overjoyed. I had tears of joy welling up for the women of Texas, and for reproductive rights in this country. There were a lot of hugs exchanged among the staff members [laughs].Why shock? Was this not the decision you were expecting? We were preparing for the worst. I had three staff on call in case they had ruled to uphold the law, because we were anticipating a huge increase in patient calls and from other providers from centers that were going to have to close. We're usually not open on Mondays, but I came in today just for the decision.Your center hasn't been forced to close, so how did the law affect your work? When the law went into effect, we saw almost double the call volume, our clinic stayed open longer hours, and we still had increased patient wait time both within the clinic and to schedule appointments, because the demand so far outweighed our ability to provide abortion care for the number of women who needed services. We're cautiously optimistic that some of the clinics that closed will re-open, but we're still going to be contending with a lot of patients who have to travel great distances.There are still so many other barriers here, though. For example, we get a good number of referrals from maternal fetal medicine specialists whose patients are dealing with severe fetal abnormalities. Those physicians are not allowed to perform an abortion in the hospital even though it's the best care for the patient. We go above and beyond for those women, but that's a hard one for me to swallow. This is the care they require, and their physicians can't provide them with it because of Texas law.So what happens going forward? It pretty much goes back to business as usual. We're actually overbooked for tomorrow because the demand is still there. I'm just hoping that with this decision, those other clinics can reopen. This is a huge victory, but it is one victory. Texas is really good at creating laws that are ""supposed"" to be good for women, but are really designed to reduce access to abortion care. Kathy Falkenstein, a contact center manager for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas. In that role, she fields thousands of calls and questions from women in Texas every week. How are you feeling? Thrilled! This law would have closed more facilities and placed an even higher burden on Texas women seeking safe, legal abortions.It can be hard to really grasp how much this law hurt abortion access in the state. What did you see? The biggest impact that I have seen are the increases in women traveling hundreds of miles for abortions services -- and the length of time it takes from call to appointment increasing. There are already so many challenges for women seeking safe, legal abortion, and reducing the number of locations by half makes it nearly impossible for so many. At least now we know that it won’t get worse today, and we have the hope of things being better tomorrow.What happens next in Texas? I hope that some of the clinics that closed because of the stringent requirements [of HB2] -- especially in rural areas -- will begin providing services again. It will make services more accessible and affordable for women, which we know also makes them safer.These accounts have been edited and condensed. "

The planet is nearly 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is to the sun.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576fe5fd2200002e00f8307d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Astronomers have found what they say is the youngest fully formed exoplanet ever seen, and it's shaking up ideas about how planets form.""This discovery is a remarkable milestone in exoplanet science,"" Erik Petigura, a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech in Pasadena, California, and coauthor of a paper about the finding, said in a written statement. The discovery, he said, could help explain the origins of Earth ""and eventually the origin of life.""More than 3,000 exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) have been found to date, and just about all are believed to be at least a billion years old. But the newly identified exoplanet, a body roughly six times the size of Earth that's located about 470 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scorpio, is just 5 million to 10 million years old.""You might think of it as an infant,"" Trevor David, an astronomer at Caltech and the paper's lead author, said of the exoplanet in a written statement.And age isn't the only thing unusual about K2-33b, as the exoplanet has been dubbed. It's locked in an extremely tight orbit around its host star. How tight? K2-33b is roughly 10 times closer to its star than Mercury, the innermost planet of our solar system, is to the sun.The fact that such a young exoplanet is so close to its star is surprising, because astronomers had theorized that it takes much longer than 5 million to 10 million years for a star's gravitational forces to pull a planet into such a tight orbit. Or as Petigura told The Huffington Post in an email, K2-33b ""is inconsistent with a whole class of theories that predict planets migrate on timescales of hundreds of millions or billions of years.""So what does explain the infant exoplanet? There are a couple of possibilities, according to David: K2-33b could have been tugged inward rapidly by the very disk of gas and dust from which it formed (a process known as disk migration), or it could have formed in its current location (a process called ""in situ"" planet formation).""The implication is that now both disk migration and in situ formation have more evidence for support,"" David said via email. ""The slower migration scenario that we ruled out might still be relevant in some cases, but we can at least say that it is not the only way to produce a close-in planet.""Petigura added: ""No single discovery is going to answer all our questions about how the earth formed, but as we find more young planets we'll get a clearer picture of how planet formation proceeds in general, which is important for understanding the formation of the earth and the origin of life.""K2-33b was discovered with the help of NASA's Kepler Space Telescope and Hawaii's W.M. Keck Observatory.The paper was published online June 20, 2016, in the journal Nature."

""The kids weren’t saying whether or not they specifically knew who did it. But you had these two groups of people -- where they knew someone from their group of friends had just killed someone from the other group of friends -- and they were able to sit down in this group and have a conversation back and forth about what had just transpired,"" Wolf said. ""They were talking through ways of finding peace and ways of making sure it didn’t escalate further.""For the past few years, Wolf and his colleagues have been studying the impact of the Becoming A Man program, which targets at-risk male students in Chicago public schools. The program, run by the non-profit organization Youth Guidance, allows students to participate in weekly group sessions that teach them how to be more conscious of their decision-making processes. A recent two-year evaluation of the program showed that between 2013 and 2015, there was a 50 percent decline in violent crime arrests for the 2,000 participants as compared to a control group. The results of this evaluation are being shared Monday at the National Summit on Preventing Youth Violence in Baltimore.By teaching these adolescent males how to slow down their decision-making processes and avoid knee-jerk reactions, the program aims to improve students' abilities to make appropriate judgments in high-stakes situations.Wolf spent many days observing the participants in the program. He watched as the boys became more willing to open up about their personal lives to other students in the group and speak about their emotional vulnerabilities. Students in the program often face difficult life circumstances. Many of them live in poverty or in dangerous neighborhoods, surrounded by violence. Just getting to and from school can be a harrowing experience. Counselors push participants to describe ""what are you actually nervous about, what are you actually scared about, what are the things that you're dealing with in your everyday existence, walking home, walking to and from school,"" Wolf said. ""You're not allowed to say that you're fearful or worried about things, but in the BAM circle they're able to uncover those feelings.""""I think a big part of it is, they learn that the kid sitting across from them in the circle has those same fears, has those same anxieties and that it's OK,"" he went on. ""It’s a human condition to show those things and it’s a common experience.""The program does not tell students how to behave, or instruct them as to the ""right"" thing to do, instead leaving it to the students to decide that. The program emphasizes only that the students carefully consider their decisions instead of rushing to act.""BAM providers recognize that these youth live in distressed neighborhoods where being aggressive or even fighting may -- unfortunately -- sometimes be necessary to avoid developing a reputation as someone who is an easy victim,"" says a 2015 working paper from University of Chicago researchers in the National Bureau of Economic Research.""It is not hard to see how someone navigating that sort of neighborhood environment could develop a tendency to reflexively push back against being challenged,"" the paper continues. ""That response can lead to trouble if it is over-generalized and sometimes applied in settings where it is not helpful -- such as school.""BAM says its approach is cost-effective: Every dollar invested in the program is projected to return up to $30 in societal gains as a result of crime reduction. Also, because the program increases graduation rates of participants by 19 percent, it will likely produce additional long-term economic gains.A previous evaluation of the program from researchers in 2009-2010 yielded similarly promising results. ""At a time when Chicago and other cities across the country are seeing increases in violence, this evidence is particularly encouraging,” said Jonathan Guryan, co-director of the University of Chicago Education Lab, in a press release. “Programs like BAM are showing us that it is not too late to help teens in Chicago’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods avoid violence and find success in school.” ______Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

21,POLITICS,The Senate Wants To Let The FBI See Your Browser History. This Democrat Is Trying To Stop It.,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ron-wyden-fbi-browser-history_us_5771a7cae4b017b379f71469,"“If you know what websites a person is visiting, it’s akin to spying on their thoughts.""",2016-06-27,Sen. Ron Wyden says the FBI already has the tools to search terrorists' computers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5771a9221500002a006c878b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Last week, Republican leaders in the Senate held open a floor vote for an hour, trying to corral support for legislation that would have given the FBI the power to search Americans' browser histories without a warrant. That attempt failed narrowly, so the upper chamber will likely give it another go.At least, that’s what Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a staunch privacy advocate, predicts will happen.When senators were first alerted that the provision would be brought up, Wyden thought the move seemed sudden. Lawmakers didn't have much time to figure out what they were voting on.“A conservative came up to me and said, ‘Do you think people know that under this [bill], without any court approval the government can get people’s browsing history?’” Wyden told The Huffington Post. “I said, ‘I don’t think most of the Senate knows that.’”The measure, authored by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.), would have allowed the FBI to use an administrative subpoena to gather people’s digital records, including email, chat records and browsing history. The provision would have been attached to a larger spending bill.McCain and others called for its passage in light of the Orlando, Florida, massacre, arguing that the measure would help the FBI better identify terror threats.In a floor speech leading up to the vote, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the amendment would help the FBI to “connect the dots,” which he added is the “biggest problem that they’ve had in identifying these homegrown, radicalized terrorists, like the shooter in Orlando.”Burr said that under current law the FBI is forced to wait for court approval before it can access web history, which he claimed isn’t feasible during an emergency.But Wyden called that a cop-out. Under the USA Freedom Act, in a section he said he wrote himself, the FBI is able to “demand all of these records immediately in an emergency and get court approval after the fact.”Indeed, the electronic records of Omar Mateen, the man who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State moments before attacking the gay club in Orlando, had been previously reviewed by authorities twice, according to FBI Director James Comey. That’s why Wyden considers the new push a “knee-jerk” reaction to Orlando.“If you know what websites a person is visiting, it’s akin to spying on their thoughts,” Wyden said, adding that he’s geared up to fight whenever Republican leaders try to bring the measure up again.The 58-38 vote didn’t reach the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) flipped his vote to no at the very end, which allows him to bring the measure back up when he sees fit. On Friday, a spokesman for McConnell said there were no scheduled announcements on the amendment. “We only won by a couple of votes, but we still have to win again because there is going to be a revote,” said Wyden, who vowed to talk to as many of his colleagues as he could to round up sufficient opposition.In particular, he's appealing to senators who voted last year against allowing the National Security Agency to continue its bulk metadata collection program of Americans' phone records.“Web browsing history is also incredibly revealing,” Wyden said. “If you know a person visits the website of a mental health professional, or a substance abuse support group, or a political organization, or a particular dating site, you know a lot about that person. To me, this level of intrusiveness ought to come with court oversight and they ought to get a court warrant unless it’s an emergency.”"

Without action, Puerto Rico could be exposed to a flurry of lawsuits, which could lead to hospital closures and squeeze the island's police force, education system and other services.The House has passed a bill to help the island restructure its debt, but the Senate has yet to vote on it. McConnell has said the upper chamber will vote this week, but given the limited time left -- and indication from Democrats that they want amendments -- things could get tricky. The bill includes a provision that puts a temporary stay on any litigation against the government of Puerto Rico, and it would go into effect the moment the president signs the legislation.In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday, Lew said the Senate needs to take up the bill “immediately.”“On July 1 -- only four days from now -- the crisis in Puerto Rico will ratchet up to an even higher level,” Lew said.“In the event of default, and if creditor lawsuits are successful, a judge could immediately order Puerto Rico to pay creditors over essential services such as health, education, and public safety,” Lew wrote. “This could force Puerto Rico to lay off police officers, shut down public transit, or close a hospital. Even a retroactive stay on litigation passed by Congress a few days later would not reverse such a court order.”“The future of Puerto Rico is hanging from a thread,” Puerto Rico Gov. Alejando García Padilla said on Friday. “While our creditors continue to sue the Commonwealth with the intention of collecting their balances, 45 percent of the Puerto Rican people live under the poverty level. There is no alternative to this measure.”Neither Republicans nor Democrats are happy with the bill, which would establish an oversight board to work with the commonwealth on restructuring. Last week, Lew met with Senate Democrats to answer questions about the text. Following the meeting, many seemed unconvinced, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said he has “serious concerns” about the bill, and “at the very minimum we need some amendments."" Opening the legislation to amendments, however, could drag out debate further. “While we do not know the full ramifications if Congress fails to act before the end of the month, we know for certain that it is the 3.5 million American citizens who live in Puerto Rico who will be further harmed,” Lew said in the letter to McConnell."

26,POLITICS,The RNC Plans To Turn Bernie Backers Against Hillary Clinton’s VP Pick,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-vp-choice_us_577027f7e4b0f1683239e34a,"In a strategy memo provided to The Huffington Post, the committee outlines how it will attack the top candidates.",2016-06-27,Elizabeth Warren is one of the three candidates the RNC believes are in Clinton's top tier of VP choices.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Republican National Committee is planning to cleave liberal voters away from Hillary Clinton as part of a campaign to counteract her forthcoming pick of a vice presidential running mate. In a detailed memo outlining its strategy to combat Clinton's VP choice, the committee says it will frame the selection as both a cynical play to certain constituencies and as an emotional letdown for voters who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the Democratic primary. The goals, the memo says, are to ""drive wedges between these top contenders and either Clinton and/or traditional Democrat constituencies, such as labor, environmentalists, and gun control advocates, and other traditional left-wing constituencies;"" and ""[w]here applicable, frame the choice as an insult to the large, deep base of Bernie Sanders supporters who are struggling with the notion of supporting Hillary Clinton as the presumptive Democrat nominee.""Titled ""Project Pander,"" the RNC's strategy memo also reveals which candidates the committee views as most likely to be selected. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), HUD Secretary Julian Castro and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) occupy the top tier; Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) are in the second. Authored by Raj Shah, the research director and deputy communications director at the RNC, the memo telegraphs a campaign of subterfuge that is traditionally executed in private. Parties normally don't like their fingerprints on the attacks against the opposition. But this has been an untraditional election, with both sides relatively unapologetic about the mud they are slinging. Sean Spicer, the RNC's communications director and chief strategist, said that the committee already has conducted extensive field research in San Antonio, Boston and Richmond, Virginia (homes to Castro, Warren and Kaine, respectively) in addition to investigative work on all six potential choices.""We've audited previous research efforts from allied folks, ID-ed relevant video and historical paper archives,"" Spicer said. He added that the committee had filed more than 20 freedom of information requests at the local, state and federal level on these potential VP choices and was ready to deploy operatives for further dirt-digging within 12 hours of an announcement.Clinton's campaign was unperturbed by the RNC's operations, a spokesman said in an email. Nor were they worried about a fissure happening within the party, noting that recent opinion polls show Democratic voters coalescing more quickly around Clinton than Republican voters around their party's presumptive nominee: Donald Trump. ""We aren't concerned,"" said spokesman Brian Fallon. ""While the Democratic party is quickly uniting around Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump actually appears to be losing ground in his bid to consolidate Republicans. More and more members of Trump's own party are realizing he is temperamentally unfit to be President, and there is no amount of Googling by RNC researchers that can fix that."" Though the RNC's research efforts underscore the high stakes of Clinton's choice of running mate, the actual value of a vice presidential pick tends to be overstated. Data shows that the selection rarely helps win a state's electoral votes, though it can marginally improve voter perceptions of a ticket. A pick can, however, create its share of headaches, either by providing damaging distractions (see: Eagleton, Thomas or Palin, Sarah) or by underwhelming voters (Lieberman, Joe or Quayle, Dan).The RNC's overarching goal is to duplicate, in one form or another, such a letdown. With respect to Kaine, the committee's plan of attack will be to paint him as a ""career politician"" whose positions on trade and abortion makes him unpalatable for supporters of Sanders. (Without irony, the RNC's memo also says they will portray a Clinton/Kaine ticket as too liberal for the electorate because of Kaine's support for Obamacare and his time as a lawyer for the ACLU).For Castro, the committee will argue that he is woefully inexperienced and that the limited record he has is a disappointment to liberals: from supporting NAFTA to pushing, while mayor of San Antonio, to get a Connecticut-based gun manufacturer to move its headquarters to the city. ""Castro could easily be portrayed as a John Edwards-esque pick,"" the memo reads, ""whereby someone with good looks but a thin resume is viewed as a novice on the national stage."" A Warren choice, the RNC concedes, would go over well with Sanders supporters. But it would be ""an extreme lurch left"" that the committee would paint as ""intensely liberal and uncompromising."" Interestingly, the RNC hints that it would use the selection of Warren as a means of diminishing Clinton, both by playing up Warren as, in some ways, the more powerful of the two and by portraying Clinton as captive to her base. ""A Clinton-Warren ticket reeks of insincerity,"" the memo reads.(For a complete rundown on the RNC's forthcoming lines of attacks, you can read the full memo here.)Many of the individual attacks that the RNC plans to level at potential VP picks have been used before. Kaine, for instance, took heat from liberals for his stance on abortion when he was named chair of the Democratic National Committee; Warren endured charges that she exaggerated her Native American heritage while running for Senate in Massachusetts. The presidential campaign, however, is a much larger stage and it comes with much deeper scrutiny. The RNC's gambit is that Donald Trump's unique appeal to working-class white voters -- including many who backed Sanders' candidacy -- also represents a potential pitfall for Clinton as she rounds out her ticket.

Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) political muscle in down-ballot races will face a key test Tuesday, as his chosen candidate in New York's 24th congressional district faces off against two competitors who have more support from New York elected officials and Democratic organizations.Sanders went to New York on Friday to campaign for Eric Kingson, a 70-year-old Syracuse University professor and political novice. Kingson co-founded the national organization Social Security Works and started the Strengthen Social Security Coalition, which comprises more than 300 organizations focused on strengthening and expanding Social Security. He has also called for a single-payer health care system, which has been a signature issue for Sanders. ""[W]e need strong members of the U.S. Congress, members who have the guts to stand up to powerful special interests, members who are prepared not just to spend their lives raising money from wealthy people, but to be working and representing the ordinary people of their communities. And Eric is going to be one of those members,"" Sanders said at the rally in Syracuse Friday.Kingson endorsed Sanders for president, whereas his two opponents, former political staffer Colleen Deacon, 38, and attorney Steve Williams, 53, endorsed Hillary Clinton. Deacon worked for the mayor of Syracuse and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the state's two senators. Former DCCC Chair Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) endorsed Williams. The winner will face incumbent Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.). The area is considered a swing district, and Democrats are eyeing it as one of their top targets.Friday's rally was Sanders' first campaign appearance for a congressional candidate, although he's endorsed other progressives, including law professor Tim Canova, who's trying to unseat Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.). The effort is an attempt to not only give Sanders more allies in Congress, but also to show that his progressive brand of politics can sustain a movement beyond his presidential run.Deacon has bristled at being labeled part of the establishment, saying what she brings is ""experience"" and a ""track record ... working with people to achieve change.""""I don't think that should penalized. I think it should be rewarded if you get things done,"" she told The Washington Post. During the campaign, Deacon has spoken frequently about being a single mother living on food stamps and how that helps her relate to the daily struggles of voters. ""Being able to use these programs really afforded me the opportunity to understand what it's like for people, not only in this region, but all over our country,"" she told a local publication, The Citizen, in October. ""I think it affords me a good perspective of what it's like to have to face challenges.""Williams, an attorney and former prosecutor in the U.S. Navy, has focused his message on bringing jobs to the region. ""Creating jobs is the number one thing for this district,"" he said. ""That's been the theme of my campaign from day one. I really want to fight to bring jobs back to this area."""
31,POLITICS,Supreme Court Spares Ex-Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell From Prison,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-bob-mcdonnell-decision_us_577109d6e4b0f1683239fb01,The justices ruled that federal prosecutors overreached when going after the former governor for corruption.,2016-06-27,Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell speaks outside the Supreme Court on April 27 after the court heard oral arguments on the corruption case against him.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Monday gave former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) the reprieve of his life -- reversing his multiple convictions for corruption and effectively sparing him from federal prison.McDonnell had been fighting since last summer for the high court to get involved in his case, and a major stroke of luck came in January, when the justices granted him a rare opportunity to not turn himself in until they issued a final ruling.When the court finally heard the merits of McDonnell's appeal, he seemed to have gotten lucky yet again, with a clear Supreme Court majority expressing deep skepticism over the way the federal government handled his criminal prosecution -- which included a high-profile trial that convicted him and his wife Maureen for receiving lavish gifts in exchange for favors for a pharmaceutical businessman.In a unanimous ruling authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court noted the many indiscretions that led up to McDonnell's prosecution, while leaving open the possibility for a new trial for the former governor.""There is no doubt that this case is distasteful; it may be worse than that,"" Roberts wrote. ""But our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns. It is instead with the broader legal implications of the Government’s boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute.""At the crux of the case was the question of what kind of behavior by elected officials counts as an ""official act"" under federal anti-corruption laws, which prohibit quid pro quo corruption -- or the exchange of something of value for government favor. McDonnel, aided by a coalition of legal scholars, former government officials and defense attorneys, had contended that his actions didn't qualify, and urged the justices not to settle for a definition that sweeps too broadly and punishes otherwise innocent everyday political activity.The Supreme Court on Monday largely agreed, relying on the text of federal law, its own precedents and constitutional principles ""to adopt a more bounded"" reading of what ""official act"" means.""Under that interpretation, setting up a meeting, calling another public official, or hosting an event does not, standing alone, qualify as an 'official act,'"" Roberts wrote.The chief justice explained that something more was required -- specifically, ""a decision or action on a question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy,"" which in turn ""must involve a formal exercise of governmental power"" or use one's position to ""exert pressure on another official to perform an official act.""Pointing to a brief from former White House attorneys who served under both Republican and Democratic presidents, Roberts also noted that the government's proposed reading would lead to a ""breathtaking expansion of public-corruption law"" that ""would likely chill federal officials’ interactions with the people they serve and thus damage their ability effectively to perform their duties.""Given these and other constitutional concerns, Roberts concluded that the jury that convicted McDonnell wasn't properly instructed and that its determinations should be vacated, leaving it to an appeals court to determine whether the case should be set for a new trial or the charges dismissed altogether.And in a sort of nod to federal prosecutors -- such as Preet Bharara, who has risen to prominence in recent years for going after top elected officials in New York -- Roberts seemed to alleviate fears that the ruling might be read to give a boon to corrupt politicians.""A more limited interpretation of the term 'official act' leaves ample room for prosecuting corruption, while comporting with the text of the statute and the precedent of this Court,"" he wrote.In a statement, McDonnell thanked God, the court and his legal team for Monday's result, and expressed hope that this legal ordeal will soon be over.""From the outset, I strongly asserted my innocence before God and under the law,"" he said. ""I have not, and would not, betray the sacred trust the people of Virginia bestowed upon me during 22 years in elected office.""Read the court's ruling below.This story has been updated throughout.

Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), pressed the Defense Department to find this talk radio caller and make him available to lawmakers. In April, Assistant Secretary of Defense Stephen Hedger insisted they were moving as quickly as possible on that request and others, and criticized Gowdy for ""the continuous threats from your staff to subpoena witnesses because we are not able to move quickly enough to accommodate these new requests.""Two months later, the committee was finally able to interview ""John from Iowa."" In a statement, it questioned whether Hedger was being honest when he said the Pentagon could not locate him, since it would be ""hard to imagine just how much incompetence would be required for that to be true.""On Monday, the Democratic members of the Benghazi committee released their own report, saying the GOP statement was skirting around the main issue: In the end, ""John from Iowa"" didn't really have anything to add. ""In fact, 'John from Iowa' provided virtually no new substantive information about the attacks and instead explained that he had called into Sean Hannity's radio show only to make sure that Congress had access to the drone video, which he stated was the best evidence of what occurred on the night of the attacks,"" reads the report. From the interview with ""John from Iowa,"" as included in the report: Q: And is there anything that you would have been able to see that one can't observe from watching the video?The Democratic report backs up Hedger, who argued to Gowdy that tracking down ""John from Iowa"" and the other drone operators was ""unnecessary since we have given the Committee access to the relevant RPA [Remotely Piloted Aircraft] video from that night and it remains unclear that additional information could be gained from these interviews.""In other words, Hedger believed the committee was drowning the Pentagon in unnecessary busy work.Democrats said they issued their report Monday because they believe that after two years and $7 million, it was time to end the committee's work:Despite our repeated requests over the last several months, Republicans have refused to provide us with a draft of their report -- or even a basic outline -- making it impossible for us to provide input and obvious that we are being shut out of the process until the last possible moment. Our overarching conclusion is that the evidence obtained by the Select Committee confirms the core findings already issued by many previous investigations into the attacks in Benghazi. Although the Select Committee obtained additional details that provide context and granularity, these details do not fundamentally alter the previous conclusions.In response, Benghazi Press Secretary Matt Wolking criticized Democrats for refusing to participate over the past two years ""in the Majority's serious, fact-centered investigation."" He also insisted that their investigation was not focused primarily on going after Hillary Clinton and her time as secretary of state. ""The dishonest Democrats on this committee falsely claimed everything had been 'asked and answered,'"" Wolking said. ""They said the committee had found ‘absolutely nothing new.’ If that’s changed, they should come clean and admit it. If not, everyone can ignore their rehashed, partisan talking points defending their endorsed candidate for president.""Gowdy had said he wanted to issue his committee's report before summer, but the process was delayed because of administration foot-dragging."

Anti-FGM organization the Orchid Project started an online petition in response, stating that the article puts forth “misguided assumptions” about FGM:“There is no evidence that a ‘lesser form’ of FGM leads to ‘no long-lasting harm,’” the petition reads. “The Economist has now joined others in taking a stance of ‘advocating minor forms of FGM.’ It is a grossly irresponsible position, which contravenes international guidance and medics' own pledge to ‘do no harm.’”FGM involves the total or partial removal of, or injury to, the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons. The World Health Organization considers the practice a violation of women and girls’ rights.Communities often practice FGM in order to maintain girls’ “sexual purity” and marriage prospects.

The piece sees nicks as a “harm reduction” approach: “Might ‘harm reduction’ lend spurious legitimacy to all types of FGM? Yes,” reads the article. “But it has worked in other fields.

In 2010, the American Academy for Pediatrics released a statement suggesting “ritual nicks” as a “compromise to avoid greater harm.” Some experts later called that a setback in the movement to end FGM.“Working on taboo and neglected issues like ending FGM is hard enough without well-respected publications like the Economist creating policy on the hoof and taking a line that puts our discussions back by decades,” Orchid Project CEO Julia Lalla-Maharajh told the Guardian. “It discredits the experiences of women who have undergone FGM and is a highly regressive step.”When the Guardian asked Helen Joyce, who commissioned and edited the Economist article, to respond to the activists' criticism, Joyce stated: “Our article is our statement.

The piece sees nicks as a “harm reduction” approach: “Might ‘harm reduction’ lend spurious legitimacy to all types of FGM? Yes,” reads the article. “But it has worked in other fields. Shooting galleries for heroin reduced HIV without increasing drug-taking. Free housing keeps homeless alcoholics out of hospital and helps them drink less.”The Orchid Project petition responds to the “harm reduction” theory, stating that genital cutting in any form is a violation of women's rights and lives:“Belief in a 'safer' cut through medicalization or a 'lesser' cut, does not constitute progress,” the Orchid Project petition reads. “Lives are at risk and rights continue to be violated.”The Economist is not the first entity to suggest “minor cutting” to curb FGM. In 2010, the American Academy for Pediatrics released a statement suggesting “ritual nicks” as a “compromise to avoid greater harm.” Some experts later called that a setback in the movement to end FGM.“Working on taboo and neglected issues like ending FGM is hard enough without well-respected publications like the Economist creating policy on the hoof and taking a line that puts our discussions back by decades,” Orchid Project CEO Julia Lalla-Maharajh told the Guardian. “It discredits the experiences of women who have undergone FGM and is a highly regressive step.”When the Guardian asked Helen Joyce, who commissioned and edited the Economist article, to respond to the activists' criticism, Joyce stated: “Our article is our statement. We have no further comment.”H/T The Guardian"

Spain has the largest population of Roma in Western Europe -- and it shares the wider Roma population’s history of persecution. While conditions and integration for the Roma community are better in Spain than in other European countries, members of the young Roma generation are often faced with exclusion and intolerance. Only five percent of Roma students in Spain complete upper-secondary education, and 25 percent of the Spanish population would not allow their children to study in the same school with Romani students.Mucha’s intimate photos show girls in their bedrooms, or details of daily life in Roma households outside of the Spanish city. The photographer, whose work often focuses on human rights, gender and social change, says she took on this project to challenge stereotypes.""I focused on the young generation and tried to reveal a glimpse of their world, since their future seems to offer little promise, and stereotypes, racial discrimination and social exclusion are the main factors that affect their lives,” she told HuffPost Italy.Mucha’s photo series, ""Wonderful,"" is on display at the Goethe Institute in Barcelona, Spain until 7 July. This piece was originally published on HuffPost Italy and has been translated into English. "
