Jeb Bush, according to The New York Times, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, according to The Associated Press, will disclose their bundlers in October. They join former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a Democratic presidential candidate, in agreeing to disclose the big-money fundraisers who collect contributions for the campaigns.The decision by Bush and Walker to disclose their bundlers comes after no Republican candidates in the 2012 presidential election volunteered to reveal the identities of their top fundraisers. In 2008, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a proponent of campaign finance reform, released names of his bundlers. George W. Bush revealed bundler names in both the 2000 and 2004 elections. Other Republican presidential candidates, however, are not on board with transparency. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), won't voluntarily disclose their bundlers, spokespeople told the Times.It isn’t yet clear how much information the candidates who will disclose their bundlers will reveal. In 2008 and 2012, President Barack Obama released bundler names in ranges, from a low of $50,001 to $100,000, to $500,001 and above. When Clinton disclosed her bundlers in the 2008 Democratic primary, she released only those raising $100,000 or more."

Scott Walker, speaks during a campaign event at a Harley-Davidson dealership Tuesday, July 14, 2015, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) is making a big mistake with his lawsuit against the federal government over drug testing food stamp recipients, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Wednesday. ""Gov. Walker hasn’t read the law,"" Vilsack told The Huffington Post in an interview. ""It’s always a good idea before you start litigation to understand what the law is.""On Sunday, Walker signed a state law that would impose screening and drug tests on childless, able-bodied adults who want food stamps in Wisconsin. The USDA has long maintained that federal law doesn't allow states to drug test food stamp beneficiaries.To get around the restriction, the new Wisconsin law also redefined food stamp beneficiaries as ""welfare recipients,"" since the federal government does allow drug testing of some people on welfare. The Walker administration then sued the Agriculture Department in federal court to settle the matter. ""The law that authorizes and approves drug testing is for people who are receiving cash assistance under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program,"" Vilsack said. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, colloquially named ""welfare reform,"" created the TANF program and also tweaked some parts of what was then known as the Food Stamp Program. It contained a provision allowing states to conduct some drug testing of ""welfare recipients,"" though the provision has long been understood to apply to people on TANF, not to people on SNAP. In 2013, Republicans in Congress tried to change federal law to explicitly allow states to conduct food stamp drug testing, but Democrats managed to beat back the proposal.""There is a clear distinction in the law between welfare recipients and public benefit recipients, and the distinction is important as it relates to the ability to drug test or provide additional burdens"" on people seeking benefits, Vilsack said.  Vilsack wondered whether Walker, who announced his presidential candidacy on Monday, was more interested in fighting poverty in Wisconsin or winning over Republican primary voters in Iowa. ""You just wonder whether this is real or it’s politics,"" Vilsack said. ""If it’s real, it’s unfortunate. If it’s politics, it’s even more so.""Roughly 46 million Americans receive SNAP benefits; TANF, by contrast, only serves about 4 million people, mostly single moms and their children. "

Their parents' last request before letting go of the place? That they clean up their room.

At least, we hope so. Alongside Fey and Poehler, the movie stars fellow ""SNL"" alum Maya Rudolph, Ike Barinholtz, John Leguizamo, Dianne Wiest, John Cena and James Brolin.

For producer-DJ Diplo, the past 12 years have been a slow but unrelenting march from the ultra-hip fringes to the dead center of pop music. Right now, he has two Top 20 singles from two different projects: the Justin Bieber-featuring ""Where R U Now,"" from his Jack Ü collaboration with Skrillex, and ""Lean On,"" from his dancehall-inflected act Major Lazer, which went from studio lark to festival-packing force. Diplo, who first broke through to the mainstream circa 2005 as M.I.A.'s producer, says there's never been a master plan: ""I've been 100 percent improvising,"" he says. ""When I moved to L.A. to produce and write, I kept DJ'ing on the side, but I thought that was never gonna go anywhere.""So is Justin Bieber officially cool now?He'd been stuck in a rut where he has to do a certain thing because of his fan base. Guy from Disclosure texted me, ""Yo, man, that Bieber record is amazing,"" and I'm like, ""Man, you would've never written that a year ago,"" and he's like, ""I know, this is very difficult for me to text right now."" Bieber's personal life is whatever it is — he's a rich kid and he's pretty much gonna have to be a jerk. But he's respectful to me, and he has that weird gene where he's good at everything: better at basketball than me, better at drums. For us it's more like an art project where you utilize his voice.The 25 DJs That Rule the Earth You're a thoughtful guy, but your social-media persona is sort of obnoxious. Why?If I have a fight with somebody, it makes me look like a prick, but it makes the social-media numbers explode. It's the Kanye West theory: In 2015, become a prick and just get more popular. I don't want to be thought of like that, but also I just don't really care. I'm doing jokes and people take it seriously, like that's the person I am.Any chance of squashing your beef with Taylor Swift, after your comments about her ""booty""?We squashed it! I saw her at the Grammys and she was supernice and cool. Her fans loved the beef, though. That's all they have — they don't have, like, real things going on. It's still startling when these artists pay attention to my Twitter. Like, Ed Sheeran unfollowed me when I said something about Taylor — I can't believe these people even know who I am.12 Biggest Feuds of the Past YearEDM's rise boosted your career, but you also stand apart from it. How do you see that relationship?It's been a slow evolution in America — you still have the biggest, glossiest, most masculine music at EDM raves. But it's got young people excited about music. Jack Ü is headlining festivals now, and Skrillex and I are up there playing random records, doing what I love, being unpredictable, being trendsetting. Some of the big guys are changing too — David Guetta's new album, nothing's really dance on that. And there's stuff like Disclosure and [French house producer] Tchami that's not about being the biggest and brightest. Skrillex — there's no precedent for what he's doing and what he could do. His persona can be as big as a rock star.You co-produced several songs on Madonna's new one, including her new single. What do you make of the ageism she faces?She created the world we live in. It already sucks to be a woman in the music industry, but to be a boss woman is even harder. She sold out her tour in minutes, but no one seems to want her to succeed — ""Madonna, we've been there, done that, now we're about Kim Kardashian."" Her song ""Ghosttown"" was a guaranteed Number One for anybody else, but she didn't get a fair shot. With ""Bitch I'm Madonna,"" everyone said there's no way it will go anywhere, but I'm like, ""Screw it, it represents you more than anything.""50 Most Important People in EDMYou're 36 — do you worry about aging out of pop yourself?There's not usually the old white dude in the music industry. You either get a job in management or you're Willie Nelson — the only dude that's cool and old. But age has nothing to do with it, as long as people are paying attention to me.Your music is pretty raucous — what do you listen to when you want something chill?I love Marvin Gaye, I like jazz and all that stuff. I used to be a record collector. Mark Ronson, Questlove and I used to be part of, like, a record-trading crew. Classic rock, psychedelic rock — I like to dig up old music and see what I can get influenced by.45 Best Albums of 2015 So FarWhat would you do with a rock band?I've done a lot of songs with Ezra Koenig [of Vampire Weekend], some really cool stuff that I hope people get to hear. We wrote a couple of things for another artist that might be huge records for the end of summer — one of them started with a Vampire Weekend idea. But he's not traditional rock — he's like me, a hodgepodge of styles and influences. And I have a studio with [producer] Ariel Rechtshaid, so every day I'm harassing Haim to listen to my beats. But I don't make anything that they ever like [laughs]! My first production job after M.I.A. was actually the xx, but they didn't like what I did, and at the end of the day we used their demos.50 Top Tweeters in MusicAny other unexpected collaborators?I just did a session with the Band Perry, and I didn't think that would work. But I listened to it yesterday — I'm like, ""Yo, this is a big, awesome song."" The way we recorded it was unorthodox — I just did it in a room with a mandolin. I mean, I'll try anything once.Also on HuffPost:"

Paul LePage (R) has apologized to a high school student for joking that he'd like to shoot his father, a prominent cartoonist in the state. LePage made the widely criticized comment in late June, during his remarks at the annual gathering of Dirigo Boys State, a youth leadership program. At one point, Nick Danby, 17, stood up and asked the governor a question. When the governor realized the student's father is George Danby, the political cartoonist for the Bangor Daily News, LePage said what he'd like to do to him.LePage has now apologized to the younger Danby in a handwritten note, the Bangor Daily News reported Monday. In reply, Nick said there were no hard feelings whatsoever.""Thank you for the warm and thoughtful note -- I appreciate your concern and frankness,"" Nick wrote in a letter back to LePage. ""I wanted to respond by telling you that I was not offended -- I thought they were quite humorous — nor was I the one who reported the incident -- I think in many respects you were simply representing the feelings of many Mainers.""He said he also didn't appreciate being portrayed in the media as a ""heartbroken child"" at the event. George Danby told The Huffington Post in June that he did not find the governor's remarks funny at all, especially in light of the shooting of five Charlie Hebdo cartoonists in France earlier this year. ""The governor shouldn't be making those comments, even though I know he doesn't care for my stuff because I pick on him quite a bit in my cartoon,"" George said. ""But it's always within the boundaries of fairness and free speech and satire."" The Association of American Editorial Cartoonists also condemned the governor's comments, saying they were ""nothing short of absolutely reprehensible"" and ""beneath contempt."" LePage does not like Maine's newspapers, as he has made clear on several occasions. In August 2014, he said the ""worst part"" of his life was that ""newspapers are still alive."" In February 2013, he said newspapers were his ""greatest fear."" He has also said he wants to ""blow... up"" the headquarters of the Portland Press Herald."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58583cc41c000011070ec689.jpeg?cache=5X9XcPNMAD&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," U.S. officials created the Central American Minors Refugee/Parole Program to discourage children from taking the dangerous trip through Mexico to the U.S. In this July 12, 2014, photo, Central American migrants climb on a north-bound train during their journey toward the U.S.-Mexico border.WASHINGTON -- There's less focus this year on the conditions in Central America that led tens of thousands of children and teenagers to flee to the U.S. last fiscal year, but many in the region are still trying to get out.  Some of them will be able to do so under a new program that lets them apply in their countries to join their lawfully present parents in the U.S. and have refugee or parole status. So far, only about 2,300 people have applied, according to the State Department, and proponents of the program say more needs to be done to get the word out. ""Frankly, not enough people have taken advantage of the program -- it's in the low thousands,"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Tuesday. ""I'd like to see more use that method versus trying to make the journey through Mexico, which is very dangerous, and crossing our border illegally.""The Obama administration announced the Central American Minors Refugee/Parole Program, or CAM, in November as one of many responses to an influx in unaccompanied children and teenagers crossing the border illegally.Nearly 70,000 children traveling without their parents were apprehended last fiscal year, most of them originally from the Central American countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, all of which have suffered a rash of violence in recent years.Numbers are down significantly this year, but minors are still coming to the U.S. illegally. From Oct. 1 to June 30, there were about 26,700 apprehensions of unaccompanied minors, compared to about 57,500 during the same period the year before.The U.S. accepts up to 70,000 refugees each year, all of whom must show they have a well-founded fear of persecution in their native country for their religion, race, nationality or membership in a particular social group, and that they are unable to receive protection from their country. Under the CAM program, lawfully present immigrants from Central American countries can file a request for an unmarried child under the age of 21 to be resettled in the U.S. as a refugee, if they meet the requirements. Under some circumstances, the child's parent can also be granted refugee status under the program.If someone is rejected for refugee status under the CAM program, they might still be approved for parole in the U.S. on a case-by-case basis for humanitarian reasons, which does not allow them to get transportation to the U.S. or resettlement help and benefits once they arrive, as refugees do.As of Monday, 2,311 people had applied for the CAM program: 1,957 from El Salvador, 43 from Guatemala and 311 from Honduras. The government is still in the process of reviewing applications. U.S. officials say the goal was to allow minors who are in unsafe conditions to reunite with their parents in the U.S. legally, while also working to improve those conditions so fewer people feel they need to flee.""This program was to take care of a part of the phenomenon that we saw last year, which was so many children coming without their parents and showing up after taking such a serious trip,"" Anne Richard, assistant secretary of state for population, refugees, and migration, said in an interview. ""There's a lot of other things that also need to be done, that are being done, to address this problem.""The U.S. government has tried to get the word out about the program, aided by refugee-oriented non-governmental organizations tasked with helping people submit applications. Martin Zogg, executive director of the International Rescue Committee in Los Angeles, said his organization even hired a staffer specifically dedicated to outreach about the CAM program, but that there's still ""an enormous concern"" that some of the people eligible for the program aren't aware of it.Another problem is the many people who are ineligible. Since only parents lawfully present in the U.S. can apply for their children, not every child facing danger in Central America has a chance at relief through the CAM program.""This is a really wonderful opportunity, but ... it's not the solution,"" Zogg said. ""This is not a program that addresses the breadth of the humanitarian emergency that exists in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador for these kids.""Children and teenagers who are still trying to come to the U.S. through Mexico face the risk of being deported without a proper screening that could find they are eligible for some type of relief. The U.S. has worked with Mexico to increase detentions and deportations on Mexico's southern border with Guatemala, stopping children before they can make it to the U.S. In a reverse from last year, Mexico detained more Central Americans than the U.S. did from October 2014 to April 2015.Although Mexico has protections for asylum in place, critics say they aren't being followed and that children are at risk of being deported even if they have valid asylum claims.The CAM program ""is an acknowledgment that many of these kids are refugees, in other words they have valid asylum claims,"" said Kevin Appleby, director of migration policy and public affairs at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. But he added that the government is still working with other countries to keep many minors out. ""It's a bit of hope to provide them some safe haven when at the same time ... we're cooperating with Mexico and Central American countries to interdict them and to send them back, where they don't get any screening,"" he said."

He was pulled from a group of men during the mass casting process, and pageant directors asked him to walk back and forth a few paces.“Then they said, ‘we’d love you to be Joseph,'” he said.Hancey plays Smith in one of the production’s last scenes, when the character is interacting with early Mormon believers in America.

The role requires mock sword skills, a glued-on beard and a lot of speaking parts, for which Campbell will mouth lines spoken from the soundtrack.“I was pretty excited … but this is I guess kind of demanding. They’re having me rehearse a lot,” he said.Laman eventually loses a major battle against his shorter but more righteous brother Nephi — “The whole point of the story is the Lord will support the righteous and the wicked will not win, even with their own strength,” he said.Garrow, who’s in his 10th pageant this year, stands front and center for a battle dance scene as a member of Nephi’s army. After several years in the same role, his high-flying moves could rival those of a trained Broadway dancer.“I remember the first time doing any of these dances, and I was like, ‘I have no idea what I’m doing … my body doesn’t move in this way,’ ” he said. “You have to be confident in yourself that you’re going to be able to just do it and that God’s going to be able to help you.”Marc and Daniela Rauh almost missed the pageant’s first few days due to an airline strike.The family traveled to the U.S. from their home city of Basel, Switzerland — the strike was postponed at the last minute — to be a part of bringing their scriptures to life in western New York.“I wanted to find the source of my beliefs … to feel the spirit of the history that’s taken place right here on the Hill Cumorah,” said Marc Rauh.The Rauhs and their four children all perform in the production — Marc Rauh plays an unbelieving crowd member, and Daniela Rauh plays an ancient Mormon prophet’s convert.“It’s just exciting to experience everything that we read in the Book of Mormon,” said Daniela Rauh. “It’s like a different perspective to feel how this person felt.”(Taddeo reports for the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle in New York.)"

In the wake of teen star Amandla Stenberg's recent comments on Kylie Jenner, Cohen asked Cox and fellow guest Andre Leon Talley on a July 12 broadcast whether ""white girls and cornrows"" was culturally insensitive or not.Both Cox and Talley avoided responding, leading many online commenters to interpreting Cox's response as apparent indifference and a failure to come to the defense of Stenberg (who Cohen dubbed the ""jackhole of the day""). ""In that moment, I... felt that the topic of cultural appropriation needs way more than the 10 seconds or less I had to respond at the end of the show to fully unpack,"" Cox wrote in a blog post on Tuesday night. The ""Orange Is the New Black"" star explained that she was unfamiliar with Stenberg, and did not want to get involved in a ""celebrity feud."" Cox revealed she has since researched Stenberg and watched her video on cultural appropriation (""Don't Cash Crop My Cornrows""), and was very impressed with her knowledge on the issue. Cox wrote, ""I was most moved by the question she poses at the end of her video, a question I, too, have asked from lecture stages. 'What would America be like if we loved black people as much as we love black culture?'""The actress concluded her essay by asking for a continuing dialogue about the issue, while posing a question of her own: “How do we lovingly make people aware of [cultural] history and the potential affects of cultural appropriation that further marginalize and stigmatize those already the most adversely affected by systems that disadvantage certain experiences, bodies and identities over others?”Since the Sunday night ""Watch What Happens Live"" show aired, a #BoycottBravo tag has began to trend on Twitter, and Andy Cohen has publicly apologized to Stenberg for his comments.

Many of those veterans are elderly and need family care or company, but their families face long wait times -- sometimes more than 20 years -- to immigrate to the U.S.The Department of Homeland Security will work with the State Department to create a program that allows certain family members of the veterans to come to the U.S. under parole status on a case-by-case basis, rather than through the general family immigration process.""These are people who are eligible for an immigration visa by virtue of their U.S. citizen family member, who also happens to be a veteran who served in the second world war,"" a White House official told The Huffington Post. ""But because the family immigration system is so backlogged, it can take decades for them to actually get a visa.""The new policy is one of many ways the administration is seeking to change the immigration system through executive actions, as President Barack Obama announced last November. Although the most-noticed portion of the executive actions -- programs to allow some undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. and work -- are blocked in the courts, the administration is moving ahead with other changes and recommendations.In a report released Wednesday, the White House laid out plans for the legal immigration system, which has seen few changes since 1991. It includes an overhaul to modernize the way people apply for visas, much of which is currently paper-based and slow.The plan for a parole program for family members of Filipino veterans follows up on attempts in recent years to do right by the surviving veterans of the estimated 260,000 Filipino soldiers who fought for the United States during World War II. They were promised U.S. citizenship but then denied it, and waited until the 1990s to finally be eligible to become citizens. As many as 26,000 Filipino World War II veterans became U.S. citizens, and an estimated 6,000 of them are still alive and living in the country, according to the White House.As citizens, they are eligible to petition for family members to immigrate to the U.S., but the backlogged visa system, particularly from the Phillippines, means some might not be able to reunite with family during their lifetimes.""These are World War II veterans, so you can just think about how old they are and how long they've waited,"" said Erin Oshiro, director of the Immigrant Rights Program at Advancing Justice.Lawmakers have pushed for the change for years, without success. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), who has introduced multiple pieces of legislation on the issue, said Wednesday that the news was ""long overdue.""""Many Filipino veterans have waited decades to be reunited with their children -- today’s action is the right thing to do for these brave people who served our country,"" she said in a statement. ""For many years, I’ve fought to end the visa backlog for the sons and daughters of Filipino World War II veterans, whether through legislation or other avenues like today’s announcement by the president. We made a promise to these individuals, and expediting reunification with their children through parole brings us one significant step closer in fulfilling that promise.”"

The object of the game is simple: Score baskets with a forehead backboard attached via headband -- LeBron's favorite basketball accessory. LeBron and Fallon struggled along in Faceketball before agreeing to a dunk-off. Fallon's Jumpman pose was on-point:Jimmy Fallon soars above LeBron James for a ""Faceketball"" dunk. More importantly, however, Fallon had LeBron address this infamous photo, which made its internet debut last Tuesday and was a viral hit. “That’s Gabrielle Union, that’s Dwyane Wade, her husband, that’s Chris Paul, the great point guard from the Clippers, but that’s not me,"" said LeBron, who half-heartedly claimed he was photoshopped into the photo.  ""I was back home in Akron, Ohio, when this happened.” SURE. Getting back to basketball, Fallon also asked LeBron about dealing with the NBA Finals loss. Last month, his Cleveland Cavaliers fell to the Golden State Warriors in six games. It's something LeBron's admitted to having nightmares over, but he credits his kids in helping him move past it all. “It doesn’t matter how well you play or how bad you play, when you come home, the kids put a smile on your face,"" LeBron told Fallon.In the James household, it's all smiles until the kids start talking about the game. LeBron's three kids, LeBron Jr., Bryce and Zhuri, like to remind him that it does matter how he plays:“Kids are very, very blunt. There’s no sugarcoating with kids. If you go out and you don’t perform well, ‘Daddy, why did you lose? Why didn’t you play well tonight? It’s your fault you lost.’"" Tough crowd.  Also on HuffPost:"

In her economic policy speech Monday, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton seemed to distance herself from Uber, focusing instead on the implications for the labor market and the risks faced by drivers who aren't shielded by benefits and job security. “This ‘on demand’ or so-called ‘gig economy’ is creating exciting opportunities and unleashing innovation, but it’s also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future,” she said.  GOP candidates, meanwhile, have rushed to align themselves with Uber, touting its role as an innovator and job creator. Politico reported that Jeb Bush plans to take an Uber ride in San Francisco, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul fired back at Clinton's speech, writing on Twitter, “Services like Uber, Airbnb, and Lyft stimulate our economy and work towards lower prices. How is this bad @HillaryClinton?”Uber, which has run into regulatory roadblocks in numerous U.S. cities, has emerged as a polarizing symbol of the sharing economy. A major concern is that its business model, which relies on drivers whom it defines as independent contractors rather than employees, is leaving these workers exposed without benefits and forced to pay any costs they incur during trips. While Uber offers drivers schedule flexibility and relief from high taxi medallion costs, it also creates uncertainty when it comes to drivers' wages and job statuses.Drivers have complained of Uber's exploitative tactics, including failing to pay up on promised fares earned.The California Labor Commission ruled last month that an Uber driver was an employee, not a contractor. But the ruling applies only to the driver involved in the case, Barbara Ann Berwick, and Uber has beaten back attempts in other states to have its drivers classified as employees.“Our economy is designed to provide a social safety net to people who have full-time jobs, but we don’t have the infrastructure to provide a similar safety net for people who do productive work but are not full time,” said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. “Uber drivers are trying to become full time because that’s where benefits are, but classifying them as full time is retrofitting an old system. There’s a new way people are making a living, and it’s about finding a way to extend protections to more of them.”In her speech, Clinton also outlined government action that would combat income inequality. Some research has suggested that companies like Uber may help alleviate some of those tensions. “There’s a growing recognition that these sharing platforms can help reduce inequality,” Sundararajan said. “They’re democratizing access to a lot of things that used to be reserved for richer people, like cars.”Like many startups of its kind, Uber capitalizes on the gaping inefficiencies in traditional systems. “Uber is easier to be upset with because it highlights the weaknesses of transportation systems in towns, specifically taxi franchises,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester who studies digital disruption. “It might create new problems, but it does solve some old ones.”That hasn’t stopped Uber from aggressively expanding into new markets and continuing to battle with policymakers and local taxi commissions. It grew six times in size in 2014, and is currently valued at $50 billion. “Uber opposes anyone that opposes them. It’s the same message: We are the future, get used to us. That may be true, but not in a politically adept way,” McQuivey said. With the election cycle kicking into high gear, Uber should be wary of not becoming the “poster child for the excesses of Silicon Valley exploitative innovation,” McQuivey said.Uber has appeared much less willing to work with regulators than its peers in the sharing economy. Airbnb, for example, has made efforts to appease concerns over the shrinking number of affordable housing options: It removed 2,000 hosts in New York from its website last year after a report by the state attorney general claimed that almost three-fourths of its listings were operating as illegal hotels, and in April cut ties with hugely profitable vacation-rental firms in Los Angeles.After repeatedly running ashore of local regulations, Uber might need to pedal back as politicians begin to take a harder stand against it.“Uber realizes it needs to adopt a more collaborative approach,” said Alex Stephany, who studied the sharing economy in his book The Business of Sharing and serves as CEO of JustPark, an app that matches drivers with parking spaces. “The challenge for Uber now is still to be aggressive operationally, but begin to forge bonds with the people it has alienated.”"

Scott Walker speaks at Red Rock Harley-Davidson on July 14, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Walker launched his campaign on July 13, joining 14 other Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential race.

Scott Walker, one of many Republicans seeking their party's presidential nomination, is suing the federal government over his plan to make some food stamp recipients pee in cups to prove they're not on drugs. Federal law doesn't give states much room to impose new conditions on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. The program is known informally by its former name, food stamps, and in Wisconsin it's called FoodShare. “This lawsuit seeks to provide clarity that the State of Wisconsin has the authority to require drug testing for FoodShare recipients,” Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said in a press release on Tuesday. While federal law doesn't allow states to impose drug tests on SNAP recipients, it does allow states to drug test and in general make up their own rules for the much smaller Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which serves about 4 million Americans. Roughly 46 million Americans receive SNAP benefits. ""Gov. Walker hasn’t read the law,"" U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told The Huffington Post in an interview Wednesday. ""It’s always a good idea before you start litigation to understand what the law is.""The Wisconsin lawsuit appears to hinge on whether the state can treat SNAP recipients like TANF recipients. The state evidently thinks it can: The new law that calls for drug tests also claims that an ""individual who is a recipient under the food stamp program is considered to be a welfare recipient.""Temporary Assistance for Needy Families is the program most commonly called ""welfare,"" though Republicans have used the term to describe most means-tested safety net programs. In its press release about the lawsuit, Wisconsin says the state's position is that ""FoodShare recipients are 'welfare recipients' and therefore may be tested and sanctioned for the use of controlled substances.""By any measure, TANF and SNAP are very different programs. SNAP is an entitlement that gives monthly food vouchers (in the form of debit cards) to anyone poor enough to qualify, with some restrictions on able-bodied adults without dependents and not too many differences across state lines. TANF, meanwhile, is generally for single mothers who meet a range of requirements that can vary widely by state. Annual federal spending for TANF is capped at about $16 billion, while annual spending for SNAP has surged to nearly five times that amount in the wake of the Great Recession.Republicans in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail have frequently called for bringing ""welfare reform"" to food stamps and Medicaid, since the major welfare reform legislation of 1996 stunted TANF spending and enrollment. When Georgia tried to drug test food stamp recipients last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said no. ""Requiring SNAP applicants and recipients to pass a drug test in order to receive benefits would constitute an additional condition of eligibility, and therefore, is not allowable under law,"" the USDA told Georgia. This article has been updated with comments from Vilsack."

(Bill Ingalls/NASA via AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LAUREL, Md., July 14 (Reuters) - A U.S. spacecraft sailed past the tiny planet Pluto in the distant reaches of the solar system on Tuesday, capping a journey of 3 billion miles (4.88 billion km) that began nine and a half years ago.NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft passed by the ice-and-rock planetoid and its entourage of five moons at 7:49 a.m. EDT (1149 GMT). The event culminated an initiative to survey the solar system that the space agency embarked upon more than 50 years ago.“Pluto just had its first visitor,” President Obama posted on Twitter. “Thanks NASA. It’s a great day for discovery and American leadership.”About 13 hours after its closest approach to Pluto, the last major unexplored body in the solar system, New Horizons phoned home, signaling that it had survived its 31,000 miles per hour(49,000 km per hour) blitz through the Pluto system.Managers had estimated there was a 1-in-10,000 chance a debris strike could destroy New Horizons as it soared just 7,750 miles (12,472 km) - about the distance from New York to Mumbai - from Pluto.But right on time, New Horizons made radio contact with flight controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab outside Baltimore, sparking a wave of shouts and applause from an overflow crowd gathered to watch the drama unfold.With 99 percent of the data gathered during the encounter still on the spaceship, New Horizons’ survival was critical to the mission.“This is a tremendous moment in human history,” said John Grunsfeld, NASA’s associate administrator for science.New Horizons spent more than eight hours after its closest approach looking back at Pluto for a series of experiments to study the planet's atmosphere and photograph its night-side using light reflected off its primary moon Charon.Sending back its first post-flyby signal took another four-and-a-half hours, the time it takes radio signals, traveling at light speed, to travel the 3 billion miles (4.88 billion km) back to Earth.Already, the trickle of images and measurements relayed from New Horizons before Tuesday's pass by Pluto has changed scientists' understanding of this diminutive world, which is smaller than Earth's moon.Once considered an icy, dead world, the planetoid has yielded signs of geological activity, with evidence of past and possibly present-day tectonics, or movements of its crust.""This is clearly a world where both geology and atmosphere climatology play a role,"" said Alan Stern, New Horizons lead scientist, with the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. He noted that it appears that nitrogen and methane snow fall on Pluto.Pluto circles the sun every 248 years in a highly tilted orbit that creates radical changes from season to season. Pluto travels closer to the sun than the orbit of Neptune before it cycles back into the solar system's deep freeze more than 40 times farther away than Earth.Scientists have many questions about Pluto, which was still considered the solar system's ninth planet when New Horizons was launched in 2006. Pluto was reclassified as a ""dwarf planet"" after the discovery of other Pluto-like spheres orbiting in the Kuiper Belt, the region beyond the eighth planet, Neptune. The objects are believed to be remnants from the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago.""Now the solar system will be further opened up to us, revealing the secrets of distant Pluto,"" British cosmologist Stephen Hawking said in a message broadcast on NASA TV.""We explore because we are human and we want to know. I hope that Pluto will help us on that journey,"" Hawking said.It will take about 16 months for New Horizons to transmit back all the thousands of images and measurements taken during its pass by Pluto. By then, the spacecraft will have traveled even deeper into the Kuiper Belt, heading for a possible follow-on mission to one of Pluto's cousins. (Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Richard Pullin)"

Shortly after, Lee took to his Instagram account to post a photo of the project’s production slate along with a caption directed towards critics who bashed the film due to its title and content. “To the misinformed critics of Chi-Raq during the principle photography June 1st-July 9th there were 331 people shot and wounded plus 69 Murdered,” Lee wrote to his 130k followers. “May God bless them, their families and friends.”Earlier this month, the city made national headlines for the high number of shootings that occurred over the 4 of July weekend. According to reports, more than 80 people were shot, 15 of whom were killed. The film will be produced by the newly launched Amazon Studios. “Spike Lee is one of the most distinct and visionary filmmakers of our time,” Ted Hope, Head of Motion Picture Production at Amazon Studios, said in a press release.“It would be impossible to find a better filmmaker with whom to launch our studio. He has a unique voice, a distinct eye, and he tackles important subjects with humor and heart, pointing to solutions and not exploiting the problems.

""This proposal cannot be accepted by the people of Syriza,"" they said.With pro-European opposition parties set to back the bailout, the measures are expected to pass some time after midnight (2100 GMT). But around 30-40 Syriza lawmakers are likely either to abstain or vote against the government, raising a question mark over how long Tsipras can remain in office.Speaking to Syriza lawmakers before the vote, Tsipras warned he would need the support of his party to stay, a government official said.""I am prime minister because I have a parliamentary group that supports me. If I do not have its support, it will be difficult to be prime minister the day after,"" he told the lawmakers, according to the official.While the debate in parliament went on, the air outside on Syntagma Square was thick with tear gas as police dispersed a rally of several thousand anti-austerity protesters.The demonstration was largely peaceful until a small group threw the petrol bombs at police, who responded with the tear gas and flash bombs. Calm returned later but nearby streets were empty and garbage bins were still burning. About 30 people were detained, according to a police source""A NEW VERSAILLES TREATY""Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who was sacked by Tsipras last week, earlier denounced the bailout as ""a new Versailles Treaty"" - the agreement that demanded unaffordable reparations from Germany after its defeat in World War One.Deputy finance minister Nadia Valavani resigned and Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis said he would not back the deal.""The choice between a bailout or catastrophe is a choice made in the face of terror,"" Lafazanis, who heads the far-left flank of Syriza, told reporters.Even ministers supporting the deal could muster little enthusiasm for an accord which will impose a mix of tax increases, public spending clamps and pension and labor reforms on the already severely weakened economy.""It's a difficult deal, a deal for which only time will show if it is economically viable,"" Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told lawmakers during a debate on reforms.A snap election could follow if the prime minister's majority collapses.Tsipras is expected to reshuffle his cabinet after the vote, replacing Lafazanis and Deputy Labor Minister Dimitris Stratoulis, another bailout opponent, and possibly making other changes.A study by the International Monetary Fund issued on Tuesday called for much more debt relief than Greece's euro zone creditors, particularly Germany, have been prepared to accept so far.Berlin, which along with the other creditors knew about the IMF study before agreeing to new bailout talks, may wince at providing huge debt relief to a country it scarcely trusts to honor its promises.But Germany insists on having the IMF in the negotiations to help keep Greece in line. It may countenance extending repayment periods for Greek debt but says it will not accept a writedown, with the finance ministry insisting it could not accept ""a debt haircut via the backdoor.""""EUROPE'S BANKRUPT CHILD""Given the hurdles facing the agreement, doubts have already surfaced about how long it can hold together, with one senior European Union official saying it had a ""20-, maybe 30-percent chance of success.""With Greece facing an urgent deadline on July 20, when a 3.5 billion euro payment to the European Central Bank is due, EU officials were racing to agree a bridge financing accord that would enable Athens to avoid defaulting on the loan.There were strong objections from both Britain and the Czech Republic - EU countries that do not use the euro - to proposals to provide a 7 billion euro loan from the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), an EU-wide fund not intended for euro zone funding needs.The European Commission published its own assessment of Greece's debt burden on Wednesday that also offered the prospect of debt relief. While also ruling out any write-offs, the Commission said debt reprofiling was possible, as long as Greece implemented the reforms it has committed to.The French parliament voted to back the bailout accord while British Prime Minister David Cameron, fighting his own battle with Brussels to reform the EU, joined calls to give Greece debt relief but ruled out contributing to the bailout.Washington has stepped up pressure for a deal between the euro zone and NATO member Greece. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is making a short-notice trip to Frankfurt, Berlin and Paris this week to press for a quick agreement.The U.S. stock market fell to the day's low as tensions heated up in Athens. It was unclear, however, whether the market was down because of worries about the outcome of the Greek vote or because the global price of oil was falling sharply.Earlier, European stocks rose and bond yields fell, with investors betting parliament would back the bailout.Although the bailout package is much tougher than the Greek people could have imagined when they resoundingly rejected a previous offer from the creditors in a referendum on July 5, most want to keep the euro.With banks shut and the threat of a calamitous exit from the currency bloc hovering over the country if it cannot conclude a deal, many Greeks see the package as the lesser of two evils.""We are Europe's bankrupt child and as a child, Europe has been supporting us for five years and told us what we needed to do to get out of this situation,"" Yannis Theodosis, a 35-year-old civil engineer. ""We did nothing and now we are paying the consequences.""VOTING NOCivil servants held a strike on Wednesday, as did pharmacists, whose industry would be opened up under the reform package, in a series of demonstrations which passed peacefully until the clashes in the evening.The latest deal was a capitulation from Syriza, which stormed to power promising an end to austerity. The fiery parliamentary speaker and the party's parliamentary spokesman both announced they would vote against reforms. Such outbursts had one right-wing newspaper crowing over the ""civil war"" engulfing the party.Syriza's junior coalition partner said it would vote only for certain clauses in the bill, rejecting those reforms that went beyond a previous vote in parliament that had given Tsipras a mandate to negotiate in Brussels.
