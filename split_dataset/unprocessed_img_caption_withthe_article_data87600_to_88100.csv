People are smiling and laughing. Several linger behind to discuss the incredible conversations that we have had.,2015-06-01,2015-05-30-1432960115-3246524-MeriHyokyPhoto9880.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-30-1432960115-3246524-MeriHyokyPhoto9880-thumb.jpg,"(Pic: Meri Hyöky)I am sitting in a room in the State Library in Maseru, Lesotho, with about 30 other young people. We are Skyping with acclaimed South African photographer Zanele Muholi, who is jet-lagged and speaking to us from Paris. She is more than 13,000 miles away, but it feels as if she is right here, with us in the room. She is making us all laugh as she tells us about her most recent exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum in New York.""For the first time in history, they have images of black lesbians and trans-people on their walls. Never before have they had a black lesbian disorganising their space like that! My work is to mainstream our issues, to give visibility to black lesbians in South Africa.""It is Saturday 23 May. Our conversation with Muholi is part of an all-day event organised by Matrix Support Group, the only organisation in Lesotho working to promote the rights of LGBTI people in the country. Founded in 2008, Matrix has in just a few years made significant headway in promoting an awareness of LGBTI issues in a country that is still largely conservative. Last weekend, the organisation successfully held the third pride march in Lesotho's history. Today's event is being supported by the U.S. Embassy in Maseru, in conjunction with the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI). The majority of the people in the room are members of Matrix, and in some way identify as part of the LGBTI spectrum. Several form part of Matrix's core leadership team. The aim of the event is to provide insights into the work that is being done by LGBTI activists in countries around the world. Six Skype calls have been arranged and, during the course of the day, a number of interesting themes and ideas emerge, as well as vital words of encouragement and support. Muholi is not the only speaker to highlight the importance of visibility. Our first Skype call was with another South African activist, Germaine de Larch, who also uses photography as a means of documenting the lives of transgender people in South Africa. ""We're not seen as human or as real, which makes it easier to discriminate against us. Through my photos, I show that we exist, we have lives, we're not going anywhere.""De Larch's most powerful statement about visibility is one is that is echoed several times today: ""simply being who you are, existing as an LGBTI person, is a form of activism."" Later, we talk to Jamaican gay rights activist Maurice Tomlinson, who Skypes us from an airport in Barbados. The occasional boarding call announcement interrupts our conversation. Tomlinson is involved in a wide variety of LGBTI activism in the Caribbean, including sensitivity training with policemen, the establishment of a shelter for homeless LGBTI youth, and the challenging of anti-gay legislation, most notably Jamaica's anti-sodomy law.Tomlinson's work and experiences resonate strongly with the people in the room. Lesotho also has anti-sodomy legislation, an import of British colonialism. In our case, however, in contrast to Jamaica, the law has never been used to prosecute consensual male same-sex sexual activity. Nonetheless, Matrix's long-term goal is to pressure the government of Lesotho to revise the law. But how to change a country's law when the majority of its citizens hold homophobic views? ""Changing the law won't change the hearts of the people,"" says Tomlinson, ""but you can work on both at the same time. One doesn't have to follow the other.""Tomlinson's work with religious groups is also very relevant to our situation. Lesotho is largely Christian, and homophobic views and attitudes often stem from religious conservatism. Tomlinson's husband, Tom Decker, is an Anglican priest, and works with him to deliver workshops and trainings. ""As a priest, my husband can tell people: 'the greatest commandment is love.' You have to embarrass them into remembering that fact. Find influential, tolerant religious voices in your churches, and amplify them.""Aija Salo, general secretary of Seta, Finland's biggest LGBTI rights organisation, reminds us that any kind of change takes time. 20,000 people attended Helsinki's 2014 pride march. Fifteen years ago, only 300 attended, a number not so different from our recent march here in Maseru. ""Change is possible, it's not so long ago that we were struggling. Recently, we established a support group for LGBTI family members in Rovaniemi, in the north of the country. Only two parents showed up to the first meeting, but it was a start. Don't get discouraged. These things take time.""Tiffany Kagure Mugo, co-founder of the website HOLAAfrica, offers similar encouragement, as well as some solid words of advice for those who do activism work. ""If you're having a bad day, know that it will get better. And be sure to never take yourself too seriously. If you do, you will focus only on the shine and the accolades, and will lose contact with the work you do."" Our final Skype call is with North Carolina-based activist and musician Laila Nur, whose charm and good looks make her an instant hit with the female members of the audience. ""There is so much fucked up in the world,"" she says simply. ""As long as you are able to do something about it, you should."" The energy in the room at the end of the day is buoyant. People are smiling and laughing. Several linger behind to discuss the incredible conversations that we have had. We have spent the day in a small room in a landlocked country in Southern Africa, but it feels as if we have just taken a trip around the globe. Many of today's speakers have promised to come and visit and to offer training and support in various ways. We have been reminded that we are truly not alone. As Maurice Tomlinson said to us earlier today: ""We are on a liberation train for LGBTI rights, and although there will be some stops and some jerks and some speed humps, we are moving forward."""
1,COLLEGE,Reflections on a Historic Summit of the Americas,"Dr. Ricardo Azziz, ContributorChief Officer, Academic Health & Hospital Affairs, State Unive...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reflections-on-a-historic_b_7475480.html,The digital snapshot seen round the world depicted a brief handshake between U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro.,2015-06-01,2015-05-30-1432997125-3028018-16470673264_4a3f1f5787_z.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-30-1432997125-3028018-16470673264_4a3f1f5787_z-thumb.jpg,"The digital snapshot seen round the world depicted a brief handshake between U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro. It became a fitting symbol of the historic nature of this year's Summit of the Americas held in Panama this past April and signaled the promise of a new era of cooperation among the nations of Central, South and North America. Along with the first-ever participation of communist Cuba, the seventh summit hosted the first meeting of the Forum of University Rectors of the Americas -- an opportunity for university presidents from throughout the region to exchange ideas on how to strengthen and expand higher education in the Americas.The theme of the forum was ""Prosperity and Education: The Challenge of Co-operation in the Americas -- The Role of Universities.""I was fortunate to be invited to attend.When U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry addressed the group, he asked the question, ""How do we together best work to create jobs, to create opportunity, to build prosperity for our children and for generations to come?"" He made the case that there are three related answers: education, innovation, and conservation.Most would likely agree that expanding educational opportunities is key to promoting regional and individual prosperity. Yet the university president's forum was held apart from the rest of the summit's proceedings, taking place in a completely different location. A disquieting and hopefully inadvertent undercutting of summit leaders' verbal assurances they understand the crucial role higher education needs to play in the region's future.Nevertheless, Sec. Kerry used the occasion to announce $68 million in new Federal funding for programs that will expand education, training, and employment programs for youth throughout Central America and the Caribbean. This followed a March request to Congress for $1 billion to help ensure a secure and stable Central America.These are important steps. But, in a later plenary session, international higher education expert Sir John Daniel (quoting from a paper he co-wrote with Stamenka Uvalić-Trumbić) cast doubts on whether our universities are ready to play our role in the process.They asked the question, ""Is Your University Fit for the 21st Century?"" and suggest we are not as fit as we should be, both in our ability and willingness to cooperate and in what we currently contribute to prosperity.  In these educators' view, both North and South American universities fail the cooperation metric. Student mobility is an important indicator of international educational cooperation. Yet, as this UNESCO interactive map demonstrates, students -- from everywhere --largely bypass Central and South America when traveling and studying abroad.As to the lack of cooperation among the universities of South and Central America, they conclude, ""The diversity of systems and their marked national differences, which could be a stimulus for rich interaction, seems instead to reinforce the closed and rigid nature of each system."" So our universities do not seem to embrace the vaunted goal of cooperation. But what about their contributions to prosperity? Here, too, they see failure.As evidence, they cite a widening gulf between what we teach in our universities and the lives graduates will lead, arguing that we're not preparing students for the jobs they need to fill. And fewer and fewer students -- particularly those from underserved populations -- can afford the costs of higher education, especially in the United States. Finally, Daniel and Uvalić-Trumbić questioned whether we're appropriately and effectively employing new technological innovations to deliver better education outcomes. Are MOOCs really the answer we seem to believe they are?Ironically, I am writing this blog while sitting in my hotel in Sao Paolo, Brazil, where I am spending one week as visiting faculty at the University of Sao Paolo (USP). Conversations and discussions have been rich, the audiences curious and interested, and the research of the unit innovative, thoughtful and provocative. In fact, USP is one of the largest universities in the world, with 92,000 students and 6,000 faculty. Their medical complex is enormous, with high quality physical facilities and a rich tradition of research and discovery. While not all areas may be at the level we often believe the great American research universities are, USP is nonetheless a bright place in Latin America and very much worth the greater attention of the global academic community. It is opportunities like these that we, as institutions of higher learning in an increasingly global society, must seek out and partner with.The Forum of University Rectors of the Americas was a tremendous opportunity to open discussion and foster cooperation throughout the region. But along with the hope and optimism, valuable food for thought and cautionary reasons for concern were also raised that higher education and government leaders must heed. Opportunities for more meaningful and measurable cooperation between North, Central and South American universities, improving the educational and economic prosperity outcome of all students, and the economic impact of innovation and discovery are readily at hand. Let's take them."
2,POLITICS,"Nuclear Disarmament: The Most Important ""But"" of the Obama Presidency","Vincent Intondi, ContributorAssociate Professor of History at Montgomery College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nuclear-disarmament-the-most-important-but-of-the-obama-presidency_b_7475474.html,"For many progressives, the Obama presidency has become a battle of trying to figure out how to celebrate historic achievements while at the same time dealing with disappointment.",2015-06-01,"WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 22: U.S. President Barack Obama speaks while meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in the Oval Office of the White House on May 26,2015 in Washington, DC. Obama said the United States is working closely with NATO in the fight against ISIL . (Photo by Dennis Brack-Pool/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fd33200000f90101de00.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For many progressives, the Obama presidency has become a battle of trying to figure out how to celebrate historic achievements while at the same time dealing with disappointment. As a historian, I am routinely asked about Obama's legacy. I often explain that it is far too early to evaluate Obama, but the one constant in these last six years has been the ""but"" factor. It also happens to be the most frustrating aspect for supporters of the Obama presidency.There are many explanations as to why Obama has made certain decisions as president. Some argue that his supporters had it wrong from the start and Obama has always been a ""wolf in sheep's clothing."" Others contend he was never a far left candidate, but a centrist liberal. Many supporters also make clear that the historic obstructionism of Republicans and conservative Democrats in Congress has prevented Obama from becoming the president they envisioned. Perhaps it is a combination of all of the above. But one should not dismiss the role of the American people. Obama never said, ""Yes I can."" It was always ""Yes, we can."" That said, once Obama was elected, many progressives now had to figure out what to do. For so long, we were ""against the man,"" but now our guy was ""the man."" Moreover, the Right attacked Obama so viciously that many supporters immediately went into defense mode and perhaps unwisely gave Obama a pass on issues that we would surely have protested if the president was Bush, McCain, or Romney. But the most frustrating and perplexing aspect of the Obama presidency has been the ""but"" factor: Obama passed healthcare reform, but gave up the public option. Obama acted boldly on immigration, but deported more people than any president in U.S. history. Obama killed the Keystone Pipeline, but just allowed Shell to start drilling in the Arctic. Obama ended the war in Iraq, but continues his use of drones and maintains many of the Bush era policies in the Middle East. While all of these ""buts"" have had major consequences on millions of lives, one could argue the single, most important ""but"" of the Obama presidency is nuclear disarmament. As a student, candidate, and president, Obama has spoken out against nuclear weapons. In his first term, Obama began the march towards disarmament. He delivered one of the most anti-nuclear speeches in presidential history in Prague, signed and ratified the new START treaty with Russia, convinced numerous countries to give up their bomb making materials, and perhaps the most impressive, through diplomacy, President Obama has to date prevented Iran from building a nuclear weapon. There is of course a ""but."" Obama's budgets have actually taken money out of nonproliferation programs and put it into building new nuclear weapons, including spending a trillion dollars over the next 30 years on the nuclear arsenal. He continues to support Shinzo Abe, Japan's extreme right-wing prime minister, who has expressed his desire to remilitarize Japan, downplays wartime atrocities against China, and wants to expand the U.S. military base in Okinawa. Most recently, the Obama administration blocked the adoption of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Review Conference's consensus statement, which called for a nuclear weapons free Middle East, because that would also include Israel. Over the last few weeks I have met with various hibakusha (atomic bomb survivors). They have all asked me the same question: ""Will President Obama visit Hiroshima this year?"" It is no secret that for the last two years I have been publicly calling on Obama to visit Hiroshima as a gesture and step in moving towards nuclear disarmament. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Former ambassador John Roos stated that he thought Obama would visit Hiroshima before his presidency was over. The average age of the hibakusha is 79. The world is arguably more dangerous than ever. In short, the time is now. President Obama often comments that he carries a checklist of what he wants to accomplish. Is fulfilling his pledge at Prague to eliminate nuclear weapons on that list? Years from now we will evaluate and debate the Obama era studying all of his accomplishments and disappointments. However, that will not be the case if he does not act, or we do not make him act on nuclear weapons. For the biggest threat to our future and that of our children is a sentence that reads: ""Obama began to act on nuclear weapons, but..."""
3,TRAVEL,Easy Ways to Save On Your Summer Vacation to Europe,"U.S. News Travel, ContributorU.S. News & World Report Travel",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/easy-ways-to-save-on-your_b_7472068.html,"Airfare prices are at their highest, crowds are at their largest and travel planning is at its most frustrating.

Unfortunately, it's also the most expensive time of year to fly across the pond. Airfare prices are at their highest, crowds are at their largest and travel planning is at its most frustrating. But don't give up hope! Here are some easy ways to save money on your European vacation.See: Best Affordable Europe VacationsDon't overlook budget airlines Sitting on a bundle of British Airways miles? Always fly Delta Air Lines domestically, so you figure its international flights will do? Dismiss that thought. There are a number of budget airlines that fly from the United States to Europe that you may not be using, namely Icelandair, WOW air, Norwegian Air Shuttle and SATA International out of Portugal. Compare prices from the big airlines to these budget carriers and you may find sizable savings with the little guys.Wait until August or September June is expensive, and prices peak for travel to Europe at the end of July, so avoid this time of year at all costs. Instead, wait until August or September. The last week and a half of August -- and essentially all of September -- are comparatively cheap; you could save about $300 just by waiting a month to go on your vacation.If you're already planning for next summer, consider May 2016 as well. Prices are just as low in May as they are in August, and that sweet time between spring break and the summer high season usually means fewer crowds.Buy and fly at the right time For most destinations, traveling midweek to midweek is the cheapest time to fly. Europe is no different: You can save a small bundle by departing on a Monday or Tuesday and returning on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. Not only do flight prices rise sharply for weekend departures and returns, but airports get more crowded. Skip the endless security queue and save a bit of money -- about $86 -- instead.Timing is also important when purchasing your tickets. For most European destinations, the old adage of ""buy on a Tuesday"" doesn't translate. Research has found that Sunday is the cheapest day to buy a flight to Europe, saving you a small (but not insignificant) $11. That's at least a few espressos!See: Best Family Vacations in EuropeChoose your destination wisely Paris, London, Rome... these are some of the most popular European cities for Americans to visit, but you can expect to pay for the privilege -- they're also the most expensive to fly to. If you're not yet settled on a specific arrival country, consider Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland or Ireland. Travelers departing from the East Coast hubs of New York, Boston and Washington, D.C. can find flights to cities in these countries for far less. For example, if you're flying from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Oslo Airport, you can expect to pay as little as $591 in August; Bostonians headed to Dublin can expect to pay around $809. By comparison, flights to Paris average $1,127; London, $1,047.If you have your heart set on eventually ending up in Paris, for example, fly into a cheaper hub, such as Keflavík International Airport. After spending a few days in Reykjavik, Iceland, you can take a more affordable connecting flight onto the City of Light.Research other ways to save Flying across the Atlantic is likely your biggest expense when planning a trip to Europe, but don't overlook other savings you could nab. Instead of hotels, look into staying at vacation rentals. Sites like Airbnb and HomeAway both offer a slate of great properties around the world, and there's no better way to experience Europe like a local than by staying in an apartment. You'll likely spend less than you would at a hotel. Plus, you can shop for groceries in local markets, saving money on restaurant tabs.If you're hoping to hop between several European destinations during your trip, remember that the train may not always be the most affordable option. To ensure you're getting the best price, compare Eurail pass prices to cheap intra-European flights. If you're planning on moving about the continent, you can select and customize a Eurail pass to suit your itinerary. Single-country passes start at just $67 and multi-country passes start at just $120. However, you'll want to compare those prices to cheap intra-Europe flights on airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet; they're often more affordable.And don't forget to check out admission passes to popular tourist attractions. For example, the Paris Pass includes entry to 60-some museums and attractions, including the Louvre, Notre Dame and the Arc de Triomphe. Two-day adult passes start at 122 euros (about $133 -- sizable savings if you're planning on hitting up multiple sights.)See: Best Places to Visit in Europe About the author: Dara Continenza is an editor at Hopper, the travel app that tells you when to fly and buy.

The professional social network -- which many use as a virtual résumé -- works much better to help you find your next job if you post regularly to its newsfeed, according to experts. Nevertheless, a large portion of LinkedIn users fail to update their pages on a regular basis.A recent survey conducted by Pew Research Center found that only 13 percent of LinkedIn users engage with the site on a daily basis. Over 61 percent of users admitted they use the site less than once every week, making LinkedIn the least frequently visited social platform behind Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest.Failing to regularly update your LinkedIn account is a ""big mistake,"" and job recruiters notice, according to Jesse Siegal, senior managing director of the recruiting firm The ExecuSearch Group. ""Posting to LinkedIn at least once a week is key,"" Siegal told The Huffington Post. ""One way recruiters gauge someone's level of interest in a field and knowledge of industry trends is through frequency of relevant activity on LinkedIn.""Domini Clark, principal of executive and technical recruitment at Blackmere Consulting, echoed Siegal's advice, suggesting that frequent activity is a good way to ""communicate without overselling.""""If you're posting regularly, it's more likely that I'm going to see it,"" Clark said. ""It's all about visibility.""As with good prose, an attractive LinkedIn profile should show, not tell. Being an active LinkedIn user will naturally provide more concrete examples that showcase your level of professionalism. For example, rather than simply claiming in your summary that you are ""creative,"" you should post a link to a portfolio of your most original work. To recruiters, this demonstrates your creative skills in a more convincing manner.Similarly, instead of claiming that you are ""compassionate,"" post a blog about the time you volunteered at a local homeless shelter and how it impacted your sense of compassion. Forty-two percent of hiring managers surveyed by LinkedIn said they view volunteer experience as equivalent to formal work experience.Siegal said users should avoid buzzwords like ""creative"" or ""compassionate"" altogether, and instead focus on highlighting personal initiatives that help prove these traits in an objective manner. Replacing buzzwords with keywords may also be effective. ""Ditch the buzzwords, add the keywords,"" Siegal said. ""As a recruiter, I put keywords in the search, not buzzwords. ... Recruiters cringe when they see [buzzwords] and [this] can many times lead to the offending profile being overlooked.""If you don't have time to post stories you have written on your page, Siegal noted that simpler activities can help, such as ""liking"" posts, commenting on articles and joining groups.""Not everyone needs to be an author or writing their own blog ... but something is better than nothing,"" he said. ""Get in the habit of being consistent with your activity.""For more on how to use LinkedIn smarter, check out these 10 tips:CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misspelled Jesse Siegal's name.

5,WORLDPOST,"If Syria and Iraq Become Fractured, So Too Will Tripoli and North Lebanon","Alastair Crooke, ContributorFmr. MI-6 agent; Author, 'Resistance: The Essence of Islamic R...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syria-iraq-fractured_b_7471540.html,BEIRUT -- Saudi Arabia and its allies effectively wanted to inject hydraulic fracturing fluid (radical Salafists) into eastern Syria in order to fracture the bridge between Iran and its Arab allies. But at what cost?,2015-06-01,"Iraqi security forces and paramilitaries deploy, on May 26, 2015, in al-Nibaie area, north-west of Baghdad, during an operation aimed at cutting off Islamic State (IS) jihadists in Anbar province before a major offensive to retake the city of Ramadi. Iraqi forces closed in on Ramadi and launched the operation dubbed Labaik ya Hussein', which roughly translates as 'We are at your service, Hussein' and refers to one of the most revered imams in Shiite Islam. It will see a mix of security forces and paramilitaries move south towards the city from Salaheddin province, said Hashed al-Shaabi ('popular mobilisation' in Arabic) spokesman Ahmed al-Assadi. AFP PHOTO/AHMAD AL-RUBAYE (Photo credit should read AHMAD AL-RUBAYE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14e2b2400004f0024fd8a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BEIRUT -- The talk now is all about whether Syria and Iraq will end up as divided states. The impetus for such speculation derives firstly from the latest Saudi, Qatari and Turkish joint resolve to mount huge numbers of jihadists on Syria's borders. According to two senior political figures I spoke to, up to 10,000+ Wahhabist/Salafists (predominantly An-Nusra/Al Qaeda) have been gathered by the intelligence services of these latter states, mostly non-Arabs from Chechnya, Turkmenistan, etc. Plainly, Washington is aware of this (massively expensive) Saudi maneuver and equally plainly it is turning a blind eye to it. Secondly, the speculation about a coming fractured Iraq has gained big momentum from ISIS's virtually unopposed walk-in to Ramadi. The images of long columns of ISIS Toyota Land Cruisers, black pennants waving in the wind, making their way from Syria all the way -- along empty desert main roads -- to Ramadi with not an American aircraft in evidence, certainly needs some explaining. There cannot be an easier target imagined than an identified column of vehicles, driving an arterial road, in the middle of a desert. Do these two cases of a Nelsonian ""blind eye"" have something to do with persuading the GCC at Camp David to sign up to the statement that they accepted that an agreement with Iran on its nuclear program was in their ""security interests""? After all, Obama desperately needs it to paint Netanyahu as the isolated outlier on the Iran deal issue and thus undercut his ability to influence Congress.Coincidentally, a highly redacted U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessment from August 2012 has been released through a federal lawsuit. It states that ""If the situation unravels [in Syria], there is the possibility of establishing a declared or undeclared Salafist principality in eastern Syria (Hasaka and Der Zor), and this is exactly what the supporting powers to the opposition want, in order to isolate the Syrian regime."" The assessment says that the creation of such a Salafist principality would have ""dire consequences"" for Iraq and would possibly lead to the creation of an Islamic State and would ""create the ideal atmosphere for AQI to return to its old pockets in Mosul and Ramadi."" A few days after the release of the DIA assessment report, John Bolton lent weight to its claims: ""I think the Sunni Arabs are never going to agree to be in a state [Iraq] where the Shia outnumber them 3-1. That's what ISIS has been able to take advantage of. I think our objective should be a new Sunni state out of the western part of Iraq, the eastern part of Syria run by moderates or at least authoritarians who are not radical Islamists.""Well, this is exactly what has happened. Should we be surprised? The idea of breaking up the large Arab states into ethnic or sectarian enclaves is an old Ben Gurion ""canard,"" and splitting Iraq along sectarian lines has been Vice President Biden's recipe since the Iraq war. But the idea of driving a Sunni ""wedge"" into the landline linking Iran to Syria and to Hezbollah in Lebanon became established Western group think in the wake of the 2006 war, in which Israel failed to de-fang Hezbollah. The response to 2006, it seemed to Western powers, was to cut off Hezbollah from its sources of weapons supply from Iran. In short, the DIA assessment indicates that the ""wedge"" concept was being given new life by the desire to pressure Assad in the wake of the 2011 insurgency launched against the Syrian state. ""Supporting powers"" effectively wanted to inject hydraulic fracturing fluid into eastern Syria (radical Salafists) in order to fracture the bridge between Iran and its Arab allies, even at the cost of this ""fracking"" opening fissures right down inside Iraq to Ramadi. (Intelligence assessments purpose is to provide ""a view"" -- not to describe or prescribe policy. But it is clear that the DIA reports' ""warnings"" were widely circulated and would have been meshed into the policy consideration.)But this ""view"" has exactly come about. It is fact. One might conclude then that in the policy debate, the notion of isolating Hezbollah from Iran, and of weakening and pressurizing President Assad, simply trumped the common sense judgement that when you pump highly toxic and dangerous fracturing substances into geological formations, you can never entirely know or control the consequences. And once you go down this road, it is not easy to ""walk it back,"" as it were: the toxicity is already suffused through the rocks. So, when the GCC demanded a ""price"" for any Iran deal (i.e. massing ""fracking"" forces close to Aleppo), the pass had been already partially been sold by the U.S. by 2012, when it did not object to what the ""supporting powers"" wanted.Will then the region fragment into a hardcore Wahhabist/Salafist corridor stretching across Syria and Iraq, while the non-Wahhabist other states (Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen -- and Hezbollah) stand in armed opposition to this entity? Perhaps. We do not know. But statements by Hezbollah's Deputy Leader, Shiekh Naim Qassem and Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, suggest that neither Iran nor Hezbollah will accept a ""fracked"" Syria. (It is less clear however whether this applies to Iraq too, though we suspect that for Iran, it does.) Similar comments have been made by a senior Hashad leader in Iraq: ""It is impossible to eliminate ISIS in Iraq without following it into Syria. We will put our differences with Syria on one side and will join efforts to fight and eliminate ISIS ... The U.S. knew that ISIS would expand in Syria and was planning to divide Iraq. This plan is over..."" These comments may presage a more proactive response by Iran (and it is hard to see that Russia and China will not be more proactive too, given the composition of the forces now being groomed by Saudi and Turkish intelligence).But there is another point to this speculation: It leaves out Lebanon. If Syria and Iraq are to be ""fracked"" -- and hard-core Sunni fundamentalism return ""to its old pockets in Mosul and Ramadi,"" in the words of the DIA assessment, why should Tripoli (capital of Libya) and the north of Lebanon prove immune from this ""fracturing""? Lebanon's Tripoli was in fact the first ISIS-style ""emirate."" The reason why a Salafi-jihadist movement should have originated in Tripoli needs a little background. A city of half a million people, Tripoli is, in a nutshell, the seat of Sunni strength in Lebanon. Traditionally, Tripoli had been the center of militant pan-Arabist nationalist and Nasserist sentiment, and until the Lebanese civil war, it lay in the mainstream of Levant Sunnism. Militant Arabism in Tripoli had Arabist nationalist and Nasserist sentiment, and until the Lebanese civil war, it lay in the mainstream of Levant Sunnism. Militant Arabism in Tripoli had been so pronounced in the 1920s and 1930s that its inhabitants had fiercely opposed inclusion of Tripoli into a ""Greater Lebanon."" In the 1930s, Sunnis from Tripoli took part in an armed revolt against the prospect of a ""Greater Lebanon,"" demanding Tripoli's inclusion with the Syrian cities of Homs, Hama and Aleppo into a separate Sunni Arab-nationalist autonomy. While the birth of jihadism in Tripoli can be ascribed to the outset of the civil war in 1975, the beginning of the substantive shift in the character of Sunni Islam in Tripoli may be dated to 1947, when the Salafist Sheikh Salim al-Shahal returned from Saudi Arabia to Tripoli to find the first Wahhabi-orientated Salafist movement. During Lebanon's civil war, Al-Jama'a -- the Lebanese equivalent of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) -- fragmented and splintered under the stress. With Syria's intervention in Lebanon in 1976, a host of radical Al-Jama'a offshoots inspired by the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran sprang up. In 1982, these Al-Jama'a breakaway factions formed Harakat al-Tawhid al-Islami (the Islamic Unification Movement). The hardline MB offshoots, now united as ""Tawhid,"" then seized control of Tripoli from the Syrian-backed militia forces. Strengthened by arms and training from the PLO and an influx of trained Syrian MB operatives after President Assad's ferocious crushing of the MB revolt in Hama in February 1982, Tawhid forces imposed Islamic law at gunpoint in neighborhoods which they controlled. The ""Islamic Republic"" of Tripoli lasted for a period of two years (e.g. banning alcohol, forcing women to wear the veil, etc.). Dozens and dozens of secular political opponents (mostly Communists) were executed, sparking an exodus of Christians from the city. In subsequent years, Saudi influence in Tripoli predominated, and Tripoli spawned diverse Salafist groups -- absorbing many MB members who survived the Syrian crackdown -- and witnessed a progressive migration towards radical jihadism.In short, were Aleppo and other parts of Syria and large swathes of Iraq to be ""fracked,"" then expect the same for Tripoli and north Lebanon too.

What's not to love about Tiki with its fruit, booze, paper umbrellas, colorful garnishes, fun glasses and taste of the tropics? Tiki has been part of our culture for decades and lucky us, right now we're in the midst of a tasty Tiki revival.For some Tiki inspiration selected by Eat Drink Lucky editors, take a look at some of these spots:Denver's Adrift Tiki Bar & Grill celebrates all things Tiki. You can get basic Tiki drinks like Mai Tais and Rum Runners, but they also have an extensive list offering Tiki sweet drinks, classics, originals and group drinks. Their tasty Blue Hawaii is a true Tiki cocktail with its pineapple, coconut milk, honey simple syrup, lemon, Blue Curacao and Don Q Cristal Rum, served blended (and pictured above).Austin's King Bee Lounge is one of the city's best cocktail bars. Opened just under a year ago in the former Legendary White Swan space, this bar has attracted a lot of attention. Co-owner Billy Hankey was happy to talk Tiki and shared one of his own Tiki concoctions, the Jaguar's Paw, the recipe appears below. ""Tiki to me is fruit, spice, sweet and spirit, really. It doesn't have to be Polynesian. This one is Mayan influenced. It's about tropicality."" Here is his recipe for Jaguar's Paw. The tamarind nectar makes it especially tasty without being overwhelming.  King Bee Lounge's Jaguar's Paw1.5 ounces Del Maguey Vida Mezcal  1/4 ounce lime juice 3/4 ounce Goya tamarind nectar 1/4 ounce simple syrup 1/2 ounce St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram 1 dash Angostura bittersFill a tall glass with crushed ice 3/4 of the way up. Build the ingredients in layers in the glass. Swizzle with a long stirrer. Top with more crushed ice. Top with a lavish garnish. In San Francisco Smuggler's Cove has been named one of the best bars in the city/country/world/universe. This bar's singular focus is on the ""past, present and future"" of rum in all its glory. The cocktail menu features over 70 traditional drinks of the Caribbean islands, classic libations of Prohibition-era Havana and exotic cocktails from legendary Tiki bars, making this destination the encyclopedia of Tiki.In LA, the best Tiki bar is Tiki-Ti, an eclectic, much-loved Los Feliz dive. Their drink menu is HUGE, so it's wise to start with their signature Ray's Mistake, a favorite among regulars. If you're really indecisive, you can always try your luck at their Wheel of Tiki-Ti Drinks.You can't talk about Tiki in Chicago without mentioning Three Dots and a Dash. They're the standard for craft cocktails meets classic Tiki vibe -- bamboo, thatched roofs, giant delicious cocktails served in tropical-themed glassware, the works. Group cocktails are totally trending right now, and their recent menu additions include this group cocktail overflowing with aged rums, called Blood of the Kapu Tiki. It's served in a ceramic pirate ship!   Three Dots and a Dash, ChicagoAlso worth checking out in Chicago, Lost Lake. For some garnish inspiration, look at their banana daiquiri; they turned a banana into a dolphin and gave him an umbrella.  Lost Lake, ChicagoFor more Tiki, consider Washington DC's Bar Charley. It's a far cry from the typical Tiki bar with more of a Mad Men-era old school vibe but they're known for their year-round Tiki tap cocktails, like the Suffering Bastard (gin, bourbon, house ginger beer, Angostura bitters, lime).In Seattle, Pennyroyal hosts Tiki Night every Sunday from 3-7 p.m. Each themed night features special drinks, Caribbean food specials, Tiki music and colorful lighting. Guest bartenders from around the city whip up new drink menus every week.   Pennyroyal, SeattleNew York's Tiki hot spot is Otto's Shrunken Head with its mix of classic Tiki (Mai Tais) and new creations (Pang's Punch glows in the dark). In New England, the Tiki culture is also going strong. Boston's Wink & Nod celebrates with Tiki Mondays. With a one Tiki drink limit per customer, Wink & Nod focuses on the classics. Pick the Grab a Zombie & Twist with Dark Rum, Spiced Rum, Amaro Nonino, Agwa de Bolivia, Pineapple and House Falernum.

7,ARTS,Gustavo Will Conduct All 9 Beethoven Symphonies for First Time Ever,"Laurence Vittes, ContributorClassical Music: An Investor's Guide",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gustavo-traces-the-steps-_b_7479308.html,"For the first time ever in his career, Gustavo Dudamel will conduct all nine Beethoven symphonies on successive nights, in numerical order.",2015-06-01,2015-05-31-1433089980-9524887-dudamel_dsc_9365_vevans.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-31-1433089980-9524887-dudamel_dsc_9365_vevans-thumb.jpg,"For the first time ever in his career, Gustavo Dudamel will conduct all nine Beethoven symphonies on successive nights, in numerical order. From July 8-12, Gustavo, his Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar from Caracas, and the lucky audiences at the Teatro Mayor Julio Mario Santo Domingo in Bogotá, will be tracing the steps of genius. Gustavo Dudamel. Photograph by Vern Evans When Gustavo Dudamel raises his baton at the Teatro Mayor Julio Mario Santo Domingo on the evening of July 8, he, the Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar, the audience and Bogotá will begin to retrace the steps Beethoven took when he created the modern symphony. On each of five successive nights, Gustavo and his Venezuelan orchestra will perform two symphonies in chronological order, concluding on July 12 with the mighty Ninth. It will be the first time Gustavo has ever played the complete cycle on five successive nights there, and it will probably be the first time any of the audience has heard it that way either.With Gustavo at the helm, in all the full glory of his youth, and considering the joyful power and brilliance of his Deutsche Grammophon recordings of the Third, Fifth and Seventh Symphonies with the Simón Bolívar orchestra, the progression of the nine symphonies will seem like the advance of nine mighty, classical music super-heroes. There are lots of back stories about why each symphony was written, what was going on the world and what each means.For this once-in-a-lifetime Beethoven experience like this, however, it may be best to just let the symphonies rock and roll as if you were hearing them for the first time.Doing Beethoven's nine symphonies on successive nightsI couldn't find anyone who had played all nine symphonies on successive nights, but I did find the next best thing, someone who had done all 16 string quartets on successive nights. It was Guillaume Sutre, first violinist of the Ysaye Quartet which played at the Bogotá es Beethoven festival in 2013. Asked what it was like, Sutre replied, ""It was a week of six concerts at the Besançon Festival that became the most challenging concerts I ever performed. The difficulty of playing all the quartets was much more than I could have imagined; my body was tense and tired from the sheer physical and mental stress of the relentless intensity of Beethoven's musical, intellectual, emotional and technical demands. Beethoven and BogotáThe Teatro Mayor is a perfect place acoustically for Beethoven, the instrumental sections in the orchestra joining up in their endless different pairings, cellos with woodwinds, strings with percussion, violas and piano, harp and celeste, horns with strings, all heard so clearly.Music, however, is more than acoustics. And for musicians, Bogotá is one of the best places to make it. Especially Beethoven.Saul Bitran, the first violinist of the Cuarteto Latinoamericano, which played Beethoven's iconic Quartet in C sharp minor, Op. 131, at Beethoven es Bogotá, spoke very eloquently: ""I had the distinct feeling that Beethoven's music was coming alive and speaking directly to Bogotá's audiences, many of which had never heard it before. It proved to me, once again, the universality of great works of art. I have nothing but the highest possible respect and admiration for the people who made Bogotá es Beethoven possible, especially the staff at the Teatro Mayor, and its visionary leader, Ramiro Osorio. The affordability of the tickets turned the festival into a veritable Beethoven town fair, where the whole city - families, students, children, senior citizens - flocked to hear this extraordinary music. I have no doubt that this festival changed many bogotanos' lives forever.Guillaume Sutre told me that playing Beethoven in Bogotá was, ""a very special experience. We often hear that classical music is reserved for an older and more expert audience, that Beethoven quartets can be unfriendly to a novice listener, etc. This was not the case in Bogota and it was very moving to be sharing these masterworks in superb halls with a very large audience, young and enthusiastic. Gustavo himself told me last year when asked about the affection between he and Bogotá, and why he chose Bogotá to perform his first ever, live Beethoven cycle, ""Both my orchestra and I have a long history with Bogotá and with Colombia. Firstly, we are neighbors and brothers, sharing a common, extraordinary history and culture. We feel like we are in our home-away-from-home when we are performing in Bogotá which is why we probably give more concerts there than anywhere else on tour in South America!""

(Photo by Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images for American Theatre Wing)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ecb512400005100542046.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The phrase ""work-life balance"" is surprisingly controversial, sparking heated debates among dedicated employees, hard-working parents and people who fall into both camps. Is it a goal worth striving for, an unrealistic and unattainable idea, or something entirely different?In recognition of National Amazing Month, The Huffington Post spoke with Randi Zuckerberg -- successful media entrepreneur, editor-in-chief of Dot Complicated, and proud mother -- to find out how she thinks about and acts on the challenge of balance in her daily life. Her insights reveal that many of us struggle with the same task, offer ways to handle it, and acknowledge that ultimately everyone is responsible for finding a customized solution that works for them as an individual.Read on to hear the ways Zuckerberg works to create a semblance of balance, as well as the passions that keep her energized and motivated.What are your thoughts on the idea of ""work-life balance?"" Is it possible? I think you can have a great work life and a great life life, but probably not at exactly the same time. A lot of people put pressure on themselves to do everything well every day -- be a great friend, be great at their job, be a great spouse, be a great parent. For me, my philosophy has been more about giving myself permission to be ""well-lopsided."" So some days being all in on my career, some days being all in on my family, and as long as it balances out in the long run, feeling okay with it and giving myself permission to live my life that way instead of feeling like I have to give half of myself to all of those things every day.Are your coworkers and family members receptive to that philosophy?  Yes. You know, the nature of my career has been a little bit different because I have been in media. Pretty much every single year, I've had one big, marquee project that's taken me on the road for about two months away from my family. At the end of 2013, I was on a multi-city book tour, last year I had the amazing opportunity to perform on Broadway, and this year I'm actually commuting back and forth to L.A. on a filming project. So I think my family has certainly gotten used to this where for a two or three-month period, I'm all in on my career, and then when I come home on the weekends or take time after that, I'm really all in on my family. I've trained the people around me that my career looks a bit different than a 9-to-5 desk job career, and for me, I really feel like I thrive when I can focus on one thing exclusively, be that my career or my family.And that backs up the current science that explains how we aren't actually capable of multitasking. Totally. And there's a lot of research that shows it makes us unhappy, too. I was reading research that said the single best thing you can do to be happier is to stop multitasking. For me, I know different people work in different ways, but I really need to focus on something for an extended period of time to unleash my creativity. If I'm constantly distracted by text messages and emails and jumping around to other things, there's no room to go deeper. I'm much more of a one-project-at-a-time person.You mention going ""all in"" for your work and your family. When do you go ""all in"" for yourself?  I think unfortunately, for a lot of working parents, that's the first thing to fall by the wayside. For me it's about lots of little things. I try to log my steps every day, so even sometimes when I'm on a call, I'll do it while walking around the neighborhood. I try to sneak it in, but I could be a lot better about it. Quite frankly, that's just the first thing that vanishes. There's a lot of guilt that goes along with splitting your time, especially if you're a working parent of two very young children. I do feel like any moment I'm not working, I should be focused on my family. I'm not sure if that mommy guilt ever goes away, but it certainly makes it harder to indulge in time for yourself.How do you go about dealing with that ""mommy guilt"" in the short term? I think it's really about surrounding yourself with people who support you, and are encouraging and helpful. I'm so lucky to have my amazing husband, who, when I tell him I'm going away for these adventures, doesn't even bat an eyelash. He says ""Of course, I'll step it up and be the primary child caregiver for those few months."" And times I express feelings of guilt, he's like, ""No, you're doing great for our family, you're setting a great example for our boys to look up to,"" and I think having people that make you feel good about your choices and reinforce them rather than undermine you and make you feel guilty is just an amazing thing. I feel so grateful to have so many people like that in my life.That level of communication and compromise can be tough to achieve in a marriage. How do you do it? I think you kind of know what you're getting into with someone when you first meet them. For us I think we've always appreciated that both of us are very ambitious and focused on our careers, and there's just a little bit of a give and take. When I'm on these big projects, he'll pull back a little from traveling or doing things for work like that, and then when I'm back, I'll be the one who stays home a little more so he can push forward with his career initiative. It's about balance in the long run. We both don't have to have amazing things going on every single day and at the same time, but so long as we don't look back over a 10-year period and think one of us comprised more than the other, I think that's really the key to success. You clearly have several priorities constantly trying to top your list. How do you manage them? I have this mantra that I've been keeping with over the past few years. Every morning when I get up, I feel like there's five categories that I choose from: work, sleep, family fitness and friends. And every day, I can pick three of those five categories to do that day. You can't choose all five -- a lot of parents feel that way, and it's just not realistic or possible. You're going to burn out. So pick three, and you can pick a different three every day. I always do work and family, and then when possible I try to pick sleep. Although with a six-month-old baby in the house, that can be a hard one. But I do try to sub them out sometimes so I'm not always neglecting my friends or I'm not always neglecting my fitness. As long as it balances out over the long run.Do you have a favorite way to de-stress each day? My most favorite thing to do is have FaceTime meals with my boys. It seems really silly, but sometimes I'll just open up my computer and we'll all have dinner together, even if we're all in different parts of the world. Sometimes we aren't even talking, but I feel like we're a normal family sitting down and eating dinner together when we do that. And for me, I love to run. I am just starting to get back into it because most of last year I was pregnant, but the year before, I ran 1,000 miles in the calendar year, and I'm really hoping to get back to that place, averaging about three miles per day. Next year I'm going for 1,200 miles. It's a goal that's attainable, but it's something you have to do and think about every single day.How about meditation and gratitude? In our family, we've always had a gratitude practice. On Friday nights, we are always together. While we eat dinner, we all go around and say two things we're grateful for that happened that week. I do think it's important to take that time to pause and feel grateful and appreciative of the stuff in your life. I'd love to start incorporating even more of that.This interview has been edited for clarity and length.  "

Rodriguez/Getty Images for CinemaCon)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb67463240000310056c453.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Clint Eastwood is an enduring cultural icon of masculinity -- even as he turns 85 on May 31. The gravelly voiced actor-director has left his mark on Hollywood, bringing home five Academy Awards, five Golden Globes, and numerous other honors. So on this, his 85th birthday, we'd like to go ahead and make his day. (Sorry, we couldn't resist.) Here are six things you never knew or perhaps have forgotten about Eastwood.1. He doesn't just act and direct. He also composes film scores, plays the piano and SINGS.The music for ""Mystic River,"" ""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" ""Grace Is Gone,"" ""Changeling,"" ""J. Edgar,"" and the original piano compositions for ""In the Line of Fire"" were all him. He also wrote and performed the song heard while the credits rolled in ""Gran Torino."" He taught himself to play the piano and played well enough to perform at Carnegie Hall.2. He talked to an empty chair at the Republican Convention in 2012.As the mystery guest speaker, Eastwood delivered a 12-minute prime-time speech in which he spoke to an empty chair that was meant to represent President Barack Obama. Multiple news sources described the speech as ""rambling,"" and Eastwood took a lot of ribbing afterward. The incident led to the ""Eastwooding"" Internet meme spreading via Twitter where people would pose next to empty chairs.3. He was the mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea.Eastwood was elected mayor In 1986 and served one two-year term. He ran on a pro-business platform and one of his political victories was the repeal of a ban to sell and eat ice cream in public. Eastwood did not seek a second term, although clearly there was still more work to be done: While not enforced, the community still prohibits the wearing of high heels without a permit. 4. He turned down the role of James Bond.He was offered the role of James Bond when Sean Connery stepped down. Eastwood declined, saying that the role of James Bond should be portrayed only by a British actor. He also turned down playing Superman.5. He has a soft spot for historic buildings.Eastwood bought the Mission Ranch in Carmel in 1986, rescuing the property from an impending fate as a condominium development. He is said to have sought out the best craftsmen for renovation, craftsmen who have replicated moldings, door frames and hardware to match the style of the original buildings. The property is a popular hotel and restaurant today.6. He didn't only say ""Go ahead; make my day.""While that may be the most memorable line, there were plenty more -- especially as they relate to guns.Other memorable Eastwood quotes: “I have a very strict gun control policy: if there's a gun around, I want to be in control of it.”  “It's a hell of a thing; killin' a man. You take away everything he ever had and ever would have.”  “Nothing wrong with shooting ... as long as the right people get shot.” At 85, he remains a man of many facets. Happy birthday, Clint. We hope you have a good one. Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter | CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated that Eastwood was offered the character of James Bond in 1983, the year that Connery reprised that role for the last time, in the non-canon ""Thunderball"" reboot, ""Never Say Never Again."" Eastwood said he was offered the role in the '70s."

Family always has come first to him.But this is not the first time Death has visited Joe Biden. Not by a long shot. He lost his first wife and his daughter in a car accident shortly after his election to the Senate. Beau was severely injured. It would be the first of many challenges Beau and the family would face.The country is saddened, and party doesn't matter. We all share the family's loss because it can happen to any one of us.It did to me, and while I know some friends and FB acquaintances are tired of my efforts to bring child loss to the national discussion, the loss of Beau Biden compels us to talk about it.Grief is always lurking around the corner. And when it comes, it comes hard with the loss of a child -- one of the most devastating life events that can happen.  When I grew up in the '60s on Long Island, it was like Camelot. Families stayed together for the most part and children certainly didn't die. Well, they did, but few of us were touched by it. I never expected to be touched by it.So, now it's back in the news and it hurts. Thanks to over 30 members of both houses of Congress, the national discussion of how to deal with child loss is front and center. Before any of you say, ""Not again, Kluger,"" I make no apologies for taking this breaking news and using it as an opportunity to tell people why this affects all of us. From the parents of those killed in our cities to our police officers gunned down as they are about to begin maternity leave, to our soldiers who won't be coming home, death and grief affect all of us.Introduced on May 12, 2015, HR2260 and S1302, The Sarah Grace-Farley-Kluger Act, which was inspired by the Farley-Kluger Initiative, a petition to Congress to Amend the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993, now is comprised of bi-partisan support. Under current law, workers get 12 weeks of unpaid leave to have or adopt a child, care for a sick family member or your own illness or care for an injured service member. But when you lose a child, you get the customary 3-5 days of bereavement leave and are forced to return to the workplace, still broken, still grieving. Work is the last thing on your mind. You just need time.  Thousands have been fired from their jobs for needing time. In 1993, this bereavement leave was not included. I believe it was an oversight, one that can and should be fixed.  But most of us live every day, by the grace of God, with our families intact. Let's imagine you have not been touched by the tragedy of child loss either your own or a friend or colleague. How does another person's tragedy affect you? Because without support, they are part of our daily lives. Let's call this a cautionary tale.Imagine the person who has only been granted a few days off returns, still in turmoil. Are they a school bus driver driving your children, an airline pilot taking you on that vacation you longed for, an anesthesiologist, a pharmacist, a lifeguard whose performance of their duties requires a sharp mind? Shall we go on? A truck driver, an exterminator, an assembly line worker, a surgeon, a building contractor, a safety inspector, an EMT or a police officer?Everyone is affected by child loss, not just those who suffer this horrible fate, but those of us who come into contact with those mentioned above who, without the proper amount of time to begin to deal with their loss, puts all of us in harm's way.  Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Christians, Jews, Muslim, Whites, Hispanics, Asians, African-Americans, rich, poor all lose children.Once again, we are mourning the loss of a bright light. And for many families, we keep the light alive when it is oh so painful to do so.But Death does its ""job"" without any bias. It doesn't have a quota on how many deaths one family can suffer. Just ask Joe."

In signing off for the last time as anchor of Face the Nation, he made that clear: ""The news is not about the newscaster,"" he said. ""It's about the people who make it and those who are affected by it.""Schieffer remembered that he was hooked when he saw his byline in the school newspaper when he was a ninth grader. He grew up in Ft. Worth, Texas, and went to college locally at Texas Christian University. He landed his first job at a local radio station, KXOL, working for $1 an hour. On Sunday's Face the Nation he would recall, ""I love the news, and, at the time, every job I have ever had was the best job in the world.""That enthusiasm soon landed him a job at the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram. It was there he got his first big scoop. He was working in the newsroom following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas. In his 2003 book, This Just In, he described answering one of the ringing phones:A woman's voice asked if we could spare anyone to give her a ride to Dallas. Schieffer picked her up and drove her to the Dallas police station where police guided him and Mrs. Oswald into an interrogation room. Several hours later the FBI realized they had a reporter in their midst and ordered him to leave. But Schieffer had a great story. Following the Kennedy assassination, Schieffer got his first promotion from the police beat to covering the county courthouse. Then The Star-Telegram would send him to Vietnam to cover America's growing involvement there. The paper had promised that he would interview every Ft. Worth boy he could find. ""I have yet to match the thrill I got when I would... tell a 19-year-old kid, 'I'm from the Star-Telegram and your mom wrote me a letter and asked me to look in on you,'"" he remembered in his book. When his assignment in Vietnam ended, he recalled, ""I had gone to Vietnam convinced the government was on the right course, and was coming home convinced the course was hopeless."" Schieffer would be hired by a local television station, but he was eager to move a network news organization. In 1969, he took a job in Washington as a reporter with Metromedia. His first assignment would be to cover the Nixon Inaugural. But he still wanted a network news job, preferably with CBS News because Walter Cronkite was his favorite broadcaster. Loaded down with tapes of his stories, he arrived one day at the CBS News Washington bureau and announced he was there to see the bureau chief. After making his case to Bill Small, the tough CBS News bureau chief, he left thinking he had failed. But a week later Small hired him.In 1970, CBS News assigned Schieffer to the Pentagon beat. He would later note that he was one of the few Washington reporters who covered all of the four major beats, the Pentagon, State Department, White House and Congress. Washington was ground zero for news with the Vietnam War, the re-election of President Nixon in 1972, and the Watergate scandal, and Schieffer was deeply involved in CBS News coverage. Richard Nixon resigned in August 1974. Schieffer covered Nixon's final departure from Andrews Air Force Base on Air Force One. One week after Nixon's resignation, Schieffer was promoted to White House correspondent replacing Dan Rather, who took over as anchor for CBS Reports.Schieffer covered Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Schieffer also continued his role as anchor of the Saturday edition of the CBS Evening News. In 1979, Schieffer was asked to anchor the struggling CBS Morning News, a role he carried out for 21 months. He would describe his stint as a ""graduate course in learning how to handle on-the-air emergencies."" He requested a transfer back to Washington, and would soon become the State Department correspondent. In 1981, Dan Rather would replace the retiring Walter Cronkite as anchor of the CBS Evening News. Schieffer found himself covering politics. Meanwhile, CBS went through a change of ownership, which led to a round of deep budget cuts. In the late '80s, Schieffer became CBS News' Congressional correspondent. He later said that, ""Congress had always been my favorite part of Washington."" He mastered the beat.In 1991, Face the Nation anchor Lesley Stahl became a correspondent for 60 Minutes. Schieffer was offered the job and responded, ""When do I start."" He wrote, ""It didn't take me long to realize that of all the jobs I have ever had over the years, this was the best. I got to interview everyone who was anyone, and I didn't even have to go to them.""Schieffer anchored Face the Nation for 24 years. He led the expansion of the program from 30 minutes to an hour. He hosted presidents and world leaders. He asked tough questions, but was never confrontational. He tried to make each program informative and interesting. At the end of his tenure, Face the Nation was consistently the number one ranked Sunday pubic affairs program. As he began his final broadcast Sunday, the 78 year-old Schieffer, speaking with his characteristic Texas drawl, said, ""Today we'll keep with that tradition set 24 years ago, and stay focused on the news."" While the news business has changed dramatically over the past six decades, there is much for all journalists to learn from Bob Schieffer's remarkable career. Thank you, Bob."

(The joke: ""Thanks for letting me take part in another hugely disappointing series finale."")""I like all jokes,"" Seinfeld said. ""There's really nothing else I care about except jokes. I don't care who has them, whose feelings have to be hurt -- if it's a good joke I’m into it.""Seinfeld mentioned that the joke was a second option after he and Louis-Dreyfuss pushed back on the first, and wondered if the writers had been hesitant to use it at first to spare his feelings.""Maybe they didn’t want to hurt my feelings. That’s what it may have been: That they had that joke and they didn’t want to hurt my feelings and then, of course, they don’t know I don’t have feelings.""It's unclear whether ""Seinfeld"" co-creator Larry David would feel the same way, as he's revealed in previous interviews that the negative reception to the show's finale still influences him. Speaking to Bill Simmons in December, he mentioned how audience perception of the episode has made him hesitant to end ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" in a similar fashion.""I got so much grief from the 'Seinfeld' finale, which a lot of people intensely disliked, that I no longer feel a need to wrap things up."" he said.For more of Seinfeld's comments, head over to Vulture."

It didn't elaborate.Kwon said part of the success had been in diversifying crops, with wheat, barley and potatoes planted after the fall rice harvest.Isaczai said farmers had no choice but to diversify, because it was too dry to plant rice.Daniel Pinkston of the International Crisis Group told Reuters in Singapore that the North was ""living on the edge.""""They might have had four, five decent years of decent output but you need only one disaster, one flood or one El Nino pattern that could have a negative impact,"" he said.

In taking control of Ariha, the largely Islamist Jaish al-Fateh coalition and its allied Free Syrian Army (FSA) factions have successfully imposed a near-total province-wide strategic defeat upon the Bashar al-Assad regime. With Idlib therefore effectively out of regime control -- with the exception of the now isolated Abu Duhour Airbase and several small pockets of villages -- opposition attention can now shift south to Hama, west to the regime stronghold of Latakia, and east to Syria's largest city of Aleppo. All seem likely candidates. Parts of northern Latakia are now dangerously exposed and one of the leading Islamist commanders active there has told this author to expect ""a lot of surprises"" in the coming weeks. Other insurgent commanders say a large multi-group operations room is in the midst of being formed in Aleppo amid escalating fighting south of the city. ""We're feeling more confident than ever and sooner or later, the regime will experience the consequences of that -- Idlib was just the first stage of a more comprehensive plan,"" claimed one prominent Islamist commander now in Idlib. However, a renewed Islamic State (IS) offensive north of Aleppo may prove a dangerous distraction to the implementation of the next stages of that more 'comprehensive plan.'A majority of the media coverage of Jaish al-Fateh's advances across Idlib has focused on the role of al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra over and above the part played by Syrian opposition factions. Admittedly, Jabhat al-Nusra and its close ally Jund al-Aqsa have indeed played a key role in frontline operations in Ariha and previous battles in Idlib city, Jisr al-Shughour, Al-Mastouma and many other Idlib fronts. However, according to interviews with multiple commanders involved in Jaish al-Fateh operations, it has in fact been more expressly Syrian factions that have lent the most combined manpower and led much of the decision making within the operations room. Faylaq al-Sham and Ahrar al-Sham -- two groups increasingly close at both leadership and ground level -- have been particularly central. Moreover, none of the major victories in Idlib since early-April would have been possible without the crucial rearguard actions of U.S.-- and Western-backed FSA units and their externally-supplied artillery shells, mortars and American-manufactured BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missile systems. Thus the reality on the ground is more complex than YouTube videos and media headlines would suggest. As this author revealed in early-May, the depth of coordination between Western-backed FSA factions, Islamists, Jabhat al-Nusra and other jihadists has increased markedly in Idlib since April, both due to a natural need for cooperation on the ground, but also thanks to a tacit order to do so from the U.S.- and Saudi-led coordination room in southern Turkey. Having spoken extensively with leading commanders from across the Syrian spectrum in recent weeks, it is clear this cooperation has at least partly been motivated by a desire to ensure victories in Idlib do not become strategic gains for al Qaeda. After all, it has been starkly clear since the summer of 2014 that Idlib in particular represents Jabhat al-Nusra's most valuable powerbase.""Coming out""So what does Jabhat al-Nusra actually represent today? The group has evolved significantly throughout its existence in Syria and it is a well-known reality that a strong dose of pragmatism has ingratiated Jabhat al-Nusra with the opposition at large since late-2012. Its prominent role in fighting against the Islamic State (IS) from early-2014 also lent it a very ironic 'anti-extremist' image for many Syrians. However, while Jabhat al-Nusra continues to appear to the outside world as a united and powerful actor in Syria, it has since mid-2014 been enduring a consequential internal struggle to define its identity. The catalyst behind this struggle was a combination of IS' dramatic gains in Iraq, the IS declaration of a Caliphate and IS' comprehensive defeat of Jabhat al-Nusra forces in Syria's oil-rich eastern governorate of Deir ez Zour - all in the summer of 2014. This presented an existential challenge to Jabhat al-Nusra and to its overarching al Qaeda central leadership in Pakistan. The immediate consequence was an internal leadership shift, with deputy leader Maysar Ali Musa Abdullah al-Juburi -- better known as Abu Mariya al-Qahtani -- being demoted and replaced by a Jordanian cleric Dr. Sami al-Oraydi. As an Iraqi national from Mosul, Abu Mariya had joined al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) in 2004 and was a founding member of Jabhat al-Nusra alongside its leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani in Syria in August-September 2011. His experience in Syria has brought out a more pragmatic stance than what would be typical of veteran AQI commanders. Consequently, his leadership of Jabhat al-Nusra in Deir ez Zour saw his men cooperating with groups of all kinds, including quietly with tribal militias involved in cigarette smuggling. The loss of Deir ez Zour to IS thus came as a personal defeat for Abu Mariya, whose replacement was a well-known hardliner -- Oraydi -- whose judicial rulings have maintained a particularly harsh tone towards anyone deemed insufficiently devout or Islamist.Sami al-Oraydi's rise to prominence came at the same time as veteran Syrian al Qaeda figures Abu Firas al-Suri and Abu Hammam al-Suri were being thrust into the public spotlight as Jabhat al-Nusra's official spokesman and military leader, respectively. Both men maintained strong links back to Al-Qaeda's core leadership in Pakistan, as did a growing number of more secretive al Qaeda veterans who had been arriving in northern Syria from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Yemen and Saudi Arabia since the late summer of 2013. This latter component is what the U.S. government labeled the ""Khorasan Group"" in September 2014.As Oraydi took the reigns as deputy and the broader leadership took on a more publicly visible al Qaeda image, Jabhat al-Nusra sought to exploit its advantageous position within the broader insurgency and emerge from its pragmatic posture as a more defiantly jihadist organization. ""That was a dangerous time... people were afraid of IS spies and others began fearing American strikes,"" said one Salafist based in Aleppo. ""Nusra's leaders began talking more assertively, especially in the north, but it was better to be with them than be their enemy.""This 'emergence' became most apparent in Idlib, where much of Jabhat al-Nusra's senior leadership and 'Khorasan' figures had settled. Through September and October 2014, as coalition airstrikes began and continued to sporadically target apparent 'Khorasan' facilities, Jabhat al-Nusra led the comprehensive defeat of the famed U.S.- and Saudi-backed Syrian Revolutionaries Front (SRF) led by Jamal Maarouf, which it had accused of corruption. This 'anti-corruption' drive extended beyond Idlib, into areas of Homs, Hama, Aleppo, and further south in Damascus and Deraa. Specifically in Idlib, Jabhat al-Nusra also began unilaterally imposing a harsher level of Sharia justice, including stoning men and women to death, restricting women's dress and freedom of public movement, and enforcing the closure of shops during prayer time. Two well-connected Islamists active in northern Syria even claimed that a hardline faction of Jabhat al-Nusra had been responsible for the dramatic killing of much of Ahrar al-Sham's senior leadership in rural Idlib on 9 September 2014 - as an attempt to prevent Ahrar's public political moderation. The group's official position, however, is that no perpetrating party has yet been identified.This 'real' face of Jabhat al-Nusra continued to be evident into early-2015, when it most notably defeated and forced the total dissolution of another Western-backed group, Harakat Hazm. ""That's when we saw what Nusra really represents,"" said one FSA activist whose family is from Idlib. ""They only want to seek their own objectives, no matter the cost to the revolution."" But not all saw it the same way, especially when it came to the fighting against the SRF and Harakat Hazm. One FSA commander exclaimed to this author that ""Jamal Maarouf was a criminal and his group was unpopular,"" while another such leader told this author in February 2015 that ""Hazm's destruction cannot come soon enough, they have done nothing but cause trouble in Aleppo.""'Re-moderation'By early-2015, Jabhat al-Nusra was sitting comfortably, after defeating the two foreign-backed groups it most feared could turn against it in northern Syria and after consolidating its position of strength in Idlib. However, its boldly aggressive behavior from September 2014 had led to increasing anxiety within the entire opposition about the real nature of Jabhat al-Nusra and its long-term intentions in Syria. Senior leaders of Islamist groups as hardline as Ahrar al-Sham have expressed to this author repeatedly and on separate occasions their concern that Jabhat al-Nusra was walking down 'the wrong path' -- in other words, that it was displaying too much of al Qaeda's transnationalism and extremism than would be acceptable within the Syrian revolution.Some of these concerns made their way to Jabhat al-Nusra, two Salafist sources have confirmed, and came on the heels of a secret order sent from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in early-2015 that outlined a new and comprehensive strategy for Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria. According to two well-connected Syrian Islamists with connections into Jabhat al-Nusra, Zawahiri specifically called on Jolani to better integrate his movement within the Syrian revolution and its people; to coordinate more closely with all Islamic groups on the ground; to contribute towards the establishment of a Syria-wide Sharia judicial court system; to use strategic areas of the country to build a sustainable Al-Qaeda power base; and to cease any activity linked to attacking the West. Both sources confirmed that Jolani subsequently distributed Zawahiri's instructions across Jabhat al-Nusra's leadership structure and on 27 May, Jolani revealed publicly the last instruction during an extended interview with Al-Jazeera.Such a pragmatic posture, coming immediately after a period of more overt assertion of traditional al Qaeda behavior, has opened up a potentially consequential division within Jabhat al-Nusra. ""There are now two main currents... the conservatives are keen on keeping ties to Al-Qaeda and the others are more inclined towards the new Syria-focused approach,"" according to one of the well-placed Islamists. Some of the so-called 'Khorasan Group' went on to obey Zawahiri and Jolani's orders and integrated their activities into Jabhat al-Nusra's Idlib offensive from mid-March 2015 -- as Martin Chulov also revealed on 28 May. Others have isolated themselves and continued to focus on external plots - these individuals are thought to have retained the interest of U.S. strikes, two of which struck al Qaeda-linked targets in Idlib on 20 May. One of those strikes killed U.S.-designated Algerian jihadist Said Arif, who had initially joined Jabhat al-Nusra but had since become the military leader of Jund al-Aqsa -- thereby revealing the increasingly close and at times inter-related nature of Jabhat al-Nusra and Jund al-Aqsa in northern Syria. Jabhat al-Nusra's moderating shift quickly gained the support of people like Abu Mariya, who had been calling for a more strategically focused approach. ""Abu Mariya is considered [to be] within Jabhat al-Nusra's internal opposition, but he's actually a little isolated,"" claimed one senior Salafist. Other leaders supposedly on board with Jolani's order allegedly include the Australian Abu Sulayman al-Muhajir. It was within this evolving environment in early-2015 that Qatar allegedly sought to force Jolani to break his group's allegiance from al Qaeda, in such a way as to allow external bodies to provide the group with support.However, the re-moderation has been a divisive move and conservative elements within Jabhat al-Nusra are allegedly increasingly discontent. One Islamist official from Damascus described the dilemma clearly:""Jabhat al-Nusra's disengagement from al Qaeda would be good for the revolution, but Jabhat al-Nusra will always be in dire need of al Qaeda's name to keep its foreign fighters away from IS. Most Jabhat al-Nusra foreign fighters will never accept to fight and die for what looks like an Islamic national project.""Within the context of Jabhat al-Nusra's internal discord, an Islamist from Aleppo added that ""nothing [bad] has happened yet, because it's proven a positive move, just look at what's been achieved in Idlib since,"" as one Islamist put it. Should Jabhat al-Nusra's attempt at moderation and integration with the broader opposition continue to bear fruit on the battlefield, then it seems likely any internal backlash will be minimized, but should progress slow, the ruptures currently spoken about only behind closed doors may begin to emerge more publicly. ""I know what's going on inside Jabhat al-Nusra,"" said another Salafist source, ""[Jolani] was trying to come up with a new discourse [in his Al-Jazeera interview] but he didn't fully make it. He wants to be progressive, but he's still torn between the two worlds.""For now, moderation or not, Jabhat al-Nusra must still be viewed as an avowed member of al Qaeda -- an organization whose express objective remains to attack and destroy the Western world. Jolani's interview may have appeared to some as having revealed more moderate positions on issues like minorities, strict Sharia law, and hostilities with the West, but all such positions were limited to the conditions prevalent today -- war. Should the Assad regime one day fall or be pushed aside in a negotiated political transition, al Qaeda's true colors will surely be revealed. If for that reason only, the international community must view Jabhat al-Nusra's cunning positioning as part of a long-term plan. Syria is on Europe's doorstep and our 20-year enemy, al Qaeda, is outbidding us and appropriating the support of many of those who could otherwise have been our friends.

A reputable property will do that.",2015-05-31,2015-05-31-1433109372-9090443-shutterstock_135635054.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-31-1433109372-9090443-shutterstock_135635054-thumb.jpg,"Barry Shiller's vacation rental owner got a better offer just before he checked in. And suddenly, his family had no place to stay for their theme park vacation this spring.He'd booked a house in Orlando through VRBO.com, a vacation rental Web site. But a few weeks before the family was supposed to check in, the owner contacted him to report that the house had been ""double-booked."" A refund check was already in the mail.Shiller, who runs a wholesale tool business in Cleveland, would have let it go at that. Except that he heard from a friend that someone else had booked the same house on the same dates after he'd confirmed his stay -- at a higher rate.""We scrambled to find another rental house, which we were able to do, but at a higher cost,"" he says.Can the owners do that? As a matter of fact, yes.All kinds of travel companies, not just vacation rental owners, turn down your business when they get a better offer. The most common cancellations happen with cruises: A group books an entire ship, and individual customers are either rebooked on another vessel or must accept a refund. Airlines, hotels, restaurants and car rental companies do it, too.VRBO spokesman Jordan Hoefar says the site doesn't regulate cancellations but that VRBO expects rental owners to honor their contracts.""If an owner acts in a way that is inconsistent with that policy, he or she may be in breach of contract, in which case the travelers may have a legal recourse,"" he says, adding, ""From a legal standpoint, travelers must be familiar with the cancellation policy in the contract.""One of the reasons companies can get away with a cancellation and an involuntary refund is that it's perfectly legal. Whether it's an airline contract of carriage or a cruise line's ticket contract, these so-called ""adhesion"" agreements typically apply only to the customer, not the company. So, although you can't cancel your reservation without losing your money or paying a penalty, the company can do so without consequence.No one knows exactly how many better offers are received and accepted in travel -- except in one case. Airlines have to report their involuntarily denied boardings to the federal government. These denied boardings happen when planes are overbooked and the airline must make the difficult decision to deny some passengers a seat.We know, for example, that United Airlines showed 9,078 passengers the door last year because it overbooked flights, the most among major airlines. But that's still a tiny number compared with the overall number of passenger enplanements: just 1.17 passengers per 10,000. Delta Airlines, with 0.35 involuntarily denied boardings per 10,000, was the legacy airline with the fewest involuntarily denied boardings.The government also requires passengers to be compensated when this happens. Federal regulations require that fliers receive anywhere from 200 to 400 percent of their fare, up to a maximum of $1,300, depending on the length of the delay.But elsewhere? Not so much.For example, Andy Abramson can't expect compensation from the restaurant at a winery just outside Krems, Austria. ""Everything was confirmed,"" remembers Abramson, a Del Mar, Calif., communications consultant. ""Then an e-mail arrived telling me that my dinner reservation was being canceled because the hotel, which houses the restaurant, is now fully booked and the maitre d' doesn't want a solo table. The kitchen is working on a special menu for the group.""The only consolation, if you can call it that, was a message inviting him to stop by for lunch. Abramson already had plans.Ian Ford, who founded Undercovertourist.com, a guide to discount attractions, suspects he knows why it's happening. Businesses that cancel your reservations because they get a better offer aren't necessarily ethically challenged, but technically challenged.When you don't have the tools that let you set competitive rates or manage your inventory, you're far likelier to be the car rental company that runs out of vehicles, leaving your arriving customers carless. Or you could be managing the hotel that has to turn away guests with reservations.""This could be particularly relevant with small, inexperienced suppliers with limited rooms,"" he says.Avoiding businesses that might let you down is difficult. When it comes to hotels, car rental companies and even restaurants, a large and well-established business is far less likely to turn you away because it receives a better offer. With cruises and airlines, size doesn't matter as much as season. During a busy travel period, you may get bumped from a flight or a cruise.Even though you may not have any rights on paper, you can still appeal to the company to do the right thing. For example, even if a hotel is overbooked, you can ask it to ""walk"" you to a comparable hotel at the same rate. A reputable property will do that.Yes, even a vacation rental.After you've left a comment here, let's continue the discussion on my consumer advocacy site or on Twitter, Facebook and Google.

Italian prosecutors are investigating how they died.Frontex is coordinating an EU rescue mission in the Mediterranean known as Triton, which was stepped up after around 800 migrants drowned off Libya in April in the Mediterranean's most deadly shipwreck in living memory.""This is the biggest wave of migrants we have seen in 2015,"" Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri said in a written statement. ""The new vessels that joined operation Triton this week have already saved hundreds of people.""Italy has so far borne the brunt of Mediterranean rescue operations. Most of the migrants depart from the coast of Libya, which has descended into anarchy since Western powers backed a 2011 revolt that ousted Muammar Gaddafi.Calm seas are increasingly favoring departures as warm spring weather sets in.The migrants saved over the weekend are all being disembarked at nine ports on the Italian islands of Lampedusa, Sicily and Sardinia and on its southern mainland regions of Calabria and Puglia.The latest wave of more than 5,000 arrivals will take the total of those reaching Italy by boat across the Mediterranean this year to more than 40,000, according to estimates by the United Nations refugee agency.The EU this month agreed on a naval mission to target gangs smuggling migrants from Libya, but a broader plan to deal with the influx is in doubt due to a dispute over national quotas for housing asylum seekers.The plan to disperse 40,000 migrants from Italy and Greece to other countries met with resistance this week, with Britain saying it would not participate and some eastern countries calling for a voluntary scheme.

The long standing rivalry with Austria-Hungary and Allied promises that it could take control of Italian-speaking territories across her frontiers with Austria in the Austrian Adriatic littoral, Cisalpine Tyrol and Dalmatia, had led Italy to join the Allies. On April 26, 1915, the two sides signed the Treaty of London. In it, Italy renounced Italy's ties to the Triple Alliance. Less than a month later, Italy declared war against Austria-Hungary. The approaches to Italy were protected by mountain ranges along its northern frontier and therefore presented extremely difficult terrain over which any potential attacker would have to pass. But it also presented similar problems if the Italians wanted to go on the offensive.  The Italian Front 1915-1917Rome's first main concern was the area of the Trentino, where a salient of Austrian-Hungarian territory pushed south, deep into northern Italy. The Italians believed that the Trentino would be extremely difficult terrain over which to attack and to fight. It was the Austrians who moved first, bringing four battle-hardened divisions and heavy artillery to the Italian border. Two out of the four existing Italian armies covered the 230-mile border with the Trentino and they were certain that the Austrians would not attack . In May 1915, however, following the spring thaw, the Austrians did attack and pushed the Italians back ten miles. By July the Austrian offensive had petered out. Operations against the Russians necessitated the withdrawal of a number of Austrian divisions and the Italians slowly recovered the ground they had lost.

Although outnumbering Austrian forces by better than three to one, the Italians were hampered by their position on low ground, poor training and low morale.

Later that year, on August 27, 1916, Italy finally declared war on Germany Italian Troops Retreating following Defeat at the Battle of Caporetto .

Winter on the Italian FrontThe Alpine environment brought other hazards as well. In December 13, 1916 10,000 Italian troops met their deaths in avalanches in the Dolomite Mountains. Although little covered by the international press, the battles on the Italian front were to prove just as bloody as those fought on the western front."

Brelo, a patrolman charged in the shooting deaths of two unarmed suspects during a 137-shot barrage of gunfire was acquitted Saturday in a case that helped prompt the U.S. Department of Justice determine the city police department had a history of using excessive force and violating civil rights. Seated next to Brelo is attorney Patrick DￃﾢￂﾀￂﾙAngelo, left, and attorney Fernando Mack. (AP Photo/Tony Dejak)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2bda2240000510095e6b8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND (AP) — While acknowledging he can't appeal an acquittal, an Ohio prosecutor says a judge made serious errors before finding a Cleveland police officer not guilty in the deaths of two unarmed suspects, and he wants an appeals court to order the judge to correct the record.Cuyuhoga County Assistant Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said in Friday court documents posted on The Plain Dealer website (http://bit.ly/1QgnV5G ) that Judge John O'Donnell's reasoning in the voluntary manslaughter trial of Officer Michael Brelo could set a legal precedent that would ""endanger the public.""McGinty said Brelo's acquittal last Saturday in the 2012 deaths of Malissa Williams and Timothy Russell in a storm of police bullets was based on the judge's mistaken analysis of laws concerning police use of deadly force and on homicide involving more than one shooter. He said the judge also considered the wrong lesser charge — felonious assault — when he should have considered attempted voluntary manslaughter or aggravated assault.""As it stands, the trial court's verdict will endanger the public, allow for one of multiple actors to escape culpability, and lead to more unnecessary deaths by police-created crossfire situations,"" McGinty said in his filing with the appeals court.""This court must return the case with the corrections of law to the trial court with instructions to deliberate and reach a verdict with the correct application of the law and correct determination of lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter — attempted voluntary manslaughter or aggravated assault,"" he said.The judge wasn't available for comment earlier Friday on McGinty's request, the newspaper said.Brelo's case is one of many nationwide that has sparked protest over deadly police confrontations. About 70 people were arrested following the verdict, although the protest was relatively quieter than others after grand juries decided against indicting white officers in the deaths of black unarmed suspects in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York.In the Ohio case, Brelo and other officers fired 137 shots at a car with Russell and Williams inside it on Nov. 29, 2012. The shooting occurred at the end of a 22-mile chase involving more than 100 Cleveland police officers and 60 cruisers after Russell's car backfired while speeding past police headquarters. During the chase, an officer reported that he thought he'd seen Williams with a gun. At the end, police mistook police gunfire for shots from Russell's car.Brelo fired 49 of those shots that night, but it was the final 15 fired into the windshield while he stood on the hood of Russell's car that led to his indictment and a four-week trial.In his Friday filing, McGinty said that reasonable use of deadly force doesn't extend to Brelo's actions.""The United States Constitution does not provide cover for those officers who abandon all cover and place themselves and other officers in danger, using deadly force not as a last resort but, like Brelo did, in a manner inconsistent with reason, inconsistent with training, and inconsistent with established federal law.""But ""... the law as stated in the verdict places no restraint on the tactics civilian police officers are to use, finding the use of any tactics to be justifiable so long as the officer perceives a subjective fear of his or her life,"" McGinty said.The prosecutor also said the judge mistakenly reasoned that the state must prove one person among the several who fired that day was the sole cause of the two deaths.___Information from: The Plain Dealer, http://www.cleveland.comCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

Oil on canvas, 90 X 140 cm.Canadian-born artist Melanie Daniel, whose work is currently on view at the Shulamit Gallery in Venice Beach, has lived in Israel for the past twenty years, including seven years in the mixed Arab-Jewish city of Jaffa. Her most recent paintings, which are vivid and thematically multivarious, are ruminations on personal identity that also reflect the hybrid culture and socio-political tensions of her adopted homeland. I recently interviewed Melanie Daniel to ask her about her background, her art and her sources of artistic inspiration. John Seed Interviews Melanie Daniel:Melanie DanielTell me about growing up in Canada and how it shaped you. I grew up in a city called Kelowna, British Columbia, nestled in a beautiful valley of forests, lakes and orchards. It is extremely arid and blazingly hot in the summer (up to 40 °C) and then winter inevitably comes and outdoor life continues on the ski slopes or in the gentler woods for snow-shoeing and tobogganing. My younger sister and brother and I were always outdoors in all seasons hunting for critters and frogs, fishing in the creeks or excavating clay from the cliffs behind our grandparents' house. We returned daily to our childhood haunts where only kids went, a parallel universe for us and our posse. Those were different times, I realize now, and we were never supervised. Free to roam, we invented games, dares, bizarre rituals, and protocol for deep forest sport. The neighborhood creek, an all-season kid headquarters, also served as the final resting place for countless pet gerbils and lizards. At sunset, our deceased beloved pets were regularly sent downstream on blazing Viking ships improvised with popsicle sticks. On less somber occasions, being the avid pyromaniacs that we were, more than once we watched from a safe distance as the local firefighters extinguished the contraband Playboys that had started it all. My brother and his nervous friends would frequently incinerate their forbidden erotic stash once discovered by us, their older sisters, the killjoys. Although we would have happily watched endless hours of TV sitcoms and cartoons, my parents were frequently heard saying, ""shut that thing off and go outside"", which we grudgingly did. But ""outside"" never disappointed. It was always a place to escape into and to be happy. The dead silence of snow, the smell of cut grass, the deafening drone of cicadas in afternoons and the melancholy return of autumn and the dreaded classroom - the reliable cycle of my formative years in Canada. It has never left me. Wrestling Bears, 2015. Oil on canvas, 99 X 101 cm.Why did you move to Israel and what kind of culture shock did you feel? Love brought me to this place. Not adventure and certainly not ideology. In the early '90's I travelled through India and one day I set my eyes upon a curly haired, dark stranger. I was sure he was Italian. I knew nothing of Israelis. After a while, each returned to his respective country and only many months later did we commence a slow correspondence through posted letters. Email was not yet widely available. Rather impulsively, I dropped my final year of university studies in history and philosophy and boarded a plane for Israel, certain that I would be greeted by a swollen silver moon over Jerusalem. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Jerusalem was a rough city, its denizens crustier still. I returned briefly to Canada to make some money tree-planting and ultimately to figure out what to do about this man. Eventually I did return to Jerusalem, and I knew that my success or failure would depend less on matters of the heart and more about what I would do there. Soon after my arrival, the prime minister was assassinated, later the second Intifada was unleashed, and all hell broke loose. It lasted five years and it changed everyone, deeply. Perennial engagement with mortality is humbling. I live in constant proof of the fragility of life and it's something that follows me everywhere. And although I don't believe that this knowledge gives me any advantages in life it has sharpened a keen regard I've always held for the present tense and a solid respect for the material/natural world. Communion with nature has always been enough for me and requires no further pontificating from men with snowy beards.The culture shock I experienced here was an ongoing hiccup, lasting years. Israelis are without a doubt the most tactless humans on earth but this abrasive quality has a very important flip side. They also happen to be the most generous, candid, creative and humorous people I have ever met. I have learned much from my Israeli friends. The other culture shock was Israel's natural landscape, the desert and its open unforgiving sky. I recoiled at my first encounter with the desert; I felt I had no where to hide. It took me many years to embrace this existential landscape as it was nothing like the towering pine giants that protected me in my youth.Patchwork Landing, 2015. Oil on canvas, 140 X 160 cmYour art has been characterized as dreamlike. Have your narratives always been this way?  Yes, I think so. Even at school I was painting when the craft was decidedly unpopular and to the dismay of my instructors, I was also bent on weaving impenetrable stories into the work. For me, the paintings invent the places and characters, not the other way around. My paintings are so much about physicality which despite their reliance on narrative are still somehow resistant to language, interpretation, or even memory. I hope to induce a sense of dislocation by being both strange and recognizable. By keeping the narrative dreamlike and just beyond reach, I let the viewer bring something of their own to the painting. The narrative can unfold once the sense of familiarity recedes from the encounter, those scenes familiar to us through the landscape genre. My art is anti-nostalgic because I don't try rehashing actual experiences but invent them at the edge of my perception.Scruffy's Emerald Secret, 2014-15. Oil on canvas, 140 X 120 cm  Can you tell me about one of your current paintings and break down some of its narrative and themes? One piece, Scruffy's Emerald Secret is a favorite of mine. It's moodier that the others and I can identify with the bare-footed loner sitting on a tree stump, hunched over his campfire. Behind him looms this tall green patterned tree, a beautiful freak specimen. It shouldn't be there, but it is. The man shouldn't be there, but he is. Where is his family? Why is he alone in keeping vigil over this odd tree? This piece is one of several in a group I call Piecemaker in which I incorporate conflicting cultural motifs, embedded traditional Arabic patterns in a Canadian landscape. They can't be fused and remain irreconcilable. Not unlike quilt-making I ""stitch"" together disparate symbolic forms and patterns from both of these worlds which have become part of me. Spellbound, 2014. Oil on canvas, 140 X 180 cm.As you have dealt with the cultural and political challenges of living and working in Israel, how has your art sustained you? One of the conditions of my decision to remain here depended on my ability to carve out a corner for myself, professionally. Making art and functioning competitively in that arena was a necessity for happiness and my own sanity. I started from zero and got a very good education and training in the arts. Self discipline was already established from my previous five years at Canadian universities, and I was very sure about how I wanted things to play out. Unlike many immigrants who arrive as adults, I had a huge advantage: art school was a big lingering bear hug. All of my friends, my political views, professional networks, and direct access to Israel's cultural carotid artery were all gifted to me during those years. I would not have survived here without it. The Drifting Patch Tree, 2015. Oil on canvas, 190 X 180 cmWhat are your interests outside of art?  My family is the heart of my life, always. Everything else falls into descending order after that. I like being outside as much as possible. As a family, we do a lot of hiking and swimming, and picnics with friends. I live a street away from the Mediterranean Sea and need to see it daily. Most days are started with a run along the sea to stave off cabin fever in my studio. I'm an avid gardener and a member of a community garden and often get my son's kindergarten involved with horticulture. It's important for kids to understand where food comes from and to really see how we're all part of a shared life cycle. They also get a real sense of pride and ownership from their hard work.I read a lot, everything from Annie Proulx to Walter Mosley, mostly at night when everyone is asleep. Music, nonstop, but that's when I'm painting. Who are some artists who have directly influenced your work? Daniel Richter: he's the best living painter as far as I'm concerned. I can look at as his works for hours and they just keep unfolding. Violent and absurd, apocalyptic.Peter Doig: a constant source of inspiration. Cecily Brown: fleshy, carnal paintings that just disintegrate and then re-galvanize, pulsing. They take time to get into and you can't hurry them. This is one of the things what makes any good painting last. Brown overdoes everything, pushes the painting to the brink and I love that .Mark Bradford: layer by layer, he builds up a thick-skinned topography from cultural detritus. It's like he maps out these strange mute neighborhoods replete with their own secrets and you want to scrape down to get to them.Velazquez: bold mark-making and outbursts of sensuality erupting through thick globs of paint. He didn't want a smooth porcelain finish but rather wanted to show us the true corporeal surface of paint. For me, moving paint around is a steady point of fascination and Velazquez always delivers the goods in that regard. Dana Schutz: she's madly prolific, restless, ballsy, and brilliant. I hit a wall over ten years ago and discovered Dana's work. It was like rocket fuel for me.David Lynch: His scenes are permanently lodged in my brain. An unapologetic storyteller of storytelling. Sally Mann: raw, haunting and achingly personal. Kwakiutl and Haida art and myths: I grew up with the imagery and stories of First Nations peoples of the Pacific Northwest. Masks and totems and legends are always with me even if they don't find immediate expression in what I do. PK Page: Canadian poet. Her vivid descriptions of fleeting moments of life hang in the air when I'm working. I just have to reach up and grab them. Here's a title: ""Deaf-Mute in the Pear Tree"".James Ensor - He literally attacked his canvases with violent gusto, making these taut, weird and nightmarish scenes. Totally unsettling.
