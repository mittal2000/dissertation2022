",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576759381500002f001ba42a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LeBron James cemented his status as one of the greatest players of all time on Sunday, completing an unprecedented comeback against the historically great 2015-2016 Golden State Warriors to win Cleveland the NBA championship he promised the city when he first returned home almost two years ago. James famously announced in a July 2014 Sports Illustrated article that he would return to the Cleveland Cavaliers after four years with the Miami Heat, where he won his first two championships and NBA Finals MVPs. ""I’m not promising a championship. I know how hard that is to deliver. We’re not ready right now. No way,"" he said at the time. ""Of course, I want to win next year, but I’m realistic. It will be a long process, much longer than it was in 2010.""Turns out, it would take the exact same amount of time: two seasons. After falling down against the Warriors 3-1 early in the Finals, James willed his team back from the brink and then willed them once more to a Game 7 victory on Sunday. Perhaps his most memorable play of the night came with just under two minutes to go in the game. With the game tied 89-89, Andre Iguodala seemed to have a wide-open layup that would have put the Warriors up two points. Then out of nowhere, there was James. In retrospect, that was it. It was the first time in league history that an NBA team overcame a 3-1 series deficit in the Finals to win the championship, and James was unambiguously the primary reason why. After the game was over, the league announced the inevitable: James had unanimously won the 2016 NBA Finals MVP, the third of his career to match his three championships. For the series, James averaged an ungodly 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.6 steals and 2.3 blocks. ""Cleveland, this is for you,"" he said in a post-game interview. James compiled 27 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in Game 7 of the series, the first triple-double in the Finals since James Worthy in 1988. But those statistics are much less significant than the most basic thing he achieved on Sunday night: winning a championship for The Land. "

4,POLITICS,We're Spending Less On Health Care Than We Thought We Would Before Obamacare,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-care-spending-obamacare_us_57685a1ae4b015db1bca53cf,"About two and a half trillion dollars less, to be exact.",2016-06-20,This chart shows projections for how much the U.S. spends on health care. The top line is what government auditors predicted after the Affordable Care Act became law. The middle line is their projection from before then. And the bottom line is their new estimate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57685b161500002f001ba6d8.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Twenty million or so more people have health insurance now than they did before Obamacare, and yet the American health care system is on track to spend $2.6 trillion less from 2014 to 2019 than before the Affordable Care Act became law.That's right -- $2.6 trillion, which is equivalent to about 15 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. That's the conclusion researchers at the Urban Institute came to when comparing health care spending projections made in 2010 before Congress passed the ACA, and projections made later that year after President Barack Obama enacted the statute, with more recent findings.In other words, more Americans have health coverage and greater access to medical care -- and they're getting it -- but the country as a whole is spending less money than expected, and will continue doing so for at least the next several years.Prior to the ACA, the actuaries predicted U.S. health expenditures would total $23.2 trillion between 2014 and 2019. After Obamacare became law, the office revised that projection to $23.7 trillion, reflecting the hundreds of billions of dollars needed to pay for the Affordable Care Act's expansion of government-subsidized health coverage. Last year, the actuaries further revised the total to $21.1 trillion. The Urban Institute report, supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, uses data from the Office of the Actuary, an independent auditor within the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The actuaries are responsible every year for reporting the total amount that American businesses, the government and households spend on health care. They're also in charge of projecting how that spending will change in the future.To be clear, the Office of the Actuary has always been extremely reluctant to attribute much, if any, of this trend to the cost-containment provisions of the Affordable Care Act, apart from the funding cuts for hospitals and other medical providers. And the Urban Institute authors don't go that far, either.At a minimum, however, a combination of factors has resulted in a moment when the uninsured rate has reached a historic low even as the amount the nation spends on health care is turning out to be much lower than anticipated. Whatever the cause, this country actually is making headway on a problem that's widely considered to be the biggest economic and fiscal challenge of our time.And as the Urban Institute report notes, the Congressional Budget Office has similarly re-evaluated the Affordable Care Act's spending and also predicted that it will be less costly than originally estimated.So what's happened since 2010? The biggest factor is the economy itself. The damage wrought by the Great Recession squeezed down health care spending as people lost their jobs, incomes and health insurance, and subsequently had less access to care. The slow recovery in the years following the recession kept spending from quickly rebounding. This is consistent with the pattern seen during previous economic downturns, which is why the Medicare actuaries continue to point to larger economic factors as the main cause for the slowdown in health care expenditure growth in recent years. But historical patterns don't quite account for the fact that growth hasn't reverted to the levels before Obamacare and before the Great Recession, when annual increases could reach into the double digits, even though health care inflation has started to increase again. Instead, spending is expected to rise by about 5 or 6 percent a year from 2014 to 2019, a bit faster than the roughly 4 percent annual increase from 2010 to 2014.And the relatively higher spending seen since 2014 doesn't represent out-of-control costs so much as it does the simple fact that more people are in the system.Although the Urban Institute researchers stop short of crediting the ACA with the seeming shift in the health care spending trend, they do note that if the Medicare actuaries and the CBO are wrong, and if Obamacare's cost-cutting initiatives are working as Congress intended, the overall numbers could wind up smaller still.""Even the current CMS forecast could prove too high,"" the report concludes. ""If current CMS projections do not fully reflect this pattern, spending projections will continue to fall and it will become harder not to attribute at least some of the sustained cost containment to the ACA.""Jonathan Cohn contributed to this story."

7,MEDIA,Jewish Newspaper Won’t Mention Donald Trump For 24 Hours Over Anti-Semitic Attacks on Journalists,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jewish-forward-donald-trump_us_576812bae4b0fbbc8beb096c,"It's a ""Trumpatorium,"" says Forward editor-in-chief.",2016-06-20,Some prominent Jewish journalists have faced anti-Semitic attacks for their coverage of Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Forward, a 119-year-old Jewish newspaper and news site, has declared a “Trumpatorium” beginning Tuesday morning in response to Donald Trump supporters leveling anti-Semitic slurs at journalists covering the 2016 election. “Online bullying is a non-partisan activity — both the far left and the far right are quite good at it — but the virulent anti-Semitism many journalists experience today comes from what is known as the ‘alt-right,’ shadowy white supremacists who mainly hide behind the anonymity of Twitter to traffic in horrible Holocaust imagery and directly threaten Jews,” editor-in-chief Jane Eisner wrote Monday.Launched in 1897 as a Yiddish-language daily newspaper, the Forward remains an influential voice on issues in the Jewish community, though doesn't have as large a reach in politics as national media outlets covering the ins and outs of the campaign each day. So the paper's 24-hour absence from the Donald Trump beat won't be as noticeable as, say, the New York Times or CNN ignoring the presumptive Republican nominee. Still, Eisner's admittedly ""symbolic"" gesture could shine a light on the barrage of slurs that Jewish journalists -- or those perceived to be Jewish -- have received this election cycle. The Anti-Defamation League announced earlier this month it would investigate such harassment of journalists and set up a task force that included Columbia Journalism School dean Steve Coll, Medill Journalism School dean Brad Hamm, former New Republic literary editor Leon Wieseltier, and Julia Ioffe, who writes for Politico Magazine, HuffPost’s Highline and GQ. Ioffe faced anti-Semitic attacks after profiling Melania Trump, who suggested the writer provoked such abuse. Ioffe’s not alone, as other prominent journalists have grappled with an uptick of similar attacks during Trump’s race for the White House. Jonathan Weisman, a New York Times deputy editor, recently quit Twitter following repeated attacks while The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg co-opted an online meme, using parentheses to identify someone as Jewish, to defuse its power. Eisner noted that Forward columnists Bethany Mandel and Jay Michaelson have also “been the subjects of terrible personal attacks for their totally legitimate criticisms of Trump’s policies and pronouncements.” She wrote that Trump ""appears to have done nothing to minimize or condemn"" the attacks even if he can't be blamed for what his supporters write. The Trump campaign has gone to unprecedented lengths to control the press during the election cycle, from restricting journalists’ ability to report at events to refusing press credentials to numerous outlets, including The Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Politico and The Washington Post. Such restrictions have come as the Republican candidate was covered obsessively since jumping in the race a year ago. Eisner wrote that the ""Trumpatorium"" also serves as a moment to reflect on the media’s role in boosting Trump's candidacy. “We gave him what seemed like unlimited air time, ignoring the old rules of fairness and balance,” she wrote. ""We let him do what he does best: define the world in his terms, civic consequences be damned.”Read Eisner’s full column here.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Nationalism and fear is driving the current conversation about the upcoming EU Referendum vote, Rowling wrote. But she also noted that on the U.S. campaign trail, the same tactics are being used.""He achieved this pre-eminence by proposing crude, unworkable solutions to complex threats,"" she said. ""Terrorism? 'Ban all Muslims!' Immigration? 'Build a wall!'""Rowling has consistently been a member of team #NeverTrump, and recently said Trump is even worse than Voldemort, referring to a loathed Harry Potter character. But in May, Rowling shocked fans at the PEN America Literary Gala in New York City by defending Trump's right to be offensive.Last year an online petition demanding Trump be banned from entering the U.K. garnered half a million signatures. Rowling addressed both the signatures and Trump's comments in her Gala speech: If my offended feelings can justify a travel ban on Donald Trump, I have no moral ground on which to argue that those offended by feminism or the fight for transgender rights or universal suffrage should not oppress campaigners for those causes. If you seek the removal of freedoms from an opponent simply on the grounds that they have offended you, you have crossed the line to stand alongside tyrants who imprison, torture, and kill on exactly the same justification.Now, Rowling is using Trump, his comments and his tactics as an example of the type of nationalism she says is so dangerous.""Look towards the Republican Party in America and shudder,"" she said. ""God help America. God help us all.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Steve King (R-Iowa) has filed legislation that would block the U.S. Treasury Department from putting Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.King is perhaps best-known in the nation's capital for his anti-immigration rhetoric and his hostility to undocumented immigrants. But this takes his mean-spirited forays into racial politics in a new direction.The congressman introduced an amendment that would bar the Treasury Department from spending any funds to redesign paper money or coin currency. If approved, the language would nullify Treasury's plans to replace the current image of President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill with a portrait of Tubman -- a black woman after generations of white men on the money. King hopes his language will be attached to a broader bill authorizing the Treasury's overall funding.Harriet Tubman was a dedicated abolitionist and women's suffrage advocate. She aided John Brown as he prepared his 1859 anti-slavery raid on Harper's Ferry and was one of the most prominent participants in the Underground Railroad, a network of abolitionists who helped guide escaped slaves to freedom.Treasury announced its plan to swap Jackson for Tubman two months ago. The department had been considering a redesign of the $10 bill, which features the nation's first Treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton. Popular enthusiasm for the musical ""Hamilton"" derailed that project in favor of a redesign of the $20 bill. Several historians have objected to the musical's benevolent depiction of Hamilton, arguing that it erases his authoritarian attitudes and overstates his commitment to racial justice. Jackson's presidential legacy, meanwhile, includes the Indian Removal Act, a key tool in the U.S. government's onetime policy of Native American genocide. Harriet Tubman, who was born before Jackson assumed the presidency and died in the early days of the Woodrow Wilson administration, carries none of this baggage.In the months since Treasury announced the switch, presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has defended Old Hickory's place on the $20 and former Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.) has argued there was more to Jackson's legacy than killing.King's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
10,BLACK VOICES,How Black Communities Could Better Help Sickle Cell Patients,Lilly Workneh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-communities-help-sickle-cell-patients_us_5766c66ee4b0853f8bf12f98,"African-Americans are disproportionately affected by sickle cell, but not enough are signing up for clinical trials to help.",2016-06-20,"Sickle-cell disease, sickle-cell anaemia or drepanocytosis is a recessive genetic blood disorder characterized by red blood cells that assume an abnormal, rigid, sickle shape. Here healthy blood cells are seen along with diseased cells.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5766cea01500002b0073b5dd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Imagine holding a cube of ice with no way to relinquish it, or being unable to remove a knife that's constantly piercing an open wound. These are some of the ways Marie Ojiambo described the ""excruciating"" pain of suffering from sickle cell disease, a disorder that causes red blood cells to change shape in ways that block proper blood flow and oxygen from traveling throughout the body. There are millions of black people around the world who are disproportionately affected by this disease. World Sickle Cell Awareness Day, which was on Sunday, is meant to raise public knowledge and understanding of the crippling condition. In effort to carry on with that mission, Pfizer shared news with reporters at a roundtable discussion on June 6 in New York about promising new research it has conducted that could help millions of sickle cell patients around the globe.Pfizer isn't the only company looking to improve treatments for the disease. Selexys and bluebird bio are two pharmaceutical companies that have both designed similar studies to treat sickle cell. But these companies all claim to run into a pretty significant problem: Difficulty enrolling black patients in the clinical trials.These trials help to test the efficacy of the medications pharmaceutical companies hope to develop for the disease but because of a confluence of factors, from distrust of doctors to logistical difficulties, the enrollment rates of black patients have been low.“Clinical trial participation is a challenge in general,” Dr. Freda Lewis-Hall, Pfizer's chief medical officer, said. “There are very special and unique problems in the sickle cell community. Only one in seven people in the U.S. know someone who has actually participated in a clinical trial and only one in five people say their physician has ever talked to them about a clinical trial. This is an elite experience, in general. When you get to the African-American community, it is an even more elite experience.”The tendency of the black community to participate in clinical trials at far lower rates is arguably because of the community's mistrust of doctors, which was instilled from unethical studies done in the past. The Tuskegee experiment was one particular controversial and horrifically unethical study on Syphilis that played a major role in this divide. The experiment, which was conducted from 1932 to 1972, involved 600 impoverished black men who were intentionally withheld from treatment of the disease by doctors who sought to see the condition take its full course in black bodies.The Tuskegee experiment, which was later turned into a film, forever left an impact on how black people perceive clinical studies and tainted their overall attitudes towards treatment from doctors, said Sonja L. Banks, president of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America. “There are lot of things I hear, one is of past studies and the history about the Syphilis study,” Banks said of the barriers to getting black people to participate in clinical trials. “But the majority of individuals with sickle cell are African-American or minority. Who’s gonna help? Who’s going to make these drugs come to fruition. It’s gotta be us.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5766cece2200002e00f81ce9.jpeg?ops=crop_5_21_609_368%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Imagine holding a cube of ice with no way to relinquish it, or being unable to remove a knife that's constantly piercing an open wound. These are some of the ways Marie Ojiambo described the ""excruciating"" pain of suffering from sickle cell disease, a disorder that causes red blood cells to change shape in ways that block proper blood flow and oxygen from traveling throughout the body. There are millions of black people around the world who are disproportionately affected by this disease. World Sickle Cell Awareness Day, which was on Sunday, is meant to raise public knowledge and understanding of the crippling condition. In effort to carry on with that mission, Pfizer shared news with reporters at a roundtable discussion on June 6 in New York about promising new research it has conducted that could help millions of sickle cell patients around the globe.Pfizer isn't the only company looking to improve treatments for the disease. Selexys and bluebird bio are two pharmaceutical companies that have both designed similar studies to treat sickle cell. But these companies all claim to run into a pretty significant problem: Difficulty enrolling black patients in the clinical trials.These trials help to test the efficacy of the medications pharmaceutical companies hope to develop for the disease but because of a confluence of factors, from distrust of doctors to logistical difficulties, the enrollment rates of black patients have been low.“Clinical trial participation is a challenge in general,” Dr. Freda Lewis-Hall, Pfizer's chief medical officer, said. “There are very special and unique problems in the sickle cell community. Only one in seven people in the U.S. know someone who has actually participated in a clinical trial and only one in five people say their physician has ever talked to them about a clinical trial. This is an elite experience, in general. When you get to the African-American community, it is an even more elite experience.”The tendency of the black community to participate in clinical trials at far lower rates is arguably because of the community's mistrust of doctors, which was instilled from unethical studies done in the past. The Tuskegee experiment was one particular controversial and horrifically unethical study on Syphilis that played a major role in this divide. The experiment, which was conducted from 1932 to 1972, involved 600 impoverished black men who were intentionally withheld from treatment of the disease by doctors who sought to see the condition take its full course in black bodies.The Tuskegee experiment, which was later turned into a film, forever left an impact on how black people perceive clinical studies and tainted their overall attitudes towards treatment from doctors, said Sonja L. Banks, president of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America. “There are lot of things I hear, one is of past studies and the history about the Syphilis study,” Banks said of the barriers to getting black people to participate in clinical trials. “But the majority of individuals with sickle cell are African-American or minority. Who’s gonna help? Who’s going to make these drugs come to fruition. It’s gotta be us. If we don’t participate, we will never find treatment or a cure.” Banks added: “There’s not enough white people to get in trials to help you. Let’s get educated, [let’s] go back to the syphilis study and look at what happened. That will never happen again, because we’re too much of an educated community now. We can get educated enough to make an informed decision.” Lewis-Hall stressed that at the end of the day, ""we have got to find a way to increase diversity in clinical trials.""One of the ways to possibly alleviate the low participation from the black community and the cultural context behind mistreatment in the medical research community is to re-educate people about these past studies, according to Lewis-Hall.“In the 100 years since sickle cell was discovered, there’s only one FDA approved drug and it’s not even for sickle cell,” Banks said. “Our people are still going to emergency room as their medical home.

But advocates say that the decision has fallen short, considering that victims of sexual assault who became pregnant are still being banned from mainstream education.During the height of the Ebola crisis, instances of sexual exploitation dramatically increased. Orphaned girls turned to selling sex when they couldn’t afford the basics, and many didn’t have the protections they once did from predators. As a result, teen pregnancies spiked.But instead of embracing the struggling adolescents, they were barred from attending school when institutions reopened in April of last year. The concern was that the pregnant girls would have a “negative influence” over other students, Brima Turay, education minister, told AFP. To determine if girls were in fact pregnant, they were forced to undergo humiliating checks. Administrators would, for example, squeeze girls’ breasts in public to see if they expressed milk, according to Amnesty International.The following month, the President Ernest Bai Koroma “compromised” by allowing pregnant girls to attend alternative schools.Advocates were wary of that option though since it stigmatized pregnant girls and the education was far inferior to the traditional school system.The alternative schools were only in session for a few hours every few days and girls were not permitted to sit for national exams, according to Equality Now, an organization that advocates for the rights of girls.“While this alternative might be based in good intentions, separate and unequal schooling only serves to perpetuate discrimination and stigma against the adolescent girls who have been victimized by those with power,” Christa Stewart, Equality Now program manager, said in a statement.Last March, Koroma reversed the ban, but that only pertained to girls who had given birth since the crisis. According to the AFP, 5,000 students who had been expelled for getting pregnant during the Ebola outbreak were allowed back. While those girls have been given a chance to pursue their education, other sexual assault survivors have been glaringly left out.Frances, for example, who comes from an impoverished home in Sierra Leone, was desperate to go to school but she couldn’t afford the fees. The 13-year-old agreed to have sex with an older man in exchange for his paying for her school costs, according to Equality Now.

Makbola and Turquia followed later, traveling with her brother and his wife, but they got stuck in Greece when the Balkan Route closed.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5767f7242200002e00f81e58.jpeg?cache=lnFRQuFxNO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Before police cleared the Idomeni refugee camp in Greece last month, photographer Jodi Hilton met girls like Zeyneb, 13, waiting to reunite with their mothers who had already made it to Europe. Hilton's photos tell their stories.When I first met 13-year-old Zeyneb Omer, she was shivering next to a smoldering fire, dressed in a thin blue and yellow raincoat. It was a cold, rainy day in March 2016 in Idomeni, where 14,000 immigrants had created a makeshift camp in Greece next to the Macedonian border. In May, Greek police closed this camp, relocating refugees via bus to locations elsewhere in Greece.She and her 7-year-old sister, Diana, and their father, Ziyad, hoped to reach her mother and brother in the Netherlands. Zeyneb and her family are part of a large second wave of immigrants and refugees who are trying to reunite with family members already in Europe.Zeyneb’s family fled Aleppo, Syria, in 2014. They didn’t have funds for everyone to travel together, so the family decided Zeyneb’s mother would go first. So last fall, her mother, Zahera, and 5-year-old brother traveled to Europe. “We heard that when women go to Europe, they are better cared for,” said Ziyad through an interpreter. Her mother and brother arrived in the Netherlands in October 2015.Nearly a third of approximately 54,000 asylum seekers stuck in Greece are trying to reunite with a family member already in Europe, according to the U.N.

""Why did he target the LGBT community, a community that so often is the victim of hate crime, in both an act of hate and terror?""Early in the morning of June 12, Omar Mateen killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, in what is now the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history.Much of the debate in the wake of the shooting has focused on terrorism -- what needs to be done to stop more attacks in the name of the so-called Islamic State on U.S. soil.Mateen had pledged allegiance to ISIS, but his father believed his son may have had a different motivation for the attack, noting that Mateen had recently become angry after seeing two men kissing in front of his family. Some of Mateen's friends said they believed he was gay -- but not open about it -- and may have tried to pick up men on gay dating sites. In the wake of the shooting, many in the LGBT community have called on politicians to examine the effect of their homophobic rhetoric and policies. Most notably, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R) has been grilled about how her sympathetic post-Orlando rhetoric squares with her long fight against LGBT equality. ""I've never said I don't like gay people. That's ridiculous,"" she told CNN host Anderson Cooper in a recent interview.""But you were arguing [in court] that gay marriage -- if there was gay marriage, if there was same-sex marriage -- that would do harm to the people of Florida, to Florida society,"" Cooper replied. ""Are you saying you do not believe it would do harm to Florida?"" Bondi said that's not what she was arguing.""The question has now been called upon the people of Florida: Will you uproot this toxic dehumanization of the LGBT community,"" said Nadine Smith, executive director of the LGBT advocacy group Equality Florida, ""or will you, by action or indifference, allow us to be treated as inferiors in laws that protect our basic rights?""

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57644c921500002a0073b36b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As President Barack Obama approaches the end of his second term, there's been much discussion of what his legacy will be. While much of that debate focuses on his foreign policy or his sweeping domestic policies, such as the Affordable Care Act, there's another area where the 44th president has left a significant mark: making life easier for millions of working parents.""His administration has spent a lot of time and energy explaining why family-friendly policies are good for business, and providing a platform for employers to share their own views on the topic,"" said Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families.Those policies have included expanding paid parental leave and sick time, emphasizing gender equality in parenting and reducing some of the costs associated with having children. (There have also been some misses -- family policy advocates pointed to the administration's continued deportation raids targeting mothers and children as a major disappointment.) ""This administration has focused in on those issues in ways that previous administrations did not,"" says Heather Boushey, the executive director and chief economist of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, noting that's been driven in part by the Obama administration's ideology and in part by the economic conditions over the last decade. Here are some of the ways Obama's presidency has benefited parents:He's emphasized giving new mothers and fathers the time off they need.""We are a nation that, on the one hand, both encourages and preaches about the importance of being good parents to your children,"" says Ellen Bravo of Family Values @ Work, an advocacy group that pushes for paid sick and family leave. ""And yet for millions Americans, doing exactly that will cost them their financial security."" Obama has pushed to make it possible for parents to be both engaged with their children and financially secure, signing an executive action granting federal workers six weeks of paid leave after a child is born. He's also urged Congress and state legislatures to expand paid leave, and emphasized the issue in his 2015 State of the Union address. The Labor Department, meanwhile, has given grants to states exploring the benefits of granting more workers paid leave.This emphasis appears to have had some trickle-down effects. Cities like New York, San Francisco and Austin have moved forward on their own to grant workers paid family leave. The issue also became an important one on the campaign trail throughout the primary season. And while just 12 percent of Americans currently have access to paid parental leave, there seems to be a shift in some sectors: Tech companies in particular have started offering generous paid leave programs, in part to retain talented workers.Many studies tout the benefits of family leave for parents and children alike. Children whose parents are granted paid parental leave are more likely to be immunized. Women are also more likely to breastfeed longer if given more paid time off, which in turn can help prevent asthma, infections and other health problems. A 2011 study found that increasing paid maternity and paternity leave could even reduce the infant mortality rate by 10 percent. Fathers who are given paternity leave are more likely to take an active role in parenting later on, which can help with children's development.Parents also see significant health benefits: A 2015 study published in Social Science & Medicine found women who are given paid maternity leave with full benefits are 16.2 percent less likely to become depressed than women without paid leave. Another study found that women who have paid maternity leave are significantly less likely to experience depression later in life.Allowing new parents time off to bond with their child also benefits the companies they work for. Research shows that individuals given paid maternity leave are more likely to return to work at the same company, reducing costs associated with employee turnover. Women who take paid leave are also more likely to work more hours and remain in the workforce longer.""That can save firms significant money,"" says Boushey.But it's not just new parents that need time with their kids.Obama has also required federal contractors to provide paid sick days to their employees, which parents can use to care for children or other loved ones in need. He's also emphasized these policies at the state and municipal level: Currently, five states and 26 cities have paid sick time policies in place.""The progress we have seen in recent years is hugely important, not just because of those who have been helped, but also because we now have an irrefutable body of evidence demonstrating that paid sick days policies work well for employers as well as workers,"" said Ness, pointing to research showing how paid sick time has little impact on profitability and in some cases has boosted productivity among workers.The American Medical Association has also endorsed paid sick leave, arguing that by giving individuals time off to care for themselves or their children, they are reducing the risk of transmitting diseases or viruses to others or prolonging illness.""Paid sick leave keeps our homes, offices and communities healthier while ensuring the family's economic security,"" the organization said.He's embraced the role of ""dad-in-chief.""""Barack Obama has been 'dad-in-chief' in a way we haven't seen before in the White House,"" said Bravo. ""He talks openly about the need for fathers to be engaged, but also that women are disproportionately affected by the lack of [family-friendly] policies."" Obama regularly talks about his relationship with his daughters, Malia and Sasha, and the importance of his role as a father. Bravo argues that by doing so, Obama has made parenthood an issue of national importance. She pointed specifically to Obama sharing how his daughters had reshaped his views on marriage equality.""That's a great model in a father,"" she said.His emphasis on fatherhood -- which Obama has said stems from his own childhood with an absent dad -- could have a concrete impact on kids if emulated. Studies show that children with engaged fathers have higher cognitive ability and stronger literacy skills. Children with engaged parents are also likelier to be healthy and have less emotional distress. And by emphasizing equality in parenting, Obama is making strides for women as well. ""His gender-neutral approach to family-friendly policies is also tremendously positive because it underscores that, for families and communities to thrive, we must recognize that caregiving is not just a women’s issue,"" said Ness.He's addressed rising income inequality. Obama's answers to the country's worsening economic inequality -- the Affordable Care Act, pushing for a higher minimum wage, proposing tax credits for child care expenses -- could have a significant impact on working families.""This is an era in which the kinds of benefits that families get make all the difference for economic security,"" said Boushey. Research shows that low wages have a major impact on families, and women of color are disproportionately affected. Raising the federal minimum wage, as Obama has proposed, would increase the salaries of millions of low-wage workers -- most of whom are women. As for the ACA, a 2014 Brookings Institution study found that Obamacare will ease income inequality over time by boosting the average income of the country's lowest earners. Another study by the Urban Institute found that the law will help close the coverage gap between white people and people of color.Ness also pointed to provisions of Obamacare, like contraception coverage and requiring employers to give nursing mothers time to pump at work, as being huge milestones for parents, arguing that these policies are ""essential to women’s ability to participate and succeed in the workforce."""
29,POLITICS,How Obama's Presidency Has Been A Victory For Working Parents,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-family-policies-fathers-day_us_5762e2a5e4b09c926cfe7b8d,The 44th president's legacy will include his strong advocacy for families.,2016-06-19,Obama has emphasized the importance of fatherhood throughout his presidency.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5762e33a2200002e00f8161e.jpeg?cache=G3xo8NIN9I&ops=crop_23_176_2121_1057%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"As President Barack Obama approaches the end of his second term, there's been much discussion of what his legacy will be. While much of that debate focuses on his foreign policy or his sweeping domestic policies, such as the Affordable Care Act, there's another area where the 44th president has left a significant mark: making life easier for millions of working parents.""His administration has spent a lot of time and energy explaining why family-friendly policies are good for business, and providing a platform for employers to share their own views on the topic,"" said Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families.Those policies have included expanding paid parental leave and sick time, emphasizing gender equality in parenting and reducing some of the costs associated with having children. (There have also been some misses -- family policy advocates pointed to the administration's continued deportation raids targeting mothers and children as a major disappointment.) ""This administration has focused in on those issues in ways that previous administrations did not,"" says Heather Boushey, the executive director and chief economist of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, noting that's been driven in part by the Obama administration's ideology and in part by the economic conditions over the last decade. Here are some of the ways Obama's presidency has benefited parents:He's emphasized giving new mothers and fathers the time off they need.""We are a nation that, on the one hand, both encourages and preaches about the importance of being good parents to your children,"" says Ellen Bravo of Family Values @ Work, an advocacy group that pushes for paid sick and family leave. ""And yet for millions Americans, doing exactly that will cost them their financial security."" Obama has pushed to make it possible for parents to be both engaged with their children and financially secure, signing an executive action granting federal workers six weeks of paid leave after a child is born. He's also urged Congress and state legislatures to expand paid leave, and emphasized the issue in his 2015 State of the Union address. The Labor Department, meanwhile, has given grants to states exploring the benefits of granting more workers paid leave.This emphasis appears to have had some trickle-down effects. Cities like New York, San Francisco and Austin have moved forward on their own to grant workers paid family leave. The issue also became an important one on the campaign trail throughout the primary season. And while just 12 percent of Americans currently have access to paid parental leave, there seems to be a shift in some sectors: Tech companies in particular have started offering generous paid leave programs, in part to retain talented workers.Many studies tout the benefits of family leave for parents and children alike.

The late-night host recently banned Trump from appearing on his show, and on Friday, he took things a little further.During his hilarious, joke-filled commencement speech at Northwestern University -- Meyers' alma mater -- the comedian made sure to take a little jab at the reality TV host-turned-presidential hopeful. First, he encouraged the class to cherish their memories and friendships from Northwestern, knowing that plenty of them probably weren't even listening to his speech. “My words won’t be what stays with you from today,” he said. “Today is the culmination of your journey and your achievements. So, while I’m speaking, I invite you to drift off and remember your favorite parts of the last four years. Remember what you accomplished and what you overcame and the fun you had and the people you met because that’s what will stay with you."" After sharing some thoughtful words of inspiration with the class of 2016 -- which he admittedly stole from Michelle Obama’s and Lin-Manuel Miranda’s previous commencement speeches at City College of New York and the University of Pennsylvania, respectively -- Meyers turned to the words of Trump. ""I think my favorite inspirational quote came from Donald Trump,"" Meyers said as the crowd cheered on, ""who said to the graduates of Trump University, 'If you want your money back, you’re gonna have to sue me, you losers.'""Of course, the crowd erupted into laughter. Following his dig at the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, Meyers fittingly urged the graduates to vote. ""Remember that the worst things that happen in this country don’t happen because of hate or rage or fear — they happen because of apathy,"" he said. ""I encourage you to be people of action. I encourage you to do the most you can while remembering the least you can do is vote. So, vote this election. Don’t forget.""You can watch his whole speech below: Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Michael McCaul (R-Texas) found himself in one of these situations Sunday, when he criticized Democrats for their record on terrorism but couldn't pinpoint how his party's presumptive presidential nominee would make things any better. McCaul said on ABC's ""This Week"" that he didn't want to attack President Barack Obama personally, but he did believe ""the foreign policy that's been conducted over the last three-and-a-half years since we've known about ISIS has led to"" attacks like the June 12 shooting in Orlando that killed 49 people. ""So, have you heard anything from your presumptive Republican nominee since this attack, or before, that would better prevent or fight this threat?"" host Jonathan Karl asked. McCaul struggled to name anything specific from Trump: McCAUL: I think, again, not waiting three-and-a-half years to deal with the problem. I think you'll hear --McCaul has not yet endorsed Trump, calling his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States ""unconstitutional” and his plan to make Mexico pay for a giant border wall ""simplistic"" and ""knee-jerk."" But Trump is now at the top of the party's ticket, and for better or worse, he is setting the agenda for which other Republicans are having to answer. And so far, his most notable proposal for stopping terrorism in the United States is a blanket ban on Muslims entering the country. Trump has also said he would ""knock the hell"" out of the so-called Islamic State if elected president and has promised ""to take out” the families of terrorists. He later clarified that he didn't say he would kill the civilians but would simply ""go after them” -- leaving most observers confused on what that would entail.Trump has said that part of the reason he is offering so few specifics on how he would fight terrorism is because he doesn't want certain entities ""to know what I’m thinking.""""That's the problem with our country,"" he told The New York Times in March. ""A politician would say, 'Oh I would never go to war,' or they'd say, 'Oh I would go to war.' I don’t want to say what I'd do because, again, we need unpredictability. You know, if I win, I don’t want to be in a position where I've said I would or I wouldn't.""Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S. "

Locals came with trucks of food and water and gave their blood. Donations to a victims' fund reached more than $5.4 million as of Sunday afternoon. Everywhere you turn in this city, there are signs offering grief counseling, local businesses raising funds and shoulders to lean on.But it shouldn't have surprised anyone that the LGBT community here shows strength and grit in the face of adversity. It's a tight-knit crew that's always been ready to jump up and offer its support, no matter what the cause.Prior to the tragedy at Pulse, activists like Loc Robertson -- who's been a bartender at Parliament House resort for 20 years -- were working to raise money for cancer survivors. He organized two national drag pageants to raise money for The Barber Fund, an Orlando-based organization that supports cancer patients and their loved ones.The Barber Fund and groups like it are now shifting their focus to Pulse.""I’ve been amazed to see how many fundraisers and outreach programs and straight communities have all reached out. It’s incredible,"" Robertson said. ""But Orlando, we've always worked together. Everyone is in the same boat, and we're all going through this together.""That feeling of togetherness permeates the entire city. It's why the Orlando Shakespeare Theater didn't ask questions when the Westboro Baptist Church showed up over the weekend and instead built angel wings that would block the protesters from the funeral processions:Meanwhile, the performance community has rallied around Pulse. As the Blacklist Babes Cabaret practiced for an upcoming burlesque show at a home outside of town last week, they were in a state of mourning and remembrance. Several of the group's members had performed at the nightclub and said the shooting shattered their world.""It makes us want to go out and perform as big as we can and sing as loud as we can,"" said music director Justin Scarlat. ""We still get to do every day what those 49 cannot do anymore. We want to tell their stories; we want to make sure that they’re not forgotten because these people are our family ... We want to make sure we’re performing for them.""The nightclub was a cross-section of Orlando's LGBT community: performers, dancers, party animals and friends.""That’s what Pulse was -- just a huge melting pot of lots of different performers,"" said choreographer Marisa Quijano. ""A lot of our performer friends were involved in the Pulse community. We hung out there, we performed there ... It was so open to everyone.""Just a day after the shooting, Justin Townes, a 25-year-old Orlando native who was performing at Stonewall, Orlando's sister bar to Stonewall Inn in New York City, said he was ready to help in any way he could.He was a bit restricted at the time, however, because he was wearing a merman costume, swimming in a human-sized fish tank at the popular gay bar.""Need a friend? A hug? A place to stay? We got it for you,"" Townes said. ""This has been a very hard learning process. It's an eye-opener ... But Orlando has more love than hate right now.""He said it would be hard to find someone who isn't grieving for some time -- but it'll also be hard to find someone without a support network in this city.""Now our community is different,"" he said. ""On the other hand, this incident is going to show what pride is all about -- love and equality ... You can’t look at someone because of how they dress or who they love or their religious beliefs. As long as there is respect and love, that’s all that matters."""
