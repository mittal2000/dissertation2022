5,POLITICS,Obama's Trade Deal Is Tangled In The Intricate Web Of Malaysia's Slavery Problem,Laura Barron-Lopez and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/malaysia-slavery-trade_n_7472682.html,,2015-05-31,"Migrants sit on their boat as they wait to be rescued by Acehnese fishermen on the sea off East Aceh, Indonesia, Wednesday, May 20, 2015. Hundreds of migrants stranded at sea for months were rescued and taken to Indonesia, officials said Wednesday, the latest in a stream of Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants to reach shore in a growing crisis confronting Southeast Asia. (AP Photo/S. Yulinnas)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fd2b1f00004002257fa5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama's push for legislation that would enable the U.S. to strike a major trade deal with 11 other countries has gotten tangled in a debate over Malaysia's record on slave labor, throwing up a last-minute legislative obstacle.  Inconveniently for backers of the trade deal, a full-blown humanitarian crisis is erupting in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Myanmar, directly connected to the region's reliance on human trafficking in industries as varied as electronics manufacturing, fishing and prostitution.  Last year, Malaysia and Thailand joined North Korea and Saudi Arabia on the State Department’s list of countries that are the worst offenders in forced labor and human trafficking -- formally known as a tier 3 designation. One year later, little has changed, though the importance of the tier 3 designation has surged as a result of the trade debate. the U.S. Senate last week passed legislation declaring that no country that engages in slave labor, such as Malaysia, can be a part of the trade deal.  As Malaysia angles for membership in a historic international trade deal of epic scope, it is facing increased scrutiny for its human rights record, yet doing little to change the facts on the ground.  In April, U.S. Ambassador Joseph Yun criticized Malaysia’s lack of progress on human trafficking. “The most obvious area is prosecution. Is there enough prosecution [of offenders] considering the incidence of trafficking?” Yun said, suggesting that such prosecutions were inexcusably rare.   This month, more than 139 grave sites were discovered, along with 28 suspected human trafficking camps in the far north of Malaysia, near the Thai border. Multiple bodies were found in each site, leading Malaysian authorities to estimate the number of dead to be well above 100. With Malaysia finding itself engulfed in a migrant crisis, the United Nations has called on it to help rescue tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims stranded at sea and in jungle concentration camps. Malaysia has not only refused, but has rebuffed even  seriously participating in discussions. Meanwhile, a top Malaysian minister has said that despite the U.S. Senate's legislation, his government is sure it will be allowed into the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which may explain Malaysia's lack of interest in addressing the human trafficking crisis. According to Malay Mail Online:   US news website Huffington Post reported Friday that while the White House is on the verge of securing the fast-track approval it needs to push ahead with the long-delayed free-trade deal, a US senator has succeeded in inserting a provision that would bar his country from entering agreements with countries officially viewed as engaging in slavery, which includes Malaysia.“Regarding our Tier 3 position on human trafficking, this could be resolved if a Tier 3 country is seen to be taking concrete steps to implement recommendations in the Trafficking in Persons report,” Malaysia Minister Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed told the paper, referring to the State Department’s trafficking report. The White House has pushed for a modification of the Senate bill that mirrors the policy described by Mohamed, meaning revised language in a future House bill could allow Malaysia, or a tier 3 nation, into trade deals if they craft a plan to address human trafficking.But the task of watering down the slavery language is made more challenging by the exploding humanitarian catastrophe, which couldn't come at a worse time for trade deal negotiators, who have argued that the Trans-Pacific Partnership, in the words of Obama, will be ""the most progressive trade deal in history.""     While that's a low bar, the active participation of a country that so blatantly participates in the slave trade calls that claim into question. American workers argue that they will face downward wage pressure from competition from Southeast Asian countries, and the fact that some of those workers will not be paid at all, but rather will be forced to work for free, only feeds those suspicions.  How did Malaysia get to this point? For the past four years, it has been on the State Department’s tier 2 watch list, and over the last seven has been ranked a tier 3 human trafficking nation three times.   The lack of consequences is just one explanation for Malaysia's apathetic response to the crisis. Perhaps more to the point, trafficking is an integral part of the nation's political economy, fed by surrounding countries.  The majority of the persecuted Rohingya are fleeing from Myanmar to neighboring nations of Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Further exacerbating the issue, Thailand cracked down on land-based migrant routes earlier this year, forcing smugglers to traffic people by sea, pushing even more to Malaysia.  Additionally, foreign workers typically migrate willingly to Malaysia from other Asian nations, according to the State Department annual report on human trafficking. Those countries include Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal and Thailand. A number of the migrants, the State Department report says, “subsequently encounter forced labor or debt bondage at the hands of their employers, employment agents, or informal labor recruiters.”  On top of that, the Malaysian government began a policy in 2013 that “places the burden of paying immigration and employment authorization fees on foreign workers,” rather than employers, making workers more susceptible to debt bondage. To make matters worse, employers in agriculture, construction, textile factories, and other domestic work throughout Malaysia routinely confiscate foreign workers' passports and other immigration documents,   making it impossible for them to leave the country, and very difficult to find other work if they want to stay. Most workers aren't allowed to travel within Malaysia without immigration documents.  Immigration officials also contribute to the problem. “Press reports continued to accuse some immigration officials of facilitating smuggling, including the transportation of trafficking victims,” the State Department’s report says.  Such press reports include detailed investigations by Reuters revealing that the Thai navy is one key link in the chain of smugglers exploiting Rohingya Muslims. After interviewing smugglers and dozens of survivors who migrated via boat, Reuters found Thai naval personnel had worked with smugglers to profit from asylum seekers. (The Thai navy subsequently filed defamation charges against two journalists; the journalists won a Pulitzer Prize.)  Still, the State Department notes the Malaysian government “did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in human trafficking,” despite multiple reports alleging such involvement.

I like to think of this time of year, however, as Parenting Season, the span between Mother's Day and Father's Day. It can be a challenging time for LGBTQ parents and our kids, since we don't fit into those two categories in the traditional way -- but it can also be a great time to celebrate and raise awareness about our families.I'm proud to see the growing presence of LGBTQ families in the media, including drama and comedy as well as the news. ABC's Modern Family, which includes gay dads in its ensemble cast, is one of the most awarded comedy series of all time. Sister network ABC Family's The Fosters, about two moms and their mix of biological, adopted and foster kids, has won critical acclaim, including Television Academy Honors ""for using the power of television to bring awareness to important social issues."" Even better, the show has garnered an avid audience of youth who follow the storylines of the teen characters.Both The Fosters and Modern Family have aired the weddings of the shows' same-sex parents. Season-ending weddings are a television trope. Season-ending weddings of same-sex parents means we've arrived, at least in some pop-culture sense. I happen to believe that pop culture is a leading indicator for legal and political change, though, so that's not a frivolous statement.Although our pop culture inclusion is new, it was built on a long history of LGBTQ parents and our children. It's a history that is still being set down, in films like Debra Chasnoff's Choosing Children, about the first generation of lesbians to become parents after coming out, and books like Daniel Winunwe Rivers' Radical Relations, which charts the history of gay and lesbian parents since World War II. I'm reminded of the old saying (sometimes attributed to Winston Churchill) that ""history is written by the victors."" We haven't won quite yet, but things are looking hopeful. Our history will root us as we grow into the future.Despite our progress, neither pop culture nor marriage alone will give us full equality, even if the U.S. Supreme Court rules favorably in the coming weeks. Not all states -- even ones that allow same-sex couples to marry -- protect people from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Not all states allow all LGBTQ people to be legal parents to our children, or do so only after a long, costly process. Not all schools include books, other curricular materials, or administrative forms that are inclusive of LGBTQ people and our families. Not every parent knows how to talk about LGBTQ people with their kids.While legal progress and media representation can help, much change comes simply from telling our stories. Stories both strengthen our community and help others to better understand us. That's why I'm very excited about Blogging for LGBTQ Families Day on June 1, the annual event that I've been hosting at my blog for the past ten years. Participants have included LGBTQ parents, prospective parents, the childfree, our children, and allies, sharing their stories to remind us of how we're all alike -- and how we're all different.To join us, simply post at your own blog in celebration and support of LGBTQ families (however you define them) and submit the link at Mombian, where I'll compile and showcase the master list for all to see. If you don't have a blog of your own, you can write at a group blog, upload a video to YouTube or another video-sharing site, or simply leave a comment on the master post at Mombian that day. You can also participate by tweeting with the hashtag #LGBTQfamilies. Posts may be personal anecdotes, political commentaries, book reviews, photographs, or anything else related to the theme.Some of us blog about LGBTQ families regularly; others rarely. But I encourage you to do so on June 1 to help build community and bridges. Even if you don't contribute, I hope you'll help spread the word about the event and come by to read some of the many wonderful posts -- a great way to start a month of Pride and a proud feeling to last all year long."

Despite being tasked with making budget cuts, Patten said the committee had decided job losses would “not be ethically appropriate.”He instead foresaw the merging of the various communication tools, which include radio, television, a publishing house and underdeveloped online services.Some 60 million euros invested annually in L’Osservatore Romano newspaper and Vatican Radio will be redirected to other areas, Patten said, such as the “very underresourced” television and social media services.“What is needed now is more visual, multimedia content, especially if one wishes to reach younger people,” Patten said, explaining the Vatican’s need to take an interactive approach.The Vatican should also be ready to “respond rapidly to a constant news cycle and in different languages.” While Patten said the committee aimed to offer “better value for money,” he also recommended ways to boost the Vatican media budget by engaging in sponsorship deals and selling archival material. In 2012, the Vatican hired former Fox News journalist Greg Burke as its senior communications adviser and tasked him with improving the Catholic Church’s image."

But, there are things that change at 26...",2015-05-31,Female friends spending leisure time together in living room,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6013b2500009400397885.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"About a year ago I wrote this post titled ""You Know You're 25 When...."" I had spent a Friday night hanging at a friends house in sweatpants drinking wine and had this revelation that my life as I knew it was changing. I wasn't in some random dress pregaming by way of shots with a group of 20 people prepping to make my way to a ""bar with dancing."" I was getting my wine on in yogas with two lady friends, and I could not have been happier.Flash forward one year later and I'm 26. You wouldn't think much has changed since then. You would probably think the two ages are one in the same because in a way, they are (for example: lots and lots of wine). But, there are things that change at 26...Here are 13 signs that you are 26:1. You have to plan way in advance if you want to hang out with friends. No more Friday afternoon texts ""what r u doing 2nite? lets go out."" It's more like ""What are you doing three Saturdays from now?! Let's plan a night out!"" and then ""Ahh, that doesn't work for you? What about five Fridays from now?"" and then ""OMG, this is crazy!!! We are like so busy! What about 3 months from Sunday? Maybe brunch?"" and then ""AWESOME. See you then! Soooooo excited!""2. You stop going out just because and start going out only when there is a reason. And when you DO go out, it's usually for dinner and drinks... and you tend to bail, a lot.3. On the rare chance you find yourself at a ""club"" or ""bar with dancing,"" you are just soooo over it. You sometimes try to act like you're into it though because YOUTH. But really, you just want to go home, put on sweats, and eat pizza... and occasionally, you and your friends will realize that together.4. You have actual responsibilities at work now, and you actually care about them.5. Losing weight has never been harder. Your metabolism went south with the first quarter of your life. Sigh.6. Save the dates, holiday cards, baby announcements, and wedding/housewarming invites are taking over your fridge.7. Couples are either getting engaged or breaking up because at 26, you start to figure out (aka admit) what you really want... unless you're an immature guy because most guys who are physically 26 are mentally 21.8. You are seeing the divide between your single friends and your getting-married/already-married friends. It's real.9. If you're single, you've thought about dabbling in online dating if you haven't already. You're not getting any younger.10. You barely buy new clothes anymore. What would you be buying them for anyway? Work? The gym? Because those are the only two places you go. It's oversized sweater city in your closet and that's fine with you. Except when it comes to going out. You used to have a new outfit for every time you went out, which was multiple times a week, but now you have one or two ""going out"" outfits and they are super casual. Help.11. You have no idea where to shop for going out clothes. When you DO have an occasion to dress up for, or you are prepping for a trip to let's say Vegas, you have no idea how to dress. You've decided never to step foot in Forever 21 again, so where can you find clothes that are both appropriate for the club and for someone your age? Do they just not make such clothes because the two are not supposed to mesh? I'm confused.12. Weekends are good for Netflix, wine, and errands. Maybe you'll squeeze in some room to be social, maybe you won't. Grocery shopping has become a high priority though. After all, what will you make in the Crockpot this week?! Gotta browse Pinterest and Skinnytaste to decide!13. You are finally starting to save money for that future thing. Maybe because you're not spending it all on going out and clothes to go out in, but either way... perhaps one day you could really afford a nice new car or a big house. Keywords: Perhaps and one day. You're not quite there yet.This post originally appeared on Forever Twenty Somethings. Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter |   Contact HuffPost WomenALSO ON HUFFPOST:"

As it turns out, that scene was integral to Davis' decision to take on the role, according to comments the actress made at the show's recent For Your Consideration panel (via Vulture):There was something for me that I didn’t buy about Annalise in private. It felt like who she was in private had to be diametrically opposed to who she was in public. And so in order to do that, I felt like I had to physically take the wig off. I mean, I have no eyebrows. I have eyelashes that I put on, and there was something extremely vulnerable about that act -- and I know it seems like a very simple act at the end of the day -- but for me, that simple act really surmounted to something very powerful in the end, because what it was was someone being very, very private in public, which is absolutely the cornerstone of what we do as artists. The scene was but one of many that broke network TV barriers in the first season of ""How to Get Away with Murder,"" which garnered praise for its depiction of gay sex and nuanced exploration of sexual violence.For more of Davis' comments from the panel, head over to Vulture.

Services like 23andMe allow any consumer to explore their gene profile, which could be empowering or frightening depending on your perspective and family history. This data, when used in the clinic, provides physicians incredible tools in the quest to practice fully personalized medicine.Our genes provide the blueprint for our individuation, and come replete with a mixed bag of advantages and potential disadvantages -- a natural person-to-person variation which was essential to driving our species forward by way of natural selection. Today, being tethered to negative health outcomes, especially when we can see these risks decades before their potential emergence, are inconvenient (to say the least) in a time when overcoming our biological limitations seems to be as natural as genes themselves.For many, genes are not destiny, but for some, the genetic risks present high enough odds to elicit serious life questions. For others, genes do determine certain health outcomes. One such disease with a determinant gene is Huntington's Disease. Many describe having Huntington's Disease as having ALS, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's all at the same time. Today, there are approximately 30,000 symptomatic Americans and more than 200,000 at-risk of inheriting the disease.In The Lion's Mouth Opens, Walker focuses on young actress Marianna Palka as she finds out whether she has inherited this fate, an incurable degenerative disorder which took her father and now has a 50 percent chance of taking her body and her mind.I couldn't wait to ask my friend Lucy Walker about her experience documenting this harrowing journey, her thoughts on genetic testing, and how to get involved with Marianna's story.What drew you to Marianna's story?It was Marianna's idea to make a film about her journey of being tested for Huntington's Disease and she'd seen my documentaries and so she reached out to me. She wanted to shine a light on the disease and on the testing process as a project to help the Huntington's Disease Society of America. I hadn't heard of the disease so I had to google it, and I was extremely moved by what I learned. I instantly wanted to help Marianna and so I agreed. I found Marianna so compelling and charming I knew she'd make a riveting documentary subject and if you watch the film you'll agree, it's impossible to take your eyes off her. Everyone who watches the film falls in love with her and her beautiful, hilarious spiritedness.Some people would ""rather not know"" their genetic risk factors for awful diseases. What do you say to those people?I'd say I completely respect everyone's decisions and there are excellent reasons to get tested and there are excellent reasons not to get tested. It's a completely personal decision about whether or not to find out about what fates our genes might hold. Neither I nor Marianna would recommend that people undergo testing unless they are 100 percent sure they want to know, because there's no way to go back to not knowing if you don't like the result. I don't have Hungtington's in my family so I'll never know what I would do in Marianna's shoes, but personally I've elected to go through genetic testing both 23andme more for personal curiosity and also some other doctor-administered tests for some other serious conditions, so I suspect I might be inclined to get tested, even for Huntington's, which I believe is the most daunting test of all because at this point there is no cure and it is perhaps the most daunting prognosis imaginable. What we can be sure about is that more and more people are facing this question as so many more gene tests are becoming available, and so the film is close to home for a lot of people. In The Crash Reel and in The Lions Mouth Opens, you're filming some of the most tragic moments in the lives of your subjects -- in the former, traumatic brain injury, in the latter, a horrific neurodegenerative disease. How do you prepare and does it take a toll on you?I feel so lucky to be working with such inspirational, courageous, profoundly awesome people as Marianna Palka in The Lion's Mouth Opens and Kevin Pearce in The Crash Reel. Honestly I feel like it is a gift to be near them as they tackle some of life's most confronting twists and turns. I've faced down some daunting moments in my own life where I encourage myself by consciously thinking ""what would Marianna do"" and channeling her spirit. As Jason says in the movie, she doesn't ""let something as simple as fear stop her from doing anything"". Wow.Is health generally a topic you're interested in? Why?I'm obsessed with health and doing what I can to be healthy and active for as long as I can. I took care of my mother when she had cancer and I lost both my parents when they were young and I feel completely motivated to do what i can to take good care of myself. I also just feel better when I exercise daily, sleep sufficiently, meditate, don't eat sugar, etc. It's also fascinating to me how much we are learning these days, there are so many breakthroughs I'm thrilled by the new information. I'm also fascinated by how intelligent our bodies are, and how our body intelligence works -and how modern life can sometimes undermine it, so it's important that we understand what's going on and avoid the pitfalls of such modern health hazards as lights at night, plastic containers, antibiotic overuse, sugary foods, etc.How can we best help those suffering with Huntington's Disease? Tune into our film The Lion's Mouth Opens on HBO, premiering June 1st 9pm/8c and thereafter on HBOGo and HBONow -- that's the one step that we'd love for everyone to take! Huntington's Disease is less well known than it should be considering that it affects 1 in 10,000 Americans. This is because it only runs in families -- unlike say cancer or HIV, it can't be acquired by anybody unless they have a parent with it, so people haven't heard about it unless they have it in the family, and even then people often don't even talk about it because it's so frightening. The good news is that there is a lot of breakthrough research happening currently, and they have identified the gene and it's a single gene (so you could say that Huntington's is a step closer to a cure than Parkinson's or Alzheimer's which are in the same family). And meantime the best way to help is to discuss it openly, so that people are better aware of it. Last year there was a heartbreaking news story of 5 cops arresting and beating up a man who had HD symptoms because they misunderstood his involuntary movements and thought he was resisting arrest. There is also a HD Parity Act that should be passed because people with HD need special protections from discrimination. Everyone in the HD community asks us to tell just one person about the disease so that the challenges faced by the community can be better understood and addressed.The Lion's Mouth Opens premiers on HBO June 1st 9pm/8c and can be found on HBOGo and HBONow."

Wisdom from Effie Gray Producer Donald Rosenfeld,"Jeryl Brunner, ContributorWriter, Parade.com columnist and author, 'My City, My New York...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-does-it-take-to-make_b_7472278.html,"Since the the 1980s, Rosenfeld has been producing great movies like Howards End, Mr. and Mrs. Bridge, Remains of the Day, Surviving Picasso, Tree of Life and Jodorowsky's Dune. And just last month, he debuted the film Effie Gray starring a stellar cast of actors.",2015-05-30,2015-05-29-1432931825-3743678-DakotaFanningandGregWise.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-29-1432931825-3743678-DakotaFanningandGregWise-thumb.jpg,"When he was just a boy, one of the first movies that really stood out for Donald Rosenfeld was the epic World War II film, Bridge on the River Kwai. ""My parents first took me to the Cinerama at age five in St. Louis where I grew up, probably because there was no babysitter available that night,"" he recalls. In fact, many images from the film continue to stay with him. And the movie's essential concepts came to represent the nature of producing films. ""You have to build this thing and yet remain conscious that you're also in the world. Because you can lose your life, (or your movie),"" Rosenfeld explains. ""You need to have a foot in the mad quixotic void of making a movie, but also be able to remain a centered human being. And I think that's often forgotten in Hollywood today.""He was also enchanted by the Robert Aldrich classic The Longest Yard which starred Burt Reynolds. ""It's set in a prison and about a football game. It showed me that you could make a movie about something impossible, which no one would ever do based on potential commerce alone,"" says Rosenfeld. Yet, somehow the film lives somewhere between total tragedy and comedy, and survives. And a magnificent movie was created breaking all the rules. If you create movies based on Instinct and passion rather than demographics and marketing concerns, you have a chance at greatness.Since the the 1980s, Rosenfeld has been producing great movies like Howards End, Mr. and Mrs. Bridge, Remains of the Day, Surviving Picasso, Tree of Life and Jodorowsky's Dune. Rosenfeld was the President of the esteemed film company Merchant Ivory Productions for more than a decade. And just last month, he debuted the film Effie Gray starring a stellar cast of actors including Dakota Fanning, Greg Wise, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters, Tom Sturridge, Derek Jacobi, Robbie Coltrane, David Suchet and Claudia Cardinale. In Emma Thompson's original screenplay, based on a true story, a teenage Effie Gray, and adult art critic John Ruskin are in a loveless unconsummated marriage during the Victorian era when divorce was not an option. ""It's a very modern story that seemed alive,"" says Rosenfeld. ""There's just so much about marriage, about discontent.""While many are intrigued about movie making, most don't really know the nuts and bolts -- what it actually takes to get a film to the screen. Rosenfeld shared the nitty gritty of what producing a film involves. Hire a great diva-free actress like Dakota Fanning to star in your film.Every day, she's grateful for all. She's like Paul Newman who I worked with on Mr. and Mrs. Bridge. They embrace the luck of their life as opposed to resting on their laurels. They're really out working. They're out trying things. She's like a great Hollywood star from the Garbo era. When making a movie, expect the unexpected and carry on.Movies are full of tremendous disasters -- natural and otherwise. On the Ballad of the Sad Café a tornado literally brought down our western town set. We had rented Willie Nelson's property and the set just disappeared! Always keep your cast and crew happy.Every day is different and kind of a performance. You are taking care of 150 to 200 people. And you have to be resilient and open to that actual day. It really is exciting. You have to keep people inspired and entertained and keep morale up. The film producer is responsible for everything.It's as if the director is the errant son and the producer is the father. The only directors I know who are kings are their own producers -- people like Steven Spielberg or Francis Ford Coppola who are also producers. A good attitude will get you far.Producers watch everything. I watch all the footage. I can tell people, we really blew it or we have to do more. In so many cases you're far off and away, so you've got to find a way to make things work and you do. Being a film producer is like being the captain of a ship.Almost every shooting day, you're the captain. But you also have to go down with the ship. i am blamed for everything. Everyone has demands and needs and often excuses, And the reality is you have to stick by the movie and be the one who's smiling. Find material that you love and feel passionate about.I loved Effie Gray. Until this point, you've never seen a Victorian movie about people like us, They're always about the kings and queens and Victoria and her lovers or young Albert.

Hastert is the longest-serving Speaker of the House but is now scorned for losing control of the House to the Democrats in the 2006 midterm elections. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fd2f1f00000002257fa9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"YORKVILLE, Ill. -- From the public library to the American Legion post, Dennis Hastert -- just ""Denny"" to residents of his hometown -- was on everyone's TV screen and everyone's lips. ""Shocked"" and ""disappointed"" were common responses to the former Republican House speaker's  indictment on federal charges he deliberately structured cash withdrawals to avoid bank reporting requirements and lied to the FBI. But then it got worse. Friday's news that Hastert reportedly withdrew the cash to pay a man $3.5 million in hush money over sexual abuse when Hastert was a teacher and wrestling coach at Yorkville High School made the allegations even harder to stomach for most residents interviewed by The Huffington Post. ""Nobody could believe it. He was the nicest guy,"" Eddie Iljazi, who owns Yorkville's Silver Dollar Restaurant, said Friday. Iljazi's diner is a popular hangout for everyone from families to farmers -- and all were chatting about the scandal involving the town's most famous resident from the first 6 a.m. pot of coffee. Iljazi said customers had guessed Hastert's misconduct was maybe a love child, corruption or something tax-related. But as Friday wore on, and The New York Times and other news organizations reported the misconduct was sexual in nature and involved a former male student, the whispers intensified.""Everybody hopes it’s not sexual abuse, but that something got misconstrued,” Iljazi said. “To everybody here, [Hastert] was a role-model politician in their eyes. He’s the only thing the town’s got.”  Hastert coached the wrestling team at Yorkville High School for nearly two decades. Yorkville, about 50 miles southwest of Chicago, has a mostly white population of about 17,000. A major employer is the Wrigley chewing gum factory, which has announced plans to begin Skittles production. Hastert worked at the Yorkville school from 1965 to 1981. The school district released a statement on Friday, saying it had no knowledge of any misconduct.Iljazi said old-timers at the Silver Dollar chatted about Hastert’s glory days as a wrestling coach. The team had multiple district and state championships in the ‘70s under Hastert.Class of '76 graduate Bonnie Mahaney -- whose older brother wrestled under Hastert -- said “he would fill the gym.” Mahaney said she, too, was shocked by the allegations against Hastert, her study hall teacher in high school. “He was great -- he was always doing wrestling,"" said Mahaney. ""Everybody loved him.” Yorkville created an annual all-day tournament for children through the eighth grade called “The Denny Hastert Open.” At The American Legion, where Mahaney was bartending, patrons seemed to recognize everyone from Yorkville who appeared in evening news stories about Hastert. When Gary Matlock, Hastert's first state wrestling champ, flashed across the screen, Mahaney and other patrons instantly recognized him. ""Are they digging out the old stuff or what?"" Mahaney said.  A plaque of Hastert in the hallway of the Kendall County Forest Preserve office. A resident who didn’t want her name used was one of the few with an unfavorable memory of Hastert, claiming he used to “ogle” cheerleaders in his social studies class. But most Yorkville residents spoke of Hastert fondly -- even reverently -- and seemed to want to protect his reputation. To them, Denny Hastert was a familiar fixture at the grocery store and in local parades. His face is emblazoned on a plaque in the hallway of the Kendall County Park District's office -- a historic building Hastert helped preserve. They called Hastert an accessible “Regular Joe.” “When he was speaker of the House, he’d ditch his security and go around town,” resident Robert E. Lee told HuffPost.   A 1960s-era photo of Hastert in his early years as a popular Yorkville teacher. Many said they don’t believe the sexual misconduct, suspicious of allegations surfacing so long after they supposedly occurred.   “If it were actually true, it would have come out a long time ago,"" resident Kathy Tucek said. ""It was a very small town -- I don’t think it was something that could be kept under wraps.” Jim Richter said he was slightly less surprised at the indictment than some of his neighbors. “He had been pinched for other money things,” Richter said. “I say investigate every one of them. There are things the public doesn’t know.”Among those things is the identity of the person who allegedly received Hastert's hush money.

This is one of the findings from a recent survey conducted by Zogby Research Services (ZRS) for Oliver Wyman, a global business management consulting firm. The ZRS/Oliver Wyman collaboration began in the midst of the 2008-2009 worldwide economic meltdown in an effort to see to what extent the downturn had shaken business confidence, and how executives felt their respective governments had performed in response to the crisis. During the past six years, we have continued to conduct semi-annual surveys of business leaders in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait in an effort to measure business confidence, identify trends and pinpoint economic reform priorities and the concerns of the business decision makers across the region.  The four countries covered in these studies have a combined Gross Domestic Product of $1.5 trillion -- placing them right after Canada and ahead of Australia and South Korea. Even with the decline in oil prices, their economies have remained strong. Governments have tapped into their substantial reserves in order to continue ambitious domestic projects that include developing infrastructure and creating jobs to absorb their growing populations. The success of the economies of these countries is not only important for their own people, but for the millions of expatriates who work there, sometimes under difficult circumstances, and who annually send $50 billion to their home countries -- making this region the largest source of remittances in the world.   They face challenges and problems, to be sure, and in earlier surveys we examined areas that required reform, focusing on topics such as: the need for skilled labor, changes in the educational system, problems encountered in implementing programs to meet hiring quotas for nationals, labor reform and difficulties in securing start-up capital for small and medium enterprises. In our first survey of 2015, we focused on how executives currently assess business conditions and prospects in the region's volatile environment.   Given the multiple challenges and crises facing the region, it is quite remarkable that an overwhelming majority of the business leaders who were surveyed said that current business conditions in their country had improved over the past year. Executives in the UAE and Kuwait were especially bullish, with 93 percent responding in the affirmative. The high level of confidence in the UAE is noteworthy since it marks the sixth year in a row where confidence levels have risen in that country. Back in 2009, only 15 percent reported that business conditions were improving. In 2010, the percentage jumped to the mid-40 percent range. In succeeding years, the levels continued to rise to where they are today.  There was also good news from the Saudi and Qatari business communities. In both countries, we had witnessed a steady decline in confidence from near 80 percent in early 2012 to 55 percent at the end of 2014. This year, however, the confidence of business leaders in Saudi Arabia rose to 79 percent, while in Qatar it was 89 percent.  Looking forward, three-quarters of the executives surveyed project that business conditions will improve even further in the next two years. Where do they see investment opportunities for growth? It appears that for the region's business leaders, the most promising arenas are in developing countries, continuing a trend we have been observing of the region's investment focus shifting from the West to the East. There are some noteworthy exceptions, with Saudis still seeing their major opportunities in the West, while business leaders in the UAE find their best prospects for growth in projects at home.   What do they perceive as the biggest threats to business conditions? Not surprisingly, more than one-half of executives in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and even those in Kuwait, point to ""internal changes in leadership"". In the UAE, on the other hand, recalling the impact of the worldwide economic recession in 2008-2009, two-thirds of executives in that country expressed concern with the dangers posed by an ""outside macro-economic shock"". Interestingly, there was only scant mention of declining oil prices, terrorism and internal tensions.  Overall, about one in seven executives did point to the broader region's military conflicts as a problem that could pose a threat to business conditions. In this context, we asked the business leaders for their assessment of the value of the GCC acting as a unit. While there was across-the-board support for the GCC, it was mostly tepid support. The only country where we found strong support was in the UAE, where two-thirds strongly agreed that there was value in the Gulf countries operating as a unit. In the other three countries, only one-in-seven gave the GCC strong support, with another three-quarters saying they only somewhat agreed that the GCC had value in addressing regional challenges.   When asked about the impact that the opening of the Iranian economy might have on the GCC region, the executives took a rather pragmatic view of this possible outcome of the P5+1 negotiations with the Islamic Republic. Overall, a substantial majority saw it as a positive development, with only one-in-ten seeing it as negative (another 15 percent were ""unsure"").  Three-quarters of those surveyed said they looked forward to Iranian investment in the region, while two-thirds said they would welcome the prospect of being able to invest in the Iranian economy. Of those who felt that the opening of Iran to the region would be negative, equal numbers expressed concern that this development would increase political instability or contribute to further lowering of oil prices.  There were interesting differences among the respondents from the four countries. UAE and Qatari executives said that the main benefit of opening Iranian economy to the region would lay in their ability to invest in the country, while Saudi and Kuwaiti executives regarded Iranian investment in the region as the main benefit.  In the end, these ZRS/Oliver Wyman findings reveal a GCC business leadership that is able to be confident and resilient in the face of multiple regional crises while, at the same time, demonstrating the capacity to be pragmatic and creative in finding solutions to vexing problems and seeking out new opportunities to grow.

Islamic State announced the explosion in a statement on social media and supporters posted pictures of huge clouds of grey smoke above the sprawling complex in the city, also known as Tadmur.Syrian state media did not mention the explosion.The prison is not located among the city's ancient ruins, which Syrian officials have warned could be destroyed by the al Qaeda offshoot.But Islamic State fighters, who captured the city from government forces earlier this month, are not reported to have harmed its 2,000-year-old monuments and the prison explosion is the first report of major destruction since the takeover.The Observatory said this week Islamic State had however shot to death around 20 men in the city's ancient amphitheater, accusing them of being pro-government.It was not immediately clear when the prisoners had left their cells.

Her whole life distilled into a pile of odds and ends: pictures of family, old papers from school, an iron-on patch of a woman with a rainbow flag flying. Yankees memorabilia, an Obama sticker, a political flier: ""Demand housing for the homeless."" A program for a community play she'd been cast in, and on the cover, a picture of her as a sad clown holding an American flag. And photos of herself: a grainy selfie she took in her bedroom wearing a gray tank top and gold chain, with close cut gray hair and reading glasses. Another where she's a little thinner, in a white baseball cap and gray hoodie, eyebrows raised and mouth slightly open as if she's about to say something.On May 6 of last year, Caquias — who everyone knew as Jackie — was incarcerated at Rikers on a years-old warrant for having missed drug court dates. She was a tough lady at 61, according to the defense lawyer in her criminal case. But she had a history of liver disease, including a bout of Hep C, and in her 20s and 30s had been addicted to heroin, which can also cause liver damage. Jackie had done time before on drug-related charges — but that was long ago. ""She was very frightened of spending time in jail after all that time out,"" her former lawyer Ilissa Brownstein says.On Jackie's second day at the Rose M. Singer Center, the island's only women's facility, the medical clinic ran lab tests that showed Jackie's liver was severely stressed. Blood work two weeks later showed the same. Yet the doctors at Rikers didn't send Jackie to a gastroenterologist for a liver exam. Instead, they prescribed her Tylenol 3 and iron, both dangerous for people with liver problems. The Tylenol 3 was discontinued after a week, but even after medical staff ordered the iron be stopped, the pharmacy continued dispensing it. Less than a month after Jackie arrived at Rose M. Singer, her system began to fail. She grew disoriented and delusional, and began vomiting so severely that blood and bodily tissue came up — all signs of acute liver failure. On June 25, 2014, after spending weeks in Elmhurst Hospital comatose and hooked up to machines, Jackie died. This according to a proposed amended notice of claim for a lawsuit to be filed this summer by her sister Daria Widing, and an analysis of health records by the medical expert hired for the case. The lawsuit, which will seek $20 million in damages, will charge that negligence by the City of New York contributed to Jackie's death.New York City's chief medical examiner listed Jackie's cause of death as ""complications of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage complicating hepatic cirrhosis due to Hepatitis C due to chronic substance abuse,"" according to the medical expert. The New York State Commission of Correction, which conducts inmate mortality reviews, determined that Jackie's cause of death was natural, and the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), in charge of overseeing Rikers medical care, reviewed Jackie's case and closed it shortly after her death.Both DOHMH and Corizon, the private company that runs medical services at Rikers, say that privacy law prohibits them from commenting on the medical care of individuals. Corizon says it is ""deeply saddened by any death.""I asked several former Rose M. Singer inmates if they had known Jackie. When I asked Namala Conteh, there was silence on the line. Then the memory filtered back: ""Oh my god, the one that passed away? Oh my — you just reopened my wound again. The crazy thing is — I — I — mmmmmm, fuck. It's crazy. That — Oh my god.""Conteh was there at the clinic when Jackie was finally taken in. ""They were so neglectful,"" she says of the staff. ""They had that blood all over their hands.""Jackie's death appears to fit a pattern; a series of health care-related deaths alongside the never-ending reports of brutality in the Rikers men's jails has dominated headlines in recent months. Last year, theAP reported that poor medical care at Rikers had helped precipitate at least 15 inmate deaths over the past five years. After medical staff failed to treat a 59-year-old inmate for constipation, he died of complications from an infected bowel. Another man went into a diabetic coma and died within two days of being incarcerated. According to a complaint filed by his family, a 19-year-old boy who complained of chest pain for seven months was never given an X-ray and died in 2013 from a tear in his aorta. The New York Timesrecently detailed another death, that of Bradley Ballard, an inmate with schizophrenia and diabetes who died after being locked in his cell for six days without medication or running water.But ""women prisoners often get overlooked,"" says Amy Fettig, a senior counsel at the ACLU's National Prison Project. The island's women's jail, known as Rosie, is home to about 600 of the 11,000 inmates at Rikers. ""In some facilities you might not see beat-ups, but you'll see the violence of not receiving appropriate health care,"" she says. Medical records, inmate complaint data, and interviews with current and former inmates bear this out.Pharmaceutical errors like the ones that may have contributed to Jackie's death aren't uncommon at Rosie. Between July of last year and April 2015, the Legal Aid Society — the largest provider of legal services to the city's poor — received complaints from 17 Rosie inmates who said their prescriptions had gone unfilled or their meds were discontinued for no apparent reason. Two Rosie inmates The Intercept spoke with told of recent instances in which they received the wrong medication or the wrong dosage.Take Kim Midyett. Last September, the 41-year-old went down to the clinic because she was feeling sweaty and shaky. According to medical records, her blood sugar had plummeted. Midyett told a doctor that earlier that morning, a nurse had injected her with 12 units of insulin instead of the prescribed six. That's not a trivial error, says Dr. Josiah Rich, a prison health care expert at Brown University. ""The wrong dose of insulin can kill you.""Or Virdie Emmanuel, who landed on Rikers in January 2014. She has dark circles under her eyes, a sweet smile and a grand larceny conviction. Emmanuel's health problems began at age 10, when her appendix ruptured. By 20, she had Crohn's disease and says she ""basically lived at Mount Sinai [Hospital] for weeks at a time."" The diseases and disorders kept piling up. Now, on top of Crohn's, the 41-year-old has rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, fibromyalgia, morbid obesity, anemia, asthma, PTSD, anxiety and depression, according to medical records. By 2013, Emmanuel says she was buried in hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of medical bills. She was arrested for — and pleaded guilty to — charging $1.3 million worth of personal expenses to her employer's account. Emmanuel says it was to pay off her medical debt.Once in jail, her health began to deteriorate further. Emmanuel takes about a dozen pills a day to manage her conditions. Last winter, her prescription for Lyrica, a fibromyalgia drug, was allowed to lapse, causing her severe muscle pain and numbness. And she submitted complaints about receiving the wrong meds several times over the past year. In January, medical director Lisa Choleff admitted in a response to a complaint form Emmanuel had submitted that she had ""received the wrong medication for several months, then when it was caught, medical did not prescribe it to her, yet pharmacy had been dispensing it to her.""After an inmate death in 2010, the New York State Commission of Correction ordered Corizon, which is the largest private correctional health care provider in the country, to evaluate why patients' medications were often discontinued after admission. And in 2011, after another death, the commission demanded the company fix problems with its dispensation of psychotropic meds and review its pharmacists' professional qualifications.Corizon says its employees ""work hard to provide our patients with appropriate care — including providing all treatment and medication that is clinically indicated."" And yet the company — which services 345,000 inmates in 531 jails, prisons and detention facilities around the country and brings in about $1.5 billion a year — has built itself a reputation for cutting costs and putting patients' lives at risk. Corizon was reportedly sued 660 times for malpractice between 2008 and 2013, and has been implicated in class action lawsuits filed by the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center. The company says its ""patient population is highly litigious,"" and that ""existence of a suit is not necessarily indicative of quality of care or any wrongdoing.""New York City attempted to prevent the company from cutting corners when it hired Corizon's corporate predecessor, Prison Health Services, in 2000. The city's cost-plus contract with the company keeps Corizon from skimping on lab tests or specialty care or prescriptions in order to jack up profits. And DOHMH provides heavy oversight of health care on the island.But inmate medical care involves treating high volumes of very sick people in a grim and often dangerous setting, and attracting good staff can be hardfor any jail health care operation. Since last fall, two Corizon staffers at Rikers have been arrested for smuggling contraband into the jail. In July 2010, a Rikers doctor was arrested for sexually abusing a female inmate. That same month, another doctor resigned over questions about the validity of his certification to provide medical care to inmates. And in 2000, before Corizon hired her, medical director Lisa Choleff had her license restricted for several years on a rare disciplinary action over charges of ""gross negligence, gross incompetence and negligence, and incompetence on more than one occasion."" She notes in her public profile at the New York State Department of Health that the disciplinary action ""has now been resolved."" She did not immediately respond to a request for comment.DOHMH notes that it conducts regular credentialing reviews of physicians and PAs. Corizon says its staff ""have taken the same Hippocratic and nursing oaths … as those in hospitals and medical facilities across the country.""The company emphasizes: ""We consider it our mission to care for our patients as we would our own family … and to deliver the very best treatment."" But at a recent city council hearing, Corizon's chief medical officer, Dr. Calvin Johnson, was at a loss when a council member asked what specific reforms the company had recommended to improve care at Rikers in the wake of the recent string of deaths. Despite rephrasing the question six times, the council member never got a direct answer.To get to Rikers, you have to wind your way to the top of Queens and then cross a long low bridge over Flushing Bay, which circles the island to the south. As Jackie crossed the bridge, she probably saw planes lifting off from LaGuardia for another coast or country — rising over the wide bay, then over the mouth of the East River to the north of the island. She might have seen a diagonal of seagulls in the sky. She might have smelled the smell of the raw sewage overflow that empties into the bay after a rain before she headed toward the compound's concentric fences and swirls of razor wire.Jackie was arrested in Harlem last year while talking on the phone with her sister Daria Widing, waiting for a downtown bus. After a 2009 arrest for selling heroin, a judge had ordered Jackie to go to drug court, which required her to be free from painkillers. She was facing intense pain from an injured knee and back, and according to her former defense attorney, eventually decided to go back on her pain meds. A few months in, she started missing court dates and a warrant was issued. In May 2014, the police picked her up and Jackie was sentenced to jail.Eighty-four percent of women incarcerated nationwide are locked up for a nonviolent crimes. Most are poor. A disproportionate number are black or Hispanic.Jackie grew up in the Washington Projects in Spanish Harlem in a big Catholic family. She was a teenager in the 1960s, a 20-something in the 1970s, and she was gay when being gay was fringe. So she fell in where she belonged. She was a hippie and did hippie things. She traveled the country. She used drugs. She did time here and there, usually on drug-related charges. ""She visited a great many states through their penal systems,"" Widing laughs.And she became an activist. Jackie joined the Young Lords, a Puerto Rican nationalist group that worked on police brutality, education, health care and tenants' rights. In the late'70s, she and some friends launched a crisis intervention service for teens called HOTLINE Cares.She was a heroin addict for a long time, but she was a ""functioning addict,"" Widing says. Jackie always managed to find odd jobs, working in social services, as a bike messenger, even as a production assistant. She did seasonal work on electoral campaigns for years. And she never let go of her causes. She fought for affordable housing, school study centers and drug rehab programs in her neighborhood. HOTLINE Cares ran for over 30 years and has been held up by the Justice Department as a model teen drug prevention program.""I'm a stand-up bitch,"" she was known to say.It was the same with her friends and family and lovers. When a girlfriend wanted a Bowflex, Jackie bought it for her. If a friend's baby needed a crib, Jackie would get it. She took on her older sister's car payment for years. ""She had a studio, like, my closet might be bigger, but everybody was welcome,"" Widing says.Jackie was only at Rosie for a few weeks, but she made tight friends fast. ""I really had a issue with people's sexuality,"" Conteh says. ""I was like, Jack, leave me alone. But then we kinda just became friends. That's why I was likeughhhh when I heard that she passed. It was, like, really bad.""Toward the end of May 2014, Conteh and several other inmates at Rosie noticed that Jackie had stopped eating and kept nodding off. As the days passed she became disoriented and then delusional, attempting to lie down in other inmates' beds and mistaking a pantry for the bathroom. ""A couple of days she wasn't eating, and then she started throwing up,"" says Diana Mack, an inmate in Jackie's unit. ""But she didn't have nothing in her stomach to throw up, so the bile came up, and then the blood came."" By June 1, according to the notice of claim, Jackie was throwing up blood and bodily tissue.A guard immediately alerted the clinic, and two medical personnel arrived with a stretcher. But when an incoherent Jackie wouldn't get on, the staffers left, according to the notice. They said she was refusing medical attention, despite her cellmates' insistence that she was no longer capable of making rational decisions. Eventually, Tiffany James, known as Buddha — who had bonded with Jackie over their shared birthday — dressed Jackie and carried her down to the clinic with another inmate. When they arrived, a doctor took a look at Jackie and said, ""You call this a medical emergency?""""That's people just not giving a shit,"" Widing says.Forty-five minutes later, EMS finally picked Jackie up and transported her to the ER. The Rikers clinic had told 911 operators that Jackie needed to be picked up because she was ""emotionally disturbed"" — not because she was having a medical emergency, according to the medical expert hired for the case. When she arrived at Elmhurst, lab tests confirmed she was in acute liver failure.Corizon says that ""in the case of an emergency, we call 911 immediately.""New York City's Department of Corrections has recently come under intense scrutiny over correction officers' brutality toward inmates, but what the Justice Department has called a ""deep-seated culture of violence"" is also undercutting inmate health care. A March 2015 study by DOHMH officials found that medical staff throughout the New York City jail system often made decisions based on security priorities. Patients interviewed said they saw no separation between medical and correctional staff. ""There is not DOC and medical,"" Conteh agrees. ""It's medical-DOC.""Legal Aid — which does not investigate each grievance — has received numerous inmate complaints of medical staff at Rikers dismissing patient complaints as malingering. A male inmate told the organization in January that after he fell and injured himself, a Corizon doctor told him to ""Get the fuck up,"" and ""There's nothing the fuck wrong with you.""Legal Aid often receives complaints about Rikers correction officers blocking access to the clinic, and yet according to city council hearing testimony by Legal Aid's John Boston, Corizon management has not set up a system to protect prisoners' right to timely access to daily sick call.Last summer, Alejandra Rodriguez, a former Rosie inmate with thick glasses and a faint lisp, says she slipped on a piece of soap in the shower and hit her head on the floor. Rodriguez, who went by Fat Baby, says she told the captain in her housing unit that she felt like she was going to throw up and needed medical attention. ""The captain said that if I were in the street I would not ask to be going to a clinic, and she left,"" Rodriguez wrote to me last year. (DOC says that ""every complaint of denial of access is investigated and remediated if necessary."")The next day, guards permitted her to go to the clinic. But she wasn't diagnosed with a concussion for another six days, according to her medical records, at which point she was deemed ""neurologically unstable.""On September 9, 1971, a thousand prisoners at the Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York rioted and seized control of the prison in what became the bloodiest prison uprising in U.S. history. The riot stemmed from prisoners' demands for decent living conditions, an end to brutality and better medical care. The Attica rebellion helped prompt a slew of prisoner lawsuits that culminated in a landmark 1976 United States Supreme Court ruling. Because inmates are not able to seek out medical care themselves, the court said, the failure to provide them with proper health care constitutes a violation of the 8th Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.Most inmates at Rikers are awaiting trial. Many others are in on short stays for minor crimes. That someone jailed so briefly would suffer unconstitutional medical care is all the more jarring. Conteh, for example, was arrested in October 2013 for criminal possession of stolen property. The 32-year-old says it was because she was waiting in the car for her friends who were robbing a clothing shop. When she was released last June, she says she ""literally crawled"" out of Rosie and spent months bedridden, undergoing physical therapy because of complications from neglectful treatment of a broken ankle sustained after an assault by a correction officer.The incident took place in February 2014, when a fight broke out between an inmate and a guard just outside Conteh's cell. When Conteh tried to pull the inmate away from the officer, another guard threw Conteh to the floor, lifted her up and slammed her back down again, according to a lawsuit Conteh filed against the city. (The city has denied all of her claims.) The following day, an X-ray showed she'd fractured her left distal tibia and fibula, but she waited three weeks to get a plaster cast put on at Elmhurst, which is run by the city. (She missed one appointment, 10 days after the ankle fractures, because of a court date.) It took two tries for doctors to fit the cast properly, and the break healed poorly, leaving painful scar tissue in her ankle and requiring her to undergo surgery after her release.This past January, Emmanuel also fractured her left foot, and never received a splint or a boot. Instead, she got a wheelchair that was too small for her body, according to a complaint submitted by Legal Aid. X-rays in February and April showed the fracture was not healing. (Corizon says ""this patient was referred to the appropriate specialists in a timely manner and has received appropriate care."") Legal Aid has received at least three complaints from Rikers inmates in the past year along the lines of, ""I think I have something broken but it's not casted,"" or, ""I can't get a splint."" A DOHMH spokesperson says that patients with urgent needs get immediate emergency care.Legal Aid also gets frequent complaints from inmates about delays in getting specialty care at Elmhurst and Bellevue, the two hospitals that service Rikers. In July 2014, a Rosie inmate who asked to remain anonymous was arrested on charges of prostitution and failure to show up at court. At the time of her incarceration, the 32-year-old was pregnant and had a large and painful ovarian cyst pressing into the left side of her abdomen. She ended up waiting four months for an appointment at Elmhurst to have it removed. Meanwhile, she miscarried. ""I woke up in my dorm in a pool of blood,"" she says. Though the cyst was benign, ""it sounds like that was a significant delay,"" says Dr. Scott Allen, a prison health care expert at the University of California Riverside, who did not view medical records but was briefed on summaries of inmate cases.In February 2014, shortly after her arrest on a drug possession charge, Diana Mack, 54, had a chest X-ray that revealed an unidentifiable mass in her right lung. Mack had to wait three months to get a CT scan at Elmhurst, and says she never received the results before she was released four months later in September. Mack only found out that the scan of her lung was inconclusive after the Intercept requested the results from Elmhurst. ""Why they didn't see to it that I got that information?"" she wondered.One reason for the delays in getting care at Elmhurst, a city official says, is that the hospital has too little space and staff to meet Rosie's needs. And inmates often complain to Legal Aid that DOC, which is responsible for transporting inmates to their outside appointments, brings patients to their specialty clinic appointments too late, or not at all. Corizon says its ""process is consistent with how you might schedule a specialty appointment in almost any health care setting."" The company adds, ""The wait time depends on that specialist's schedule and patients are provided with the care they require as soon as medically possible.""Several doctors the Intercept asked to weigh in on summaries of inmate cases contend that patients at public hospitals across the country face the same issues of access and delays. But that may be a false equivalence, Allen says: ""They don't have the liberty to seek alternative care themselves, do they?""Changes could be coming soon to Rikers. In 2013, the city downgradedCorizon's performance rating from ""good"" to ""fair."" After the death of Bradley Ballard, a state review recommended against renewal of Corizon's contract, which expires at the end of the year. And city council members are pushing the mayor's office to turn inmate health care over to the city's public Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs city hospitals like Elmhurst and Bellevue.The reason New York City has kept Corizon around for so long despite the company's many failings is that no one else has wanted to take over the contract. When the city put out a proposal request in 2000, Corizon's corporate predecessor was the only entity with the proper capacity to bid. Since then, according to two former city officials familiar with the bidding process, no other provider with the infrastructure to handle such a huge system has expressed any interest in taking over care of inmates on Rikers Island.Widing found out that Jackie had been taken to the ER when she happened to call Rikers to ask for the address to send her sister a letter. The operator told her Jackie had been taken to Elmhurst. When Widing called the hospital and asked to speak to her sister, the doctor told her that wouldn't be possible. ""She's in a coma,"" she recalls him saying.Widing wasn't there on Jackie's last day — she lives in Florida and was scheduled to visit her sister the following week. Another sister Anna had come by, and Jackie's niece, and her Aunt Judith, who arranged her bedding and recited a prayer and rubbed her feet.Jackie coded two or three times on the morning of June 25 — the digital line of her heartbeat falling flat on the monitor. She kept bleeding and bleeding and her organs began to fail. Widing asked the doctor what Jackie's life would be like if they kept her alive. He said she'd been without oxygen to her brain for too long and her body was shutting down. ""At this point we're breathing for her,"" he said. So Jackie's family agreed to disconnect all the machines and let her go, Widing says. ""That was around 9:40 that morning. By 2:45 she was gone."""

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14e412400003600382c91.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"GENEVA (AP) -- A month out from a nuclear deal deadline, the top U.S. and Iranian diplomats gathered in Geneva Saturday in an effort to bridge differences over how quickly to ease economic sanctions on Tehran and how significantly the Iranians must open up military facilities to international inspections.The talks between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif were likely to extend into Sunday, a negotiating round that officials described as the most substantive since world powers and Iran clinched a framework pact in April.That agreement, however, left big questions unanswered, which weeks of subsequent technical discussions have done little to resolve.Asked about completing the full accord by June 30, Zarif said Saturday, ""We will try.""World powers believe they have secured Iran's acquiescence to a combination of nuclear restrictions that would fulfill their biggest goal: keeping Iran at least a year away from bomb-making capability for at least a decade. But they are less clear about how they'll ensure Iran fully adheres to any agreement.Various Iranian officials, including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, have publicly vowed to limit access to or even block monitors from sensitive military sites and nuclear scientists suspected of previous involvement in covert nuclear weapons efforts.The U.S. says such access must be guaranteed or there will be no final deal. A report Friday by the U.N. nuclear agency declared work essentially stalled on its multiyear probe of Iran's past activities.The Iranians aren't fully satisfied, either.The unresolved issues include the pace at which the United States and other countries will provide Iran relief from international sanctions - Tehran's biggest demand - and how to ""snap back"" punitive measures into place if the Iranians are caught cheating.President Barack Obama has used the ""snapback"" mechanism as a main defense of the proposed pact from sharp criticism from Congress and some American allies.And exactly how rapidly the sanctions on Iran's financial, oil and commercial sectors would come off in the first place lingers as a sore point between Washington and Tehran.Speaking ahead of Kerry's talks with Zarif, senior State Department officials described Iranian transparency and access, and questions about sanctions, as the toughest matters remaining.They cited ""difficult weeks"" since the April 2 framework reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, but said diplomats and technical experts are getting back on a ""smooth path.""None of the officials were authorized to be quoted by name and they demanded anonymity.Iran insists it is solely interested in peaceful energy, medical and research purposes, though many governments around the world suspect it of harboring nuclear weapons ambitions. The U.S. estimates the Iranians are currently less than three months away from assembling enough nuclear material for a bomb if they chose to covertly develop one.Joining Kerry and Zarif in Switzerland was U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. American nuclear negotiator Wendy Sherman and her Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi attended, too. European Union negotiator Helga Schmid sat in as well."

""It is unclear how much farther China will go.""He said the United States was ""deeply concerned"" about the scale of China's land reclamation and the prospect of further militarization of the islands, saying it would boost ""the risk of miscalculation or conflict.""A Chinese delegate at the forum initially gave a measured response, in which he said Carter's comments were not as hostile as those made at the Shangri-La Dialog in previous years, but the foreign ministry reacted strongly.""The United States disregards history, legal principles and the facts,"" spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. ""China's sovereignty and relevant rights were established a long time ago in the South China Sea.China's island-building is ""legal, reasonable, conforms to the situation and neither impacts nor targets any country.""Despite the rhetoric, Carter said there was no military solution to the South China Sea disputes.

""Turning an underwater rock into an airfield simply does not afford the rights of sovereignty or permit restrictions on international air or maritime transit.""Japan's defense minister said China and other parties in the dispute had to behave responsibly.""If we leave any unlawful situation unattended, order will soon turn to disorder, and peace and stability will collapse,"" Gen Nakatani told the forum. ""I hope and expect all the countries, including China, to behave as a responsible power,"" he said.Malaysia's defense minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, urged all parties in the South China Sea dispute to exercise restraint or face potentially dangerous consequences.""This has the potential to escalate into one of the deadliest conflicts of our time, if not history,"" he said.

Moscow denies Western accusations that it is supporting fighters with arms and troops.A spokeswoman for EU foreign affairs said that in recent months Russia had denied entry to a number of EU politicians, based on their inclusion on the previously confidential ""stop list.""""We consider this measure as totally arbitrary and unjustified, especially in the absence of any further clarification and transparency,"" she said.Asked about the list while on a visit to Ukraine, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said it would hamper peace efforts.""At a time in which we are trying to defuse a persistent and dangerous conflict, this does not contribute towards that,"" Steinmeier said.A spokeswoman for Britain's Foreign Office said there was no justification for the travel ban.""If Russia's intention is to put pressure on the EU to ease sanctions then this is not the way to do it,"" she said.The Russian Foreign Ministry was not immediately available for comment.BLACKLISTEDAmong those on the list is Uwe Corsepius, current secretary general of the European Union council in Brussels, who is due to take over as foreign affairs advisor to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Six other Germans were blacklisted.The document also includes Bruno Le Roux, the leader of President Francois Hollande's Socialists in parliament, Britain's former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and former Belgian premier Guy Verhofstadt, who heads the Liberal group in the European parliament.A French diplomatic source said French authorities had not officially been notified of the list.Poland, which has been the sternest EU critic of Russia's policy towards Ukraine, had 18 names on the list, including Bogdan Borusewicz, head of the Polish senate, who was denied entry for the funeral of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov.""For some time we've seen that Russia is not necessarily trying to mitigate tensions but rather strengthen them,"" a spokeswoman for Poland's government told Reuters.Anna Maria Corraza Bildt, a member of the European parliament and wife of former Swedish premier Carl Bildt, was also mentioned, along with seven other Swedes.""I see that the Kremlin has found out who is calling the shots in our home,"" Carl Bildt said on his Twitter account.Last Monday, Germany protested to Russia over its refusal to let a conservative German lawmaker, Karl-Georg Wellmann, who had called Russia a ""warmonger"" earlier this year, into the country.Other countries with names on the list include Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Denmark, Finland, Czech Republic, Romania, Bulgaria and Spain.

Brian Sandoval (R) to raise taxes to better fund public education in the state. In the same poll, 81.8 percent of Democrats in the district said they supported the plan, as did 73.4 percent of independents.But respondents in the survey became much more supportive when they were told that the plan would only increase business licensing fees, and that it would be applied to corporations, not individuals. They expressed even more support when they were told the funds would be used to ""reduce class size, expand reading programs and increase high school graduation rates."" Given those details, respondents were asked again whether they agreed with Sandoval or with anti-tax advocates who oppose all tax hikes. This time, 63.6 of Republican respondents said that they agreed with the governor, as did 90.1 percent of Democrats and 81.7 percent of independents.Just 16.4 percent of Republicans in the second poll said they agreed with the anti-tax advocates who opposed all tax hikes.The moral of the story here seems to be: It matters a lot how poll questions are phrased. So the next time someone quotes public opinion stats at you, make sure you know where those numbers came from in the first place."

37,BLACK VOICES,"On the ""A"" w/Souleo: Rain Pryor Has Her (Own) Story To Tell","Peter 'Souleo' Wright, ContributorJournalist and curator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/on-the-a-wsouleo-rain-pryor_b_7474696.html,,2015-05-30,2015-05-30-1433021095-6242431-CarlRedding_courtesyofRedding_2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-30-1433021095-6242431-CarlRedding_courtesyofRedding_2-thumb.jpg,"Rain Pryor is used to being introduced as the ""daughter of Richard Pryor."" But nearly ten years after the legendary comedian's death, Rain shares that she no longer feels heavily conflicted by the mention of her father. With a revamped take of her one-woman show Fried Chicken & Latkes she has finally come into her own.  ""For a time I felt like I was only Richard Pryor's daughter. People just wanted me to be like him,"" she said. I feel like I am me and I am part of him and vice versa. Now he is part of my life. He is like my shadow walking behind me along with the other ancestors. I am living my life, truth, story and destiny. And that's what he wanted me to do.To improve the telling of her story of growing up as biracial and Jewish, Rain collaborated with Broadway director Kamilah Forbes (A Raisin in the Sun, The Mountaintop). In what is being billed as a world premiere at the National Black Theatre (NBT), Rain and Forbes have cut and expanded parts of the show's script, added additional musical and production elements. In the show, Rain portrays 11 characters that informed her views on race, identity and religion.  ""I hope people walk away from this incarnation of with that sense of us as black people needing to figure out our purpose and make changes in the world. My daughter might grow up in a little bit better of a world but we still have so much we need to do,"" she said. ""We have to face our own spiritual corruption. We go to churches and they preach prosperity gospel. But where is the focus on the community and us as a people?""  The show runs at NBT from June 2 through June 28.  Chef Carl Redding plans a comeback to Harlem's culinary scene  In speaking with chef and proprietor, Carl Redding it becomes apparent that part of him wishes he had never left Harlem. When he opened Amy Ruth's in 1999 it quickly became and remains a popular eatery. But tax debt forced him to sell the property and venture outside of Harlem with two failed restaurants including Ruthie Mae's in Englewood, NJ and Redding's in Atlantic City, NJ. Now the Harlem-born and raised chef wants another taste of what the neighborhood has to offer.  ""The lesson I learned was to stay home and not venture out to people that won't welcome you to their community and don't welcome change,"" he said. I am loved and welcomed in my own community in Harlem. Amy Ruth's is a testament of the work I put into the restaurant business. People know me from that restaurant because I was one of the pioneers who put a new restaurant in the community at that time.  With a plan to open in late spring 2016, Redding envisions his restaurant as a 250-seat venue destination serving American comfort cuisine. In addition, he plans to use the restaurant as a training ground for young adults to learn cooking and business skills.  Redding is hoping that the Harlem community welcomes his return with not only open arms, but open pockets too. Hence he's taken to crowdfunding site, GoFundMe to raise $200,000 of the $2 million he estimates it will cost to establish a new restaurant. As of publication, the one-month old campaign has raised less than one percent of its goal. But Redding is undeterred by that or the competition that awaits him in Harlem, from Marcus Samuelsson's Red Rooster and Streetbird Rotisserie to Alexander Smalls' The Cecil and Minton's Playhouse.  ""I remember when there was nothing but burnt down buildings, garbage and high crime all about. Harlem was a town of blight,"" he recalled. So I am happy for what's going on in Harlem. We have good restaurants that bring a special flavor. But I am an innovator and will bring a restaurant Harlem has not seen in the last 50 years or more. Food is my life and my business.***The weekly column, On the ""A"" w/Souleo, covers the intersection of the arts, culture entertainment and philanthropy in Harlem and beyond and is written by Souleo, founder and president of event/media content production company Souleo Enterprises LLC."
