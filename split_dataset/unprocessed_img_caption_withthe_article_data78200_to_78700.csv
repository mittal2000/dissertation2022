1,POLITICS,Democrats Want To Make Labor Organizing Akin To A Civil Right,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-labor-civil-rights_us_55f98fb7e4b0e333e54c14ae,"A proposal in Congress, backed by labor unions, would make it much riskier for employers to illegally retaliate against pro-union workers.",2015-09-16,"Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), pictured, and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), ranking members of the Senate and House committees overseeing labor relations, introduced legislation that would strengthen worker protections. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f9913c1c000025000823b5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- If you get fired for trying to organize a union in the U.S., federal labor law does a pretty weak job of protecting you. Even if your employer is found to have broken the law, the most you can win under the current system is back pay and reinstatement -- that is, the right to go back to work under a boss who already illegally retaliated against you.Labor unions have sought for years to strengthen those protections, and on Wednesday Democrats in Washington took up the latest version of the cause. Lawmakers proposed a bill, crafted with the input of the AFL-CIO union federation, that would make workplace organizing akin to a civil right.The bill, called the Workplace Action for a Growing Economy (WAGE) Act, would do so by amending the National Labor Relations Act, the bedrock Great Depression-era law that set the boundaries for collective bargaining. The Democratic proposal would triple the amount of back pay that workers are owed when their employers fire them for what's known as protected concerted activity. It would also give workers the right to pursue damages in federal court, just like those who've been discriminated against over their race or gender.In addition, the law would increase the use of federal injunctions to get illegally fired workers back on the job quickly. And it would establish civil penalties against companies that violate the law, and allow for officers and directors of the company to be penalized individually as well.All told, the legislation would make it far riskier for employers to retaliate against workers who are trying to organize a union or band together to improve working conditions. Due to the relatively weak recourse under current law, there's little disincentive now for employers to commit what are known as unfair labor practices. Even when back pay is awarded to a fired worker, it must be mitigated by any other pay the worker earned elsewhere since being fired.To be clear, the Democratic proposal has approximately zero chance of going anywhere while the GOP controls both the House and Senate. Republicans have been set against putting any new regulations or mandates upon businesses, and they're not about to make it easier for workers to sue their employers. Besides, they already view the National Labor Relations Board -- the agency that enforces labor law -- as being far too friendly to unions in the Obama era.Though it will surely languish, the bill will still serve as a model prescription for what Democrats and unions say are the deficiencies of the current system. The last comprehensive overhaul of labor law pushed by the AFL-CIO was the Employee Free Choice Act. That bill would have assured workers the right to form a union merely by having a majority sign authorization cards, taking away the right of employers to demand a secret-ballot election. The bill died in 2009.In a letter to colleagues this week, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), ranking members of the Senate and House committees overseeing labor relations, said the legislation introduced Wednesday was intended to strengthen worker voice and, by extension, help raise wages and grow the middle class.""While the majority of Americans support workers’ ability to come together to improve their wages and working conditions, too many employers use aggressive intimidation campaigns to keep workers from having a voice in the workplace,"" Murray and Scott wrote. ""The system is broken, and needs to be fixed.""Many of the nuts and bolts in the bill were previously laid out in a book called Why Labor Organizing Should Be a Civil Right, by Richard D. Kahlenberg and Moshe Marvit. The book argues that the growing income inequality of recent decades can be traced to the erosion of labor unions in the U.S. Giving workers more protections under federal law, the authors write, would help restore bargaining power more generally in the economy.In an email, Marvit, a labor lawyer and fellow at the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, said that the ""weak procedures and remedies"" under current law lead many employers to ""violate these rights with impunity."" If labor rights were more like civil rights, he said, workers could seek ""real remedies that can make them whole"" and dissuade bad actors from breaking the law.""I do think that the legislation is a good prescription to reverse the tide of falling union density in the U.S.,"" Marvit said. ""Studies have shown repeatedly that the majority of American workers would join a union if they could, and yet the number of private sector workers who do so remain dismally low. The reason is because of employer violations of workers' labor rights.""Union membership in the U.S. is now hovering near an all-time low. Only 6.6 percent of private-sector workers belong to labor unions, according to the most recent survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's down from a historic high of roughly 35 percent during the mid-1950s. "

3,COLLEGE,"University Of California May Outlaw Intolerance, And Experts Say It'll Violate The First Amendment",Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/university-of-california-intolerance_us_55f71809e4b063ecbfa529ec,"Free speech scholars are confused by the system's attempt to ""uphold free speech by banning free speech.""",2015-09-16,University of California President Janet Napolitano. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f9d2ef2000002600242539.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The University of California system is considering a ""statement of principles against intolerance"" that legal experts believe is likely to violate the First Amendment. A draft copy of the statement seeking to stamp out intolerance on the public college campuses, submitted by the UC president's office, will be considered Thursday at a meeting of the system's regents, which govern the universities. Experts who reviewed the proposal this week told The Huffington Post they're confused about what the statement would mean, why there is a distinction between course content and public commentary but the policy still seems to apply toward speech online, and why the universities need a new policy on this at all. ""The problem is that it's ambiguous,"" said Geoffrey Stone, a University of Chicago law professor and First Amendment scholar. ""Reading it, it's hard to figure out what they're attempting to protect and what they're attempting to restrict.""The proposal says:Intolerance has no place at the University of California. We define intolerance as unwelcome conduct motivated by discrimination against, or hatred toward, other individuals or groups. It may take the form of acts of violence or intimidation, threats, harassment, hate speech, derogatory language reflecting stereotypes or prejudice, or inflammatory or derogatory use of culturally recognized symbols of hate, prejudice, or discrimination.The statement explicitly says it ""shall not be used as the basis to discipline students, faculty, or staff,"" but warns the universities will ""respond promptly and effectively"" to any report of intolerant behavior. It also says it won't count toward ""course content, teaching methods, scholarship, or public commentary,"" nor will it infringe on a student's free expression. ""My question back to them is how can a university uphold free speech by banning free speech?"" asked Charles C. Haynes, vice president of the Newseum Institute and Religious Freedom Center. ""How is that possible to do?"" Stone said the document is ""badly written"" and could chill free speech on campus, because if there's ambiguity, a person may say, ""Well I'll be careful about what I say because I don't want to deal with all that crap."" ""I just don't know how it's going to be implemented,"" said Joan Bertin, executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship. ""Saying it can't be used for disciplinary measures doesn't mean it can't be used for punishment."" Each of the experts interviewed noted that because the University of California is public, it's considered a state actor bound by the Constitution, unlike a private school. ""You can't be held legally responsible for thinking something or saying something that other people don't like,"" Bertin said. ""That's thought control.""A spokesman for the UC president's office said the purpose of the statement is to ""provide a framework for prompt and effective responses to reports of intolerant behavior,"" but did not elaborate on what that meant. ""We're taking a very important step this week with a full discussion of principles that span the broad spectrum of our UC community of students, faculty, staff and others,"" UC system spokesman Steve Montiel said in an email Wednesday. Meanwhile, pro-Israel and Jewish groups are criticizing the proposed language in the policy for not going far enough. Last week, 27 groups representing Jewish communities sent a letter expressing ""extreme disappointment and outrage"" that the proposed policy was ""watered-down,"" ""overly broad"" and failed to specifically mention anti-Semitism. The groups want UC to acknowledge their view that ""demonization and delegitimization of Israel"" is part of modern anti-Semitism. However, the examples provided by the UC system are reflecting situations widely decried as anti-Semitic. ""Questioning a student’s fitness for a leadership role"" based on their race, religion, ethnicity or national origin would be an act of intolerance, the policy proposal says. This situation reflects an incident in February when members of the Undergraduate Students Association Council questioned whether Rachel Beyda, a Jewish candidate for the UCLA's judicial board, could be ""unbiased"" because of her religion. The policy would also target graffiti, which recalls examples of anti-Jewish markings found at UC Berkeley and UCLA's campuses. Bertin noted those are already crimes because they are vandalism. Free speech scholars said attempting to legislate what is hate speech could prove problematic.""One person's hate speech is another person's religious conviction,"" Haynes said.Haynes mentioned the possibility that a student wearing a shirt that said ""Homosexuality Is Sinful"" while quoting scriptures could be accused of hate speech. Someone might also come under scrutiny under UC's proposed policy if they displayed the Confederate flag or celebrated Black Power.""The university is not a marketplace of ideas for ideas that people don't find offensive or intolerant,"" Haynes remarked. ""Is it painful? Is it messy? Yes, but that's the United States at our best. You'd think the last place in the United States where we would try to chill speech would be where we educate people to be part of the democratic process and prepare them to be citizens.""______Tyler Kingkade is a senior editor and reporter covering higher education, and is based in New York.

4,ENTERTAINMENT,Donald Trump Vows To Fix Veterans' Care If Elected President,"ERIN MCPIKE, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-veterans_us_55f8e28ce4b0e333e54bcfe2,"""We have illegal immigrants that are treated better, by far, than our veterans. That’s not going to happen anymore.""",2015-09-16,"Trump won the endorsement of the Veterans for a Strong America, which claims more than 500,000 members.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump appealed to veterans on Tuesday by saying a Trump administration would let them go to private hospitals and see private doctors if the Department of Veterans Affairs failed to provide decent care.In a 14-minute speech that had been billed as a major national security address, the real estate mogul chose a stage with the decommissioned battleship USS Iowa as a backdrop.But he made only glancing references to Iran and did not mention the Islamic State group once. Instead, he used the venue to drive his crusade against illegal immigration and appeal to veterans, one day before the second televised debate between Republican contenders for the November 2016 election.""We have illegal immigrants that are treated better, by far, than our veterans. That’s not going to happen anymore,” he said on a stage in front of three 16-inch guns on the battleship that was commissioned during World War II. It was donated to the city of Los Angeles three years ago and has since become a museum.""We're going to create a whole new system. We're going to take this system apart,"" Trump vowed.""And if they're not doing their job, the veterans are going to go to private doctors, private hospitals. We're going to reimburse those doctors and those hospitals, and you're going to get the greatest service of any veterans in any country because you deserve it.""The Republican frontrunner has been championing veterans on the campaign trail, even challenging CNN, the host of Wednesday's debate, to donate to veterans groups the network’s profits from the steep increase in advertising rates charged during the program.Trump won the endorsement of the Veterans for a Strong America, a tax-exempt advocacy organization, which claims more than 500,000 members and that was the sponsor of Tuesday's event.Its chairman, Joel Arends, offered the group’s support, saying he thought it was time for a president with courage who would take a stand for veterans.Trump said he neither expected nor asked for the endorsement, but added: “I will say this, I am with the veterans 100 percent. They’re our greatest people. They’re being treated terribly.”As he was introduced, a group of protesters shouted complaints from outside a fence surrounding the museum's parking lot.“We have people protesting us. I think we’re doing something right here folks,” Arends said.But others attending the event, including a 60-year-old Latino pharmaceutical salesman, said he may vote for Trump because he wants the problem of illegal immigration addressed.“At what point do we try to solve this issue? Eleven million people, 22 million, 44 million? What’s the number at which the nation will deal with this?”Tickets for the event cost $100 for general admission, $250 for preferred seating and up to $1,000 for a seat in front of the podium, although veterans with valid identification were allowed in for free.Related On HuffPost:"
5,BUSINESS,"Despite Ongoing Controversies, Uber CEO Thinks The Company Could Take Over San Francisco Streets",Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/travis-kalanick-uber-dreamforce_us_55f9b649e4b0fde8b0cc932c,Travis Kalanick wants to see a day when every car in the city is an Uber.,2015-09-16,Uber founder and CEO Travis Kalanick said on Wednesday that he would one day like to see every car in San Francisco be affiliated with the company. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f9b85620000026002424f7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick envisions a future where he looks out the window of his San Francisco office and sees only Ubers on the streets.That may be a pipe dream in California, where car culture (and the status of having a Tesla in your garage) still reigns, but the head of the ride-hailing service claims his vision would vastly improve life in one of the United State's most congested regions.""If every car in San Francisco was an Uber, there'd be no traffic,"" Kalanick said.Speaking Wednesday at Dreamforce, Salesforce's annual tech confab in downtown San Francisco, Kalanick didn't give specifics on how he plans to make the city an Uber-dominated zone. But throughout his conversation with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Kalanick hinted at what's to come for the rapidly expanding company: growing its UberPool service, recruiting drivers in anticipation of big events, staking its claim in the delivery space and, eventually, incorporating driverless cars and other robotics innovations. ""If something's moving from somewhere to somewhere else in a city, that's our jam,"" he said.Benioff, and Salesforce by extension, is known for championing philanthropy as well as taking a public stand on issues like Indiana's anti-LGBT law. The company often touts its ""1-1-1"" model, under which the company donates 1 percent of its equity, time and resources to helping communities in need.Uber, in contrast, is often portrayed as cold and capitalistic. Kalanick, however, touted many of the company's philanthropic programs on Wednesday, highlighting the company's ""Ride for a Cause"" campaign, which donates $1 to a charity of the rider's choice, as well as its collection of donations for refugees in Europe and efforts to recruit military veterans.He also defended his company against criticism from the taxi industry, arguing that Uber provides drivers both better flexibility and higher paychecks. Taxi drivers, Kalanick said, spend tens of thousands of dollars every year to lease their cars, only to work long hours for little profit.""For that privilege, they get to be impoverished,"" he said.But Uber is also facing fierce criticism for classifying its drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, meaning the company doesn't have to pay for cars or gas, cover workers' compensation or provide unemployment insurance and other key services. The company argues that since its drivers set their own hours and can work as much or as little as they like, they're more business partners than employees -- Kalanick referred to drivers as such during his talk on Wednesday.  Courts, however, have disagreed. In June, an official at the California Labor Commission ruled that the company owed a driver expenses incurred on the job, arguing that the driver in question is an employee because Uber retains ""all necessary control over the operation as a whole."" And earlier this month, a court ruled that Uber drivers in California can file a class-action lawsuit against the company in a case over whether they are contractors or employees. Uber is appealing the ruling. One analysis found that drivers could earn benefits worth up to $5,500 annually if these challenges are successful.That debate has bled into other problem areas for Uber, including its background check system for drivers. Lawmakers in many states are pushing for Uber (and rival services like Lyft) to beef up its background checks in the wake of alarming accusations that drivers have assaulted passengers. In California, prosecutors have filed a complaint against ride-hailing companies for letting individuals previously convicted of sex offenses, kidnapping and murder slip through their background check system.The company's claims about how much drivers can make -- it cites figures as high as $90,000 a year -- have also faced scrutiny and criticism, with many drivers saying they're making minimum wage.The contract battle was absent from Wednesday's conversation, and Benioff largely glossed over Uber's other PR problems. The closest he came was asking if Uber ""has a heart."" But the Salesforce executive did question Kalanick on the company eventually using a fleet of self-driving cars, hinting at the ethical problems that may pose.Kalanick, without mentioning Uber's own attempts at getting into the robotics business, said he'd address those challenges as they come up -- and wouldn't fall into the same trap his predecessors in transportation have. ""Am I going to be part of the future or am I going to resist it?"" Kalanick said. ""We don't want to be like the taxi guys that came before us."""
6,MEDIA,"CNN, NYT Asked To Drop 'Illegal Immigrant' Ahead Of Debate",Gabriel Arana,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cnn-nyt-illegal-immigrant_us_55f97da6e4b0b48f6701693b,"While the Times has evolved in its use of the term, CNN declined to say whether it would recommend its on-air talent not use it.",2015-09-16,"The CNN Spin Room for the GOP debate, which will be held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Wednesday",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f981211c00002e007571e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the first things any journalist learns is that when you’re reporting on someone accused of a crime, you always use “alleged” to indicate that the accused has not been convicted and could very well be innocent. Until a court pronounces guilt, it’s the “alleged” bank robber, the “alleged” jaywalker and the “alleged” candy-snatcher. And yet, whenever immigration issues make it into the news, journalists and media organizations regularly use the phrase “illegal immigrant” or “illegal alien” to describe undocumented immigrants, skipping not just the trial but branding the person as criminality itself. It is for this reason that major news organizations like ABC and the Associated Press have banned the use of the politically charged term, which many in the Latino community regard as a racial slur, and instead require writers and reporters to come up with more precise, neutral language to describe those in the country without permission.“The terms ‘illegal immigrant’ and ‘illegal alien’ are incendiary and tend to incite fear and hatred,” said Mekahlo Medina, president of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. “And as a journalist, it’s completely inaccurate to identify somebody as an illegal immigrant because you’re categorizing a person and not the actual act.”Ahead of Wednesday’s presidential debate, where immigration issues will likely come up, the NAHJ and Define American, a pro-immigrant group founded by activist José Antonio Vargas, have asked CNN to discontinue its use of the phrase. They launched an online petition calling on the network to stop using the term, which on-air talent at CNN continue to use and which also appears in on-air graphics and online headlines. The request is part of a broader push from both organizations to encourage news outlets to modernize their guidelines, using the hashtag #WordsMatter.“We had noticed in a number of interviews that CNN was really all over the place with the language they used,” said Ryan Eller, executive director of Define American. “It was concerning because CNN is hosting the Republican presidential debate and after the last presidential debate, we saw an uptick in negative language being used.”“What we are hearing on the ground is that this has resulted in an increase in violence and discrimination against people of color,” Eller added.In the last three months, as immigration has once again become a salient political issue, CNN has used the term “illegal immigrant” or “illegal alien” a total of 1,634 times, out of 1,995 times in the past year, according to TV monitoring database TVEyes.In response to the petition, Geraldine Moriba, the network’s vice president of diversity and inclusion, told NAHJ that “the word ‘illegal’ should never be used as a standalone noun to refer to individuals with documented or undocumented immigration status” and pledged to remind staff of this guideline.While that would mean CNN wouldn't refer to undocumented immigrants as “illegals,” it wouldn't cover instances in which the word is used as an adjective, like “illegal immigrant” or “illegal alien.”CNN would not confirm to The Huffington Post whether it has an official policy on use of those terms, despite multiple requests.Define American’s Vargas, who wrote about being undocumented in a widely read 2011 New York Times article, said the continued use of the term reflects the media’s racial and ethnic homogeneity.“It gets to the issue of diversity in newsrooms,” Vargas said. “When these decisions are made, how many Hispanic and Asian journalists are part of the conversation?”The continued use of racially tinged rhetoric in the mainstream media also speaks to the powerlessness of the country’s estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants. Journalists are careful to qualify that crimes have only been “alleged” in part as a precaution against libel suits, but they needn’t fear legal action from some of society’s most vulnerable members.The New York Times is another target of the NAHJ and Define American’s #WordsMatter campaign. Vargas first approached the paper’s public editor, Margaret Sullivan, about the issue in 2012. At the time, Sullivan addressed the topic in an online article, saying, “At this point, I don’t know enough.”But Sullivan -- who as the Times’ reader advocate does not have a policy-making role -- has since evolved. “I wrote a few times on this, ultimately saying that my position had changed, and I no longer thought the phrase was the right one,” Sullivan told HuffPost in an email. She explained her evolution on the matter in a blog post. “Language evolves and it’s time for these changes,” she wrote. “So many people find it offensive to refer to a person with an adjective like ‘illegal’ that I now favor the use of ‘undocumented’ or ‘unauthorized’ as alternatives.”Philip Corbett, the Times’ standards editor, has in the past decried the use of “undocumented” as a euphemism. “Often those phrases seem deliberately chosen to try to soften or minimize the significance of the lack of legal status,” Corbett told Poynter in 2012. “We avoid those euphemisms just as we avoid phrases that tend to cast a more pejorative light on immigrants. For example, we steer clear of the shorthand ‘illegals’ and also the word ‘aliens,’ both of which we think have needlessly negative connotations.”But the paper, too, has evolved -- though not as swiftly nor as decisively as Sullivan. In 2013, the Times announced it would encourage its writers to use more precise terms to describe those living in the country without authorization, but did not go so far as to ban the use of “illegal immigrant.”“Our new guidelines recognize that many people object to those terms, and we encouraged our reporters to consider alternatives and especially to be specific whenever possible about a particular person's situation and status,” Corbett said in an email. “No term is perfect or works in every situation, but there are a range of alternatives, including but not limited to adjectives like ‘unauthorized’ or ‘undocumented.’”Vargas believes that the impetus to change the language reporters use to talk about immigration will ultimately come from the journalists who report on immigration issues.“This is going to end with what kind of pressure individual reporters can put on their news organizations,” he said."

""I can't tell you how ridiculous it is to try to run an organization of 70,000 people who are very, very committed to their mission, which is of great importance to the American people, to have to work with them on shutdown planning right now because Congress has not acted on the budget.""During the 16-day shutdown two years ago, the Interior Department was one of the closed wings of the federal government that drew the most public attention, because it oversees the National Park Service. The closure of the parks drew a lot of public outrage, ruining family vacations and weddings at sites across the country. It was also costly for the government; the Interior Department estimated that the closure caused $414 million in lost revenue in and around the parks.But Jewell said the ""hidden catastrophes"" of a shutdown are even worse, like government scientists who can't use data they've been collecting for an entire year because there is a three-week gap.""There are many things that aren't as visible as the national parks that are impacted by a shutdown,"" said Jewell. ""It is very, very important that Congress not go down that path again."""
8,SPORTS,What Not To Do When You And An MLB All-Star Both Catch A Ball,Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/adrian-gonzalez-fan-catch-red-sox_us_55f82108e4b00e2cd5e7e4d7,TFW you realize you're struggling with an All-Star for a foul ball.,2015-09-15,Dodgers first baseman Adrian Gonzalez was none too pleased as a spectator interfered with a routine out on Monday night.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f830112c00003600aafc2b.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On the airwaves of a major league broadcast, the judgment of longtime Dodgers announcer Vin Scully is considered as close to irrefutable as possible in the oft-argumentative sports world. A given fly ball will lead the 87-year-old to recall a pop out from four decades ago. A strikeout incites a memory of a Koufax pitch from the Cold War era.So when Scully publicly censures a play on the field, you know it’s a no-no. Especially when the target of the reproach is wearing a T-shirt, not a jersey, and a watch, not a baseball glove.In the fifth inning of Monday’s Dodgers-Rockies matchup, a pop-up from Colorado’s Tom Murphy drifted foul, slating toward the first row of the grandstand. While Dodgers All-Star Adrian Gonzalez stuck out his glove to make the catch, a fan donning a brewery insignia on his shirt and a Red Sox logo on his cap leaned in toward the ball as well, attempting to wrestle it away from the first baseman.They both clung to the ball for one, two, three seconds, before Gonzalez seized control, nabbed the out and walked away from the Boston fan, giving him a Michael Jordan stare-down on his way back to the infield.“[Y]ou know, they play for a lot of money, there’s a lot of pressure, and this fan probably figures, ‘Well, it’s coming to my neighborhood, so I’m entitled to it,’” Scully commented after the play, “Really, I couldn’t argue with him, but at the same time, considering everything that’s at stake -- I mean, he was fighting Gonzalez all the way.”In the midst of both a tied game with the Rockies and a tight division race with the Giants, the last thing the Dodgers needed was to be competing with the Red Sox (and their fans) as well. Gonzalez seems to have gotten the last laugh, however, as his ball club took down the Rockies, 4-1.Across the country, the fan’s beloved Red Sox fell to an underwhelming Orioles team to boot.Also on HuffPost:"

10,MEDIA,CNN Gears Up For GOP Debate Night And The Big Ratings (They Hope) Come With It,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cnn-republican-debate_us_55f88eece4b0d6492d635e4c,"""We want them to be disagreeing with each other. This is a real dogfight.""",2015-09-15,"Jake Tapper at the Reagan Library, where CNN's Republican primary debate will be held on Wednesday night. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f89002200000260024239e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- Jake Tapper has recently interviewed all 11 Republicans hitting CNN’s primetime debate stage. He won’t be doing so again Wednesday night. What Tapper intends to do is draw out substantive policy disputes amidst the on-stage squabbling, getting candidates to reveal key differences even as they trade rhetorical blows. ""We don’t want them to be talking about their stump speeches. We don’t want them to be on talking points,"" Tapper told The Huffington Post. ""We want them to be disagreeing with each other. This is a real dogfight, this Republican presidential contest. … We want them to be explaining why them and not their opponents.""The Republican candidates better be prepared to do just that at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library because time is ticking. An unprecedented field began to narrow last week, when former Texas Gov. Rick Perry dipped out of the race. Candidates still barely registering in the polls know it’s essential to make an impact on Wednesday night -- or be next off the stage. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has threatened to ""go nuclear."" And some fading candidates may consider the best way of getting the public's -- and certainly the press' -- attention to be swiping fast at frontrunner Donald Trump.So there are sure to be fireworks right out of the gate. But Tapper said his ideal exchange would resemble Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul sparring over NSA surveillance and bulk collection during last month’s Fox News debate. It was a genuine policy dispute that, importantly, also drove conversation on Facebook and Twitter. ""What I’d like would be as many of those moments as possible in the second debate,"" Tapper said.While Fox News assigned different moderators for its first- and second-tier debates, CNN picked Tapper to moderate both the 6 p.m. undercard and 8 p.m. main event. It's a big opportunity for the host but also for CNN as a whole, which has invested heavily in political coverage this past year. The network boasts a 2016 election team approaching 100 staffers, with recent additions from ABC News, The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The network poached a dozen journalists from Politico alone as it ramped up digital coverage. ""When we began to think about this campaign maybe a year and a half ago, we realized it was an important campaign,"" Sam Feist, CNN’s Washington bureau chief, said in an interview. ""We didn’t know exactly who the players were, but we believed this was going to be one of those campaigns that captivated the country.""So far, that bet has paid off. The Fox News debate drew a record-setting 24 million viewers, far more than the roughly 3 million who tuned into the first Republican debate of the 2012 cycle. CNN, anticipating another huge audience, is reportedly charging 40 times its average price for a 30-second ad spot during the debate. While CNN should profit off the debate, the network also devotes significant resources to covering and producing it, with several hundred staffers involved. That investment is evident when you walk into the Air Force One Pavilion at the Reagan Library. Normally, library visitors look at Reagan’s Air Force One, but viewers will see the plane directly behind candidates. CNN staff intricately built scaffolding so that the stage is raised a few stories to the height of the elevated aircraft. Feist said the layout doesn’t just provide a ""spectacular backdrop for a debate,"" but allows those Republican candidates claiming to carry Reagan’s torch to have the opportunity to make their case in front of the plane he used to travel the world as president.Of course, CNN couldn’t skimp after a steady drumbeat of debate coverage the past several weeks, with news segments, candidate interviews, pundit panels and seemingly nonstop reminders during commercial breaks or via on-screen graphics. CNN rolled out a countdown clock Monday night -- still 48 hours away! -- and the network’s wall-to-wall coverage Tuesday was like a (very long) Super Bowl pregame show. ""We are just 34 hours from the crucible of political competition known as the CNN Republican debate,"" said ""New Day"" co-host Chris Cuomo.Coverage Tuesday focused heavily on how candidates could stand out on Wednesday night -- and of course, on Trump. The reality star-turned-Republican frontrunner has had a frequent presence on CNN over the past few months, each offensive comment or spat providing an additional subplot. Trump has called into several CNN shows, talking at times for 20 minutes straight without commercial break, and was the subject of a primetime interview special.  The network has disrupted programming to show Trump events live, even recently bumping Anderson Cooper’s long-planned Hurricane Katrina special in the process.""If you get good ratings, they'll cover you even if you have nothing to say,"" Trump told around 15,000 people gathered Monday night in Dallas for an campaign rally, carried live on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN. Tapper and CNN executives defend the network’s Trump coverage by pointing out that he’s the Republican frontrunner and that he’s accessible to the media. ""As a political television producer, I will never turn down an interview with the frontrunner for any party on any program,” Feist said. He and Tapper suggested they’d similarly make time for Hillary Clinton, the more press-averse frontrunner on the Democratic side.Though Trump seems like a debate-night wild card, especially when compared to the more staid governors and senators in the mix, Tapper insists he doesn’t have a specific game plan for dealing with him. Fox News co-moderator Bret Baier, for instance, acknowledged having a ""nuclear"" option going in to last month's debate, a prepared script to launch into if Trump strayed from the ground rules. ""The way I’ve covered Donald Trump from the very beginning is as I would cover any presidential candidate,"" Tapper said. He plans to enforce the same time limits for all the candidates. He should have an easier time during the earlier debate, given that just four candidates will be on stage. Later in the evening, Tapper will have to wrangle 11 candidates, the most to ever appear on a primary debate stage. Though unwieldy, Tapper noted the primetime debate allows for more time -- nearly three hours -- and potential disagreements on stage. Tapper will be joined by Dana Bash and conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, each of whom will ask some questions of the candidates. CNN has a deep bench and last election cycle, when Tapper was still at ABC News, it tapped Wolf Blitzer and John King.Feist said the network wanted ""to treat of the candidates as similarly as possible,"" with the same moderators, questioners and audience for each contest. Because of security reasons, Fox News didn’t allow members of the public into its undercard debate, resulting in the candidates debating in a largely empty, cavernous arena.Tapper, a political junkie whose CNN office is stuffed with presidential memorabilia from losing campaigns, said he’s been excited by the unexpected 2016 primary, with not only the rise of Trump but also by 74-year-old Democratic Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders drawing huge, enthusiastic crowds.""This is all just fun. This is all interesting,"" Tapper said. ""I have no idea how it’s going to end. Every day during debate prep, when we’re going over questions, we talk about what our first question would be if the debate were tonight. And every day it’s different. Every day it’s a different question."""
11,ENTERTAINMENT,"In And Outside Of One Tiny 'Room,' Brie Larson And Jacob Tremblay Are A Wonder",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/room-review-brie-larson_us_55f72bb0e4b042295e374629,The adaptation of Emma Donoghue's novel is a Toronto Film Fest highlight.,2015-09-15,Likely to Garner the Most Oscar Buzz: “The Danish Girl”,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ef1a681d0000ea01146f6d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"To prepare for ""Room,"" Brie Larson locked herself in her apartment for weeks at a time. She met with trauma counselors and participated in a silent retreat, revisiting childhood recollections of living in a tiny studio with her single mother and eating Ramen nightly. Larson realized that period was one of the fondest of her life, despite how limited it may have appeared in actuality. And that is what informed her performance in the new adaptation of Emma Donoghue's best-seller, which revolves around a young mother who has birthed and raised her now-5-year-old son inside the shed where they are held captive. Larson recounted her groundwork for the role during a Monday press conference at the Toronto Film Festival, where ""Room"" screened for media. Talk of an Oscar nomination for the 25-year-old actress rippled through the festival, and for good reason: Larson, who broke out on the Showtime series ""United States of Tara"" and earned her bona fides with the moving drama ""Short Term 12,"" does her best work to date in the movie. If she were playing someone whose confinement was fresh, Larson would require a big performance, full of panic and anguish. But because it's been several years since her character was kidnapped, by a man who asked for help with his sick dog, Larson must blend the grief that itches at her with the banality of everyday life inside of one tiny outbuilding where her captor visits only to have sex and deliver chintzy groceries. By the time we meet her, she is anesthetized to the experience. That's seen in deadened interactions with her volatile detainer and in the imagination she uses to give her son the most positive upbringing possible. An equal match for Larson is Jacob Tremblay, the 8-year-old ""Smurfs 2"" actor who portrays her long-haired son, Jack. As in the book, the story is told largely from his perspective. Here, that means sporadic voice-overs where Jack explains the world that he knows inside of what he and Ma call Room. In his eyes, everything else is outer space and the people on the television they watch are not real -- at least until Ma introduces a plan to escape. Tremblay's is as much of a lead role as Larson's, and he captures the naïveté of Jack's transition from claustrophobic chamber to a boundless and unfamiliar universe. He panics as Ma informs him of what exists beyond Room, hesitates as he later experiences it for himself and cycles through grief, rage and wonder at the circumstances that burden his young brain. No remarkable child performance should go without credit to the director -- in this case, Lenny Abrahamson (""Frank"") -- and the primary co-stars, but Tremblay carries a lot of weight on his tiny shoulders. It is apparent that Larson and Tremblay's connection ran deep while making ""Room."" At Monday's press conference, they talked about constructing some of the toys featured in their characters' titular home and spending time playing together before production began. “I felt incapable of not talking about 'Star Wars' and which animal would beat what in a battle,” Larson said of the hours they weren't in each other's company throughout the movie's shoot. That kinship comes to life in the two characters' nonverbal communication -- the fury they sometimes unleash upon each other, the warmth that billows through their laughter and the gravity of each's need for the other to survive. There's a lot else to rave about when it comes to ""Room,"" primarily Danny Cohen's roving cinematography. It traces the scenery in a such a way that the audience enters the mindset of being locked away and then discovering or re-entering a world rendered foreign. In faithfully adapting her own novel, Donoghue retains a sense of bewilderment about navigating life for the first time, which is why Jack is the crux of ""Room."" If you've spent five years whimsically thinking that dogs belong in television sets and friends are the mice that scurry across your single bedroom, imagine the heartache and awe upon learning there is an escape. Imagine the same if you actually knew there was a universe passing you by. Larson and Tremblay masterfully convey that turbulence. By the time ""Room"" comes to a weepy close, the audience's world seems a bit bigger and brighter than it did two hours earlier.""Room"" opens Oct. 16.For continuous updates from the Toronto Film Festival, follow Matthew Jacobs and Erin Whitney on Twitter.Also on HuffPost:For a constant stream of entertainment news and discussion, follow HuffPost Entertainment on Viber."

""The president in his Climate Action Plan has said clearly that we need to move to a lower-carbon future. I am very proud to work for a president that has been as direct and forceful in his messaging as President Barack Obama.""Environmental groups have criticized the administration for advocating for action on climate change while also approving oil drilling in the Arctic and opening new areas off the East Coast for exploration.Jewell said that her department, along with other parts of the federal government, has been working to reduce the United States' contribution of climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions.""But,"" she continued, ""right now, we are sitting under lights that are likely powered by coal. Most of you probably burned some fossil fuels in one way or another to get here. There are millions of jobs around this country that are dependent on these industries. You can't just cut it off overnight and expect to have an economy that is, in fact, a leader in the world.""Shortly after Jewell's remarks, a coalition of environmental groups held a small rally in front of the White House calling for an end to all fossil fuel development on public lands, including coal mining and oil and gas extraction. Groups involved in the rally included Physicians for Social Responsibility, Friends of the Earth, Rainforest Action Network and 350.org, which have joined with others to form the ""Keep It in the Ground"" campaign. The campaign is “based on the notion that we are in a climate crisis,” said Friends of the Earth President Erich Pica.“Scientists have said that we need to keep 80 percent of all the known fossil fuel reserves in the ground” in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, he added.But in her remarks Tuesday morning, Jewell indicated that ending development on public lands is a position the Obama administration wouldn't be adopting anytime soon. ""I think it oversimplifies a very complex situation to suggest that one could simply cut off leasing or drilling on public lands and solve the issue of climate change,"" she said. ""We all have a responsibly to act and there are things we are doing and will continue to do to reduce the carbon footprint and put incentives in place for all of us to do a better job in how we use carbon.""Philip Lewis and Ruby Mellen contributed reporting.

The White House has remained cagey when discussing the ban -- first implemented during the 1970s Arab oil embargo -- simply saying the administration's policy has not changed despite taking action to gradually ease it where deemed appropriate.House Republicans plan to vote on legislation this fall that would lift the ban, allowing the large-scale export of crude oil overseas.Asked about the bill, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the decision on whether the ban should be lifted should be left to the Commerce Department. ""We’ve got a position on this, which is this is a policy decision made over at the Commerce Department, and for that reason we wouldn’t support legislation like the one that has been put forward by Republicans,"" Earnest said Tuesday, threatening a veto by the president if it reaches Obama's desk. Earnest went on to prod Republicans, claiming they are too ""cozy"" with the oil industry. ""It is pretty clear, once again, where Republicans in Congress and their political benefactors stand when it comes to their energy policy priorities,"" he said.Earnest added that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) should instead use the opportunity he has to ""demonstrate true political courage"" and offer legislation that would ""end billions in subsidies that oil and gas companies in the U.S. already enjoy."" McCarthy spoke before an energy forum in Texas on Tuesday to preview the GOP's fall agenda. Last year, the Commerce Department lifted restrictions for certain U.S. companies, allowing them to export a type of ultralight oil known as condensate to foreign buyers, clearing the way for the first exports of unrefined oil in over four decades. The U.S. also exports crude oil to Canada, and recently announced a landmark decision to allow crude oil export swaps with Mexico. "

Dianne Feinstein graciously says the CIA's torture program didn't go that far.,2015-09-15,Sen. Dianne Feinstein thinks the documents on torture tell a brutal tale.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_41_50_3761_2469%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Former CIA Director Michael Hayden still isn't pumped about last year's Senate report on the agency's torture program. It's slanted, it's one-sided, and it cherry-picks information, Hayden wrote in a new attack last week. The way the staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee did their work, he said, they could've made it look like he helped put Jesus Christ on the cross.Alas, despite Hayden's suggestion, the proverbial thorn in the side of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) doesn't appear to have played a role in perhaps history's most famous death.""There are no CIA documents to indicate that Hayden killed Jesus,"" reads a surgically precise rebuke from Feinstein, former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and her staff. She quietly posted a detailed rebuttal to Hayden's assertions last week. ""There are more than 6.3 million pages of records that indicate the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation' program was ineffective and more brutal than previously known, as well as CIA records that show Hayden provided substantial amounts of inaccurate information to the Committee on the program,"" wrote Feinstein, referencing the report prepared under her watch. ""The CIA -- in its official response -- agrees that Hayden provided inaccurate information.""Hayden and other former spy chiefs claim they've been unfairly villainized by the Intelligence Committee's damning, 6,700-page report on the agency's now-defunct torture program. That report, the executive summary of which was released last December, concludes that the CIA mismanaged and abused its interrogation powers in the wake of 9/11 and lied to Congress and the White House about the harsh techniques it used.Onetime CIA leaders Hayden, George Tenet, Jose Rodriguez, Porter Goss and a handful of others are fighting back with Rebuttal: The CIA Responds to the Senate Intelligence Committee's Study of Its Detention and Interrogation Program, released this month by the Naval Institute. The book offers a collection of essays as well as the CIA's own formal response to the Senate report and a complimentary document from what was then the Intelligence Committee's Republican minority. In the essays, the former CIA officials present an unapologetic defense of the agency's use of torture and a searing indictment of the Senate study.Hayden, who became director of the CIA in 2006 at the tail end of the torture program, has long been a vocal opponent of Feinstein's report. But his defenses have occasionally left his audience scratching their heads. In his most recent essay, his attempts to explain the CIA technique of ""walling"" fall short of the mark.While Feinstein and her Senate colleagues said the agency had ""slammed people's heads into walls,"" Hayden wrote that walling involved ""pushing a detainee's shoulders into a false plywood wall, all the while protecting their necks with braces or at a minimum towels."" According to the CIA's own documents, interrogators used the towels as a tool for propelling people's heads toward the wall.As for Feinstein's most recent rebuke, the former Intelligence Committee chair leaves the ball in the retired CIA chief's court. ""Only Hayden can say if he intentionally misled policymakers,"" the response reads."

Just the price of the plan is outrageous, Ramos noted. He zeroed in on Trump's plan to deport 11 million immigrants in an 18- to 24-month period. To do this, Ramos said, Trump would have to deport 458,333 immigrants per month, or 15,277 people per day.""Let me put it in perspective,"" he said. ""That means he would have to fill up 30 or more 747s every single day for two years, and this would be incredibly expensive.""Ramos said that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has estimated that it costs $12,500 to deport one person -- meaning that deporting 11 million people would cost around $137 billion.

The UAW had still not called for walkouts as of 7:30 a.m. as workers started reporting for morning shifts in the U.S. Midwest.The decision to extend the contract indicates the two sides are making progress on complicated pay and benefit issues. Neither FCA nor the UAW issued comments on details of the talks Tuesday morning.UAW officials could direct members to stop work at any time if talks hit an impasse.At issue are proposals to overhaul a two-tier pay system the UAW wants eliminated and to restructure company health plans to curb rising costs, people familiar with the process said.The UAW wants FCA to agree to raise wages for more senior workers, who make about $28 per hour, and to reduce or eliminate the disparity for more recently hires, whose hourly pay tops out at $19.28.FCA Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne has said he wants to eliminate the two-tier wage system, but he has suggested base wages be set lower than the current top tier. He wants to offer union workers more in the form of profit-sharing or bonuses when FCA's earnings are high.At FCA, about 45 percent of the hourly UAW workers earn lower-tier wages.The UAW has at least three options.It could call a companywide strike or stage limited walkouts that could cripple FCA's operations without forcing hefty payments to workers from union strike funds. It could also opt to continue extending the talks.The terms of any deal with Fiat Chrysler would set the pattern for subsequent labor agreements at General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co, the UAW has said.FCA's U.S. operations have had an $8-to-$10-an-hour labor cost advantage over Ford, where 28 percent of the UAW workers are in the lower-tier wage group, and GM, where 20 percent are in that tier.Ford and GM on Monday agreed with the UAW to extend their current contracts, the union and the companies said.
