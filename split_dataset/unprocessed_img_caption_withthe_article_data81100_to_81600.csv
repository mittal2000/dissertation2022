His windmill jams are tasteless; instead of apologizing, he hangs from the rim, screaming.He constantly commits flagrant fouls: He called Mexican immigrants rapists, impugned John McCain's military record, and suggested a Fox News anchor was menstruating after she asked a mildly difficult question. This stuff's supposed to be against the rules! But Trump just bullies the refs, forcing Fox News to give him friendlier calls on the court by threatening to abandon the network.Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), in particular, has been getting posterized. At the first debate, he accused Trump of buying politicians, only to have Trump agree and say that in fact, he had even bought Rand Paul. The Kentucky Senator then attacked Trump in a campaign ad, only to have Trump call Paul a ""mess"" who sucks at golf, which the Paul campaign meekly admitted was kinda true.Even Democrats are taking elbows to the face. Disgusted that Bernie Sanders yielded his lectern to Black Lives Matter protesters -- women! -- Trump said it showed Sanders' ""weakness"" and averred that The Donald would have physically fought the protestors.It's a level of bluster to which Republican voters are totally unaccustomed, and they love it. At least, that's what we think.

The standoff began when the suspect picked up a gun and lit his home on fire as marshals tried serving a warrant for a parole violation, SILive.com reports.A 54-year-old firefighter responding to the scene was shot in the lower left leg and buttocks, police told the publication. He was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The New York City Fire Department released dispatch audio of its response to the shooting.""We need EMS... we have a report of a firearm... firefighter shot,"" emergency responders can be heard saying at the 2:40 mark.Around 7 a.m., after the initial encounter, a Facebook page appearing to belong to Tyree had a message saying today would be his last.When asked to elaborate, a message from the account said police had ""kicked in my door and it popped off.""Around 11:45 a.m. Garland came out of his home shooting at officers. Authorities responded by shooting back and dispensing tear gas, according to the New York Post. Tyree was found dead inside the home a short time later.A high-ranking police source told both Silive.com and the New York Daily News that Tyree is a well-known leader of the East Coast Bloods. Social media accounts appearing to belong to the suspect mention previous arrests.Tyree previously served seven years in prison on assault and weapons possession convictions, according to the Daily News."

But what exactly are eyes doing when we experience rapid eye movement (REM) sleep?A new study suggests that our eyes are essentially visualizing new images that we ""see"" in our dreams. In fact, our eyes seem to respond to those images in much the same way they would respond to seeing something while awake.""Our goal was to examine what happens inside the brain when we dream, specifically at moments when rapid eye movements occur,"" Dr. Yuval Nir, a neuroscientist at Tel Aviv University in Israel and co-author of the study, said in a written statement. ""We discovered that the electrical brain activity during REM sleep is very similar to what occurs when the viewer sees new images for the first time.""For the study, the brain activity of 19 epilepsy patients whose brains had been fitted with electrodes was monitored for two weeks -- both while the patients were awake and while they were asleep.The researchers observed that neurons in the medial temporal lobe -- a brain region associated with visual perception and memory -- showed a surge of activity around a quarter of a second after patients moved their eyes during REM sleep, New Scientist reported. The researchers concluded that after the rapid eye movements occur the dreaming brain produces new images.""Even people who are congenitally blind... can still dream about their aunt coming to visit from Florida: her voice, the emotions and all the associations that go with that,"" Nir told BBC News. ""And when the dream changes from meeting this aunt to, say, taking your dog for a stroll in the park, then the brain activity changes and this happens in sync with eye movements.""The scientists hope that, with additional research, they might be able to link brain activity in dreaming patients to specific dream imagery.The study was published online in the journal Nature Communications on August 11, 2015.

""In Alaska, glaciers are melting. The hunting, fishing, upon which generations have depended for their way of life and for their jobs, are being threatened. Storm surges once held at bay now endanger entire villages,"" Obama continued. ""As Alaskan permafrost melts, some homes are even sinking into the ground. The state's God-given natural treasures are at risk.""Obama will be in the state from August 31 through September 3. The White House said he will meet with Alaskans experiencing climate change's impacts, and will seek to bring national and global attention the issue.While environmental groups welcome Obama's visit to the Arctic -- the first by a sitting president -- they also point out that the administration has approved permits allowing Shell to drill for oil  in the region, even as the president decries the effects of climate change, which is largely driven by the burning of fossil fuels. Shell received permission to move forward with exploratory drilling, but needs to modify some of its plans before drilling can begin.Greenpeace USA and Oil Change International released a new report Wednesday condemning drilling in the region. ""Announcing a tour of Alaska to highlight climate change would be deeply hypocritical if the President would then turn around and give Shell final approval to drill in the Arctic tomorrow,"" Greenpeace spokesman Travis Nichols told The Huffington Post in an email.The prospect of drilling in the Arctic while promoting the need to protect it is ""like shooting rhinos to save them,"" said Ben Schreiber, climate and energy program director at Friends of the Earth."
5,BUSINESS,Pinterest Now Analyzing Pay For Discrimination Against Women,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pinterest-pay-women_us_55cbaadfe4b0f73b20bb9bdf,"Big companies have been doing this for years, and now startups are too.",2015-08-13,"<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18.1818180084229px; background-color: #eeeeee;"">Redfin did its first salary audit this year.</span></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55cbaf6714000077002e2bdf.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Many older, established companies are already in the habit of making sure they’re not discriminating against women when it comes to pay. Now tech startups are starting to get hip to the practice, too.Pinterest is joining a growing group of young tech startups that are closely reviewing employees’ salaries to make sure men and women are paid fairly. An outside firm is analyzing pay at the 5-year-old social network to make sure it’s not discriminating against any particular group, a spokeswoman recently told The Huffington Post.The reviews, which started about 18 months ago, take place “during the times of year when employees are up for bonuses and promotion,” said spokeswoman Malorie Lucich in an email. The company, which has more than 600 employees, wouldn’t say if anyone has gotten a raise as a result of its analysis or whether it had turned up any bias.Pay audits are gaining steam quickly in part because of the growing focus on the struggles of women in the tech industry -- there are fewer females in general, and a real dearth in high-profile positions. The idea is also catching on as so many of these startups start to, well, grow up.“At first a startup is so focused on survival, and so convinced of its own idealism and its own rightness, who could possibly think we could have biases,” Glenn Kelman, chief executive of 10-year-old real estate website Redfin, told HuffPost.At the prompting of a couple of its female employees, Redfin not only took a companywide look this year at how it pays women and men, it also published the results. The data happened to look pretty good -- pay is about equal for men and women at the 1,000-person company. In some cases, women are pulling in more money. That surprised Kelman, who cautioned that he expects that might not always be the case. ""We're going to make mistakes,"" he said. The key is having a system for catching discrimination and quickly fixing it.Kelman said that since Redfin did its audit, other chief executives at small and midsize companies have since reached out to ask about the experience. They’re not on board with pay audits yet, but are exploring the idea, he said.Some women were being paid less than men at enterprise software company Salesforce.com before it launched a similar effort earlier this year -- also at the prompting of a few female employees. “In certain positions, people were not being paid at the same level,” Chief Executive Marc Benioff recently told The New York Times.“This is definitely new for startups,” said Joelle Emerson, the founder of Paradigm, a consulting firm that focuses on diversity. Emerson said that a few of her clients, including Pinterest, have started doing the pay comparisons.Big companies have been doing these types of audits for years. The end game might not be fairness, per se, but to avoid getting sued for discrimination.Looking for bias in salaries “should be a standard,” Donna Morris, the senior vice president of people and places at software company Adobe, told HuffPost. Her department looks every year, she said, and Google, Facebook and Microsoft do as well.If you’re not doing these comparisons, “it’s like a ticking time bomb,"" said Ken Abosch, a compensation practice leader for Aon Hewitt, which does this kind of work for about 10 to 20 percent of the Fortune 1000 in any given year. (Some employers’ do their own analysis, typically in the HR department.)Still, even though the practice makes sense, ""a surprisingly large number of organizations don’t do this,"" Abosch said.There are plenty of cases where Abosch and his team find that females are underpaid relative to men, or when older workers are paid less than younger workers. When that happens, “those things have to be corrected,” he said. Abosch said most companies won’t explain why you’re getting a raise when discrimination is found. But then again, most people getting a random raise aren't going to spend too much time worrying about why.There's still a long way to go on this issue of pay parity. Men in Silicon Valley earn up to 61 percent more than their female peers, according to a report this year from Joint Venture Silicon Valley. Indeed, the gulf between the sexes is worse in Silicon Valley than in San Francisco at large or the U.S., according to the research group.If so many companies are starting to think about fair compensation, how could a gap remain? Well, first, there are still plenty of companies that aren't focused on this. And second, because ""fair"" pay isn't the same as ""equal"" pay in the workplace. Companies reviewing their salaries are simply looking for discrimination in pay -- if all the people in a certain class are systematically making less for no good reason. They're looking to keep workers within an acceptable salary range -- so it could be fine for a woman to earn $40,000 a year and a man to earn $50,000 if that's the standard range for a position. There are plenty of reasons people earn different salaries -- experience and ability, of course, are two. Also, some people negotiate harder for higher pay. Studies have shown that those people are typically men. Once you've got that lower-than-average salary, it follows you around.The salary analysis at Pinterest is part of a broader diversity initiative at the company, which took the unusual step last month of publicly announcing its goals to increase its hiring of women and minorities. “We believe the more diverse the team is, the more creative potential we have as a company,” said Michael DeAngelo, Pinterest’s head of people, in a recent blog post. “So we also care a lot about making sure our team includes a wide diversity of skills, life experiences, races, ethnicities, genders and other traits that make us unique.”"

Over the past year, Mckesson -- a former teacher and school administrator in Minneapolis -- has become one of the most visible Black Lives Matter activists and has documented protests across the country. Packnett, a Teach For America executive and former congressional staffer, is a member of both the Ferguson Commission in Missouri and President Barack Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Mckesson has been openly critical of various presidential candidates, and has sought to hold them accountable for the way they've seldom addressed the unique issues facing black Americans. After attending Clinton’s official 2016 presidential campaign announcement in June, Mckesson left the event feeling underwhelmed.Mckesson, one of dozens of demonstrators arrested this week during a protest outside the federal courthouse in St. Louis, told HuffPost that the discussion with the Clinton campaign revolved around police and criminal justice reform.Black Lives Matter is gradually making systemic racism a campaign issue for the Democratic presidential hopefuls. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is running as a Democrat, on Sunday introduced a policy platform targeting structural anti-black racism. O'Malley has rolled out a framework for criminal justice reform, although it's less explicit in its discussion of racism than Sanders' platform.Clinton, however, has not yet produced a comprehensive agenda focusing on police violence or mass incarceration -- issues that disproportionately affect black Americans -- even though she is currently the most popular candidate among black voters, with a favorability rate of 68 percent.“In the next six months, up to the primaries, we really want to be challenging each candidate about their platforms, or lack thereof, specifically relating to a black agenda,” Cullors said. “We’ve gone far too long with president after president who doesn’t center the needs of black people -- and then, in fact, creates policies that completely decimate black communities.”“Even after a year of protests and organizing, we still aren’t seeing the reforms necessary to ensure that black people are going to be safe,” Cullors went on. “We want to see something that’s very concrete, and on our end we’ll do our work to continue to lift up the issues that we think are most important, that are impacting black communities today.” Clinton met with activists from the Boston chapter of Black Lives Matter on Tuesday after they were shut out of a campaign event in Keene, New Hampshire. The activists had planned to disrupt the event, a forum on substance abuse, in a manner similar to how Black Lives Matter demonstrators in Phoenix interrupted a Netroots Nation town hall last month. But in Keane, the activists were directed to an overflow room by U.S. Secret Service after being told the event was at capacity. One goal of the confrontation, according to Cullors, was to challenge Clinton’s role in facilitating mass incarceration -- something critics say Clinton has done in part by supporting tough-on-crime initiatives. “How do we know what she’s saying is going to translate into real-life changes for black people? We haven’t seen a racial justice agenda from the Hillary campaign,” she said. “We haven’t seen a criminal justice reform agenda from the Hillary campaign.”Cullors said she doesn’t believe the activists were shut out of the Keane event because it was at capacity. “They found out there was going to be a disruption, saw people with ‘Black Lives Matter’ shirts on, shut them out and then strategically put them in the overflow room,” she said. “It was a very political move. [Clinton] understood that... she would have gotten shut down, and she needed to play her cards right -- so she decided to meet with us. And that’s fine.”The group met with Clinton for about 15 minutes after the forum ended. It was a short chat that mainly consisted of the former secretary of state making suggestions about how to advance the movement -- but not proposing policies that would address the movement’s concerns, according to Julius Jones, one of the activists in attendance. “We were going in there with the understanding that we were combating systems, but we're also encountering a person with a higher level of responsibility for the way that the systems are today than most anyone in the presidential race,” Jones told The New Republic -- a reference to Clinton’s support of a 1994 crime bill signed into law by her husband, then-President Bill Clinton. “We went in there with that understanding, and chose to press her on her personal involvement and her personal feelings about her involvement, and what she was going to do to change it, given her husband's history of perpetuating mass incarceration and the War on Drugs.”Democratic candidates aren't the only ones on whom Black Lives Matter activists hope to make an impact. “Obviously, on the GOP side, we’re going to be challenging the ways in which the GOP has related to black folks for decades,” Cullors said. “We’re going to challenge [former Florida Gov. Jeb] Bush and the regime that he comes from, both his father and his brother who drove black lives into the ground. And we’re going to challenge all the Republicans -- the ones who are most visible.”Packnett, one of the activists who spoke with Clinton's policy director a couple of weeks ago, told HuffPost that the current political moment is one of great potential.""There's a critical opportunity before presidential candidates right now to not only engage with marginalized communities, but also to act on our behalf and act with our needs in mind,"" Packnett said. ""I firmly believe that the opportunity has been created due to socially and politically involved people of color, particularly young people of color.""She told HuffPost that today's levels of social and racial inequity have been centuries in the making, and that the next president must set the country on a path to repair those inequalities.""Incrementalism wouldn't be enough,"" she said.Bush was interrupted by Black Lives Matter activists at an event in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Cullors said the group also plans to confront the real estate mogul Donald Trump, who is running for president as a Republican -- even though Trump has claimed that any activists who try to take his mic will be met with physical violence.“This is coming from [someone] who may lead the country,” Cullors said. “I think it’s important as organizers that... no matter who the candidate is, Democratic or Republican, we have to challenge both sides.” This story has been updated to include information about Clinton's April 2014 remarks."
