0,POLITICS,The Budget Deal Raises Taxes On Rich People -- Just Not The Way You Think,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/budget-deal-taxes-on-rich_us_562fd371e4b0c66bae59dd44,Some hedge funds and lawyers are going to be paying Uncle Sam a little bit more.,2015-10-27,The new budget deal reached between Speaker of the House John Boehner and the White House would raise a little bit of revenue through more aggressive IRS enforcement.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/562fd4781400001b013c945d.jpeg?cache=ZbSIMk4lgn&ops=crop_59_59_3184_2260%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Although outgoing House Speaker John Boehner may be reluctant to acknowledge it, the latest budget deal between Congress and the White House includes a provision that will require wealthy Americans to turn over more money to the IRS.Boehner claimed Tuesday that the deal doesn't increase taxes. Whether that's an accurate statement depends on how one defines the term ""tax increase."" The federal government has three basic ways it can increase its tax revenues: raise tax rates, eliminate loopholes and deductions, or ramp up IRS enforcement of existing tax laws. The latest budget deal took what's behind Door No. 3.The proposed deal is expected to generate $11 billion in new federal revenue from what both sides are calling ""tax compliance"" measures, including $9 billion from new auditing standards for hedge funds, law firms and other business partnerships. In plain English, that means the IRS is going to be getting more money by improving its tax collection policies for rich people.It's an open secret in Washington that a lot of wealthy people don't pay all of the taxes they owe. But figuring out who is taking advantage of perfectly legal tax deductions and who is illegally dodging payments can be a difficult and costly endeavor. It's particularly hard when people have their money tied up in a large business partnership, because the existing rules for auditing partnerships are old and designed for relatively simple businesses.Under existing law, if the IRS thinks a firm has been skimping on its payments, it can't just look at a single tax filing for the business and calculate what it owes; it has to audit the individual tax returns of every single partner involved in the business. That's not a big deal for a local bakery or flower shop with two or three partners. But many far more complex operations -- hedge funds, law firms and other things that pay rich people lots of money -- can have hundreds or even thousands of partners, making it extremely difficult for the IRS to show that money is being held up.A 2014 GAO report found that, as of 2011, there were more than 10,000 businesses with at least 100 partners, and more than 500 businesses with at least 100,000 partners. And the large partnership structure is particularly appealing for many firms precisely because it is harder to track tax chicanery than if the company were simply organized as a corporation, which can be audited at the corporate level. The number of large partnerships more than tripled from 2002 to 2011.The change included in the budget would eliminate those more complicated auditing rules for partnerships and allow the IRS to audit them once, at the partnership level, without fussing with hundreds or thousands of other tax returns.Regardless of whether one would define $9 billion in new money from hedge funders and other well-heeled professionals over the next decade as a tax ""increase,"" the wealthy could be doing much worse. Raising the tax rate on the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers by 5 percentage points, for instance, would bring in $55 billion in the first year alone, according to The New York Times.Zach Carter is The Huffington Post's senior political economy reporter and a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast, ""So That Happened.""

Unlike previous debates, the number of candidates who can appear in the prime time debate will not be capped. Debate organizers will consider polls conducted through Nov. 4 by ""major nationally-recognized organizations that use standard methodological techniques,"" Fox Business Network and the Wall Street Journal said in a release.  The criteria used to determine which candidates can participate in the prime time debate has been controversial in a GOP field that started out with 17 candidates and in which 15 remain. In August, Fox News limited its primary debate to those who polled in the top 10 and wound up choosing a selection of polls that left former Texas Gov. Rick Perry off the main debate stage.CNN also revised its criteria for its September debate, extending the interval of time in which it was willing to consider polls after complaints from Carly Fiorina's campaign.To participate in CNBC's main debate on Wednesday, candidates most be polling at 3 percent or above. The Fox Business Network/Wall Street Journal debate will be held Nov. 10 in Milwaukee.Also on HuffPost:"

3,SPORTS,The 5 NBA Rookies You Need To Watch This Season,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nba-rookies-2015_us_5627e35ce4b02f6a900f5a44,These guys got next.,2015-10-27,"No. 1 overall pick Karl Anthony-Towns, No. 8 pick Stanley Johnson and No. 2 pick D'Angelo Russell all face lofty expectations for their rookie campaigns.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/562e92ac1400002200c7ae0f.jpeg?cache=OJr5rHzhCL&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NBA rookies are fun -- they just are.But what is fun in the NBA isn't necessarily good. Last year's famed rookie class with Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker had plenty of great moments, but Wiggins came up against the proverbial rookie wall and Parker suffered a season-ending injury after performing well early on. In fact, the remainder of the lottery hardly impressed, either. Joel Embiid and Julius Randle never got on the floor after severe injuries, while hot draft-night names like Dante Exum, Aaron Gordon and Doug McDermott all disappointed. We think the 2015 class is more talented and far deeper than its predecessor. Here are the five players -- all 19 years old, by the way -- whom you can't afford to miss this season. (And you can see more NBA previews here, here and here.)Karl Anthony-Towns, MinnesotaNo surprises here. Towns -- whom HuffPost caught up with in June -- was the No. 1 pick in the draft because of his unlimited ceiling. His splendid blend of size, athleticism and legitimate shut-down defensive ability already stands out.Minnesota is young -- like, really young -- and Towns will be featured in the post as the T-Wolves attempt to establish an identity. His pick-and-roll game with Ricky Rubio will be extra notable as a result. Finally, under the tutelage of teammate Kevin Garnett, the 7-foot Towns will learn how to become a pro, the importance of which cannot be understated in today's NBA. His best move early on will likely be the baby jump hook off the left shoulder that he used so well in college, but we know he will also need much more. (Remember, he shot below 40 percent in summer league.)Towns' footwork -- like any young big -- will need help, but he has terrific hands, and his dramatic improvement during a single season in Lexington suggests he'll get there sooner than later.D'Angelo Russell, LA LakersIt may have come as a surprise to some observers that the Lakers opted for Russell as the second overall pick, choosing him over Duke's Jahlil Okafor. But it shouldn't have, as I explained in my draft winners and losers column. Russell, at 6-foot-5 with a freakish 6-foot-10 wingspan, is a playmaking dynamo and prodigious passer who thrives on the open floor.That said, his turnover woes (5 per game) and shooting struggles (38 percent) in summer league will continue, so long as he is being featured in Byron Scott's offense. And perhaps the bigger question is how a 37-year-old Kobe Bryant responds to a young, swashbuckling, ball-dominant lead guard. Russell will be special, but he'll need to be given the leeway to make mistakes early, and to learn from them as well.Justise Winslow, MiamiWinslow will make everyone pay for passing on him. Miami, which snagged him with the 10th pick, will instantly employ Winslow as a lockdown perimeter defender and capable third scoring option. It wasn't a reach when his college coach, Mike Krzyzewski, referred to Winslow as a Dwyane Wade clone. And Wade, to be sure, will benefit from Winslow's ability to play multiple wing spots. The beauty of Winslow is his versatility and winning pedigree, which Miami executive Pat Riley clearly coveted. While helping lead Duke to the national championship, the 6-foot-6 forward often had to defend the post one game and the perimeter the next. Winslow was equally comfortable making plays with the ball as he was playing off of Tyus Jones and Okafor.His role with the Heat won't be much different. He will thrive playing off Goran Dragic and Chris Bosh -- who recently sat down with me on HuffPost Live -- in the same way, not to mention the 33-year-old Wade. As his shooting becomes more consistent, particularly from 3, Winslow will have every opportunity to become Miami's next superstar.Emmanuel Mudiay, DenverMudiay doesn't appear to be a particularly gifted athlete, but with his 6-foot-5 frame and wondrous feel for the game, it may not matter. Like New York's Kristaps Porzingis, Mudiay is more of an enigma than anything else, given that few people have actually seen him play.Here is what we do know, however. He can really pass the ball and from everything we've seen, he really wants to pass it. While he's not a consistent perimeter jump shooter yet, Mudiay's comfort level in the low block will be a major advantage. Big point guards who can score with their backs to the basket -- think Gary Payton, Andre Miller -- have a distinct built-in advantage, and it will serve Mudiay well, especially early on in his career.The negative for him is likely to be overall efficiency, specifically when it comes to turnovers. This is a shortcoming of most young point guards, but going from the pro game in China to the NBA is a tremendous leap, and Mudiay will surely struggle with turnovers in his eagerness to make plays. But that's okay, because like Russell, he has the size and skillset to thrive as his team's quarterback. Just give him time.Stanley Johnson, Detroit Johnson may actually be the rare example of a player who becomes a better pro than he was a collegian. Some say he didn't live up to the preseason buzz -- though he earned the Julius Erving Small Forward of the Year award during his lone season in Tucson -- but make no mistake, Johnson is tailor-made for the NBA. At a long 6-foot-7 and 245 lbs., he has a rock-solid power game with the ability to instantly defend multiple slots, a trait that will endear him to Pistons head coach Stan Van Gundy.Don't forget that Johnson won four straight California Interscholastic Federation state crowns in high school. Then again, he shot a measly 7-26 from the floor and averaged 7 points per game in Arizona's NCAA Tournament run -- excluding one game against a hapless 15th seed, Texas Southern. Without question, he will be asked to score right away, but ultimately ball handling and creative capacity will determine the type of rookie season Johnson has. Both were areas where he struggled in college, and his finishing ability was generally unimpressive. But summer league showed a more polished Johnson, particularly his willingness to run pick-and-roll, not to mention shoot the 3 (42 percent). He has already emerged as a bona fide dark horse contender for Rookie of the Year.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter @Schultz_Report and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report.Also on HuffPost:"
4,WOMEN,Fox Invites 'Panel Of Dads' To Judge Whether Women Should Wear Leggings,Cavan Sieczkowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-panel-of-dads-leggings_us_562faf73e4b06317990f95ed,This seems like a very productive use of time.,2015-10-27,Anchor Asks Why A Muslim Would Write About Christianity,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f872e614000021001b53d6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"For some inexplicable reason, Fox News thought it was a good idea to have a ""panel of dads"" on to discuss whether women should wear leggings while various women modeled different leggings for them. ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Steve Doocy led a riveting discussion Tuesday including ""Duck Dynasty"" star Willie Robertson, Fox's legal analyst Arthur Aidala and Andrew Sansone, the husband of Fox News' Julie Banderas.

""Willie, are you comfortable with the women in your life parading in public in leggings?"" Doocy asked. ""Because they ain't pants."" It all went downhill from there. Some lowlights included: Aidala saying ""if it's not worn in the monastery, it's not worn out on the street;"" Doocy asking the leggings model if she has any tattoos; and commentary about her physique.

5,POLITICS,Coal State Senators Look To Block Obama's Climate Rules,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senators-resist-clean-power-plan_us_562fd704e4b00aa54a4b9dae,"""There's a war on coal in America,"" says Mitch McConnell, ""and the leader is the president of the United States.""",2015-10-27,Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other senators are fighting the Environmental Protection Agency's new Clean Power Plan.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Coal state senators from both parties are trying to derail the Obama administration's new emissions regulations for coal-fired power plants.Sens. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) introduced a measure on Tuesday that would prevent emissions limits for existing power plants from taking effect, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) introduced another measure to block the limits for new power plants.The Obama administration's Environmental Protection Agency released the final rules for new and existing power plants, which it calls the ""Clean Power Plan,"" in August. Under the plan, each state must meet an EPA-set emissions limit, but can develop its own plans to meet that limit. The rules were published in the Federal Register last Friday. The plan, Heitkamp said in a floor speech Tuesday, ""threatens the supply of abundant, affordable, and reliable electricity"" in her state and across the country.""There's a war on coal in America,"" said McConnell, ""and the leader is the president of the United States."" To resist the new rules, the senators are using the Congressional Review Act, a little-used provision that allows Congress to overturn executive branch regulations within 60 days of their publication in the Federal Register. A CRA measure only needs a simple majority to pass -- and in the Republican-controlled Senate, the group will probably get that -- but McConnell acknowledged Tuesday that Obama would likely veto the senators' attempt, and they don't have the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.The majority leader, who has also been working to convince world leaders that the U.S. is not serious about committing to an international climate agreement, also downplayed the importance of cutting emissions in the U.S. Doing so, he said, would have ""as much impact as dropping a pebble in the ocean, and yet we're paying a real price for it here at home.""McConnell has previously avoided answering the question of whether or not greenhouse gas emissions generated by burning fossil fuels cause climate change, stating that he is ""not a scientist.""While the majority of Senate Republicans and a handful of Democrats like Heitkamp and Manchin would likely vote for the measures, some other vulnerable moderates are backing the administration's climate efforts. Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) came out in support of the rules on Sunday, breaking from party leadership."

That's barely a tick up from the average of $28,400 that the class of 2013 had, according to last year's report from TICAS. Last year's report also showed only one state -- New Mexico -- had graduates who on average owed less than $20,000 in debt. This year, both New Mexico and Utah made the cut. Still, TICAS found the class of 2014 graduated with a record high amount of debt.""Student debt has rightly become a major policy issue,"" said TICAS President Lauren Asher in a statement. ""Students and families need better information and better policies to make college more affordable and debt less burdensome.""The report included which states have graduates with the highest and lowest amount of debt.

I think it is too late,"" Meadows said of the current Nov. 3 deadline to lift the debt limit. ""So I don't see that as something that happens this time, but I do see that potentially in all future debt ceiling negotiations.""The three lawmakers said they wanted to work with Ryan on process reforms that would allow them to get a much earlier start on future fiscal deadlines to demand spending cuts and reforms to federal benefits programs such as Social Security and Medicare. This way, they would not be trying to craft a strategy at the last minute with default or government shutdowns looming in the balance.They said, however, that they would not vote for a ""clean"" debt ceiling extension this week without some concessions on spending or benefits programs.Mulvaney, from South Carolina, said the debt ceiling negotiations were typical of big deals during Boehner's reign in the House, negotiated behind closed doors with little input from Republican members.""This is going the way that the current leadership wants it to go. Paul (Ryan) probably won't be blamed for whatever happens tomorrow, because it's clearly Boehner's baby.""However, he said Ryan's first big test would be a spending bill to keep government agencies open past a current shutdown deadline of Dec. 11. This would have to produce ""at least something better than we would have gotten under Mr. Boehner.""Mulvaney said that in his view, that would mean not raising any discretionary spending caps without an equal amount of spending cuts elsewhere.(Additional Reporting by Susan Cornwell, Andy Sullivan, Kevin Drawbaugh and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Sandra Maler)Also on HuffPost:"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/562e8eed140000e800c7ae03.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc applied Monday to U.S. regulators for permission to test drones for home delivery, curbside pickup and checking warehouse inventories, a sign it plans to go head-to-head with Amazon in using drones to fill and deliver online orders.The world's largest retailer by revenue has for several months been conducting indoor tests of small unmanned aircraft systems – the term regulators use for drones - and is now seeking for the first time to test the machines outdoors. It plans to use drones manufactured by China's SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd.In addition to having drones take inventory of trailers outside its warehouses and perform other tasks aimed at making its distribution system more efficient, Wal-Mart is asking the Federal Aviation Administration for permission to research drone use in ""deliveries to customers at Walmart facilities, as well as to consumer homes,"" according to a copy of the application reviewed by Reuters.The move comes as Amazon, Google and other companies test drones in the expectation that the FAA will soon establish rules for their widespread commercial use. FAA Deputy Administrator Michael Whitaker said in June that the agency expected to finalize regulations within the next 12 months, faster than previously planned. The FAA has not set rules yet that would allow for the commercial use of drones.Amazon has said it would be ready to begin delivering packages to customers via drones as soon as federal rules allow.Wal-Mart spokesman Dan Toporek said the company would move quickly to deploy drones depending on its tests and regulations.""Drones have a lot of potential to further connect our vast network of stores, distribution centers, fulfillment centers and transportation fleet,"" he said. ""There is a Walmart within five miles of 70 percent of the U.S. population, which creates some unique and interesting possibilities for serving customers with drones.""Finding ways to more efficiently warehouse, transport and deliver goods to customers has taken on new importance for Wal-Mart, which this month projected a surprise decline in earnings next year as it copes with costs to increase wages, beat back price competition and boost online sales.In the FAA application, Wal-Mart said it wanted to test drones for taking stock of trailers and other items in the parking lot of a warehouse using electronic tagging and other methods. A Wal-Mart distribution center could have hundreds of trailers waiting in its yard, and a drone could potentially be used to quickly account for what each one is holding.The retailer also wants to test drones for its grocery pickup service, which it has recently expanded to 23 markets with plans to add another 20 markets next year. The test flights would confirm whether a drone could deliver a package to a pick-up point in the parking lot of a store, the application says.Wal-Mart also said it wants to test home delivery in small residential neighborhoods after obtaining permission from those living in the flight path. The test would see if a drone could be deployed from a truck ""to safely deliver a package at a home and then return safely to the same,"" the application says.(Reporting by Nathan Layne, editing by Eric Effron and John Pickering)MORE ON HUFFPOST:"

15,SPORTS,Here's Why We Need To Stop Criticizing LeBron James,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-defense-of-lebron-james_us_562695b9e4b08589ef494e6a,No one is more clutch than this man.,2015-10-26,The 30-year-old James is the first player in NBA history to have reached the finals' five consecutive times.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LeBron James will always have his detractors. That's the nature of being an elite, generational type of player, who also happened to leave Cleveland for Miami in the way he did. But times are changing, and with James' 31st birthday just a couple of months away, it's time for us to turn the page on the unjust criticism of one of the game's all-time players. Keep reading to find out why. (And you can see more NBA previews here and here.)Mr. ClutchFive straight NBA Finals appearances is something that not even Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Magic Johnson have accomplished. In fact, in the nearly 70-year history of the league, LeBron is only the 10th player to have achieved the feat, and the first since Bill Russell in 1966. For a guy whose clutch gene has been incessantly questioned for a decade, it's hard to argue with such standout numbers. Go back to his first stint with Cleveland, when James' second-best player was Mo Williams and he was flanked by Sasha Pavlovic and Daniel Gibson in the backcourt.Whether or not you agreed with his decision to join Miami in 2010, you can't argue the facts: James has been sensational in the finals, and maybe at no point more so than this year, when he became the first player ever to lead his team in points, rebounds and assists, according to ESPN Stats & Info. In addition, James has now made four go-ahead shots in the ""final seconds"" of playoffs games, per ESPN Stats & Info. Over the past 15 years, nobody has made more. He is clutch -- there's simply no reasonable way to argue otherwise.Minutes MachineBefore last season, James altered his entire diet and workout regimen in the belief that he needed to be leaner and, in turn, put less stress on his body. What came next was the lowest minute total of his career, but also his second-highest assist clip. At just 30 years old, the four-time MVP has already logged more minutes than Johnson, Larry Bird, Jerry West, Clyde Drexler or Steve Nash, per HoopsHype. Moreover, when compared to Carmelo Anthony -- another member of the infamous 2003 draft class -- James has nearly 11,000 more minutes. To be fair, James has enjoyed significantly more postseason success -- hence more games and minutes. At some point, he'll have the opportunity to surpass Abdul-Jabbar for most minutes ever played. And it's not as if James doesn't take a massive beating: His 8.5 free-throw career attempts per game slot him near the top of the previous decade.Changing A CulturePersonnel matters -- nobody disagrees with that -- but so does culture. How many guys can legitimately change the culture of a franchise? We've seen it with Dan Quinn, head coach of the Atlanta Falcons. For a player, it's even more of a lift. But James is precisely that guy. Amid the Cavs' 1-2 start to last season, I wrote about the team needing to discover its identity. And James spoke about it as well.""We have to understand what it takes to win,"" he said. ""It's going to be a long process, man. There's been a lot of losing basketball around here for a few years. So a lot of guys that are going to help us win ultimately haven't played a lot of meaningful basketball games in our league.""It's not merely the wins and losses with James. He is also the definitive leader of any team he plays on. His presence alone changes the culture. When his relationships with both Erik Spoelstra and David Blatt were under fire, his teams suffered. When those relationships improved -- e.g. the second half of the season -- the result was sustained playoff success. The same can be said about 2015: The Cavs enter year two under Blatt, and the second year of their Big Three. How James handles Blatt and how he handles his massive leadership responsibility is only trumped by the culture change. The Cavaliers have never won a world championship. Maybe they do this year and maybe they don't, but having LeBron as the definitive face of the organization might be equally important.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report."

According to a Gallup poll released on Monday, just 17 percent of Americans said they supported the tea party -- a drop of 15 percentage points since the movement's peak in November 2010, when 32 percent of respondents supported it. Meanwhile, a record 54 percent of Americans polled this month said they didn't have an opinion about the tea party either way. In 2010, 52 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they supported the tea party movement. In combined polls from 2014 and 2015, however, only 32 percent of them did so. In the same period, support among conservative Republicans -- still the tea party's biggest supporters -- decreased by 21 points, and support among moderate and liberal Republicans fell by 15 points.Liberal Democrats' opposition to the tea party remains nearly as high as it was in 2010, dropping just two points to 59 percent in the latest combined polls. They continue to be the group most opposed to the movement.More respondents with postgraduate degrees also said they opposed the tea party: While 36 percent opposed the movement in 2010, 53 percent did so in 2014 and 2015. Meanwhile, more Americans ages 18-29, as well as those with low incomes and single women, said that they neither supported nor opposed the movement.Less support for the tea party could signal a decline in its influence and impact on American politics, noted Gallup's Jim Norman. Still, the 2016 presidential election could also inspire more Americans to move from the neutral camp and take sides, the polling agency said.Gallup surveyed 1,015 adults nationally, using live interviews via landlines and cell phones, on Oct. 7 through 11."

Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) came out in favor of the Obama administration's effort to cut carbon pollution by power plants on Sunday, bucking Senate leadership that has worked to derail the emissions plan.The Obama administration announced final regulations on emissions from both new and existing power plants in August. Dubbed the Clean Power Plan, the rules are part of the administration's larger push to curb emissions that cause climate change. The Clean Power Plan has faced opposition from many conservative politicians. In supporting the rules, Ayotte cited the work her state has already done to reduce emissions.""After carefully reviewing this plan and talking with members of our business community, environmental groups, and other stakeholders, I have decided to support the Clean Power Plan to address climate change through clean energy solutions that will protect our environment,"" she said in a statement on Sunday. ""New Hampshire is already well on its way to meet the goals of the Clean Power Plan through positive steps it has already taken. I will carefully monitor implementation of the plan to make sure there is sufficient flexibility for New Hampshire to meet its goals and that the plan does not have an adverse impact on Granite State energy costs.""Ayotte noted that her state is a member of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a partnership of Northeastern states to reduce their emissions, and ""is on track to meet its goals."" She also pointed out that New Hampshire-based businesses such as beer maker Smuttynose and apparel company Timberland support the power plant plan.While Ayotte has received a mediocre rating from environmentalists since entering the Senate in 2011, she has taken a moderate stance on climate change. She was one of just five Republican senators to endorse an amendment earlier this year stating that climate change is real and ""human activity significantly contributes"" to it.Ayotte is up for re-election in 2016 and expects to face a tough challenge. New Hampshire's popular Democratic governor, Maggie Hassan, announced earlier this month that she intends to run against the incumbent senator."
