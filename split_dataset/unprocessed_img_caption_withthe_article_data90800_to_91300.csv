Low-Cost Preventative Treatments Could Change That",Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/world-malaria-day_n_7138192.html,,2015-04-25,"A girl holds her younger brother who is currently treated for malaria and dehydration at the Al Sabbah Children's hospital in Juba on October 14, 2014. The government of South Sudans integrated response to the nutrition emergency, the South Sudan National and State Ministry of Health, Sanitation and Environment, UNICEF and WFP are starting a mass-screening campaign to reach over 600,000 children in high-burden, non-conflict affected states - Juba, Warrap and Northern Bahr-Ghazal.

Through malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment, 4.3 million lives were saved between 2001 and 2013, according to UNICEF. Still, more than half a million people died from the disease in 2013, and the vast majority of the cases occurred in Africa. To bring the death figures down even further, and nearly eradicate the issue in the next 15 years, the World Health Organization (WHO) is now urging for a more aggressive approach to prevention and treatment.WHO now recommends diagnostic testing for all suspected malaria cases to make sure that malaria drugs are solely dispensed to patients who have contracted the disease. The group also recommends that the most susceptible groups, which includes pregnant women, children under 5 and infants, get preventative treatments. Strategies to protect pregnant women from malaria, for example, cost less 50 cents for the full course of four doses, according to UNICEF. Eliminating malaria could save economies $270 billion in sub-Saharan Africa alone.While the situation is grim in some areas, advocates say they feel bolstered by recent innovations.The world’s first malaria vaccine -- a shot designed for children in Africa -- could be approved by international regulators as soon as October, according to Reuters. Another key prevention tactic may lie in simple LED lights.A new study published in the Royal Society found that all arthropods analyzed (including mosquitoes) were significantly less attracted to customized LED lighting than fluorescent lighting. A number of advocacy groups have also done a tremendous job in dispensing protective nets, which keep mosquitoes from preying on humans. Since 2000, more than half a billion such nets have been sent to Africa, according to The New York Times. However, on-the-ground advocates remain concerned about how these life-saving nets are being misused in a number of African countries.In Mozambique, Nigeria, Uganda and elsewhere, some people are so desperate for food that they use the nets for fishing, the Times reported. Others fear that the nets are poisoned and can lead to impotence. Despite such setbacks, advocates remain hopeful that the disease will come to a relatively swift end. In November, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates committed to increasing the budget for his foundation’s malaria program by 30 percent to more than $200 million per year. One of his goals includes developing a drug or vaccine that purges the malaria parasite in people who carry the disease, but don’t express any symptoms, the Associated Press reported. ""I really do believe that malaria can be eradicated in my lifetime,"" Gates told the AP.  Like Us On Facebook   Follow Us On Twitter  "

Here's their story, in their own words...""I was a schoolteacher for 30 years,"" Peg begins. ""For 20 of those years, I taught hormonally stressed adolescents. When I retired in 2008, I was ready for an adventure.""""The good news was that Peg had a teacher's pension to retire on,"" April continues. ""I'd worked my whole life, too, but I had no pension. That meant the two of us would be retiring on the income of a single teacher's pension.""Then we went to a neighborhood party,"" April explains, ""and a friend had just gotten back from Uruguay. He was talking about a waterfront community there for expats.""I asked him: What's an expat? I'd never heard the word before. The next day, Peg got on the computer and started researching the idea,"" April says.""I found an article by a lady called Kathleen Peddicord,"" Peg says, ""and I saw an ad for her book, 'How To Retire Overseas.' Twenty minutes later, I was in line in Barnes and Noble buying the book.""When April came home from work that day, I told her, 'I've figured it out. We're going to retire to another country,"" Peg says.""I showed her the book and told her it was the answer for us. She took a little persuading but not a lot. We both got really excited about the idea from the start.""""The trouble,"" April continues, ""was that we had no idea where to go. We knew we needed someplace cheap because we had only the small, fixed income. And we needed someplace safe. Safety was critical for us. We were two women thinking about making this move on our own. We also wanted good health care and easy access to the States for visits with family.""We'd been to Costa Rica. In our research, Panama  and Uruguay got our attention. We decided Uruguay was too far and Costa Rica was too expensive. So we focused on Panama.""""April was still working, but I was retired, so I was spending all day every day researching Panama,"" Peg explained. ""I mean, I was on this! ""Online I stumbled onto two development projects in Pedasí. I contacted both developers and started conversations. One of them had me convinced after one day that if I didn't buy right then, right away, the opportunity would be gone. ""So that night when April got home, I said, 'OK, we're buying this lot. And we need to move quickly. But don't worry. I got this. We just need to send 20 percent of the money tomorrow...""April looked at me as though I'd lost my mind. 'We're not buying anything until we've seen it first!'"" she told me.""The next day, April went to work, and I was back online. This time I found and a link to a development in another part of Panama, in Veraguas. The developer was offering an excursion tour.""Well, April told me we should go see for ourselves, I thought... and so I signed us up,"" Peg says.""That night when I walked through the door,"" April remembers, ""Peg told me she'd booked us a trip to Panama in two weeks. Fine, I told her, but we're leaving the checkbook at home.""""That was February 2011,"" Peg continues. ""We traveled with a group of six other people out to see the property on the Veraguas coast. It was jungle. There was no road. We hiked in with machetes in hand. I was like, 'where's the beach house?' These were very early days. There was nothing there yet. But we loved it. It was amazingly beautiful. We were sold.""""We didn't have our checkbook, but we did have PayPal. We bought a building lot on the spot. We were moving to Panama.""""Then we went back home,"" April continues, ""and we told our families what we'd done. They all thought we'd lost our minds. The enormity of what we'd set in motion began to settle in.""We'd both lived in the United States our whole lives, but neither of us had seen more than a handful of states. Now we were leaving. ""So I had a great idea,"" April says. ""We'd take a year to tour our home country before moving to a new one. We bought a fifth-wheel RV and drove from coast to coast, seeing almost every state.""""Now, neither of us had ever driven anything like this in our lives,"" Peg adds, ""but the salesman told us we could do it!""What a trip that was. We had three flat tires and got rammed and then stranded in Massachusetts for six weeks. One morning we woke up and a tire was gone. We still don't know where it went.""We didn't plan it this way, but that trip was great preparation for our move to Panama in every possible way. We learned how to travel, how to keep in touch, how to keep up with mail, how to live in a small space with only bare necessities, and how to rely on ourselves for everything. We learned how to problem solve on the fly. We had no choice. ""And that's what life is like here in Panama. You just have to figure it out. ""After that year on the road in the States, we were ready. We began getting all our documents together and facing the practical logistics of a move like this. How would we get ourselves, our stuff, our two dogs, and our two cats to Panama? How much luggage should we plan for? What should we bring with us?""""We made a deal that we'd each bring four suitcases,"" April explains. ""Peg packed all her knives and kitchen things. I packed high heels and winter clothes.""""She's used my stuff way more than I've used her stuff,"" Peg says.""Our pets were the biggest problem,"" April continues. ""Finally, we thought we had everything figured out, but then we found out that the cage for one of the dogs was too big for the plane and that the cats had to go cargo, not in the cabin. Then we found out that, if a plane is too full, they can bump the animals, even at the last minute, no notice. In the end, we hired a pet relocation company and were glad we did.""Finally, we were all in Panama.""""We decided to begin our new lives with some language study,"" Peg explains. ""We found a Spanish immersion program in Pedasí, so that's where we went first. Pedasí is a nice little town on the east coast of Panama's Azuero Peninsula. We found a cute local house that we rented for $600 per month. This was very basic living. No hot water, no oven, no washing machine, no closets, no TV...""It was simple and basic, but we loved it. We had a great time.""After a few months in Pedasí learning Spanish, we were ready to move closer to the place where we planned to build our house. We moved first to Santa Fé, which is a beautiful mountain town in Veraguas, then, recently, we moved to Palo Seco, which is where you'll find us until our house is finished. We broke ground last week, and we couldn't be more excited. ""We never could have predicted that this new life in Panama would be our retirement. Years ago, we never would have imagined this. It's been a great big incredible adventure, and we're really only just getting started.""Related articles:Living, Investing, Retiring, And Starting A Business In PanamaHow To Get A Tourist Visa For Travel In PanamaInternational Living And Investing In PanamaEarlier on Huff/Post50:"
2,POLITICS,Senate's Proposed 2016 Budget Turns a Deaf Ear to the Needs of Young Families,"Aline Gubrium and Elizabeth L. Krause, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senates-proposed-2016-budget-turns-a-deaf-ear-to-the-needs-of-young-families_b_7138980.html,"Some of the nation's most vulnerable families are headed by young parents, many who juggle poverty-level wages and social shaming. From homelessness and housing insecurity to violence and abuse, these young families face hardships that should be at the top of our nation's agenda.",2015-04-25,A politician counting money in front of the US Capitol Building,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f3f5200000f90101dc09.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As Congress gears up to pass a new federal budget, the proposed Senate Budget outlines cuts to a number of social equalizers, such as education, health and housing. The plan proposed by the Senate not only maintains the Budget Control Act's current cuts but proposes cutting an additional $236 billion in non-defense discretionary spending over the next 10 years. Without providing specifics, the plan proposes cutting $4.3 trillion to mandatory spending programs including Medicaid and food stamps over the next 10 years.Yet in the midst of the cacophony of budget balancing, the voices of young parents and their families are virtually absent from these conversations -- and their needs often lost in this fray.Some of the nation's most vulnerable families are headed by young parents, many who juggle poverty-level wages and social shaming. From homelessness and housing insecurity to violence and abuse, these young families face hardships that should be at the top of our nation's agenda to solve, rather than in the budget shredder.There is no powerful lobbying arm for young parents, and it is easy for society to cast them aside as a cautionary tale about what might happen if teenagers become pregnant. Our research shows that stigmatizing young parents has little impact on preventing unintended teen pregnancy, yet it creates a social hostility that erects unbelievable barriers to their success. Rather than empathize with young families, Congress -- and most of society -- are more likely to relegate them unworthy.At the University of Massachusetts Amherst, we launched the Hear Our Stories project to capture the stories of young mothers and better understand their needs and desires. These young parents endure amidst heartbreaking circumstances. In contrast to what society might expect, the women speak most often about being shamed and, as a result, disenfranchised by the very people, policies and government meant to support them.Homelessness and housing insecurity are very real for young parenting women and their families. For some young mothers, access to housing and related social services becomes almost a full-time job as they manage a cyclone of requirements to obtain them. It is estimated that nearly a third of young families are homeless in Massachusetts alone.One young mother and her brother were employed when their mother found out that her Section 8 payment would increase as a result of her children's hard work, thanks to rules by the Congressional ""chastity"" bill that makes it hard for poor families to stay together. The young woman was forced to move with her baby daughter to a shelter. Her brother lived on the streets. Both eventually lost their jobs due to their tenuous housing circumstances.Another young mom found housing at a Teen Living Shelter Program (TLP), where she navigated unsupportive staff, tensions with other residents, and a sense of imprisonment. Another, also living in a shelter with her husband and child, had her young son illegally removed from her care for a prolonged period due to a paperwork mix up at the hospital.Many of our storytellers told of facing extreme violence and trauma in their lives. A staccato of violence has pierced their young lives, from childhood on.Many of the women described constant dislocation, moving around from place to place, never feeling at home. One young mother described her housing situation as ""all this scribble scrabble everywhere,"" when asked if she could map the places she has lived. Instead of the loud reverberations of inequality that incessantly pervades their lives, most women just asked for a quiet place for their families to call home.Stories like these illustrate the complex web of requirements vulnerable families already face as they work to support their families. Families need greater access--not increased barriers--to resources.As the Congress works to create a reasonable budget, surely these are not the families that should be abandoned. Congress must provide opportunities for young families and organizations that advocate for young families to provide testimony so that they know and understand the devastating impact of these cuts in their lives as they contemplate budget allocations. These families' voices and experiences matter.Lifting up the safety, dignity and hope of our most vulnerable families should be our greatest priority, not our disposable remnants."

They also hit Baiji, Iraq's largest refinery last week.Late on Friday, the insurgents attacked the security perimeter at al-Thirthar dam with explosive-laden vehicles and then battled army forces in clashes that continued on Saturday, police and army sources told Reuters.Dozens of Iraqi troops were killed in the fighting, but poor communications in the area made it difficult to confirm a precise figure, said Athal al-Fahdawi, an Anbar provincial council member. Army sources said two senior officers were among the dead.Officials from Iraq's defense and interior ministries could not immediately be reached for comment.Security forces and Shi'ite paramilitaries have regained some ground in Iraq since Islamic State proclaimed a caliphate straddling the border of Syria and Iraq, but core Sunni territories such as Anbar remain under Islamic State control.A video posted online on Saturday by Islamic State's official media organization appeared to show its fighters moving about freely at al-Thirthar dam, which serves as a flood control for Baghdad and other cities.A black flag commonly used by the militants is seen flying from a radio tower.

She never wore much makeup, but she always had a beautiful haircut and regularly went in for highlights. I have always followed her example, and when I worry that it may not be wise to spend a small fortune on my hair, I remember how great she looked. If you can buy yourself a little self-assurance, it is always money well spent."" --Elizabeth Angell, articles editor""My mother's most important piece of advice: 'Take care of your neck. You never think of your neck until it's too late.' So now I always moisturize it."" --Alexandra Tunell, beauty assistant""My mom's word of advice with diet: 'Everything in moderation.' At 61, she's still thin, which is in part thanks to good genes, and also because of her eating habits. She's not a health nut by a long stretch. Actually, by any stretch. She loves ice cream, potato chips, and the occasional apple-tini or Guinness stout. She doesn't deny herself sweets or snacks--she just doesn't overdo them. Definitely something I've stuck to over the years.""  --Sophia Panych, digital beauty editor""When I was growing up, my mom would always tell me, 'Keep your hands off your face!

I finally started listening to her advice, and my skin is thanking me for it.""  --Lindsay Colameo, assistant digital editor""While most children try to wiggle away from their parents as they slather them with sunscreen at the beach, I never did. My mother has survived malignant melanoma twice, and the best beauty advice she ever gave me was to stay out of the sun (which was hard as a child in South Florida!), never even think of using tanning oil, and to wear sunscreen every single day. I now make sure almost all of my products have SPF--my morning moisturizer, my BB cream, and even my lip balm."" --Jenna Rosenstein, beauty writer""Use a good body lotion every single time you shower, no excuses. Do it as soon as you get out, especially in the winter."" --Grace Clarke, assistant editor""My favorite beauty advice my mother ever gave me--and that I believe she lifted from Jackie O.--was to dedicate one night a week at home to take care of yourself. Paint your nails, whiten your teeth, use a face mask, deep-condition your hair, whatever it is you do, while listening to music or watching TV or anything else you enjoy. Whenever I tell her about my hectic schedule, she likes to remind me of this one."" --Alexandra Owens, assistant editor""My mom always taught me not to overtweeze or wax my eyebrows. She has always liked the look of fuller brows, and I went through much of my teen years with too-far-apart, too thin brows. She (thankfully) wouldn't let me tweeze them quite as much as I wanted to.

Other stores were limited in the types of transactions they could make, some accepting only cash, or mobile payments.Approximately 7,000 U.S. stores and 1,000 in Canada were affected by the outage, Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson told the Associated Press.""The point of sale cash registers are down in the U.S. and Canada.

The barista said each customer could get one tall drink. This did not appear to be the case at other locations. Some were reportedly giving away multiple drinks or of larger sizes.By 9:30 p.m. PT, Starbucks' computer system was back in action the company said in a statement. The outage was caused by a failure during a daily system refresh, and also affected Starbucks' Evolution Fresh and Teavana stores.But it wasn't all free drinks during the hours-long outage, as some Starbucks locations posted signs saying they were closed due to the computer glitch.The outage came a day after Starbucks reported strong sales and profits, beating Wall Street's expectations.

They did so knowing that while Pakistan's security vacuum and Weinstein's visibility likely were factors in the militants'  kidnapping of Weinstein in August 2011, it was the aid worker's own government that eventually killed him. The Obama administration did so in January when it targeted the al Qaeda compound where he and Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto were being held hostage.""I was really hoping that the Pakistani government or the U.S. would stand by this guy, but the reality is if you remember his last video, he felt abandoned and forgotten by his own government,"" said Raza Rumi, a prominent Pakistani journalist serving as a visiting fellow at the National Endowment for Democracy in Washington. Rumi, who was referring to an al Qaeda video released around Christmas 2013, in which the U.S. hostage appeared to say he felt ""abandoned,"" told HuffPost he got to know Weinstein when the two were part of a consortium of development consultants in Pakistan's Punjab province from 2008 to 2011.""Warren was this jovial, lighthearted, fun guy who would wear [the local outfit of a] shalwar kamiz, speak Urdu, joke around,"" Rumi said. ""And I would tell him, 'Warren, you need to be careful.' He said, ""I feel safe, I feel integrated."" The question of how Weinstein's death could have been avoided is sparking debate both in the U.S. and Pakistan. Weinstein's wife said in a statement on Thursday that ""those who took Warren captive over three years ago bear ultimate responsibility."" But she said she was disappointed in the governments of both countries for failing to rescue him after he was kidnapped from his home in the Pakistani city of Lahore in August 2011. She added that she would like U.S.-Pakistan relations -- which have been improving in recent months -- to be ""reflective of how [Pakistan] prioritizes situations such as these.” Rumi said the risks for the aid worker became clearer as anti-American sentiment grew in Pakistan, following the killing of two civilians in Lahore by a CIA contractor in January 2011 and the Osama bin Laden raid, which Pakistanis saw as a breach of their sovereignty, that May. Some had already been speaking ill of Weinstein, Rumi added, questioning his reasons for being in Pakistan, looking askance at his Jewish faith and alleging that he was a spy.The Pakistani friends of Weinstein who spoke with The Huffington Post said they were, instead, impressed with his sincerity.""He had this remarkable ability to bring people around a table and make them agree,"" said Khawaja, the bureaucrat, explaining that the work he and Weinstein were doing involved convincing small and medium-sized Pakistani businesses to cooperate to boost their industries. ""He could talk at any level and was very flexible in dealing with people,"" Khawaja continued. He said Weinstein had been known to don the native shalwar kameez and eat meals with drivers and security guards -- quite the statement in a class-ridden society where elites often shed overt connections to local custom. Rumi recalled Weinstein's social side, which led him to travel around Pakistan to visit friends in different cities.The aid worker could play the host, too. Khawaja recalled Weinstein's wife and one of his two daughters traveling to Pakistan and visiting the bureaucrat's home.""Warren developed a special connection with the country and a deep and profound respect for its people and culture,"" Elaine Weinstein, his wife, wrote in a 2014 essay for Newsweek Pakistan. ""He also saw just how significantly his work -- to help the Pakistani people strengthen their industries. ... When he visited us at home in the United States, he spoke highly of Pakistan and urged friends and family to visit him there so they could see and experience the country’s warmth and beauty firsthand.""She continued with a direct appeal to the people of her husband's temporary home.""I know,"" she wrote, ""that the kidnappers who took Warren from his home and are holding him away from his family and those he so dearly loves do not represent you. As the third anniversary of his abduction nears, I hope the customs of hospitality, protection, respect and honor that you afforded Warren -- and that he did his utmost to return in kind -- will continue to be granted to him.""Khawaja said he was directly involved in talking to the Pakistani authorities about saving Weinstein, whose situation became more desperate because of concerns about his heart condition and asthma. Freeing hostages thought to be held by extremist groups has proved difficult, he added, noting that the son of former Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani  remains in captivity.The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that part of the effort to win Weinstein's freedom included the payment in of $250,000 to al Qaeda in 2012, negotiated through a Pakistani intermediary.Asked how he felt about learning that Weinstein had been killed by his own country after all, Khawaja said he was ""impressed, very, very impressed"" that President Barack Obama offered a personal apology to the families of Weinstein and Lo Porto, the Italian hostage.""Frankly, in such circumstances, there are at times collateral damages. At times you do have intelligence failures too,"" Khawaja added.""I'll remember him as a very good friend and a very committed, devoted development expert, very genuinely trying to help the people of Pakistan.""Nick Robins-Early contributed reporting."

High contrast seems to suit this sort of thing.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14a7f240000d30b51b8f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If America ends up at war, it almost certainly will be on behalf of one ally or another. Washington collects allies like most people collect Facebook ""friends."" The vast majority of U.S. allies are security liabilities, tripwires for conflict and war.Perhaps even worse, American officials constantly abase themselves, determined to reassure the very countries which the U.S. is defending at great cost and risk. Indeed, America's most hawkish politicians, who routinely posture like reincarnations of Winston Churchill, routinely talk of sacrificing U.S. lives, wealth, and security for the benefit of other nations. For instance, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fl.) recently worried, ""What ally around the world can feel safe in their alliance with us?"" The more relevant question should be with what ally can America feel safe?Instead of relentlessly collecting more international dependents, Washington policymakers should drop Allies In Name Only (AINOs). The U.S. should return to a more traditional standard for alliances: Join with other nations only when doing so advances American security. Alas, that rarely is the case today.Indeed, contra the scare-mongering of hawkish politicians such as Sen. Rubio and his GOP compatriots, the strategic environment today is remarkably benign for the U.S. The world is messy, to be sure, but that's always been the case. The number of big conflicts is down. More important, America faces no hegemonic threat or peer competitor and is allied with every major industrialized state other than China and Russia.All of Washington's recent wars have been over -- from America's standpoint -- unimportant, indeed, sometimes frivolous stakes. The Islamic State, Libya and Iraq were regional problems for U.S. allies with minimal impact on America. Iran and North Korea are ugly actors, but mostly for Washington's dependents. The two would face destruction if they attacked America. The latest crisis du jour, Yemen, worries Riyadh but is not even a speed bump for the globe's sole superpower. Yet Washington now is involved in another sectarian proxy war through its totalitarian ""ally"" Saudi Arabia.Terrorism remains a genuine threat, but falls far short of the sort of existential danger posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Worse, terrorism typically is a response to foreign intervention and occupation. Washington has inadvertently encouraged terrorism by backing authoritarian regimes, joining foreign conflicts, and creating enemies overseas. America has done some of the worst damage to itself when protecting the interests of allies -- fighting their wars, killing their enemies, backing their campaigns, advancing their interests.Adding unnecessary allies obviously makes this problem worse. In Ukraine, for instance, the Obama administration is under pressure to treat a non-ally as an ally -- arming and/or defending Russia's neighbor -- which would yield a proxy war with Russia, a nuclear-armed state which considers border security a vital interest. Bringing Ukraine (and Georgia) into NATO would be even more dangerous, inviting a geopolitical game of chicken over minimal stakes. Neither country has ever been considered even a marginal security concern of America. In contrast, both were long ruled by Moscow, which sees their links to the West as a form of encirclement, capping the extension of NATO up to Russia's borders.Of course, both nations have been treated unfairly and badly by Moscow. But that doesn't justify a military alliance with the U.S. Alliances should be based on interest, not charity. They should not be an end, an independent security interest, but a means to an end, to protect America. Adding troubled states with limited military capabilities and unresolved conflicts turns the purpose of alliances on their head.The U.S. long eschewed alliances and other ""foreign entanglements,"" against which George Washington had warned. Even in World War I, a foolish imperial slugfest of no concern to America, Woodrow Wilson brought in the U.S. only as an ""associated power."" Popular and congressional opposition then prevented Wilson from guaranteeing the allied powers' post-war territorial seizures. Nevertheless, Washington's involvement was a catastrophic mistake, making possible the Versailles Treaty, which turned out to be only a generational truce before the combatants returned to fight a second and far bloodier round.The extraordinary circumstances of World War II led to a genuine and justifiable alliance. During the Cold War the U.S. created what were intended to be temporary alliances. This policy was justified by the vulnerability of America's war-ravaged friends and hostility of the great communist powers, China and the Soviet Union. But even Dwight Eisenhower warned against turning the Europeans into permanent dependents. It makes no sense for Washington to retain responsibility for defending a continent with a larger economy and population than America -- and vastly greater resources than its only serious potential threat, Russia.Much the same has happened in Asia, which Washington filled with allies after World War II. Even as Japan became the world's second economic power Tokyo relied on the American military. South Korea now has 40 times the GDP and twice the population of the North, yet Washington is responsible for the South's defense. The problem is not just wasted resources, but tripwires for war. Alliances deter, but they also ensure involvement if deterrence fails, as it often does. And lending smaller states the services of a superpower's military changes their behavior, causing them to be more confrontational, even reckless. America and China aren't likely to come to blows over, say, Hawaii, which Beijing has no intention of attacking. But conflict could erupt over irrelevant allied territorial disputes, such as the Senkaku Islands and Scarborough Reef, claimed by Japan and the Philippines, respectively, and China.Unfortunately, commitments to marginal allies determine basic U.S. defense strategy. Should America be prepared to fight one, one and a half, two, or more wars at once? These prospective conflicts invariably involve allies, not America directly. After all, what state can actually harm the U.S.? Other than Russia (and to a much more limited degree China) with its ICBMs, there is none. If war comes, it will involve Korea, Japan, the Persian Gulf, or Europe. The greater the number of dependent allies, the larger the number of possible wars. But when the interests involved are unimportant and the nations involved are capable of defending themselves, why is Washington sacrificing its people's lives and wealth for other states?The U.S. should start defenestrating AINOs. Most of these nations would remain close. With all of them commerce should be free, culture should be shared, people should be friends, and governments should cooperate. In some cases military coordination may be called for, when the U.S. and other nations share vital objectives.However, Washington should stop defending South Korea. With an overwhelming resource advantage, the South should deter North Korean adventurism and build cooperative regional relationships to preserve security in Northeast Asia. Despite historic tensions, Seoul should build ties with Japan, another American dependent which should transcend the past and create a military sufficient constrain a growing China. Washington should base relationships on equality rather than dependence.The U.S. also should end its European defense dole. Today, NATO is effectively North America and the Others. Yet the Europeans collectively are wealthier and more populous than the U.S. They should take over NATO or set up their own alliance. No doubt there still would be important occasions for Washington to work militarily with these nations, which share history and values. But they, not America, should secure Europe.Even more so the U.S. should not turn conflict-prone nations like Georgia and Ukraine into allies. Europe, not America, should protect the continent's eastern reaches and police North Africa, such as Libya. If the Europeans prefer not to pacify their neighborhood, Washington certainly shouldn't do so. Life might not be fair for Russia's immediate neighbors, but that's no reason to make them U.S. ""allies.""Washington should be particularly wary about turning less important and less democratic states into allies. America's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were misguided. Neither nation warrants a long-term security commitment or permanent military garrison. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are at most ""frenemies,"" which Washington should deal with as circumstances warrant. Americans should refuse to allow such nations to drag the U.S. into extraneous conflicts, like that in Yemen.Washington still has an interest in preventing a hostile, hegemonic power from dominating Eurasia. But that possibility isn't likely for decades to come. Russia is a declining power, despite Vladimir Putin's pretensions. Europe is unlikely to ever marry economic strength with political unity and military power, let alone direct its resources against America. India must raise its people out of poverty before it will be ready to impose its will on the international system. The People's Republic of China is most likely to become a superpower peer of America. However, the PRC remains relatively poor and faces enormous economic and political challenges. China is surrounded by states with which it has fought in the past -- and which remain interested in restraining Beijing's ambitions. The U.S. should watch warily, but act only if the PRC threatens far more than a border scrape with a well-heeled U.S. ally.America has benefitted much from its relative geographical isolation. It rarely needed allies in the past. It requires even fewer allies today. When appropriate, Washington should cooperate with like-minded states to promote shared objectives. In the rare case, the U.S. should make an alliance to advance American security. But Washington should beware allowing the tail to wag the dog. Washington should create alliances to deter and win wars, not go to war to promote and preserve alliances.Geopolitics is not a grand version of Facebook, with the objective of amassing as many ""friends"" as possible. While America's faux warriors see allies as another reason for promiscuous war-making, alliances instead should reduce the likelihood of conflict. Since most of Washington's military pacts endanger the U.S., America should be dropping, not adding, allies. This post originally appeared at Forbes online."

Why did I put myself into transition?  I saw an increasing disconnect between the 9-to-whenever world in which I was spending most of my waking hours, and the intensity of marketplace innovation. I saw a growing divide between my job, and a market calling for what I love to do most - to turn innovation into impact.I have to admit, while I pushed myself onto the street wanting in my heart to be part of something new and maybe even amazing, I faced real moments of doubt - was it crazy to give up a ""perfectly good,"" high-paying corporate gig? I also held something less than a wholehearted belief that transition itself would be a great experience. But I just had to do it. And I knew the timing was as good as it would ever be.So here's the surprise: living in transition has been one of the most rewarding times of my life. I have to admit that it has even become fun.""Let's get real,"" you are probably thinking, ""this is easy stuff to talk about, but being 'in transition' is just a nice way of saying 'being out of work.' And that's uncomfortable. It's an empty space to fill with a job - the sooner the better. It's all about identifying open positions, scheduling and going on interviews, and pacing back and forth until something hits.""But I've discovered that there is an entirely new way to define transition - a far more productive and rewarding way. Being in transition has given me the opportunity to immerse myself in all the industry goings-on, to talk to all the relevant players, to get in front of emerging trends, to open doors - essentially to create new value as a professional by gaining a deep, current understanding of market realities - and by creating and strengthening relationships.Equally important, it's given me the opportunity to share what I'm learning. To speak at conferences, engage in social media and share my knowledge with students of all ages. For all the people who are (as I was) stuck inside a corporate bureaucracy, without enough open space to keep pace with the outside world, I've become a conduit of real-time information, a source of market intelligence, and truthfully, a rather welcome visitor and resource. I've become a market connector.  What does it take to be a market connector instead of a job seeker?   For starters, it means getting comfortable with ambiguity, with the loss of structure a job, a role, a title, a company and an office provide. It also means not knowing up-front the start date for my next gig and what my business card will say, and being okay with that.But most of all it means trusting that if I focus first on learning and sharing knowledge with any and all relevant professionals around me - that exciting options and opportunities will come as a natural by-product.  ""Nice in theory,"" you say. ""I can't do that."" Well, I got to the point where I couldn't not do it, and also calculated that the time would be no longer than that of a traditional job search (and likely shorter). And, I no longer wanted to feel I was missing the amazing possibilities arising from the current technology revolution that is changing everything we do and how we do it.What has becoming a ""market connector"" allowed me to do?   • See career possibilities with clarity, well beyond the obvious  • Get out in front of trends, rather than race breathlessly to keep up • Focus on evaluating possibilities, without feeling pressure to sign on • Build incredible relationships, strengthened by sharing what I am learning • And (not unimportantly) uncover many terrific new opportunities - from advisory assignments with start-ups to full-time c-level positions at both emerging and established companies.The crazy thing is that I was the only person who needed to give me permission to do all of this. Of course it's easier to see in retrospect that I had the choice all along - and that those who have even expressed envy could probably figure out a way to follow this path. As always in life, it's about being aware of what really matters to you, and reconciling the tradeoffs to get there. When, where and how will this journey end for me?  There's no question in my mind, I am going to arrive on time at the right destination. That's because I truly experience this time of life as a point of transition. Are there moments of doubt? Certainly. But those are easily overshadowed by the ongoing exhilaration I feel by being on the right track once again. And, in my role as a market connector, I am continually opening up more and more exciting options for my future by doing things I never thought I would have been able to do, including: • Developing a proprietary, technology-driven marketing model allowing me to ""product-ize"" my expertise as a digital and customer experience innovator  • Publishing as a thought leader on leading blogging platforms including Huffington Post, LinkedIn and Insurance Thought Leadership, and compiling ideas that could someday turn into a book • Joining New York Angels gaining both a front-row view of what's next and opportunities to invest in some of the world's most talented entrepreneurs • Considering the possibility of a graduate-level teaching position  • Advising adtech, fintech, media, leadership development, and b2b software services start-ups on marketing and digital strategies  • And, evaluating full-time c-suite roles in leading media and financial services organizations, as well as senior advisory affiliations with prominent consulting firmsWhat's really terrific is the pressure is gone - my job right now is to be a great market connector, and my next career is unfolding as a result. Whether for me that means a portfolio of roles or a full-time assignment remains to be seen. For now, transition is a great place to be. Photo courtesy of www.businessbanter.com "

Hubble has four main scientific instruments that allow it to observe not only in visible light but also near ultraviolet and near infrared. Hubble helped determine how old our Universe is, what quasars are, and also helped discover ""dark energy.""  The space shuttle crew took a photo of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory as the satellite was deployed, with Earth visible beneath it. Credit: NASA/MSFCIn 1991, NASA launched a satellite into space carrying the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO). The goal of Compton was to study gamma rays from objects far out into space. Gamma ray telescopes can study incredibly exotic objects such as blazars, magnetars, cosmic rays, and dark matter. Compton operated in space until when NASA intentionally sent it into the Earth's ocean in 2000. An artist's illustration of the Chandra X-ray Observatory in space. Credit: NGST NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory is a telescope specially designed to detect X-ray emission from very hot regions of the Universe such as exploded stars, clusters of galaxies, and matter around black holes. Because X-rays are absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, Chandra must orbit above it, up to an altitude of 139,000 km (86,500 mi) in space. Chandra was launched aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia in 1999 and continues to be in excellent health and deliver incredible science over a decade and half later.  An artist's illustration of the Spitzer Space Telescope in orbit. Credit: NASA The last of the Great Observatories, the Spitzer Space Telescope, was launched into orbit in 2003. Spitzer is designed to detect infrared light, which is primarily radiation from heat. This gives Spitzer the ability to study objects like brown dwarfs (failed stars), extrasolar planets, giant clouds of gas and dust, and organic molecules that may hold the key to life in the Universe.Over the years, astronomers have used often used data from these telescopes together. Not only does this reap incredible scientific rewards, the combined datasets from the different observatories often make spectacular images that help all viewers get a more complete picture of our fascinating Universe. (Astronomers call images with different types of light ""multiwavelength"" images because each type of light encompasses different sets of wavelengths.) We think this may be a perfect example of Aristotle's old adage that the whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts. With that, we've selected some of our favorite multiwavelength images with Hubble, Chandra and Spitzer data (and listed the colors that each image is shown in). Each type of light brings a new piece of the puzzle in the quest to understand the cosmos we live in. We hope there will be many more years to see our Universe in a whole new light.

(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4b4a92200005700dc2f92.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Well, Andy Dwyer was a secret pothead. Chris Pratt revealed as much when he took to Reddit on Friday for an Ask Me Anything session. During the Q&A, Pratt opened up about his roles in ""Parks and Recreation,"" ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" and got candid about his personal life. Read on for the most interesting revelations.1. Pratt's ""Parks and Rec"" character Andy Dwyer was a big weed smoker. When asked what Andy Dwyer/Johnny Karate/Burt Macklin would be doing right now, Pratt said they all had one common interest:Here's something you might not have known about those characters. They smoked a lot of weed. they'd probably be doing that right now.2. Pratt and Peter Quill, his ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" character, are very similar: Quill and I are basically the same person. We were born in the same year. We loved the same movies. The same music. If I were kidnapped at 10, taken to space and based my ideology on the pop culture of 1979-1989 I would be Peter Quill.3. Pratt loves Arya Stark:I am a huge ""Game of Thrones"" fan. I love Arya Stark the most.4. Pratt's marriage to Anna Faris is like a fairy tale:Anna and I are meant to be together. Our relationship has made me believe in divine intervention and destiny, just as much as my crazy career and the way I fell into this life. She and I grew up 20 minutes away from each other but never met until we met in LA. We both got our start in horror spoofs. We both did an animated movie for Phil Lord and Chris Miller. We both made our careers playing guileless nitwits for laughs. We both have parents that have suffered with MS. The similarities go on and on. Anna is a great wife. Very patient and understanding. Very supportive. So kind and genuine always. And she gave me a wonderful son and family of in laws that I truly love.5. Pratt's favorite dinosaur is the velociraptor:They are pack hunters and super cool. But also I love the Mosasaur. That's the water dinosaur thing from the trailer that is SO FUCKING BADASS! Funny story, before I got Jurassic Park I gave James Gunn a wrap gift of an authentic Mosasaur Jawbone Fossil. So basically I can control the future.6. The ""Jurassic Park"" films offer something different than the book: Movies have a hard time of capturing the grittiness of a novel. Whereas novels have a hard time being done in an hour and a half.

(AP Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb77cd42600002d01835117.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a highly decorated Olympic athlete, Bruce Jenner's courageous act of coming out as a transgender woman highlights the dearth of open trans athletes competing at any level, even in a time where there is more acceptance for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in both sports and society. The metaphorical closet for the lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) sports community, appears to be slowly, but progressively, collapsing. In the last few years, we've seen more athletes -- amateur, pro, active and retired -- come out as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. The sports community has embraced these athletes. Their stories have sparked allyship awareness among leagues, teams and players. We have more out LGB players, more pride nights, and more proactive sexual orientation nondiscrimination policies.However, the sports community has not seen the same types of shifts in trans inclusion in sports. In fact, in many ways, the metaphorical closet for the transgender sports community is as solid as ever. There are still only a handful of openly trans athletes, active or retired. Even less have ever competed at the professional level. To date, no openly trans athlete has ever competed in the Olympics. Trans visibility might be increasing in everyday society but this trend is not translating to the sports world in the same way it has for LGB players.Sports inclusion advocates have worked to change the culture of sports around sexual orientation, because sports culture around this issue is indeed one of the greatest barriers for LGB inclusion. So advocacy has largely focused on LGBT 101 player trainings, educating leagues about the financial benefits of LGB inclusion, and expanding programming for the LGBT fan base. But the issue of trans exclusion in sports is a whole different ballgame. It's not just an issue of culture or stigma but one of tangible bad policies -- exclusionary policies that have been condoned, ignored and, at times, celebrated in the sports world.Trans athletes are literally excluded from sports at all levels. Transgender children are kept from playing on sports teams that reflect their gender identity. Many k-12 and recreational leagues do not offer any proactive protections or direction for trans inclusion, leaving trans inclusion to the whim of confused coaches and parents. So many trans athletes leave sports at a young age once they become aware of their gender identity and desire to live lives consistent with their gender identity. This exclusionary pattern continues at the collegiate and Olympic levels. While the NCAA does have a policy regarding trans athletes, it requires a trans athlete to either ""sit out"" or undergo hormone therapy. For example, a transgender player on an NCAA women's team, undergoing medically necessary hormone treatment, would be disqualified from playing, even if no physical advantages are present. The burdens on trans athletes are even higher at the Olympic level. The International Olympic Committee's trans policy requires invasive, painful, and expensive measures. Before a trans athlete can be an Olympian, they must obtain a legal name change, have gender reassignment surgery, and must also have hormone therapy for two years. Once celebrated as a ""victory"" for trans athletes, this policy, like many of others, has become outdated and inconsistent with new research or medical care standards. It does not, in practice, open the Olympic dream to trans athletes. Even outside of league restrictions, trans inclusion is even threatened. There has been an influx of anti-trans bills across the country. Many of these anti-trans bills would prohibit young trans athletes from using locker rooms consistent with their gender identity. The locker room is an integral part of the team experience. It's where team bonding and team strategizing happens. Being banned from the locker room is essentially being banned from the team. Alarmingly, there have been at least 20 of these bills introduced across the country this legislative session. Some of these bills even go so far as to keep transgender children off sports teams altogether. This trend, and its threat to trans sports inclusion, is expected to continue. Having high profile athletes like Jenner come out as transgender certainly helps draw attention to trans exclusion in sports. But this problem is systemic. So it is going to take more than courageous trans athletes coming out to improve the situation. For starters, advocates have to let go of the notion that sports, in practice, interacts with gender identity in the same way as it does with sexual orientation. It's not just an issue of culture or stigma; it's an issue of real policies that promote these unfortunate outcomes and trans exclusion. These out-of-date policies have to be combated, dismantled and replaced with policies that respect transgender identities."

The event marks the centenary of the massacre of some 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman forces. AFP PHOTO / FREDERIC J. BROWN (Photo credit should read FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f407200000f90101dc0d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I expected that I would be attacked for my column on the Armenian Genocide. Criticism can be good and, if constructive, can provide a springboard to discussion. Unfortunately, some of the letters I received from Turkish groups were anything but constructive. They were overly defensive, and, at times, crude and insulting.In a way, the Turkish reaction to my recent article reminded me of the equally intense responses I received six years ago when I wrote a column supporting President Obama's April 24, 2009 decision to hold back from using the term genocide so as not to disrupt the Turkish-Armenian negotiations that had been announced only two days earlier (on April 22 of that year). After that column appeared, some Armenian American groups felt that I had done their community a grave injustice and they flooded my inbox with some pretty nasty letters. The intensity was the same, but with a difference that is profound.I was troubled in 2009 and I am troubled now. And it's not because of the criticism. It has more to do with the rawness of the reaction that appeared to spring from an existential need. It feels as though Armenians need the acknowledgment of genocide in order validate their history, while Turks need to deny genocide in order to validate theirs. All in all, this is not a healthy state of affairs. As a result, both Turks and Armenians are engaged in a ""zero-sum"" game. If you use the ""g word"", you are damned by the Turks; if you don't use it, you are damned by the Armenians.Having said that, I want to be clear that in the ensuing standoff, I will side with the Armenians. They have been the victims and continue to be victimized by the Turkish efforts to falsify or obfuscate history and, when all else fails, to bully into submission those who continue to insist that recognition be given to the tragedies inflicted on the Armenian people a century ago.It may be that in response to Turkish obstinacy, Armenians have felt forced to also play ""zero sum"" with the matter of genocide. I wish they had not taken that path. As I said to my Armenian friends in 2009, and still say today, they should give President Obama and their other friends a break. For example, in his message to the Armenian people, issued on the eve of this year's anniversary, the President used extraordinarily evocative language to describe the horrible tragedy of 1915, saying:Beginning in 1915, the Armenian people of the Ottoman Empire were deported, massacred and marched to their deaths. Their culture and heritage in their ancient homeland were erased. Amid horrific violence that saw suffering on all sides, one and a half million Armenians perished.As the statement continues, the President uses the Armenian term ""Meds Yeghern"" (""Great Calamity""), and speaks about ""terrible carnage"" and ""a dark chapter of history"". Although he is clearly standing in solidarity with Armenians, because he did not use the ""g word"" he was denounced this year, as he was in 2009, and was even accused of having betrayed Armenians. One leader went so far as to suggest that the President's statement had brought shame to America. Such over-the-top criticism is, at best, unhelpful and, at worst, shameful. History is on the side of the Armenian people. And after 100 years there is growing recognition of what transpired in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. But in the end, U.S. recognition of genocide will not bring justice or restitution to the victim Armenian nation. That will only come when Turkey is able to accept and become reconciled with its own past and that is what President Obama has called on the Turks to do.There appeared to be signs of positive movement in that direction last year when then Prime Minister Erdogan called the killings ""inhumane"" and sent condolences to the families of the Armenian victims. Prime Minister Davutoglu expanded on these same themes last week and added that Turks ""understand what the Armenians feel"" and proclaiming ""a historical and humane duty for Turkey to uphold the memory... and cultural heritage"" of the Armenians. These signs of openness close quickly, however, when foreign governments or leaders dare to use the ""g word"". Turkish officials were, for example, extraordinarily harsh in their denunciation of both Pope Francis and EU Parliament for commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. As disturbing as I found the bullying and mean-spirited language that was employed, what bothered me more was the extent to which the denunciations were coupled with healthy doses of historical falsification.I got a taste of this last week when a Turkish organization sent me a 10-page letter that alternated between silly insults and attempts to educate me.The insults were no more than trite name-calling -- ""incompetent"", ""ignorant"", ""prejudiced"". The ""education"" was more disturbing. The letter's argument drifted between an invitation to put all the facts on the table to see what really happened, to telling me what they believe really did happen.According to the Turkish group's letter, the Armenians did a ""skunky thing"" by rebelling against the Ottoman Empire while ""the Sick Man was on its knees"". The Armenians formed ""terror groups"" and it was the effort to defeat them that has now been turned into a ""genocide"". Who was the ""enemy"" the Turks needed to defeat? According to the letter ""it was not just the armed rebels. It was most everyone in the Armenian population"". As a result, the Armenians were ordered deported ""not to eradicate an entire people, but to deny support to the Armenian guerrilla bands and to remove Armenians from the war zones and other strategic locations"". What else, the letter asks, could be done with rebellious minorities? Having thus made the case that it was indeed genocide, the group's letter moved on to educate me about how many Armenians actually perished. They questioned the oft-cited more than one million or 1.5 million, by claiming that there were no more than 1.5 million Armenians to begin with. Then by demonstrating that at war's end almost 1 million Armenians remained alive -- many in exile -- the letter then notes ""We will leave it up to you to perform the easy calculation to figure how many died?"" Then comes the rebuke ""why did you double the mortality (sic)?"" What I took from this bizarre argument was that even if we accept the claim that only 1.5 million Armenians existed before the war, 500,000 dead and the bulk of the rest in exile is somehow acceptable and not evidence of genocide!I cite this letter because it is symptomatic of the problem of the lengths to which some Turks will go to deny history. They continue to rebuff efforts to prod them to acknowledge their past -- as the White House continues to do. As the President noted, many nations were born with ""original sins"", including our own. The genocide against Native Americans and the institution of slavery remain festering wounds that have not healed. Europe's legacy of colonial conquest, Germany's horrific crimes against Jews and others, Israel's forced expulsion and dispossession of Palestinians -- all are ""original sins"" which these nations must acknowledge and for which they must make restitution if they are to have peace -- not only with their victims, but with themselves. A nation's refusal to come to grips with its past is more a sign of weakness, than of strength. Making peace with your past makes you stronger and more able to deal with future challenges. The inability to do so, is disturbing, to say the least. Denial and bullying the victim only delays the recognition that must ultimately come. Follow @AAIUSA for more."

Mitt Romney embraces Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker who introduced him at a campaign event at Wisconsin Products Pavilion at State Fair Park, Friday, Nov. 2, 2012, in West Allis, Wis. (AP Photo/David Goldman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f40a3c000066000e01ef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"That didn't take long. Gov. Scott Walker (R-Wis.) is now the first 2016 GOP presidential potential walking the anti-immigration plank, hoping -- against history -- that this time it will lead to the White House and not just to a watery political death.Since Republican nominee Mitt Romney crashed in 2012 on the shoals of his ""self-deportation"" strategy of harassing immigrants until they left the country, many Republican leaders and operatives have concluded that Romney's immigration policies were sure losers in a national election.How else to explain Romney's showing among American Latino voters -- the worst since President Ford? In fact, it does help explain the loss of key swing states, by having repulsed Latino voters en masse.So now comes the 2016 GOP frontrunner, Walker, walking down the same road. In a revealing interview with Glenn Beck, Walker came out not only against immigration reform with a path toward earned citizenship; he also staked a position against legal immigration.For some time, the Republican talking point was ""we're not against immigrants, only illegal immigrants."" Of course, that line in itself was not going to win Hispanic voters for whom immigration policy is a proxy for respect. But at least it had some connection to reality -- immigration is one of the most effective mechanisms for the American economy to diversify its workforce, create job specialization, and increase economic growth and wages.Undoubtedly, Walker's own immigrant ancestors were part of this machinery, which has made the American economy the most powerful and vibrant in the world.I remember my third-grade teacher in Connecticut teaching us about the melting pot. ""And that's how we all become Americans,"" Mr. Richter told us. It was one of those powerful conversations that allows you to connect the dots -- and for me, to understand that my feeling of being an alien in a new world would eventually dissipate. It was both factual and comforting.But we're in a different epoch in America. Walker is playing to that section of the American electorate that is anxious and angry. The multi-decade process of globalization has created many challenges for American workers -- we no longer just compete with our neighbors for jobs; we now compete with workers across the world.Moreover, technology has immeasurably improved our lives, but has also exposed us to the increasing robotization of formerly middle-class jobs that are disappearing like that of the trolley driver. It is to this sector of the electorate that Walker is pointing his anti-immigrant remarks.Recent demographic studies of the Republican base show a population of economically anxious people with relatively low levels of education, older than the general population and predominantly living in Republican-governed states where education has not been prioritized, and where the social net, which serves both psychological and substantive comfort for a displaced worker, is tattered and ineffective.Enter Walker's politics of fear. For the party that rhetorically champions self-reliance, the emphasis on creating fear and despair in the electorate is ironic, but effective. Why blame yourself for economic insecurity when you can blame a faceless immigrant plotting to take away your job?Walker and his 2016 fellow GOP contenders have now discovered that the middle class is under pressure. But instead of proposing transformative policies -- like greater access to education, including adult education, cheap loans for small business start-ups and a fair tax code that rewards work at least as much as it applauds passive investments -- GOP candidates have vilified immigrants.American history is replete with examples of immigrant attacks in the name of economic issues, racial purity and general ""otherness.""As some Republican strategists have suggested, the GOP's best hope in 2016 is to hyper-stimulate the non-Hispanic white vote. This strategy is problematic on several fronts. To start, it means trying to get a bigger percentage of a population that will be a smaller share of the electorate in 2016 than it was in 2012.Moreover, it shows a damning pessimism on the part of Republicans, a surrender of the idea that the Republican platform could actually attract new voters from what Ronald Brownstein has called the new ascendant segments of the American electorate: young people, college-educated folks, Asian-Americans, African-Americans, Latino-Americans and especially women.This strategy is more a Republican Party epitaph than an exhortation to victory.The day after Romney's defeat, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said that immigration reform would be at the top of the Republican agenda. Four years and one bipartisan Senate bill carefully calibrating a comprehensive bill to reform our outdated and failed immigration system later, Republicans are back to vilifying immigrants.Walker's alliance with his party's anti-immigrant champions may be sound primary politics. The Tea Party movement has now transformed itself into a force against immigration, and you can expect it to be a fervent participant in the nominating process.But what is Walker (or Sens. Ted Cruz [R-Texas], Marco Rubio [R-Fla.] et al.) going to do in the general election if he wins the nomination? Faced with a primary process during which Republicans will try to outdo each other in their anti-immigration rhetoric (self-deportation with leeches?), whoever emerges the winner will face repudiation not just from Latino- and Asian-Americans, as Romney did in 2012, but from Americans of all walks of life who remember that this country is a nation of immigrants, made up of people who value fairness and reject prejudice.An electoral strategy of division and fear, like the one now adopted by Scott Walker, cuts both ways. As Mitt Romney proved, anti-immigrant zealotry is a great get-out-the-vote strategy -- for Democrats."

Ryerson Lecture on the subject of same-sex marriage. Because the Supreme Court will hear arguments on this issue on Tuesday, I thought I would post the core of the lecture here. It quite a bit longer than the usual Huffington post, so I apologize for that.In August 1982, an Atlanta police officer went to the home of Michael Hardwick to serve an arrest warrant for public drinking. Upon entering the home, the officer observed Hardwick and another man engaged in oral sex. The officer placed both men under arrest for the crime of sodomy. In Bowers v. Hardwick, decided in 1986, the Supreme Court held that Georgia's prohibition of homosexual sodomy was not unconstitutional. Noting that the Constitution says nothing about a right to commit sodomy, and that proscriptions against homosexuality ""have ancient roots,"" Justice Byron White, who wrote the majority opinion, concluded that, to claim that the Constitution protects ""a right to engage in such conduct ... is, at best, facetious."" In a concurring opinion, Chief Justice Warren Burger added that condemnation of homosexual conduct ""is firmly rooted in Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards"" and that ""to hold that the act of homosexual sodomy"" was somehow protected by the Constitution ""would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.""Justice Harry Blackmun, joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens, dissented. Although conceding that ""traditional Judeo-Christian values"" had proscribed homosexual intimacy for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, Blackmun insisted that that fact ""cannot provide an adequate justification"" in itself for the Georgia law. ""That certain ... religious groups condemn the behavior at issue,"" he reasoned, ""gives the State no license to impose their judgments on the entire citizenry."" To the contrary, ""the legitimacy of secular legislation"" depends on ""whether the State can advance some justification for its law beyond its conformity to religious doctrine."" Finding no such justification, Blackmun concluded that the Georgia statute could not be reconciled with the United States Constitution.That, however, was a dissenting position.The Court's invocation of moral and religious proscriptions against homosexuality played a central role in the justices' reasoning in Bowers, and it is therefore useful to have some understanding of that history. Let's take a look at the ""ancient roots"" Justice White invoked.The pre-Christian world generally thought of sex as a positive part of human nature. It did not see sex as bound up with questions of sin or religion. The ancient Greeks, for example, focused, not on sexual ""sin,"" but on whether an individual's conduct was harmful to others. This extended even to homosexuality. Indeed, a common feature of classical Greek sexual life was that adult men often had sexual relationships with adolescent boys. This might seem strange to us, but Greek poetry, history and literature celebrated such relationships and identified them with love, honesty, integrity, honor, and courage. Similarly, although Roman sexual life was different from that of the Greeks, the Romans too celebrated sexual pleasure and neither Roman religion nor Roman law condemned same-sex sex. The emergence of Christianity, however, produced a profound change in the prevailing understandings of sex generally. By the end of the fifth century, Christianity had come to condemn sexual desire as inherently shameful and as an evil temptation that must be suppressed. This shift occurred over the course of several centuries, but it was Augustine who finally crystallized the early Christian understanding of sex. In a critical leap, Augustine linked sexual desire to the Fall of man. Adam's transgression, he argued, had not been one of disobedience, as the ancient Hebrews had believed, but one of sex. Augustine therefore maintained that every sexual desire is born out of evil, that every child born out of evil is born into sin, and that it is through sex that man passes on the original sin from one generation to the next. Augustine therefore concluded that man's only hope for redemption lay in repudiating the sexual impulse and, with it, the burden of sin and shame inherited from Adam. Augustine's vision ultimately shaped the future, not only of Christianity, but of Western culture and law, more generally.During the next thousand years, Christian dogma, backed by the threat of hellfire and damnation, attained not only religious, but social, political, and legal authority. The sin of ""sodomy"" came to be seen as uniquely dire, for as the biblical story of Sodom had taught, for this particular sin God will punish not only the sinners, but also those who fail to prevent the sin. It was still unclear, though, precisely what acts constituted ""sodomy."" It was Thomas Aquinas who, in the 13th century, first drew a sharp distinction between opposite-sex and same-sex ""unnatural"" acts. Although oral or anal sex with a person of the opposite sex was deemed a vice against nature, such acts with a person of the same sex, he concluded, constituted the worst form of sodomy. Before long, Thomas's thinking on this point became the dominant authority in Christian doctrine. At roughly the same time, and not coincidentally, same-sex sex came for the first time to be declared, not only a sin, but a crime. That is, the Church for the first time conscripted the secular law to extend its prohibition on same-sex sex not only to those who shared the faith, but to everyone, regardless of their personal religious beliefs. Criminal statutes against same-sex sex were thus enacted throughout Europe, and because of the heinous nature of this crime, these laws called for homosexuals to be castrated, dismembered, burned at the stake, drowned, hanged, stoned to death, decapitated, or buried alive. In short, homosexuals for the first time became the object of a systematic program of extermination. Although the Reformation brought about significant changes in the Protestant attitude towards sex, those changes did not extend to homosexuality. To the contrary, Protestant reformers reaffirmed in no uncertain terms the traditional condemnation of homosexuality as a ""detestable and abominable sin."" In the American colonies, for example, the Puritans declared that sodomy must be punished ""with death, without mercy,"" and warned that the ""Land cannot be cleansed until it hath spued out this Unclean Beast.""By the time of the American Revolution, the colonies, under the influence of the Enlightenment, had stopped using the criminal law to prosecute most forms of consensual sex -- except for the crime of sodomy, which remained a capital offense. Indeed, sodomy remained a serious felony in every state in the nation for the next two hundred years. Throughout all of this history, until the late 19th-century, it was generally assumed that individuals who chose to engage in same-sex sex were no different than other individuals who chose to engage in other types of criminal or sinful behavior. Engaging in homosexual sex, like engaging in robbery, was simply a choice.This assumption began to be questioned, however, in the late 19h-century, as medical authorities became interested in the issue. For the first time, persons drawn to same-sex sex began to be seen as individuals possessed of a distinctive psychological identity. It was in this era that the concept of the ""homosexual"" first came into being. Leading studies of homosexuality in the late 19th century posited that homosexuality was a pathology and that persons afflicted with this pathology were ""strange freaks of nature."" Among the questions debated were whether the inclination to engage in homosexual conduct was congenital or acquired, whether it was curable or incurable, and whether it should be accepted as an unavoidable condition or actively resisted and suppressed.  Physicians in this era proposed a broad range of ""remedies"" for homosexuality, including hypnosis, psychoanalysis, sex with prostitutes, intense bicycle riding, rectal massage, burning the neck and lower back with hot irons or chemicals, electric stimulation, castration, and clitorectomy. Many doctors recommended the sterilization of homosexuals in order to prevent the condition from being passed on to the next generation, and by 1938, 32 states had enacted compulsory sterilization laws aimed at homosexuals.Also in the 1930s, the image of the homosexual took on an increasingly sinister cast. A growing public anxiety over sex crimes recast the dominant image of homosexuals as dangerous psychopaths who were naturally inclined to commit the most unspeakable crimes. Demonized not only as perverts, but now as child molesters as well, ""homosexuals became the new enemy of the people,"" and arrests for sodomy increased dramatically percent in the 1930s. During World War II, the United States for the first time attempted to prevent homosexual men and women from entering the military, and those who were discovered in the military were discharged in proceedings that often left them branded for life. With the advent of the Cold War, things got even worse. Fearful of domestic subversion, Americans turned with a vengeance against homosexuals. The conflation of ""Communists and queers"" seemed only logical, for Americans viewed communism as atheistic, un-Christian, immoral and degenerate. As one congressman asserted in 1950, ""the Russians are strong believers in homosexuality."" Red-baiting journalists warned that ""Communists are now converting American youth to homosexuality to defeat us from within,"" and Senator Kenneth Wherry of Nebraska, the Republican floor leader, declared that ""You can't hardly separate homosexuals from subversives."" By 1950, the ""Lavender Scare,"" as it came to be called, was well underway. Government agencies began using lie detectors to determine whether their employees were homosexuals, the FBI compiled lists of suspected homosexuals from local vice-squads, and President Eisenhower issued an Executive Order officially declaring ""sexual perversion"" a serious security risk. In light of the intensity of the anti-homosexual fever that gripped the nation during the Lavender Scare, gays and lesbians found themselves increasingly isolated. In a society in which the dominant religion excoriated homosexuality as a heinous sin, the law branded it a vicious crime, and the medical profession diagnosed homosexuals as diseased, the vast majority of individuals who harbored homosexual impulses did their best to hide their secret shame from family, friends, neighbors, employers, and associates. The terrible fear of discovery kept the secret lives of most homosexuals invisible, even to one another.Indeed, even civil rights groups turned their backs on gays and lesbians in this era. In 1957, for example, the national board of the American Civil Liberties Union declared that ""it is not within the province of the [ACLU] to question the validity of laws aimed at the suppression or elimination of homosexuals."" By the late 1960s, though, inspired by the civil rights and women's rights movements, a handful of courageous gay men and lesbians began calling openly for the acceptance of homosexuals ""as full equals"" in society. In 1969, for example, Carl Wittman, a gay SDS leader, penned what he termed The Gay Manifesto, in which he declared: ""Our first job is to clear our own heads of the garbage that's been poured into them.... Liberation for gay people is defining for ourselves who we are. It is time for us to come out.""This was the first time anyone had used the term ""come out"" in this manner. For those who sought equal rights for gays and lesbians, ""coming out"" was a radical and daring act that would affect every aspect of their lives. Indeed, as late as 1969, only a few hundred members of the growing gay rights organizations in the United States had publicly identified themselves as homosexuals. This was about to change.At around 1:00 a.m. on the night of Friday, June 27, 1969, the New York police raided the Stonewall Inn, a dingy, Mafia-owned gay bar on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village. Five other New York bars had been raided in the previous three weeks, but this time the drag queens, bar boys, and lesbians who had either been in the bar or in the gathering crowd outside resisted the police harassment. The next night, hundreds of gay men and women gathered on Christopher Street, leading to yet another confrontation with the police, an event that generated national attention. A year later, thousands of people commemorated the anniversary of Stonewall by marching in New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles in the nation's first Gay Pride parades. The decade after Stonewall saw gradual, but halting, progress in the cause of gay rights. In 1972, a lesbian was allowed to retain custody of her children in a contested divorce for the first time in American history. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association declared for the first time that homosexuality was not a mental illness. And by the end of the decade, 22 states, adopting the recommendation of the American Law Institute, had repealed their laws making consensual sodomy a crime. Illinois, by the way, was the first state in the nation to do this.These developments sparked a sharp backlash, however. The most dramatic explosion arose over a proposed gay rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. In 1977, the county commission, following the lead of several other cities, passed an ordinance prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Local religious groups were outraged, and demanded an immediate repeal of the ordinance. Local Baptists charged that the law violated God's biblical commandments, and the National Association of Evangelicals soon entered the fray. Leaders of the Christian Right, including Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, and Jim and Tammy Baker, came to Miami to campaign in favor of repeal, and in a special referendum, Dade County's voters repealed the ordinance by an overwhelming margin. This victory generated momentum for a new, religion-based, anti-gay movement. The campaign took on an ugly tone as bumper stickers appeared across the nation with such messages as ""Kill a Queer for Christ."" Within two years, many of the laws that had been enacted in other cities to protect gays from discrimination were also repealed. The Christian Right charged that such laws promoted ""child molesting"" and ""gay recruiting,"" and the Rev. Jerry Falwell raged that ""Homosexuals do not reproduce! They recruit! And, many of them are after your children."" The anti-gay rights crusade saw this fight as a religious battle for the Christian soul of America.Soon thereafter AIDS struck the gay community with a vengeance. As the disease became associated in the public mind with homosexuality, the Christian Right deemed AIDS God's punishment for homosexual sodomy. The Reagan administration, which had actively courted the Christian Right, had no interest in devoting ""government time or money"" to an illness that was thought to threaten only gay men. Rather than invest federal funds in medical research, the White House instructed the Center for Disease Control to ""look pretty and do as little as we can."" Over the course of the next decade, AIDS ravaged the homosexual community, killing more than a quarter-of-a-million gay men and leaving hundreds of thousands more to wonder if they might be next.Ironically, though, the horror of AIDS brought homosexuality into the light. As thousands of gay men died horrible deaths, people had to take notice -- often, though not always, with sympathy and concern. Gradually, one person at a time, in often awkward and sometimes excruciatingly painful conversations with family, friends, and acquaintances, the previously closeted lives of homosexuals became visible, first out of necessity and desperation, then later out of candor and self-respect.  ""Gay invisibility"" was suddenly melting away. At the Gay and Lesbian March on Washington in 1993, hundreds of thousands of individuals wearing pink triangles marched proudly past the White House. Four years later, Ellen DeGeneres, star of the popular ABC television show Ellen, came out as a lesbian. Shortly thereafter, some forty-two million viewers tuned in to watch DeGeneres' character, Ellen Morgan, reveal that she, too, was a lesbian. Not everyone cheered. The response of the Christian Right was fierce. The Rev. Jerry Falwell called Ellen DeGeneres ""Ellen DeGenerate,"" and the Southern Baptist Convention called for a boycott of ABC because it had broadcast the show. In the view of the Christian Right, homosexual perversion, immorality, and degeneracy were being spewed across the land. Donald Wildmon, the president of the American Family Association, railed that homosexuality was ""a sin grievous to God and repulsive to Christians."" This struggle, he declared, was a matter of life and death, because if we fail, ""we fear the judgment of God on our nation."" The battle lines had clearly been drawn.This brings me back to the Supreme Court. As we saw earlier, in its first encounter with homosexuality the Court held in Bowers v. Hardwick that a state could constitutionally make homosexual conduct a criminal offense. The Court explained that, given the history of religious and moral condemnation of homosexuality, any suggestion that the Constitution could be interpreted as protecting such behavior was, ""at best, facetious."" The Court's second foray into this arena was Romer v. Evans, which was decided in 1996, exactly a decade after Bowers. As I noted earlier, beginning in the late 1970s several cities enacted ordinances prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. As in Dade County, however, this generated a sharp response from the Christian Right, which usually succeeded in getting those laws repealed. In Colorado, after Denver enacted an anti-discrimination ordinance in 1991, a coalition of Christian Right organizations launched an aggressive campaign to amend the Colorado constitution to override the ordinance. Amendment 2, which was adopted in a statewide referendum, provided that neither the State of Colorado, nor any of its subdivisions, could enact any law that protected homosexuals against discrimination. Nine days later, lawyers from Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union, which had changed its tune, filed suit claiming that Amendment 2 violated the United States Constitution. In light of Bowers, it seemed clear that the Supreme Court would reject the challenge, but in a stunning six-to-three decision the Court held Amendment 2 unconstitutional. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who had been appointed to the Court by President Ronald Reagan, authored the Court's opinion. In Kennedy's view, the problem with Amendment 2 was that it imposed ""a special disability"" only upon homosexuals. This was so because, under Amendment 2, every group in Colorado was free to try to persuade a city council, a state university, or the state legislature to enact regulations protecting them against discrimination -- except homosexuals. Because of Amendment 2, only homosexuals would have to amend the state Constitution before they could obtain ""protection against discrimination.""With that fact in mind, Kennedy turned to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that ""no state shall ... deny to any person the equal protection of the laws."" Under that guarantee, if a law treats some people differently than others, it ordinarily will satisfy the demands of equal protection if ""it bears even a rational relation to some legitimate end."" Although almost every law passes that highly deferential standard, Justice Kennedy concluded that Amendment 2 did not.This was so, he reasoned, because ""a law declaring that ... it shall be more difficult for one group of citizens than for all others to seek aid from the government"" was virtually ""unprecedented"" in American history, and it was therefore impossible to escape the inference, he explained, that the ""disadvantage imposed"" on homosexuals by Amendment 2 was the result, not of any rational effort to further a legitimate state interest, but ""of animosity toward the class of persons affected."" Because a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate government interest, Kennedy concluded that Amendment 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause.Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas, was of a rather different view. Scalia maintained that Amendment 2 ""is not the manifestation of a '""bare ... desire to harm""' homosexuals, but is rather a rational and perfectly legitimate attempt by Coloradans to ""preserve traditional sexual mores."" He castigated Justice Kennedy's reasoning as utterly disingenuous.The Supreme Court's third decision involving the rights of homosexuals, Lawrence v. Texas, was pretty much a re-run of Bowers v. Hardwick. Police officers in Houston were dispatched to a private residence in response to a reported disturbance. After they entered the residence, they saw two men engaging in anal sex. The men were arrested, charged, and convicted of violating a Texas statute making it a crime for any person to engage ""in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex."" Since 1982, Bowers v. Hardwick had been used by politicians, legislators, and judges to justify discrimination against gays and lesbians in deportation hearings, adoption proceedings, military discharges, employment discrimination, and a host of other contexts. After all, if homosexual conduct is criminal, than a homosexual is no different than a rapist, a robber, or a thief.Much had changed, however, in the seventeen years between Bowers and Lawrence. Not only had AIDS devastated the gay community and changed the public's perception of homosexuality, but sixty percent of Americans now thought that homosexual sex should no longer be deemed a criminal offense. In a six-to-three decision, the Supreme Court overruled Bowers and held the Texas statute unconstitutional. Justice Kennedy again delivered the opinion of the Court. Kennedy maintained that the Court's reasoning in Bowers v. Hardwick had been distorted by its ""failure to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake"" in such deeply personal relationships. Although conceding that the Framers of the Constitution had not expressly guaranteed the right to engage in homosexual sex, Kennedy explained that the Framers had intentionally left some constitutional guarantees open-ended because ""they knew"" that ""later generations can see that laws once thought proper in fact serve only to oppress."" That, Kennedy maintained, was the situation in Lawrence. There was, he concluded, no constitutionally legitimate justification for making same-sex sex a crime.Justice Scalia, joined once again by Rehnquist and Thomas, dissented. Scalia accused the Court of signing on to what he termed the ""homosexual agenda,"" and he fumed that the Court had no business invalidating legislation that had been legitimately enacted by the citizens of Texas. Echoing Justice Scalia's outrage, religious conservatives throughout the nation were livid. Pat Robertson denounced the Court for rending the ""moral fabric of the nation,"" Jerry Falwell warned that Lawrence would lead to bestiality, and a pastor in Kansas fumed that it marked ""the death knell of American civilization."" When it came time for Justice Kennedy to announce the judgment of the Court in Lawrence, he read a brief statement explaining the result from the bench. The Supreme Court chamber was, of course, packed. At the end he declared: ""Bowers was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today. It ought not to remain binding precedent. Bowers v. Hardwick should be, and now is, overruled."" It was a remarkable moment. Overwhelmed by what was happening, many of the gay and lesbian advocates sitting in the gallery sobbed openly. For the gay and lesbian community it was an occasion for dancing in the streets. Joyous demonstrations erupted in cities across the nation. For gays in America, Lawrence meant much more than that rarely-enforced anti-sodomy laws could no longer be legally enforced. Rather, Lawrence meant that never again would their rights be dismissed by the highest tribunal in the land as, ""at best, facetious,"" and never again would they wonder whether the words engraved on the pediment of the Supreme Court building, ""Equal Justice Under Law,"" included them. The Constitution was now their constitution, too.In San Francisco, a group of veterans who had been expelled from military service during World War II because of their sexual orientation proudly saluted as a huge Rainbow Flag, which had flown atop an eighty-foot pole for more than five years, was lowered and an American flag for the first time was raised in its place.   For most of American history, the notion that a man could marry a man, or a woman could marry a woman, seemed utterly absurd. In 1990, however, only four years after Bowers v. Hardwick, three gay couples in Hawaii applied for marriage licenses, which were of course denied. Audaciously, they then filed suit in state court claiming that the state's refusal to allow same-sex couples to marry violated the Hawaii constitution. To pretty much everyone's surprise, the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that the state's law restricting marriage to a man and a woman might violate the Hawaii constitution.This decision provoked a furious response from the Christian Right, and almost immediately states across the nation rushed to amend their state constitutions explicitly to define marriage as involving one man and one woman. The goal of these amendments was both to prevent their own state courts from following the Hawaii Supreme Court's suggestion, and to make it impossible for future majorities in the state, should they emerge, to legalize same-sex marriage by enacting legislation to that effect.These issues played out at the national level, as well. As the 1996 election approached, the anti-gay rhetoric was virulent. Dick Armey, the Republican whip in the House, publicly referred to congressman Barney Frank as ""Barney Fag,"" six of the seven Republican presidential candidates vehemently condemned the idea of same-sex marriage, and Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich proposed the ""Defense of Marriage Act,"" or DOMA, which provided, among other things, that if any state recognized marriages between persons of the same sex, persons entering into such marriages would be ineligible for the multitude of federal benefits that were otherwise available to married couples. The hearings on DOMA were ""openly homophobic."" Members of Congress described gays and lesbians ""as sick, perverted, and dangerous,"" charged that the nation was facing a dangerous ""attack upon God's principles,"" and warned that ""the flames of hedonism ... are licking at the foundations of our society."" Congress quickly enacted the legislation, and with a presidential election just around the corner, and, with the American people opposed to same-sex marriage by a margin of sixty-eight to twenty-seven percent, President Bill Clinton signed DOMA into law. Of course, none of this really mattered at the time, because same-sex marriage was not legal in any state in the nation.Seven years later, though, in 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Court held that laws denying same-sex couples the freedom to marry violated the Massachusetts constitution. Massachusetts thus became the first state in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage. In response, 13 additional states promptly amended their state constitutions to forbid same-sex marriage. Several years later, though, the state supreme courts of Connecticut, California, and Iowa followed Massachusetts' lead and held that their state constitutions also guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry. Moreover, in 2009, Vermont became the first state in the nation to enact same-sex marriage by legislation. Shortly thereafter, New Hampshire and Maine followed suit. The pushback, again, was furious. In Maine and California, for example, the Christian Right launched vigorous - and successful -- campaigns to amend their state constitutions to outlaw same-sex marriage, and voters in Iowa, spurred on by the Moral Majority, voted out of office three of the state supreme court justices who had voted to recognize a state constitutional right to same-sex marriage. As the executive director of the American Family Association warned, if any judge attempts ""to impose ... an amoral agenda, we're going to take [you] out.""Thus, despite several seemingly landmark victories, the movement for same-sex marriage had stalled. DOMA remained the law nationally, most efforts to legalize same-sex marriage had been overturned, and by 2013 more than thirty states had enacted state constitutional amendments expressly outlawing same-sex marriage. This brings me to the Supreme Court's fourth and most recent decision in our story - United States v. Windsor. Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer met in New York City in 1963 and began a long-term relationship. In 2007, they were married in Ontario, Canada, and New York law recognized the validity of their marriage. Two years later, Spyer died, leaving her estate to Windsor. When Windsor sought to claim the federal estate tax exemption for surviving spouses, she was barred from doing so by section 3 of DOMA, which expressly provided that no provision of federal law could recognize as lawful any marriage other than those between a man and a woman. Windsor then filed suit, challenging the constitutionality of section 3. In a bitterly-divided five-to-four decision, the Supreme Court invalidated section 3 of DOMA on June 26, 2013 - ten years to the day after its decision in Lawrence. As in Romer and Lawrence, Justice Kennedy authored the opinion of the Court. He was joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan. Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito dissented.In his opinion for the Court, Justice Kennedy explained that the issue presented was not whether states were constitutionally obligated to recognize same-sex marriage, but whether the federal government could constitutionally discriminate against couples who were legally married in a state because those individuals happened to be of the same sex.In approaching this question, Kennedy emphasized that ""by history and tradition the definition and regulation of marriage has been treated as being within the authority of the separate States."" A state's decision to give same-sex couples ""the right to marry,"" he noted, ""conferred upon them a dignity and status of immense import."" Although acknowledging that ""Congress, in enacting discrete statutes, can make determinations that bear on marital rights and privileges,"" Kennedy characterized DOMA as unprecedented because it applied ""to over 1,000 federal statutes and the whole realm of federal regulations."" Thus, like Colorado's Amendment 2, which had been invalidated in Romer, Kennedy maintained that a central purpose of DOMA was to undermine ""the equal dignity"" of gays and lesbians. Indeed, DOMA's ""principal effect,"" he maintained, ""is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned marriages and make them unequal."" ""By creating two contradictory marriage regimes within the same State,"" DOMA, he reasoned, ""places same-sex couples"" in the ""position of being in a second-tier marriage,"" a discrimination that ""demeans the couple"" and ""humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples."" Because no legitimate federal interest justified what he described as ""the purpose and effect"" of disparaging ""those whom the State sought to protect,"" Kennedy concluded that DOMA violated the Constitution. In a furious dissenting opinion, Justice Scalia characterized the Court's reasoning as nothing short of ""remarkable."" At various points, Scalia dismissed Kennedy's analysis as ""perplexing,"" ""confusing,"" ""absurd,"" ""overcooked,"" and ""legalistic argle-bargle."" Scalia reiterated what he had insisted upon in Lawrence: ""The Constitution does not forbid the government to enforce traditional moral and sexual norms."" That, in itself, he maintained, is sufficient justification for the federal government's decision not to recognize same-sex marriages.Scalia angrily predicted that Windsor would lead to recognition of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. He charged that if the Court believed that DOMA was the product of unconstitutional animus against homosexuals, then surely it would make the same assertion about state laws limiting marriage to one man and one woman. ""As far as this Court is concerned, he fumed, ""no one should be fooled; it is just a matter of ... waiting for the other shoe.""It is striking how far the Court had moved in the twenty-seven years from Bowers to Windsor. This was due to several factors, one of which was not an overall move of the Court in a more ""liberal"" direction. To the contrary, on a broad range of issues, including affirmative action, campaign finance, gun control, and voting rights, the Court, with the additions of Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Roberts, and Alito, had grown, if anything, notably more ""conservative"" than the Court at the time of Bowers.What had changed in those years was the public awareness of gays and lesbians in society and the public and legal understanding of both the morality and wisdom of laws discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. Indeed, public opinion on these issues had shifted dramatically between Bowers and Windsor. In 1986, no one even bothered to poll on the question of same-sex marriage. It wasn't until 1996 that Gallup finally thought to ask people about same-sex marriage. At that time, only 27 percent of Americans thought same-sex marriage should be legal. By 2013, fifty-four percent of Americans shared that view. This shift was due to many factors, but most important was the profound change in the visibility of gays and lesbians in American society. This transformation affected not only everyday citizens, but also legislators, mayors, governors, presidents, and judges. With these changes, the traditional judicial understandings of such fundamental legal concepts as liberty, equality, and due process -- as applied to homosexuals -- were suddenly called into question, and rightly so. It is important to note, though, that these changes in public attitudes and understandings did not in themselves dictate any particular change in constitutional doctrine. Bowers and Windsor were both five-to-four decisions. Only one vote had ""changed"" over the course of those twenty-seven years. Had Robert Bork been confirmed, and Anthony Kennedy therefore never been appointed to the Court, the outcome in Windsor almost surely would have been five-to-four the other way. Thus, the divergent outcomes in these cases were shaped by at least two critical factors: the general public understanding of homosexuality at the time of the decision, and the particular interpretative approaches and values of the individual justices who happened to be on the Court at the specific moment when the issues arose.Since Windsor there has been a virtual avalanche of lower court decisions invalidating state laws denying same-sex couples the freedom to marry. Before Windsor, the vast majority of all courts and judges who addressed this issue held that laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples were constitutional. In the two years since Windsor, the overwhelming majority of courts and judges have held such laws unconstitutional. The shift has been sudden and it has been seismic.The other shoe is about to fall.In June, the Supreme Court will hand down its decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which directly presents the question whether state laws that deny same-sex couples the freedom to marry violate the United States Constitution. It seems almost certain that at least five justices will now take this step and that Justice Anthony Kennedy will again write the opinion of the Court.What is unknown is whether any of the other justices will join the decision, and what explanation the Court will give for its decision. The latter is especially intriguing, because despite Romer, Lawrence, and Windsor, it remains a bit of a mystery how the majority thinks about these questions. The central question is whether laws denying same-sex couples the freedom to marry violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Those advocating this position have advanced three primary arguments in support of their view. First, they argue that laws denying same-sex couples the freedom to marry are unconstitutional because they do not rationally further a legitimate state interest, that the real purpose of such laws is to denigrate and stigmatize a despised class of citizens, and that, like the laws invalidated in Romer, Lawrence, and Windsor, these laws therefore violate the Equal Protection Clause. Those on the other side point out that the rational basis standard is a highly deferential one. They argue that there are, in fact, legitimate justifications for laws that limit marriage to one man and one women, including morality, tradition, promoting procreation, promoting family stability, and preserving respect for the institution of marriage. Moreover, they argue that, even if the Court was right to find evidence of ""animus"" in Romer and Windsor because of the ""unprecedented"" nature of the laws at issue in those cases, no similar inference can logically be drawn with respect to the traditional understanding that marriage involves a relationship between a man and a woman. After all, they argue, when marriage was defined in this way many centuries ago, no one was thinking about homosexuals one way or the other. That being so, they reason, animus toward homosexuals has nothing at all to do with the traditional definition of marriage.The second argument advanced by those challenging the constitutionality of laws denying same-sex couples the freedom to marry turns on the notion that the freedom to marry is itself a ""fundamental interest."" In a series of decisions over the past century, the Supreme Court has held that a law that treats people differently with respect to a ""fundamental"" interest, such as the right to vote, the right not to be sterilized, or the freedom to use contraceptives, violates the Equal Protection Clause unless it satisfies something called ""heightened scrutiny."" That is, when a law treats people differently with respect to a fundamental interest, the law is unconstitutional unless it substantially furthers an important government interest. A mere rational explanation is not sufficient. Those who challenge the constitutionality of laws denying same-sex couples the freedom to marry maintain that such laws implicate the fundamental right to marry and that they therefore must pass heightened scrutiny review, a test that pretty much everyone agrees cannot be satisfied. Those who defend the constitutionality of laws denying same-sex couples the freedom to marry respond that, even if the freedom to marry is fundamental, that applies only to opposite-sex couples. This is so, they argue, because for an interest to be recognized as ""fundamental"" it must be deeply rooted in ""our Nation's history, legal traditions, and practices."" Although the right of opposite-sex couples to marry is clearly fundamental under that standard, they insist that there is no analogous fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry, because that practice can hardly be said to be deeply rooted in ""our Nation's history, legal traditions, and practices.""In response, those arguing in favor of a fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry maintain that, just as the meaning of express constitutional rights, like the freedom of speech and the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures, can evolve over time with changing circumstances, so too can the meaning of implied fundamental rights evolve over time. The third argument of those challenging the constitutionality of laws denying same-sex couples the freedom to marry is that, because such laws discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, they are analogous to laws that discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, national origin, gender, and similar characteristics, and therefore call forth heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause for that separate and distinct reason.The Supreme Court has long held that laws discriminating against individuals on the basis of certain ""suspect"" criteria are especially problematic and are therefore unconstitutional unless they satisfy a more demanding standard of justification. Because laws discriminating against African-Americans are the paradigm violation of the Equal Protection Clause, the Court generally considers four factors in determining whether discrimination against any particular group should be deemed ""suspect"": whether the group has experienced a history of invidious discrimination; whether the defining characteristic of the group is essentially immutable; whether the group can effectively protect itself against discrimination through the political process; and whether the discrimination is based on stereotyped characteristics that are not truly indicative of the group's ability to perform in society. Those who contest the constitutionality of laws discriminating against gays and lesbians maintain that such discrimination satisfies these criteria and therefore must be tested by heightened scrutiny.In response, those who defend the constitutionality of laws discriminating against gays and lesbians maintain that homosexuality is a choice, that what homosexuals call a history of discrimination therefore is no different than a history of ""discrimination"" against any other group of individuals who choose to violate society's moral norms and legal strictures, that gays and lesbians have ample political power, and that homosexuality is relevant to a host of legal considerations, most obviously to marriage. Thus, in their view, laws that ""discriminate"" against homosexuals are no different than laws that ""discriminate"" against people who commit incest, or burglary, assault, or bestiality. Such laws, they insist, are completely different constitutionally from laws that discriminate against African-Americans, women, Hispanics, or Japanese-Americans.So what should the Court do? In my view, all three of these arguments would justify a decision invalidating laws forbidding same-sex marriage, and lower courts have invoked all them in one case or another. My preferred rationale is the third - that laws discriminating against gays and lesbians are constitutionally ""suspect"" in ways that are similar to laws that discriminate against blacks, Hispanics, women, and, to use the World War II example, persons of Japanese descent. Gays and lesbians have been subjected to a long history of invidious discrimination, sexual orientation is not a matter of choice, gays and lesbians have consistently had their interests dismissed and overridden in the political process, and sexual orientation has nothing to do with an individual's ability to perform in society.Put simply, and especially in light of our history, laws that expressly discriminate against gays and lesbians, whether in marriage, child custody disputes, employment, housing, or any other context are properly understood as suspect in the sense that they are highly likely to be tainted by considerations of animus, hostility, ignorance, and prejudice. This, to me, is the deepest and truest reason for invalidating laws that discriminate against gays and lesbians. Moreover, unlike the ""marriage is a fundamental interest"" and irrationality arguments, the suspect classification argument renders all government discrimination against gays and lesbians presumptively unconstitutional -- as it should be. This argument cuts to the very heart of the issue and no longer skirts around the edges of the problem. It is my hope that the Court will embrace this argument and thereby put government-sponsored discrimination against gays and lesbians to rest, once and for all.I'd like to conclude with two final observations. First, perhaps foolishly, I am an irrepressible optimist. I tend to believe in progress, especially in the realm of discrimination. When we think back over the past hundred years, America has made great strides in addressing, though surely not solving, issues of discrimination based on race, gender, religion, and now sexual orientation. I am proud of the role that lawyers, law professors, and judges have played in helping this progress along. It is important not to take this achievement for granted. Twenty-five years ago, no one in this room would have imagined that the Supreme Court of the United States would hold that homosexuals have a constitutional right to marry one another. In truth, this is remarkable.It is also important to understand the central role courts have played in this progress. As of now, same-sex marriage is legal in thirty-seven states. But only 11 of those states have voluntarily chosen to legalize same-sex marriage by legislation. But for the role of courts, thirty-nine states would still forbid same-sex couples to marry. Moreover, because almost all of those states have adopted state constitutional amendments forbidding same-sex marriage, even a majority of the citizens of those states could not legalize same-sex marriage through legislation if they wished to do so. In such circumstances, the role of courts in interpreting and applying the Constitution is essential. My second and final point looks to the future. For most of American history religion controlled the law on issues like sexual expression, contraception, abortion, and homosexuality. Traditional Christian values dictated the content of our laws. In the last half century, though, due largely, though not entirely, to the Supreme Court, those Christian values have been pushed aside, and individuals have been freed to act on their own personal and religious beliefs, rather than dictated to by the religious beliefs of others.This is a great achievement in a society dedicated to the separation of church and state. But it now leaves us with an interesting challenge. For our Constitution also guarantees the freedom to practice one's religion, and with the demise of the religious state, those who hold to traditional Christian values find themselves on the defensive. No longer able to dictate that others must act in accord with their religious beliefs, they now demand that they be permitted to act in accord with their own beliefs. Hobby Lobby demands the right not to provide certain contraceptives to its women employees, Catholic priests demand the right not to marry same-sex couples, and florists, bakers, hotels owners, and restaurant owners demand the right not to participate in same-sex weddings. These are not easy questions for one who values both the separation of church and state and the freedom of religion, as I do.But those are questions for another day. For now, we are where we are, and we are, quite simply, on the threshold on an exciting new era in human dignity. I can't wait to see the celebrations!"

I stood by the pond in Hyde Park watching the swans and crisp bare trees surrounding me and realized that spring was here. Nothing to preempt it. No warning. Just one gorgeous morning to announce its arrival. A bright yellow daffodil bloomed at the entrance of the park. It's been quite a few years since I've spent so many winter months in London at one stretch, and I finally remembered how good it felt to wake up and realize that winter is finally over. The first day of spring - a day to let go, exhale, to breathe it all out and then to take a deep lungful breath of change.This morning, I felt inspired to making these delicious sun-drenched chewy chocolate date squares macaroons topped with coconut and strawberry maple sauce drizzled with raw melted chocolate. They're lightly spiced with fresh ginger juice and turmeric powder just to add an extra handful of health; and with the strawberry sauce, they simply spring to life in color, taste and everything!  Makes around 10 piecesThe ListBase 40g cashews 100g dates 1 teaspoon flaxseed oil ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder 2 teaspoons cacao powder ½ teaspoon ginger powder 1 teaspoon ginger juice 15g cacao butter Coconut topping 60g coconut flakes 2 tablespoons maple syrup Strawberry maple compote 2 large strawberries 2 tablespoons water 1 tablespoon maple syrup 1 tablespoon coconut flakes 15g raw chocolateMethod Start by blending the cashews so that it becomes a fine powder. This should take less than a minute in a high-speed blender. Put the dates, cashew nut powder and the rest of the ingredients in a pan and stir on low heat until all the dates are melted and it becomes one thick consistency (5 minutes).

I stood by the pond in Hyde Park watching the swans and crisp bare trees surrounding me and realized that spring was here. Nothing to preempt it. No warning. Just one gorgeous morning to announce its arrival. A bright yellow daffodil bloomed at the entrance of the park. It's been quite a few years since I've spent so many winter months in London at one stretch, and I finally remembered how good it felt to wake up and realize that winter is finally over. The first day of spring - a day to let go, exhale, to breathe it all out and then to take a deep lungful breath of change.This morning, I felt inspired to making these delicious sun-drenched chewy chocolate date squares macaroons topped with coconut and strawberry maple sauce drizzled with raw melted chocolate. They're lightly spiced with fresh ginger juice and turmeric powder just to add an extra handful of health; and with the strawberry sauce, they simply spring to life in color, taste and everything!

(AP Photo/Gerry Broome)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae57bd240000320054e456.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have used a controversial speech at the school to launch a broader conversation about feeling unsafe on campus. The UNC College Republicans invited conservative writer David Horowitz to speak at the school on April 13. In his speech, Horowitz said the Muslim Students Association and Students for Justice in Palestine are associated with terrorist organizations, reports the campus newspaper, the Daily Tar Heel. Horowitz added that SJP and the MSA -- along with the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, Fatah, Iran and Hezbollah -- intend to ""kill the Jews, to push them into the sea.""""These accusations are harmful not only to members of these organizations but also to our community as a whole,"" student body president Houston Summers wrote in a letter to the editor. After Horowitz's speech, some UNC students began an online campaign called #NotSafeUNC to show how they have felt discriminated against on and around campus. The campaign is not just for Arab and Muslim students, but for any student who identifies as a marginalized person.Horowitz's speech came two months after members of a Muslim family -- Deah Barakat, 23, Yusor Abu-Salha, 21, and Razan Abu-Salha, 19 -- were killed in Chapel Hill by Craig Hicks, who will face a death penalty trial. The killings caused a strong reaction among Muslim and Arab students nationwide, who saw them as an indication that they may not be safe, even when on or near a campus.The speech also comes during a school year that, nationwide, has seen increased attention to marginalization and microaggressions -- for example, though the proliferation of the #BlackLivesMatter movement on college campuses. Farris Barakat, brother of Deah Barakat, responded to #NotSafeUNC by tweeting that his brother died because ""freedom of speech has been used to defame Muslims through lies. Speak up.""""In no way did the UNC College Republicans intend to cause feelings of fear for any student,"" the College Republicans said in a statement. ""Being uncomfortable with something that’s said does not equate with being unsafe, and we intended to do nothing more than cause academic discomfort by inviting David Horowitz to UNC.""The statement also listed five former MSA affiliates who were connected to terrorism since the early 1980s. ""Let it be published, that UNC Muslim Students Association (UNC MSA) is not a terrorist group, nor is it affiliated with or funded by any terrorist groups,"" the MSA said in its own statement. ""It is absurd that we even need to make this statement.""Following Horowitz's comments, UNC College Republicans' chairman, Frank Pray, suggested that the school's MSA and SJP be reformed, according to the Daily Tar Heel. Pray did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.In response, SJP leaders wrote, ""Pray’s call for MSA and SJP to be 'reformed' in light of Horowitz’s unsubstantiated assertions is paternalistic and groundless.""""[Controversial speakers] create a hostile learning environment for Muslim and Arab-American students, and that's what they're designed to do,"" Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told HuffPost. ""They’re designed to demonize Muslim and Arab students.""Students who have participated in the #NotSafeUNC campaign are facing backlash on Twitter from people arguing their points, calling them weak, and generally trolling.Hooper said CAIR supports the students' campaign.""We support anyone, anywhere, who challenges bigotry and intolerance,"" he said. ""It seems wherever Mr. Horowitz goes, bigotry and intolerance follows.""See examples of #NotSafeUNC tweets below, and read more at @NotSafeUNC:"

It was a trip that would set his professional life on a new and exciting path: he was to become one of the first surgeons trained through the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Global Competency-Based Fistula Surgery Training Program. This is the world's first and only internationally recognized fistula training program, based on a path-breaking manual developed for the treatment of obstetric fistula, a childbirth injury suffered most commonly by poor women who give birth in places without access to emergency obstetric care.  Dr. Ganesh (pictured right) attending the FIGO fistula training program.  An obstetric fistula occurs when a woman's labor becomes obstructed and constant pressure from the baby's head on the pelvis cuts off the flow of oxygenated blood, causing tissue to die. As a result, a hole develops that causes her to become incontinent. The smell of the incontinence too often spurs her husband to leave and the community to abandon her. She sometimes thinks it's her fault, believing she's cursed. Even worse, her child usually does not survive. This injury devastates the lives of one million women globally.  Fistula can be complicated for a surgeon to repair. While some cases can be treated quickly, in under one hour, more often than not, treatment requires a surgeon with advanced skills and sometimes even several rounds of surgery to complete. In the hands of a surgeon whose level of skill does not meet the complexity of the injury, more harm can be done to the patient than good. This is why it is so critical for fistula surgeons to be properly trained, and is what prompted FIGO to develop its training manual.  When the manual was released in 2011, Fistula Foundation worked with FIGO and our partners at Johnson & Johnson to develop and fund surgical training fellowships that would help increase the pool of skilled surgeons in places where fistula was most common. Dr. Gangal was was a fastidious student who paid meticulous attention to every detail of his training. He completed the program with high praise from instructors and returned home eager to implement his newly minted skills. But his operating conditions were far less than ideal.   In his operating room at the Kathmandu Model Hospital, the table on which Dr. Gangal performs fistula surgeries is 50 years old. The hand cranks that raise and lower the bed no longer work, which can make for awkward and less than desirable operating conditions. It's the kind of operating table that many surgeons would complain about using, or perhaps use as an excuse to avoid operating at all. But Dr. Gangal carries on, treating poor women who are suffering and giving them a new chance at life.  Kathmandu Model Hospital  Learning about Dr. Gangal's operating table, and hearing, too, from other surgeon trainees who shared obstacles to their work, we realized: if we were going to invest in a surgeon's training, it should be equally as important to invest in that surgeon's success back home. That's why our support for fistula surgeons is not limited to training and operating room equipment. We also fund patient transportation to hospitals, stipends that entice nurses to work extra hours to care for recovering fistula patients, and even the development and distribution of community-specific outreach materials that will help women and their families understand that fistula is a treatable condition and that treatment is locally available.  Dr. Gangal will soon have a brand new operating table. And, to further ensure that the surgeries he provides are as safe as possible, we will also be providing a new set of lights for his operating room. We hope that he will never have to operate on a bad operating table or in bad lighting again.   Fistula Foundation works with FIGO, Johnson & Johnson and so many other partners to transform the lives of women who suffer from obstetric fistula. We've done that together in a number of ways, in a number of places, but we're confident that by forging ahead to invest in surgeons and their ability to apply the training we helping them to receive, this be one of our best investments yet. Kate Grant is CEO of Fistula Foundation, which works in 29 countries to treat women who suffer from the childbirth injury obstetric fistula.

The fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, feeds on soft tissues of bats such as their wings and noses. Little Brown Bat with white-nose syndrome  Credit: Jonathan Mays, Wildlife Biologist, Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and WildlifeWhite Nose Syndrome was first discovered in Haile's Cave at John Boyd Thacher State Park by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation during a routine bat survey in March 2007. The earliest evidence of the disease in North America can be seen in photographs taken by a cave hydrologist at Howe Caverns in Schoharie County, New York in the winter of 2006. New York State DEC states that since March 2007 ""we discovered the disease in every hibernation site in New York in which we have looked for it."" The U.S. Fish & Wildlife estimates a death toll between 5-7 million bats based on the most recent survey conducted in 2012. Impacts of the disease on hibernating bats have varied between species. According to the NYS DEC, ""the Northern long-eared bat and the tri-colored bat are most impacted. Observed declines for these species exceed 95 percent on a statewide basis. The little brown bat, once very common, has declined about 90 percent. The Indian bat, a species that was considered endangered even prior to white-nose, has been slightly less affected as a percentage, exhibiting perhaps 70 percent decline statewide.""  Bats exhibiting Pseudogymnoascus destructans fungus on their muzzles. This fungus causes WNS in bats. Photo Courtesy of Nancy Heaslip, New York Department of Environmental ConservationMichelle Verant, Post Doc at the USGS National Wildlife Center at the University of Wisconsin, published a study this past December on how the disease progresses from initial infection to mortality in bats. Verant states ""bats have reduced immune function in hibernation, making them susceptible to the disease."" The study found that the fungus fluctuates in growth substantially based on temperature with ideal conditions between 12-15 degrees Celsius (53-59 degrees Fahrenheit). Those conditions also happen to be the body temperature range of most bats during hibernation. The fungus inhibits the bat's ability to release CO2 from their bodies. Verant attributes the increased energy use during infection to high levels of built up CO2 found in infected bats. She states, ""as the fungus feeds on the bats soft tissues, it increases the metabolic rate of the bats compounded with the damage to the wings that aid in passive release of CO2 from the bat."" The spike in C02 levels in the bats causes them to hyperventilate, increasing arousal frequencies during hibernation, leading to fatal starvation.The fungus most likely originated in Europe. Jeff Foster of the Department of Molecular, Cellular and Biomedical Sciences at the University of New Hampshire, is one of the leading researchers genetically tracing the origins of the fungus. His lab results have demonstrated that the North American strain and European strains of the fungus do not produce mortality in European bats, but both do so in North American bats. Based on his findings, Foster hypothesizes that episodes of mass mortality in European bat populations have historically occurred until bats developed immunity to the disease and that small numbers of surviving bats in North America will likely do the same. He states ""the genetic testing of the fungus in Europe suggests that is has existed there for millennia, whereas the North American variation of the fungus strongly suggests it was introduced very recently as very little genetic variability has occurred."" Foster and many other researchers suspect that the fungus was brought over from Europe inadvertently on cave gear or clothing. This suspicion has led to strict regulations on cave access throughout potentially affected areas. At Mammoth Cave National Park, White Nose Syndrome has affected the visitor procedures for entering and leaving the caves since the emergence of the disease in New York. According to Rickard S. Toomey III, Director of Mammoth Cave International Center for Science and Learning, From 2008 until the winter of 2010-2011, park efforts on White Nose Syndrome spread prevention focused on keeping people from bringing the fungus that causes White Nose Syndrome into park caves. Visitors were screened to see if they had visited other caves since 2005. Those that had were asked about their shoes and clothing. If necessary, shoes were treated with a cleaning solution to kill any fungal spores that might be on them.In 2011, the existence of White Nose Syndrome was confirmed in the state of Kentucky, and the park's precautionary efforts extended to requiring all visitors who went on walking tours to sanitize their shoes on bio-security mats in case the fungus existed at the park undetected. From 2011 until Spring 2014, spread prevention efforts simultaneously targeted preventing the fungus from coming to the park with people and preventing people from leaving the park with viable fungus (in case it was already there, but undetected). By spring 2014, White Nose Syndrome was confirmed on tour routes. Toomey states ""since 2014, primary concern with spread has been to minimize potential for visitors to spread the fungus to other sites after visiting Mammoth Cave."" Some colonial bat roosts in the park have been closed to most access, to reduce potentially spreading the disease and exacerbating the disease in infected bats. On cave crawling tours Toomey states, ""we no longer allow people to use their own caving gear. The park supplies coveralls, pads, helmets, lights, and gloves. These gear are only used on these tours and do not leave the park. Visitors use their own boots, but the boots are cleaned following the tours. The gear restriction addresses both the potential for people to accidentally bring the fungus into the cave and keeps people from leaving with it, now that the fungus is here."" The gear and access restrictions, according to Toomey, have not significantly impacted park attendance.National White Nose Syndrome Coordinator at U.S. Fish and Wildlife, Jeremy Coleman, was a graduate research assistant at Cornell University when White Nose Syndrome first emerged. In 2008, a meeting in Albany, New York brought together Federal, State, Non-Government and research organizations to develop a response plan to the epidemic. The Northeast Regional U.S. Fish & Wildlife office in Hadley, Massachusetts was designated the lead in overseeing the National response. According to Coleman, ""The disease is still advancing and has been confirmed in 25 U.S. States and five Canadian Provinces to date, with pending lab results that may add another three states to that map. Bats can travel hundreds of miles from their roosting sites, so the impacts of the disease affect their entire range and not just the counties in which their roosting/hibernating sites reside. The disease isn't going away anytime soon.""Reports of the disease have decreased this year in the Midwest, but Director of Imperiled Species at Bat Conservation International Katie Gillies states, ""the decrease in the Midwest is due to bat movement patterns rather than any actual decline in the spread of White Nose Syndrome."" Gillies cites the biggest breakthrough in fighting the disease of recent has been the research on creating a biological control for the disease.Possible hope for the bats is in development. At Georgia State University's Crow Laboratory, Chris Cornelison was conducting research with the bacteria Rhodococcus to delay the ripening of fruit. His findings showed a significant decrease in fungal growth on the fruit and he was curious as to whether it could produce the same results on bats infected with White Nose Syndrome. In conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service, his research has demonstrated that the bacteria stop germination of the fungus on bat tissue without any negative effects. His team developed a nebulizer to distribute the bacteria at a very low cost and recently conducted a field trial at four sites in Kentucky. Cornelison states that ""the field trial results have yet to be published, but regardless of how well it works, the diverse environments that bats inhabit throughout North America call for a diversity of tools needed to combat White Nose Syndrome so that the resource management of each particular jurisdiction can utilize the right tool to mitigate the impacts of the disease for each specific ecosystem.""Official White Nose Syndrome Website http://www.whitenosesyndrome.org"

However, there's no glory, because when the cheer team takes the field or the floor, it is in support of the football or the basketball team. Thus, it requires a type of selflessness and humility that is rare in NCAA Division I collegiate athletes.",2015-04-24,2015-04-23-1429773219-9591499-FNLjumpsPrecision_Image_004.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-23-1429773219-9591499-FNLjumpsPrecision_Image_004-thumb.jpg,"Like most things in the past 30 years, the face of cheerleading has drastically changed. The days of the cutesy, scantily clad girl with an indelible smile, randomly shaking her pompoms on the sidelines, are gone. Today, cheerleaders are highly skilled, well-trained, disciplined student-athletes who combine gymnastics, acrobatics and choreography in complex routines that rival Cirque du Soleil. The new millennium brings fearless girls putting themselves in positions that would make Gumby scream, while flying through the air in perfect synchronicity to land high atop multi-level human pyramids, and guys with the upper-body strength of alpha-male apes, effortlessly holding the girls above their heads with one hand. Then they fluidly transition into meticulously choreographed flips, jumps, and dance moves with the precision of German technology, while helping the crowd support the team. Anatomy of a ChampionThe University of Michigan's cheer team won its third consecutive Intermediate Coed Collegiate Division I National Championship at the National Cheerleading Association (NCA) College Nationals held in Florida earlier this month. They beat the runner-up by eight 100ths of a point. Yes, cheerleading has become that serious, and that competitive.""We were in third place going into the finals,"" says Pam St. John, who has coached cheerleading for more than 30 years. ""The competition was tough. We had to change our routine at the last minute to secure the win. Being able to do that speaks to our kids' mental toughness."" Michigan's academic reputation, athletic tradition and reasonable tuition have always made it a top choice among the nation's elite students. Joining the Common Application has increased that 10-fold and may account for the sheer mental toughness the competitors displayed in their comeback title win. ""The academic environment at Michigan is much tougher than it has ever been,"" St. John says. ""These kids are extremely bright, which, with proper training, makes the best student-athletes. As a coach, I never expect to win, but I am never surprised when we do.""She went on to say, ""As science advances and we learn more about ourselves and our bodies, we better understand how humans function as athletes. This allows for better training results and, subsequently, better athletic performances.""Coach St. John also credits former Athletic Director David Brandon for a large part of Michigan Cheerleading's rise to national prominence. ""He made facilities and resources available for the Cheer and Dance teams that we simply never had before."" she says.St. John feels that she and her assistant coaches couldn't have achieved their success without the resources that Brandon's vision provided. A Different RewardMichigan's football and basketball team have one season per school year; the cheer team's season encompasses them both, spanning from the middle of August to mid April. This represents a 15- to 20-hour weekly time commitment. One might ask: Why would a student in a very academically competitive environment like Michigan devote the time and effort cheerleading requires?""Unlike other varsity sports, there are no big rewards down the line in terms of multimillion-dollar pay-offs. The rewards of cheerleading lie in the life skills you acquire, such as gaining an understanding and respect for the value of teamwork,"" explains St. John. Does the coach think Michigan would win a fourth straight national championship? ""I don't know,"" St. John says. ""It depends on the students and how driven they are to achieve it. I think it is possible; ask me next year. Every team is different. Sometimes the rewards are in the destination; other times they lie in the journey.""Jim Harbaugh, Michigan's head football coach, said that as a freshman, he asked Bo Schembechler if the coach thought the football team would be good. Schembechler responded, ""I will know in 20 years when I see what type of husbands and fathers you have become."" ""It doesn't take me 20 years,"" says St. John. ""I know what kind of person I am dealing with when I see who shows up early to practice or who stays after and makes sure things are put away; this is important because I teach life lessons through cheerleading."" Not only is that a noble approach; it's refreshing. It hasn't distracted from Michigan's competitiveness either, considering the school won the NCA Collegiate Intermediate Coed National Championships in 2013, 2014 and now 2015. The Bigger PictureCheerleading is a unique sport in that it focuses on supporting other athletes. Still, it requires serious discipline and more hours of hard work and training than most other collegiate sports. However, there's no glory, because when the cheer team takes the field or the floor, it is in support of the football or the basketball team. Thus, it requires a type of selflessness and humility that is rare in NCAA Division I collegiate athletes. You will never read in the sports pages how many double-downs, basket tosses, herkies, or helicopters the cheerleaders executed. However, it matters -- to the crowd, and ultimately to the team playing.More importantly, before, during and after the game, humans are a social species. There is no better example of our social nature than one group of people working hard to function as a cohesive unit (the cheerleaders) to encourage another group of people (the crowd) to galvanize a third group of people (the team) to achieve a common goal. So, in essence, cheerleading is an acrobatic, well-choreographed artistic expression of our basic social nature. Perhaps this is why cheerleaders can put in so much hard work without the motivation of the future multimillion-dollar rewards that often inspire other NCAA Division 1 athletes. Or perhaps cheerleaders realize that the past and the future are only valid when they are the present. Also valid: the uniform ($300), the megaphone ($50), the pompoms ($20). The life lesson: Teamwork and encouraging others is what nature intended for humans to do -- priceless.Photos courtesy of University of Michigan CheerleadingDr. Gordon on Psychology TodayDr. Gordon at the Center for the Neurobiology of Stress at UCLA Dr. Gordon's website"
