Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin, D-Ill., make their way to a news conference in the Capitol on the administration's strategy for combating ISIL, September 11, 2014. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dac0260000300183bc30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats who aren't running for re-election this year and those who have retired were sitting on nearly $52 million in campaign cash at the end of September, even as their party's candidates are slogging through a difficult electoral cycle.That untouched pot of money has become a sore subject for Democratic strategists, several of whom privately complained that the lawmakers were risking the Senate majority to protect their own hides. What's further agitated these strategists is that some Democratic senators who are running for re-election with comfortable leads have also stashed away cash while their colleagues struggle in tight races. ""We all get multiple daily desperate emails begging for money, especially as Democrats are on the verge of losing the Senate,"" said one top strategist who, like the others, would only speak about the matter anonymously for fear of retribution. ""Meanwhile, some senators are sitting on millions while colleagues like [Georgia candidate Michelle] Nunn and [Iowa candidate Rep. Bruce] Braley are fighting for their political lives and to keep the majority.""Complaints about the generosity of individual lawmakers are an element of every single campaign. The gripes expressed here have arisen in cycles past; they will in cycles future. What is irksome for party officials, however, is that the situation for Democrats in 2014 is so dire. The electoral map is large and fluctuating, and as the midterm campaigns enter their closing days, operatives want to be running hard in states like Georgia or Iowa without having to take resources away from other close contests. Two officials told The Huffington Post that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), unhappy with the contributions so far, has been pushing his members to give more cash to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The complaints aren't directed at one individual senator. Several names have come up in conversations. Among them are Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who is sitting on more than $2.37 million in campaign cash even though he is retiring; Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who has more than $12.8 million in his campaign account saved for his race in 2016; former Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), who has more than $9.8 million in his campaign account despite having left office in 2010; and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who had $4.7 million cash on hand at the end of September while facing an easy re-election contest. ""It's astonishing that 10 days before the election, the No. 2 in Senate leadership is sitting on that kind of money as Democrats get outspent across the country,"" said the aforementioned strategist. In an email statement to The Huffington Post, the DSCC defended the amount of money donated by Senate Democrats and noted that members have contributed to the committee's work in other ways.“Democratic senators have been fully supportive of our efforts this cycle, traveling the country, giving generously from their campaigns and raising directly for the DSCC,” said Matt Canter, the committee's deputy executive director.For the lawmakers, meanwhile, there is a second side to each of these stories. Schumer, for example, has donated $1 million to the DSCC (more than any other member). His office said he has also helped raise nearly another $2.7 million for candidates. Moreover, while he seems likely to coast to victory in heavily Democratic New York come 2016, running in the Empire State is a pricey proposition, with the second most expensive media market after California.Durbin is actually running for re-election. Though he is almost certain to win, he's spending heavily, his campaign said. The $4.7 million cash on hand at the end of September is $400,000 cash on hand now, campaign spokesman Ron Holmes told The Huffington Post. That was after $250,000 was transferred to ""help efforts of Democratic candidates running for Senate"" during the last 10 days. Beyond the transfers, Durbin has also raised more than $2 million for the DSCC, Holmes said.There are other Senate Democrats in relatively easy races who seem to have cash to spare. Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) had $3 million at the end of September; Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) had nearly $3.5 million at the end of September. Harkin isn't running for office now or in the next cycle. But he is hoping to start a policy center after he leaves office in January. Since Congress outlawed earmarks, he needs a pool of cash to do it. Politico first reported that Harkin's refusal to throw more money behind Braley, his potential successor, has irked Reid. Harkin and Reid have discussed the matter in several tense meetings. On Thursday, Bayh told The Huffington Post that he had been generous with his remaining campaign funds, having transferred roughly $1.5 million over the last three years to other Democrats. Part of the reason he wasn't doing more, he said, was that he was advised ""by former colleagues who retired and had given significant money to some of the committees"" that those donations went unappreciated. But the other reason he wasn't doing more was less personal and more political. ""I'm in my 50s. Most of the other people [holding on to cash] are in their early 70s,"" said Bayh. ""So I don't know what the future might hold. I don't think it makes a lot of sense closing doors."" Asked if he was planning a future run for office, he added, ""I think the chances of that are not high. But you just never know.""Bayh is hardly the only retired member with money in the bank. Former Sen. Ken Salazar (D-Colo.) has $1.2 million in campaign funds that has been left (so far) unused. Former Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), who now serves as the U.S. ambassador to China, has $1.08 million. Retiring Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) has $848,000 in his campaign fund even as the race to replace him has become a three-way tossup. It stands to reason that in a state like South Dakota, a few hundred thousand dollars could actually make a difference. Contributions from the campaign accounts of senators have generally not been a huge source of money for the DSCC or its Republican counterpart. House party committees are generally more reliant on such contributions as there are far more representatives running in uncompetitive races with funds to spare.Some Democratic senators are using other avenues to help their party's efforts. A leadership PAC affiliated with Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) has given $150,000 to Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC supporting Democratic senators, and another $50,000 to a super PAC supporting the re-election of Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.). Senate Majority PAC also received $250,000 of his own money from Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) and $100,000 from Durbin's campaign.Not everyone, moreover, is convinced that money is the solution -- or, rather, that lack of it is a major problem. This cycle has seen historic levels of spending by both campaigns and outside groups. Airing another series of television ads in the closing days may make a difference on the margins. But the likelihood is that most voters have either tuned out or made up their minds. ""Democrats in key Senate races and their allies have enough money,"" said one long-serving Democratic operative. ""Maybe not as much as the other side, but enough to buy enough ads to make every swing voter's eyes bleed. They need to focus on free media, debates and GOTV ['get out the vote' efforts]. I just hate whining. It's a sure sign someone is trying to divert attention from their own mistakes and failings."" This post was updated with a comment from the DSCC."

No one under 21 would be able to buy cigarettes in New York City under a proposal unveiled Monday, April 22, 2013 to make the city the most populous place in America to set the minimum age that high. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8daa32200004301dd7d55.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Northern California city has become the first in the state to approve raising the minimum age for tobacco purchases.Healdsburg, California's city council voted 4-1 Monday to raise the age threshold required for tobacco purchases from 18 to 21. (California state law mandates that no tobacco products or paraphernalia are sold to anyone under 18.) Healdsburg, a popular Sonoma County wine country destination, will require individuals purchasing cigarettes, chewing tobacco or other tobacco products to be 21 years of age or older. Electronic cigarettes are also included in the ban. Pending a second city council vote, the ordinance is set to take effect in early December.""This is about trying to save people's lives -- prevent disease,"" Healdsburg Mayor Jim Wood said, according to the Press Democrat. ""I see more young people than ever before smoking. It's distressing.""The legislation's proponents, including the American Lung Association, hope that the new regulations will discourage young people from picking up a tobacco habit. According to a U.S. Surgeon General's report released earlier this year, 88 percent of adults who use tobacco began smoking before they were 18 years old. And if the current smoking rate persists nationally, an estimated 5.6 million Americans who are currently younger than 18 will die of a smoking-related illness.Last year, New York City became the first major American city to raise the legal tobacco purchase age from 18 to 21. While California legislators considered a similar move in 2002, the effort ultimately failed. No other city in the Golden State has succeeded in passing a similar ban.The Healdsburg ordinance will ban pharmacies, as well as supermarkets like Safeway that have pharmacies, from selling cigarettes -- a practice that began six years ago in nearby San Francisco. Earlier this year, CVS Caremark Corp announced it would stop selling tobacco products at its 7,600 stores across the country, and has put pressure on other pharmacies to follow suit.The Healdsburg legislation also requires that retailers obtain a new city license for tobacco sales, with an estimated $450 annual fee to help enforce the new regulations.City Councilman Gary Plass, who cast the only dissenting vote against the ordinance, argued that the law could easily be skirted by underage smokers willing to drive a few miles to buy cigarettes in another town, and would put local retailers at an economic disadvantage. ""The four miles of Healdsburg has no business doing what no other city in California has done ... not even San Francisco,"" he said, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.Advocates for the ban, however, argued that Healdsburg could be a trendsetter and inspire other California cities to adopt similar regulations.""Anything we can do to turn the tide on smoking, we have an obligation to do,"" Councilman Tom Chambers said."

One day when everything seems great. Just one day. One news day where the news is so good that it is the story of the day. A day that excites all Americans, whether they are Republicans, Democrats, or any other political persuasion. The news is so good that all the news coverage is overwhelmed by this wonderful event. Fox News and MSNBC both agree with wild joyous reports, as well as the networks, and even the dour Rush Limbaugh. And no talking head can pick apart this good news because it's just too good.You might ask, what news could be this good? Well, there were days in our past when we all joined together in mutual enthusiasm. V-J Day: Americans throughout the country took to the streets in wild celebration. I don't believe there was one opposition report that day complaining about various issues, like the cost of the war, or should we have dropped the bomb. Not on that day. Maybe the next day. But that was one day of sheer bliss, pure happiness. Or what about Armstrong's walk on the moon? That was a good day. It didn't include any news on the darker side. The news didn't begin with ""Armstrong walks on the moon, the stock market drops, and somebody killed in crash on the GW Bridge."" Not on that day. That day was a good news day. Even the good reports begin to sound like bad news nowadays. There was a good report on unemployment dropping to its lowest point since 2008, but that got beaten up quickly and then so quickly forgotten I was unsure if it was good news. So was that good news? Was it sort of good news?This fall it appears Americans are willing to give up voting privileges, women's rights, increases in minimum wages, health plans, educational grants and a long laundry list that would prove beneficial to their own interests as they most likely vote Republican because they are being taught that the present is frightening... the future is frightening. The future is an unknown enemy. Negativity sells. Negativity is a vote magnet. The Democrats aren't very adept at spreading any good news to counteract, perhaps too fearful that a positive outlook will only bring down the wrath of indignation from the Republicans. And since the goal is winning, be cautious. Don't speak out against the wave of discontent from the opposition. Only Elizabeth Warren, the democratic senator from Massachusetts, speaks her mind. Stands against the tide and believes America can do better. A woman who speaks a positive message of how we can better the social and economic fabric of our country. A woman who has a vision of a better America, of what we can accomplish together. Hopeful. Positive.I will sum it all up with this one story. A number of years ago I read a report on the weak dollar versus the British pound. I am not an economist, but it went something like this: The pound was apparently too strong against the dollar and it was affecting the trade deficit, or something like that. Months later I read that the dollar was now too strong against the pound, once again affecting the trade deficient but now in the opposite direction. The dollar went from being too low to too high! How is that possible? On its way from being too low to too high, doesn't it have to pass through ""just right""? Here was a chance to celebrate that one day of the balance being just perfect and they didn't even tell us. Why didn't we celebrate that one day? THE EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN ENGLAND AND THE U.S IS PERFECT, SAY ECONOMISTS! A good news day, a small celebration at best, but a celebration never the less. And believe me, there must be more good news out there, that's the only one I knew about."

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e5c8f2600003200803e17.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Julie Steenhuysen and Sharon BegleyCHICAGO/NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The Ebola crisis is forcing the American healthcare system to consider the previously unthinkable: withholding some medical interventions because they are too dangerous to doctors and nurses and unlikely to help a patient.U.S. hospitals have over the years come under criticism for undertaking measures that prolong dying rather than improve patients' quality of life.But the care of the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the United States, who received dialysis and intubation and infected two nurses caring for him, is spurring hospitals and medical associations to develop the first guidelines for what can reasonably be done and what should be withheld.Officials from at least three hospital systems interviewed by Reuters said they were considering whether to withhold individual procedures or leave it up to individual doctors to determine whether an intervention would be performed.Ethics experts say they are also fielding more calls from doctors asking what their professional obligations are to patients if healthcare workers could be at risk.U.S. health officials meanwhile are trying to establish a network of about 20 hospitals nationwide that would be fully equipped to handle all aspects of Ebola care.Their concern is that poorly trained or poorly equipped hospitals that perform invasive procedures will expose staff to bodily fluids of a patient when they are most infectious. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working with kidney specialists on clinical guidelines for delivering dialysis to Ebola patients. The recommendations could come as early as this week.The possibility of withholding care represents a departure from the ""do everything"" philosophy in most American hospitals and a return to a view that held sway a century ago, when doctors were at greater risk of becoming infected by treating dying patients.""This is another example of how this 21st century viral threat has pulled us back into the 19th century,"" said medical historian Dr. Howard Markel of the University of Michigan.Some ethicists and physicians take issue with the shift.Because the world has almost no experience treating Ebola patients in state-of-the-art facilities rather than the rudimentary ones in Africa, there are no reliable data on when someone truly is beyond help, whether dialysis can make the difference between life and death, or even whether cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can be done safely with proper protective equipment and protocols.Such procedures ""may have diminishing effectiveness as the severity of the disease increases, but we simply have no data on that,"" said Dr. G. Kevin Donovan, director of the bioethics center at Georgetown University.Donovan said he had received inquiries from fellow physicians about whether hospitals should draw up lists of procedures that would not be performed on an Ebola patient. ""To have a blanket refusal to offer these procedures is not ethically acceptable,"" he said he told the doctors.NEW GUIDELINESNevertheless, discussions about adopting policies to withhold care in Ebola cases are under way at places like Geisinger Health System, which operates hospitals in Pennsylvania, and Intermountain Healthcare, which runs facilities in Utah, according to their spokesmen.Dr Nancy Kass, a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said healthcare workers should not hesitate to perform a medically necessary procedure so long as they have robust personal protective gear.So far, only two U.S. hospitals have used kidney dialysis: Texas Health Presbyterian Dallas, which treated Liberian patient Thomas Duncan and where two nurses became infected, and Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which has treated four Ebola patients at its biocontainment unit without any healthcare workers becoming infected.Although it is not yet clear how the Dallas nurses became infected, health officials have questioned both the lack of adequate training in the use of protective gear and the decision to perform invasive procedures.The American Society of Nephrology and CDC are now working on new dialysis guidelines for Ebola patients, whose kidneys often fail. In some cases, dialysis can help a patient get through the worst of the illness until their own immune system can fend off the virus.Nephrologist Dr. Harold Franch said the new guidelines will consider both whether the procedure is medically necessary and whether the hospital can do it safely.""Most academic medical centers and many good private tertiary care hospitals will be able to do this,"" he said. Yet he thinks many hospitals may not offer the service, since ""it takes a lot of money and time to train people."" TREAT, OR FLEE?Throughout the history of medicine some doctors have declined to treat infectious patients or fled epidemics, said Michigan's Markel. Greek physician and philosopher Galen fled Rome during the bubonic plague 1,800 years ago, doctors deserted European cities stricken by the Black Death of the Middle Ages, and some health workers refused to treat HIV/AIDS patients in the 1980s.""The idea that a doctor would stick to his post to the last during an epidemic, that's not part of the Hippocratic Oath,"" Markel said. ""If you feel your life is at risk you don't have to stay and provide care.""At University of Chicago Medicine, questions of taking last-ditch measures were discussed early in the hospital's Ebola planning, said Dr. Emily Landon, a bioethicist and epidemiologist.Decisions about offering services such as dialysis or inserting a breathing tube are made in advance by the hospital's care team in consultation with patients. But if a doctor on the team feels in the moment that she cannot provide the service, another may step in and do the procedure.Landon views dialysis as a ""no brainer"" for Ebola patients, and believes the risks are fairly low to the well-trained nursing staff who have volunteered for the hospital's isolation ward.But putting in a breathing tube and putting them on a ventilator is more controversial.""We have very little experience with that except for Mr Duncan, who didn't do well,"" she said. The hospital plans to consult with patients before the need arises and plans to insert a breathing tube at the earliest sign that it might be needed.CPR, which is performed when a patient's breathing or heart stops, also poses risks. It can involve chest compressions, inserting breathing tubes and other invasive procedures.If a patient goes into cardiac or respiratory arrest, a team would have to don protective gear. Rushing could leave them without proper protection, but a delay could make the procedure ineffective.That represents too great a risk for caregivers for what could be ""a futile act,"" said Dr. Joseph Fins, chief of medical ethics at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.

It's been three years since 25-year-old Abdullah graduated college and struggled to find a job. It's been two years since he decided to give up on his engineering dream and become a hotel worker. And more than a year since his father and sister were murdered, victims of the military's bloody dispersal of an Islamist protest camp in Cairo, along with hundreds of other supporters of Mohamed Morsi, the ousted president. Abdullah says his days now blur together, but there was once a time when he had hope for something better. A time when it felt like anything was possible, and everyone in the streets knew what they stood for. ""The revolution shook us all, made us think life would be different and better, but it fooled us,"" he said as he finished his 10-hour shift at a rundown hotel in Assiut, one of the poorest areas of Egypt, 215 miles south of Cairo. ""We're still poor, even more poor, and there are no opportunities. I couldn't even travel to Cairo to see the dead body of my father because I couldn't miss work."" It's the new normal in Egypt, not much different than the old, with young people like Abdullah slowly emerging from the hangover of a revolution to find themselves still held down by the same oppressive gravity. And the would-be beneficiaries of Egypt's uprising -- who join millions of millennials worldwide still searching for a future, a group we call ""Generation TBD"" -- remain its neglected victims. No matter which country I report from across the Middle East and Africa, unemployment almost always tops the conversation, often trumping all other grievances that dominate headlines. Whether in Lebanon or Jordan, Nigeria or Malawi, youth cling passionately to a simple dream of finding meaningful work. In the impoverished Tunisian town of Sidi Bouzid, where an unemployed and frustrated 26-year-old Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire almost four years ago and sparked a revolution, sleepy cafes are still filled with scores of young men, all dressed up in pleather jackets with nowhere to go. All Bouazzi wanted was a job. Instead his action sparked a series of uprisings that devoured many of the youth who joined them.""We didn't even care about politics,"" Abdullah says, sharing stories with his colleagues about the initial days of the uprising in Egypt. All seem startled by how cold they feel recalling a warm memory. ""We just wanted more options. Now, it's all over.""Nearby in northern Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey, Generation TBD's troubles are exacerbated by the Syrian refugee crisis -- the most brutal humanitarian disaster in modern history. I've met countless youth in refugee camps and city centers, yearning to make something of themselves, to build among the ashes of their past.""If I was able to get a degree and then a proper engineering job, things would at least be manageable,"" says Hani, a 21-year-old Syrian refugee living in an informal refugee tent settlement in Lebanon. Back in Syria, he was a star-student. He had plans to study engineering at a top Syrian university on a full scholarship. ""Without education, without a job ... our lives are stalled like a car.""The dull buzz of that engine echoes more than 2,000 miles away in Nigeria -- the most populous country in Africa and the continent's largest economy. Earlier this year, as part of a reporting fellowship on youth unemployment hosted by The GroundTruth Project, colleague Chika Oduah and I focused on the country's similarly disenfranchised youth. At a time when the militant Islamist group Boko Haram rocked the world by kidnapping almost 300 girls, igniting the impassioned celebrity-endorsed ""Bring Back Our Girls"" campaign, we travelled the country focusing on an even larger enemy that Nigeria's government has failed to confront: devastating levels of unemployment, paired with a widespread sense of despair and frustration.Most Nigerians we spoke with said this acute lack of opportunities, amid a culture of government corruption and growing economic disparity, looms larger in their day-to-day lives than the perils of the Boko Haram insurgency. For many, Nigeria's staggering unemployment rate and inescapable cycle of poverty has meant a life of crime and violence. For others like 24-year-old entrepreneur Tayo Olufuwa, necessity is the mother of invention, and entrepreneurs are working to fill in the gaping holes the state has long ignored.""I just realized I could do something with my life,"" Olufuwa said, adjusting his black-rimmed glasses while explaining his business venture that connects young Nigerians with jobs. ""I could create solutions.""Those solutions are at the core of a major international conference on youth unemployment on Oct. 24 and 25, hosted by New York City's International House. The event will feature some of our work from Nigeria and the larger Generation TBD project with reporting from 21 fellows in 11 countries.In the coming weeks, GroundTruth will publish more of our work on young Nigerians like Olufuwa who have lost faith in in their government, and have often taken matters into their own hands. Their struggles are part of a larger, unhashtaggable fight for dignity -- one waged across the world by Generation TBD.Whether in Upper Egypt, Tunisia, Brazil or northern Nigeria, youth are struggling to dictate their own narratives. And we ought to listen to their rough drafts and half-starts, for Abdullah, Hani and Tayo's plotlines are more telling than any breaking news event or statistic. Their narratives are also our own and when jaggedly pieced together, they are maps to the future of a generation.This post is part of a series produced by The GroundTruth Project, presented in partnership with The Huffington Post and International House in conjunction with the Generation Jobless conference (Oct. 24-25, New York City). The event is a solutions-based conference, offering viable, real-world solutions to remedy the critical issue of global youth unemployment. For more information on the conference, read here.

They called it decimation, derived from the word ""tenth."" This discipline, of course, prompted all soldiers to police against desertion so as to save their own skins.New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley seems to have borrowed a piece of this incentive structure for a current financial situation. In a speech October 20, this key regulator of the nation's largest banks proposed that a major chunk of pay for all senior executives at a particular bank be forfeited when the bank violates the law. Specifically, Dudley proposes that part of senior bankers' pay be sequestered in a ""performance bond."" If the bank must pay a large fine, this bond is forfeited and paid as part of the fine. ""This would increase the financial incentive of those individuals who are best placed to identify bad activities at an early stage, or prevent them from occurring in the first place."" Making bankers pay for fraud may stifle a replay of one of the glaring judicial miscarriages following the response to the financial crisis of 2008. Despite the massive frauds subsequently documented by the Department of Justice, no senior executives faced penalties. The billion dollar fines meted out by the DOJ were, in fact, borne by shareholders innocent of any conspiracy. Prosecutors have offered varying reasons for this indefensible result, including the recent excuse offered by James Cole, who just retired as Deputy Attorney General at the DOJ: The fraudsters were ""rocket scientists"" who simply outsmarted the prosecutors. Under the Dudley scheme, even if the DOJ failed to track down some of the guilty individuals, all the senior bankers at a firm would nevertheless suffer at least some financial pain. Dudley isn't alone in thinking about the links between compensation and bad or risky behavior. Federal Reserve Board Gov. Daniel Tarullo offered parallel remarks at the same Oct. 20 conference. ""It is important that compensation arrangements, including clawback and forfeiture provisions, cover risks associated with market conduct.""Dudley and Tarullo are centrist figures, not outliers. Dudley worked for Goldman Sachs. Tarullo heads the Fed's bank regulation effort. Happily, this idea enjoys a vehicle. One of the last remaining interagency rules required from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act requires regulators to adopt compensation packages that remove incentives for bankers to take ""inappropriate"" risks. This is known in the law as Section 956. Tarullo made specific reference to this Section 956 in his speech. Criminal activity is certainly an ""inappropriate"" risk. Putting pay on the line for criminal behavior may reduce the cozy deals the DOJ cuts with mega-banks in what is called the deferred prosecution agreement. HSBC violated money laundering laws and JP Morgan participated in the Madoff Ponzi scheme but the DOJ settled both outside of a trial with deferred prosecution agreements. If such agreements mean the entire class of senior bankers at a firm must take a major pay cut, the bankers may choose instead to take their chance on trial in the hope of winning acquittal and protecting their pay. In turn, that could force prosecutors to bring welcome trials and true convictions of criminal bankers. Bad Wall Street pay practices led to the financial crash. In Dudley's view, high Wall Street pay attracts intelligent people whose skills are more richly compensated than if they pursue careers in other fields such as rocket science. Many are ""risk-takers drawn to finance like they are drawn to Formula One racing."" And one risk that many of these intelligent, compensation-hungry gamblers prove willing to take is fraud, he concludes. Reform the pay incentives and we might keep the rocket scientists exploring space instead of the frontiers outside the law. We need only look to Roman history for counsel. "

(AP Photo/AJ Mast)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8da97210000d601c966bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even in Washington, few have embraced the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision more vociferously than long-time campaign finance reform foe Senator Mitch McConnell. In a brief to the Supreme Court in 2012, he argued that critics of the decision got it exactly wrong: despite the warnings, unlimited spending from corporate treasuries had not skyrocketed, and the decision should stand.Senator McConnell may have a point -- or half of one. While it's impossible to know exactly how much corporate spending Citizens United has unleashed (because so much spending is no longer disclosed), four years on, it has become apparent that the biggest impact of the decision may have little to do with the spending of ""corporate wealth.""Rather, as our colleague Ian Vandewalker points out in his recent analysis of spending in the most competitive Senate races of 2014, it is now apparent that the decision's biggest impact may be that it opened the door to two types of political spending entities that could completely undermine the integrity of what's left of our campaign finance system: candidate-specific super PACs and dark money groups. Candidate-specific super PACs undercut federal contribution limits to candidates by allowing individuals to direct unlimited sums of money in support of someone running for office, while dark money groups evade the disclosure requirements for political contributions that currently exist under federal law.It may be that no single race better exemplifies these developments, and foreshadows the shape of future federal elections, than Senator McConnell's competitive re-election contest against Alison Lundergan Grimes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, considering McConnell's current position and the potential for him to become Senate Majority Leader, the Kentucky race has attracted massive spending on both sides, including significant activity by new outside spending entities. A. How Candidate-Specific super PACs Allow Donors to ""Supplement"" Their Giving Federal law prohibits candidates from taking contributions above $5,200 ($2,600 in the primary; $2,600 in the general) because large contributions might corrupt. But under the logic of Citizens United, super PACs operate independently of candidates, and can take in unlimited funds. In Kentucky, both Alison Lundergan Grimes and Mitch McConnell have benefited from super PACs devoted exclusively to supporting them, but many more of McConnell's donors have ""double dipped"" by maxing out in direct contributions while also contributing heavily to the candidate-specific super PAC supporting him. Kentuckians for Strong Leadership (KSL) was created ""to ensure that Kentucky's own Senator Mitch McConnell is reelected."" To that end, it has already spent about $5 million in the race. The existence of this group has allowed many maxed-out McConnell donors to supplement their campaign giving with unlimited donations. According to recently available FEC data, about 68% of KSL's individual contributors have also maxed out to McConnell's primary or general election campaign. More than 50% maxed out to both. While KSL is supported by just 40 of these ""double dipping donors,"" their contributions have had a serious impact, adding up to about $2.25 million and comprising roughly 74% of KSL's funds from individual donors. The average maxed-out donor contributed about $56,000, more than ten times what can be given directly to McConnell. These figures cover contributions through the second quarter of 2014, and the number of double dipping donors may have increased. In the nine most competitive Senate races, no candidate-specific super PAC took in more money from donors who also maxed out to the candidate in question. One other group--the pro-Mark Begich Put Alaska First--spent significantly more than KSL, but received the bulk of its money from another super PAC, the Democrat-aligned Senate Majority PAC. Large contributions to candidate-specific super PACs could raise the same corruption concerns that existing limits were created to prevent. KSL is considered independent of McConnell, but it was founded by a senior adviser to his 2008 campaign and was set up exclusively to support his reelection. One of its three board members is McConnell's former chief of staff. Alison Lundergan Grimes also enjoys the support of a candidate-specific super PAC, We Are Kentucky, which has spent about $100,000 attacking McConnell. The group received 75% of its individual contributions--about $85,000 total--from five double dipping donors. Senate Majority PAC has also spent $4 million attacking McConnell while receiving significant funding from donors who have maxed out to the Democratic Party committees, potentially raising corruption concerns at the party level. The PAC's second-largest individual donor has maxed out to Grimes' primary and general election campaigns.B. The New Kid on the Block: Dark Money Candidate-Specific GroupsWe were already seeing candidate-specific super PACs back in 2012. But super PACs need to reveal their donors under federal law. Dark money groups do not. Like super PACs, they are largely a creation of Citizens United, which expanded nonprofit corporations' ability to spend in elections while also initiating a cultural shift toward more outside spending. In 2014, the benefits of unlimited spending have been combined with the anonymity of dark money to form candidate-specific dark money groups. The Kentucky Opportunity Coalition is an example of a dark money organization that does not have to reveal its donors. It has spent $7 million attacking Grimes, contributing to the over $100 million spent by dark money groups this election cycle. The Brennan Center analysis of the most competitive Senate races found that Kentucky Opportunity Coalition was among the top five dark money spenders overall, and was far and away the top candidate-specific dark money spender. An adviser to Kentucky Opportunity Coalition is a former McConnell staffer, and earlier this year the group stretched the limits of its independence by using b-roll footage of the candidate produced by McConnell's campaign. These types of shared advisers and campaign materials may increase the chances of coordination between candidates and outside groups. But even absent outright coordination, politicians may be more likely to notice a six figure check to an independent group than a $5,200 direct contribution. As former Representative Dan Boren put it, ""If you're a massive donor to the DNC ... and now you're giving to the Majority PAC unlimited amounts of money.... You can't tell me if you sit down with the leadership of any party that that legislative agenda is not going to reflect a lot of the wants and needs of those interest groups."" That is true of candidates as well. The parade of presidential contenders who wooed super PAC mega-donor Sheldon Adelson this March suggests that giving generously to super PACs is an effective way to reach candidates, and possibly to affect the actions they take as elected officials, perhaps more so than joining the scores of donors who give to them directly.  ** The Supreme Court's Citizens United decision removed limits on what outside groups could take in, with the understanding that those groups were independent of candidates and unable to corrupt them. It has taken a few years for the full impact of that decision to sink in, but the reality in Kentucky shows the world the Court envisioned and the reality it created aren't even close. Without new laws to curb these practices, or a new Supreme Court to reconsider its very flawed jurisprudence, the kind of spending we are seeing in Senator McConnell's race against Alison Lundergan Grimes will likely represent the future of campaigns across the country."
