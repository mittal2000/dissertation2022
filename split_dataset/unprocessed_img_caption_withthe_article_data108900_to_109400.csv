The Brazilian general elections will take place next October 5. AFP PHOTO / NELSON ALMEIDA (Photo credit should read NELSON ALMEIDA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7efef3c000018010db02d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BRASILIA, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Brazil's increasingly powerful evangelical Christians are tantalizingly close to electing one of their own as president next month in what would be a historic shift for the world's largest Catholic nation.Marina Silva, an environmentalist running neck and neck in polls with incumbent President Dilma Rousseff, is a Pentecostal Christian who often invokes God on the campaign trail and has said she sometimes consults the Bible for inspiration when making important political decisions.Some 65 percent of Brazil's 200 million people are Roman Catholics but evangelicals are rapidly gaining followers and power.They grew from 5 percent of the population in 1970 to more than 22 percent in 2010 and the trend has continued. Evangelical groups have made particular inroads among urban working Brazilians who benefited from economic prosperity over the last two decades and are now demanding a greater say in politics.Recent polls show evangelical voters would support Silva over Rousseff by a margin of about 54 percent to 38 percent if the two face each other in a runoff on Oct. 26, as most expect.In a tight race, that could swing the result.The evangelicals' rise has drawn comparisons to the ""religious right"" that began to influence U.S. politics in the 1980s.There are important differences - most Brazilians are politically well to the left of Americans, perhaps inevitably in a country with one of the world's biggest gaps between rich and poor. Silva and Rousseff both call themselves socialists and push for robust welfare programs.Infighting within evangelical groups has also limited their ability to create a unified bloc.Yet similarities with the ""religious right"" abound. Brazil's evangelical faithful have turned their opposition to gay marriage and abortion, which are both illegal here, into key national political issues.Funded by the tithes their followers are asked to pay, the more successful evangelical churches are increasingly turning their newfound wealth into political influence.They have bought up radio and television stations across Brazil and financed campaigns to elect evangelical candidates, including many pastors, to seats in Congress.The evangelical caucus in Congress showed its muscle in May by forcing Rousseff to revoke authorization for public health service abortions in exceptional cases of pregnancies caused by rape and of fetuses with brain defects.For the first time in a Brazilian election, there are two evangelical candidates running for president. Silva has eclipsed the second hopeful, Pastor Everaldo, although he has made his mark in debates by accusing Rousseff's government of trampling on family values and seeking to legalize abortion.Under evangelical pressure, Silva has changed her party's position on gay rights. And Rousseff, a Catholic who has rarely used faith in her political career, is now presenting herself as a good Christian. ""Happy is the nation whose God is the Lord,"" she quoted from Psalms at one campaign stop.""The evangelical vote will be decisive in this election,"" said Rodrigo Delmasso, a pastor of a Brasilia-based Pentecostal church, who is running for a seat in the city's legislature.""As the community grows it's natural that our share of political representation grows too,"" the 34-year-old pastor said during a campaign stop where he handed out bumper stickers and posters to metro workers.Delmasso said he voted for Rousseff in 2010, but he now backs Silva, trusting she will sweep out corruption after 12 years of rule by the leftist Workers' Party. MORALITYMany evangelicals believe their churches are uniquely equipped to cleanse politics - and society at large.In a shabby shopping center in the center of Brazil's capital, two theaters that used to show porn films are now churches. In one that doubled as a strip club, pastors preach about salvation from a stage where strippers once performed.Pentecostalism, the fastest growing branch of evangelical Christianity, was introduced to Latin America by U.S. missionaries a century ago.These days, virtually every town and neighborhood in Brazil seems to have a Pentecostal chapel where vibrant song and prayer blare over loudspeakers onto the street outside. Many converts say the uplifting services and emphasis on material prosperity are more appealing than what they found in the Catholic Church.The exodus is happening across Latin America and is especially strong in Brazil.The Catholic Church retains political influence of its own - gathering all the major presidential candidates for a debate in Aparecida, the shrine of Brazil's patron saint, earlier this month, for example.But while it bans its priests from engaging in politics, evangelical preachers are free to launch their own political careers from the pulpit or televangelist studios.Recently, at the doors of a church in Brasilia, youths in shirts and ties handed out campaign flyers to people attending the service. A vote for the evangelical congressional candidate was ""the same as voting for the Church,"" one of the youths said.One major goal of evangelicals is to keep expanding their caucus in Congress, which has grown from 17 in 1985 to 76 today - about 15 percent of the Chamber of Deputies.They have in many ways followed the path taken by the U.S. Christian right, which didn't really get involved in national politics until the early 1980s when one of its own - Pat Robertson - ran for president, said Andrew Chesnut, an expert on Brazil's Pentecostal boom.""Up until then, American evangelicals saw the political arena as the devil's arena where even forthright Christians could be contaminated,"" said Chesnut, a professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.""The view was that if they had critical mass they could elect their own people and that would inoculate them from the contagion of the political arena. That was the same in Brazil.""CONVERSIONSilva's rise could further boost political engagement among Brazilian evangelicals. Many, like Silva, are Afro-Brazilian women who come from a poor background.Silva came to the faith somewhat late in life. She was born to illiterate rubber-tappers in the Amazon rainforest and wanted to become a Catholic nun as an adolescent, before turning to environmental activism and a career in politics.Her conversion to Pentecostalism came in 1997 after her doctor said only a ""miracle"" would heal her fragile health, wrecked by malaria, hepatitis and lead poisoning when she was a child on the rubber plantation.Silva has tried to strike a careful balance between pride in her faith and not alienating more secular-minded Brazilians. She said in an interview this month that ""the Bible is without a shadow of a doubt a source of inspiration,"" but immediately added that all of her decisions are ""taken on a rational basis.""One campaign jingle celebrates ""the faith of every believer and the reason of every atheist.""Last month, her Brazilian Socialist Party issued an official platform supporting gay marriage and making homophobia a crime but Silva quickly reversed the stance after Brazil's best-known televangelist, Silas Malafaia, threatened to withdraw his support for her.It was a costly embarrassment for Silva, losing her support among young and urban middle-class voters and fueling broader concerns that she flip-flops on major issues.Rousseff tried to capitalize, announcing after Silva's gaffe that she would push through legislation granting evangelical churches the same tax benefits as the Catholic Church.Analysts say many evangelical voters are still up for grabs. Brazil's poor depend on social programs introduced by the ruling Workers' Party, and could vote for Rousseff regardless of what their pastor may say.Rousseff has the backing of Brazil's second-largest evangelical church, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. Silva belongs to Assemblies of God, which has more members but is less well-organized.Rousseff even attended the opening last month of a 10,000-seat, 11-story Solomon's Temple built in Sao Paulo by the Universal Church's leader, Bishop Edir Macedo. A media magnate, Macedo has a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $1.24 billion.Macedo's PRB party backs Rousseff and even has a seat in her cabinet. But he exerts more influence with his ownership of the second largest television network, Rede Record.Bishop Robson Rodovalho, a physicist who founded a Pentecostal church in 1992 that now has more than 1 million followers and a TV channel, said he expects that Silva still has room to grow her support in coming weeks.""Much of the Church will converge on her candidacy,"" he told Reuters before going on stage to preach to the sound of rock music in a darkened church hall lit with discotheque lights.""Brazil is a real democracy. It's only a matter of time before we have an evangelical president. That's a fact."" (Editing by Brian Winter and Kieran Murray)"

The plan would allow for universal suffrage in three year's time, but would restrict candidates to those approved by a committee that opposition politicians say is dominated by pro-Beijing representatives.In response, pro-democracy groups Occupy Central and student-led Scholarism have threatened civil disobedience that could shut down the city.

Police have been using pepper spray and tear gas, but protesters continued to pour into the streets on Sunday night:Police have been photographed carrying guns, and some protest groups called for a retreat on Sunday night on fears that the police would begin using rubber bullets.Photos posted online showed subways full of police being transported toward the protests. In response, protestors barricaded the exits to some subway stations.Students prepared for the threat of tear gas with masks, and as the night wore on, protestors issued public appeals for more supplies on social media.Police reportedly cleared the site of initial protests, but stand-offs continued at the government headquarters and other locations near the center of the city.At approximately 10:30 p.m., a Twitter account for the Hong Kong Federation of Students, one of the leading protest groups, began to call for a retreat in the face of mounting injuries.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the location of the protests.

Microsoft on Thursday, July 17, 2014 announced it will lay off up to 18,000 workers over the next year. (AP Photo Ted S. Warren)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb313da240000500055bf3f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Through August, planned job cuts were slightly lower than they were during the first eight months of 2013. In all, companies have announced just under 333,000 planned layoffs so far this year, down 4% from roughly 347,000 layoffs announced between January and August of 2013.According to data compiled by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, 10 companies alone have accounted for more than 20% of the announced job cuts, planning nearly 72,000 job cuts this year combined. No company announced more layoffs than Microsoft, with 18,000. Based on data from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the companies cutting the most jobs.Click here to see the 10 companies cutting the most jobs.In some cases, companies face difficult obstacles to return to profitability, or are insolvent, and are forced to shed jobs. However, in an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Challenger, Gray & Christmas CEO John Challenger explained that this is not the case for most companies. “Generally, we’re not seeing layoffs that occur because companies are doing poorly, [or] they are near insolvency.”In many cases, Challenger told 24/7 Wall St., layoffs are conducted as part of a company restructuring to become more lean. With the economy improving, he added, “more of the layoffs are occurring now because companies are shifting their business strategies, they’re buying other companies and they don’t need two headquarters.”Technology companies have been the largest downsizers so far this year with several long time stalwarts leading the way. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ), and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) announced the most job cuts, not only among tech companies, but also overall.The industry with the second largest planned layoffs so far in 2014 has been retail, with nearly 30,000 job cuts announced through August. This figure is actually down from last year, despite layoffs at Best Buy (NYSE: BBY), as well as Coldwater Creek, which declared bankruptcy in April.Financial companies, too, were among the top companies cutting jobs. Both JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) were among the 10 companies with the most planned layoffs so far in 2014.One factor that often drives job cuts is industry evolution. According to Challenger, this is especially true in the retail sector, where “it’s an area of low margins and fierce competition and technology is making a big difference in how consumers are coming to stores.” As a result of such changes, he added, retailers are making cuts due to the changing retail landscape, especially the fact that more shopping is being done online.Best Buy is probably the best example of this. With the increased popularity of online sales, the phenomenon of showrooming has undercut sales at the electronics retailer as many customers visited stores to try out a product before buying it online, oftentimes at Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN). The online retailer has long been famous for its low prices and has even been willing to sacrifice profits to grow its market footprint.Other companies cut jobs in an effort to continue to stay competitive. Shareholders invest in companies with the hope that shares will generate higher returns than they could elsewhere. In order to provide such returns, companies often restructure their operations to trim costs and increase profits, which can lead to layoffs. Layoffs at many of the employers cutting the most jobs are often motivated by such initiatives.However, in some cases, companies that announced layoffs truly had no choice. For example, Coldwater Creek had to close all of its stores after filing for bankruptcy protection. Not only were shareholders wiped out in the bankruptcy, but the company had to close all of its stores in order to pay off its creditors, eliminating thousands of jobs in the process.Many of the companies with the most layoffs are also among the largest employers in the United States. JPMorgan Chase announced an additional 5,500 planned layoffs earlier this year, on top of more than 19,000 job cuts announced in 2013. However, this total represents just a small share of JPMorgan Chase’s total headcount, which was more than 245,000 as of the second quarter of the current fiscal year.Challenger Gray & Christmas provided 24/7 Wall St. with all job cut announcements affecting at least 500 positions this year. 24/7 Wall St. combined all planned cuts by company to identify the companies that have announced the most job cuts this year. We only considered publicly traded American companies. However, job cuts did not need to be entirely within the United States. Some cuts announced this year may not be completed until 2015 or later. Consolidated revenues and employee totals are from each company’s most recent financial report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the company did not disclose headcount for the quarter, figures from its last annual report were used.These are the 10 companies cutting the most jobs."

So, now that you've succeeded in elevating the mother of all issues to the top of the global agenda, where should you and your fellow 399,999 marchers direct your tide-turning energies? 1. Dig in to Food and Climate  If you're up to speed on the climate impacts of the energy and transportation sectors, why not investigate the often hidden connections between food and climate? Did you know the global food system can exacerbate our woes (for instance, agriculture is responsible for 75 percent of global deforestation) or be key to solving them? (Organic farms use 30-50 percent less fossil fuel energy than industrial farms). This accessible report on the topic can get you started. If your book club is looking for a good read, there are many great books that elucidate the connection between food and climate including Anna Lappe's classic Diet for a Hot Planet, and Dan Barber's thoughtful meditation, The Third Plate. If you're looking for something truly meaty, tackle, This Changes Everything, hot off the press by the inimitable Naomi Klein.   2. Quit Wasting Food!With food insecurity right in our communities, food waste is obviously a big moral problem. It's also a significant climate problem. How significant? In 2012, the most recent year for which estimates are available, Americans threw out roughly 35 million tons of food. That's 50 percent more food than the U.S. tossed out in 1990, and nearly three times what Americans discarded in 1960. In fact, it's 40 percent of what we produce. America, this is totally unacceptable! We're wasting energy and precious fresh water, and by sending food waste to landfills, we're cooking up 21 percent of America's methane pie.

Fall in Love With Your (New) Compost BucketDo you compost? Why not? You have a trash can in your house, right? It is likely that one third of the garbage coming out of your house isn't garbage at all, but food scraps. These are a valuable resource that that can be turned into an amendment that creates healthy soil. In fact, many of the Cool Foods Campaign's activities focus on communicating the critical importance of rebuilding soil health. Why? Rebuilding soil health is a no-risk, low-cost approach to store carbon in the ground where it provides multiple benefits for climate stability, food security, and fresh water availability.

They have already taken up the issues of climate change, the terror threat posed by the Islamic State, and the devastating outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa.Government leaders are also reviewing the work completed by the General Assembly earlier this year on the new set of global development goals that will succeed the Millennium Development Goals. Included among them are two critical targets on preventing the extinction of threatened species and taking urgent action to halt poaching and trafficking and demand and supply of illegal wildlife products. Forest Protection Department authorities examine confiscated wildlife products. CREDIT: © WCS Vietnam.On Friday, Germany and Gabon led a high level event to discuss illegal wildlife trafficking in an effort to keep the issue high on the global political agenda. The trafficking in wildlife and their parts is a criminal international trade worth an estimated $20 billion a year. The soaring demand for products derived from wildlife has pushed several iconic species --including elephants, rhinos, and tigers, as well as many lesser known species -- toward the precipice of extinction. This is a global crisis for both wildlife and people, particularly local communities; it undermines equality within and among nations, sustainable consumption and production, the health of ecosystems, human health, and social stability. Poaching and the illegal trade in wildlife negatively impacts: the resilience of ecosystems; human security across countries and regions; and national wealth and the ability of countries to generate employment, reduce poverty through tourism, and provide dependable livelihoods through community-based natural resource management.  Tourists visiting parks to view elephants are vital to the economies of Eastern and Southern Africa, with tourism dollars responsible for more than 11 percent of GDP in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher ©WCS.To take but one example, the loss of elephants and rhinos threatens tourism jobs and livelihoods. Tourists visiting parks to view elephants are vital to the economies of Eastern and Southern Africa, with tourism dollars responsible for more than 11 percent of GDP in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Without elephants, these tourism enterprises would collapse.The recent entrance of armed militia groups -- including the Lord's Resistance Army and the Janjaweed -- into the international wildlife trade has generated combined revenues of between $4-12 million for criminal activities, while feeding corruption and instability and undermining national law enforcement efforts. But if ivory commands a price-per-weight value higher than gold as a commodity, that price pales in comparison to the cost of this trade to wildlife populations. The most recent accounting put the loss of African elephants at 100,000 over the past three years. That translates to approximately 96 elephants a day, with only 400,000 remaining in the wild across all of Africa.  Highly trained ranger patrol teams are helping to protect the remaining tigers in Thailand's Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary. CREDIT: © WCS Asia Program.Fewer than 30,000 wild rhinos survive. A mere 3,200 wild tigers survive in the forests of Asia, including only 1,000 breeding females. And populations of many lesser known species, from Africa to Asia and Latin America, are also being depopulated by poaching and illegal trade -- all of which are fueled by greed, weak governance and enforcement, and corruption along the entire trade chain. It is clear that the trafficking of wildlife requires a global response -- one that fits well within the governance regime of the UN General Assembly. In the face of a growing assault upon the cultural and natural heritage of nations across the globe, a growing number of UN Member States have called for urgent action to end the poaching and trafficking of wildlife. For many of these countries, the elephants, rhinos, tigers and other species are not only their natural heritage, but their very patrimony. A major challenge to bringing a halt to trafficking, in addition to rampant corruption, is the absence of adequate law enforcement across the trade chain: on the ground where the killing is taking place, through the transit States, and on to the final destination consumer markets.

Just this week, the Clinton Global Initiative renewed its commitment to the fight against wildlife trafficking, expanding a coalition of countries created one year ago that together pledged both financial and human support for stricter enforcement, expanded interdiction actions, and media-based education efforts in Asia (and wherever demand for ivory and other products is high).The coming together of the United Nations Member States this week presents an ideal moment to recognize the interconnectedness of these actions to reduce, and ultimately halt, illegal wildlife trade .

Governments are collaborating through existing treaties, such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, but much more is needed in terms of anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, and enforcement enhancement, if we are to end this scourge. Wildlife trafficking must be treated with the same seriousness as other transnational organized crime. Continued leadership from the UN on this issue is essential to the protection of iconic species and the welfare of people whose livelihoods and wellbeing depend on them."
15,POLITICS,Lebanon: The Forgotten Front,"James Zogby, ContributorPresident, Arab American Institute; author, 'Arab Voices'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lebanon-the-forgotten-fro_b_5892706.html,"While the world's attention has been focused on the combined efforts of Arab and U.S. forces attacking the Islamic State positions in Iraq and Syria, there is unfolding in Lebanon, a third front in the war against this violent extremist group.

Sayid went missing around the same time that some two dozen soldiers and police were seized by militants from Syria who overran the border town of Arsal for several days last month. The incursion was the most serious spillover yet of the Syrian civil war and escalated tensions in Lebanon, which is bitterly split over the conflict. (AP Photo/Hussein Malla)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d7622100004502c965ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While the world's attention has been focused on the combined efforts of Arab and U.S. forces attacking ""Islamic State"" (IS) positions in Iraq and Syria, there is unfolding in Lebanon, a third front in the war against this violent extremist group. This third front has received scant attention. Because Lebanon has been so overwhelmed by the fallout from Syria's civil war, aggravating the country's fragile sectarian balance, the threat of IS poses an existential challenge that must not be ignored. Despite being the smallest of Syria's neighbors, Lebanon is currently hosting 40 percent of Syria's refugees. With a population of just under 4 million citizens, the presence of 1.2 million displaced Syrians means that nearly one in every four persons currently residing in Lebanon is a Syrian. This is causing severe stress on Lebanon's resources and its social order. While the refugees are dispersed across the country in over 1,600 locations, some Lebanese towns have been completely overwhelmed by Syrians with the impact being felt in severe shortages in housing, medical services, water and electricity. Classrooms are overcrowded. And with the refugees willing to work for less pay, many Lebanese are now finding themselves priced out of the job market. The international community has been generous in providing support to the refugee population -- though far short of the needs that exist. But the host communities have not received adequate support to provide for Lebanese who have been negatively impacted by the surge of refugees. All of this has caused enormous stress country-wide. In June of 2012, all of Lebanon's political groups agreed on a policy of ""disassociation"" -- pledging not to become involved in Syria's war. While individual Lebanese crossed the border to fight either for or against the Assad government, the first formal break in the ""disassociation"" policy came with Hizbollah's entry into the Syrian war in 2013. While Hizbollah's justifications for their action varied from protecting Shi'a holy places from being overrun by Sunni extremists to supporting their ally in Damascus, the net result was to aggravate Lebanon's Sunni population thereby aggravating the country's sectarian fissures. Over the past year, Lebanon has been on a low boil. There have been mass bombings in both Shi'a and Sunni neighborhoods and not a day goes by without reports of small scale, but still lethal, sectarian attacks. The most dangerous situation, to date, is unfolding in Lebanon's northeast -- in the border town of Arsal. As a result of the Syrian war, Arsal's Lebanese population of 35,000 swelled to over 100,000 souls. Preying off of the obvious discontent created by this untenable situation, a combined force of Jabhat al Nusra (the al Qaida affiliate) and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) overran Arsal in early August. A week later, the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) reestablished control, driving out the two militant groups. Losses were great -- 19 LAF soldiers died in the battle, and 38 were captured. Since then, a terrifying and dangerous drama has unfolded, with the extremists threatening to behead the captives unless the LAF withdrew. It is important to note that the LAF is held in high esteem among all sectors of Lebanese society. It is Lebanon's one truly national institution with near equal portions of Sunni and Shia in uniform, joined by a substantial number of Christians. A recent poll showed that while the public gave extremely low single digit favorable ratings to their parliament and government, 70 percent gave a positive rating to their army. The extremists have ruthlessly exploited the captives calling the soldiers' families telling them to pressure the LAF to withdraw from Arsal and then engaging in public executions of the soldiers, one at a time, to demonstrate their cruelty and resolve. Lebanese officials have decried this barbaric display and have complained that some elements of the Lebanese media have contributed to the extremists' efforts by sensationalizing the parents' appeals. To date, three LAF have been executed, but the army and government have withstood the pressure and refused to surrender Arsal back to the control of the terrorist groups. As one Lebanese official recently put it, ""the choice they are giving us is to trade 38 captives for the entire city of Arsal."" Lebanon has signed on as a partner in the Arab and US coalition to combat the Islamic State. But they won't be fighting in Syria or Iraq. They have their own front in this war. Their efforts need recognition and international support. The LAF requires advanced weaponry to fight more effectively. And Lebanon requires much more assistance to provide not only for the massive influx of refugees but for Lebanon's host communities. It would be a tragic if in the process of combating the IS presence in Iraq and Syria the world ignored Lebanon thus allowing IS to gain a foothold in that country or allowing the tactics of ISIL or Jabhat al Nusra to provoke tensions within Lebanon thereby sparking a sectarian civil war. The key to avoiding either outcome is to strengthen the LAF so that it can control the country's borders and to demonstrate to the Lebanese people that the world is attentive to their plight.

Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), the woman he hopes to defeat come the midterm elections in November. He missed.Calling in to the Boston Herald radio show on Friday, Brown was given the chance to pile on a simple, if not inane, attack against Shaheen's absenteeism at numerous Senate Foreign Relations committee hearings. The conservative-leaning Boston Herald reported Thursday that the Democrat ""skipped out on nearly half of the public hearings held by the committee over the last two years,"" including an April hearing on the dangers of the Islamic State.The report prompted immediate hysteria from Republicans. ""New Hampshire is an independent state, and it's sad that Granite Staters are being poorly represented by an Obama puppet and a no-show senator like Jeanne Shaheen,"" said New Hampshire GOP Chair Jennifer Horn. Former New Hampshire Sen. Gordon Humphrey (R) released a statement saying that, had Shaheen been in the military, she would have been ""charged with abandoning her post.""To his credit, Brown, a former Republican senator from Massachusetts, took a more measured approach. He explained that while it was practically impossible to hold a spotless attendance record, the one hearing Shaheen missed on Islamic State was a matter of concern because it had taken place before the militants seized control of parts of Iraq earlier this year. Yet in passing up the opportunity to criticize Shaheen, Brown neutralized a line of attack from his own party and did Shaheen a favor at a time when the race appears to be tightening.""Senators have tremendous amount of responsibilities,"" he said. ""I don't think there's ever an expectation to have 100 percent attendance.""""They're double-booked a lot,"" he explained of committee hearings.Asked by the host about gaps in his own attendance record while on the Arms Services and Homeland Security committees, Brown conceded the point entirely.""That wouldn't surprise me. We would have to pick and choose what are we listening to, what are we working on today,"" he said. ""I'm not criticizing [Shaheen] for her attendance at committee hearings. I am questioning where we are with ISIS.""Shaheen is not the only member of Congress whose committee attendance has come into question this year. In the deadlocked Iowa Senate Race, Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) was pilloried by Republicans for missing 75 percent of meetings for a committee that provides oversight over the Veterans Administration -- a headline especially damaging during the widely followed VA scandal."
