Preparing to film its fifth season, Oxfam Tanzania’s series about women",2015-07-30,"<p>A woman works in the field of Loi Bangoti's farm July 18, 2007 in Ngiresi near the Tanzanian town of Arusha.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This reality show drama is actually worth watching.Preparing to film its fifth season, Oxfam Tanzania’s series about women farmers highlights the gender inequalities this demographic faces and demonstrates women’s value in the industry. ""Mama Shujaa wa Chakula,"" or ""Female Food Heroes,"" brings 18 women to live together for three weeks to engage in various farming competitions, and grants the show's winner an opportunity to expand her operation.Though women make up 75 percent of Tanzania's farmers, they often live in poverty and their contributions are often overlooked, Oxfam told Reuters. Viewers vote for the winner who gets 20 million Tanzanian shillings (about $9,500) and farming and fishing tools.For Anna Oloshuro, one of the top three winners in 2011, it wasn’t just about the prizes she took home. It was the way her community shifted their perception of her after the competition. Before the show, Oloshuro told Oxfam that men would tell their wives to stay away from her and that she was “cursed.” But after she appeared on ""Female Food Heroes,"" Oloshuro was regarded as a revered leader of the community. Now, men won’t even call a meeting without her, she said.The show comes at a time when women are playing ever-increasing roles in the farming industry, but their rights haven’t quite yet caught up with the progress.Now that more men is rural areas are working in cities, about half of all farmers are women who produce more than half the world's food, according to World Watch. Still, women farmers are often deprived of such basic rights as land ownership.Yet, if women were given equal access to resources, food output would increase to a point that it could pull 100 to 150 million people out of hunger, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the U.N. concluded in a report released in 2011. Tired of such inequities, the show’s winners often use their fame to help improve conditions for women farmers.Last season’s winner, Bahati Muriga, took home the grand prize after building a grass-thatched hut for raising chicken and then producing hand-hoes for sale, the Citizen reported.She vowed to use her winnings to expand her farm and support legislation to revolutionize the agricultural sector.“Small-scale farmers play a key role not only in their own families but also the nation at large,” Muriga told the Citizen.

The officer got out of his marked vehicle and approached Hammond's car with his weapon drawn, Police Chief John Covington said, noting that this is standard practice for a ""narcotics"" investigation. That's when, according to the chief, Hammond accelerated his car toward the officer, local Fox affiliate WHNS notes. Covington maintains that his officer ""fired two shots in self-defense"" as Hammond ""drove directly at him.""But the Hammond family's attorney, Eric Bland, sees a different picture when looking at the teen's newly released autopsy report.“It is clearly, clearly from the back,” Bland told Greenville Online on Wednesday. “It is physically impossible for him to be trying to flee or run over the officer that shot him.”Greenville Online reports:Bland said the autopsy indicated that the first shot went into Hammond’s left rear shoulder, throwing him forward in the car, and the second one went at a downward angle into his side from the rear, through his heart and lungs and leaving out his lower right side.But Covington stood by his initial comments, saying that Hammond was shot at near-point-blank range from outside his open driver's side window. He said Hammond was not ""shot from behind.""Hammond's father, Paul, thinks his son may have been trying to flee, but said, ""I think he was shot for fleeing the scene.""Tori Morton, 23, the other passenger in Hammond's car, was uninjured. She was charged with simple marijuana possession and released Monday. Oconee County Coroner Karl Addis said Tuesday that Hammond died from a gunshot wound in his upper torso, but wouldn't elaborate on the angle of the shots fired. He referred all questions to local and state authorities. Meanwhile, the unidentified officer has been placed on administrative leave, and the city and officer have both hired attorneys, WHNS reports.The shooting comes during a dark time for police in South Carolina. The state is on pace to have its bloodiest year of officer-involved shootings in more than a decade, according to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. Hammond's death was the state's 29th cop-involved shooting in 2015, SLED said, and at this rate South Carolina will reach 50 shootings by the end of the year."

Scott Walker (R) loves are made with union labor.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ba32321d00002f0014340e.jpeg?ops=crop_6_0_2994_1627%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"(Corrects name of union in 19th paragraph) MILWAUKEE, July 30 (Reuters) - For Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, there's something awkward about the Harley-Davidson motorcycles that he has been posing on at presidential campaign stops: each one bears a sticker on its frame that reads ""Union made in the USA.""Walker has made the iconic American brand a centerpiece of his campaign kick-off tour this month, visiting four dealerships and sometimes showing off his own 2003 Harley Road King as he seeks to harness its appeal to older white male voters.But there is another side to Harley that the Republican candidate has been less vocal about - it is a leading example of a successful company that has a strong relationship with labor unions.Walker, by contrast, has made his union-busting credentials the foundation of his White House bid, touting it as the prime example of his leadership success and as evidence of how he can defeat powerful vested interests and even foreign enemies.It's not clear how he can reconcile his love of the powerful, deep-rumbling bikes known as ""hogs"" with the strong union loyalties of those who build them.Some of the people who build Harleys - more than a thousand of whom are unionized workers in Wisconsin - are fuming over Walker's prominent use of the bikes in his campaign.""He's trying to make a name for himself by saying 'I took on 100,000 union workers' - and he's on our bikes,"" said Andy Voelzke, 57, who works at Harley's plant just outside Milwaukee and is a member of the United Steelworkers union.""It's just such a contradiction.""As governor, Walker passed legislation over strong Democratic opposition to limit collective bargaining for state employees. He took another swipe at organized labor this year with a bill that forbids unions within private firms from forcing workers to pay dues.Like other candidates in the crowded Republican primary field, Walker is hoping to connect with voters in the ""Harley-Davidson"" demographic, jokingly referred to as ""old fat guys"" and who are perceived to be mostly conservatives.Walker may already have some ground to make up among Harley lovers. Ten out of a group of 11 riders approached by Reuters in downtown Milwaukee on Tuesday named front-runner Donald Trump as their early favorite in the race for the Republican nomination.Seven of the riders, none of whom were from Wisconsin, said they hadn't heard of Walker.Harley’s unions in Wisconsin could be affected by Walker's ""right to work"" reform passed this year. Voluntary membership could leave unions with less money to pay for negotiators and lawyers. The company will also have more power to fire employees for not agreeing to additional tasks, such as overtime shifts.""Governor Walker believes individual workers should be free to decide on their own – without the influence of union bosses – whether they’d like to join a union and pay dues and that’s why he signed a law making Wisconsin a right-to-work state,"" said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Walker's campaign.A spokeswoman for Harley-Davidson, which has enjoyed solid global sales and whose share price has doubled over the past five years, declined to comment, saying its management wanted to remain neutral.THE HOG CASE STUDYHarley-Davidson's relationship with its workers' unions isn't just decent; it's studied as an example of how corporations can benefit from organized labor.""They've had disputes in the past, but Harley has never tried to kill the union and the union has always taken the attitude that it wants Harley to succeed,"" said Paul Osterman, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.""It's a successful example of labor-management cooperation.""Flags representing the United Steelworkers and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers fly alongside the U.S. flag and Wisconsin's state flag at the entrance to Harley's plant on Pilgrim Road, just outside the Milwaukee city limits. Harley's global headquarters is in the city.The plant's union leaders told Reuters they work closely with management to fine-tune production, eliminate waste and collaborate on new manufacturing initiatives.The union is credited in the Harley-Davidson museum in Milwaukee, which is run by the company, for helping to save the firm from bankruptcy in the early 1980s.The two sides haven't always gotten along. There have been worker strikes as recently as 2007, and Harley has experimented with efforts to offshore parts of its production.But employees interviewed by Reuters said the company has, within the past five years, repatriated some production after workers argued it would improve efficiency.Among the Harley riders interviewed by Reuters, Walker had a fan in William Welp Jr., 60, a retired Navy commander who now teaches at a public high school in Fort Lauderdale.""When I first heard Scott Walker and saw him I thought: 'There's a guy who thinks just like I do,'"" said Welp, who had ridden from Florida with three of his friends.Welp said he had already donated to Walker and was against unions, even though he joined one voluntarily.Erin Spengler, 40, a Harley rider who works at Pilgrim Road, described her anger when, in 2013, Walker climbed on a Harley to lead a motorcycle rally as part of Milwaukee's Military Appreciation Day Parade.Spengler was supposed to participate, but at the last minute, she said, decided to stay home.""I am not going to let this guy lead me through town like a circus when he's against everything I stand for,"" she said.Additional reporting by Alexia Shurmur in Las Vegas; editing by Stuart Grudgings.)Also on HuffPost:"

Indeed, Sanders' remarks at an event hosted by the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on Thursday failed to win over Javier Palomarez, the group’s leader.After talking about the importance of providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Sanders shifted to say that foreign-born workers who come to the U.S. sometimes hurt wages.""There is a reason why Wall Street and all of corporate America likes immigration reform, and it is not, in my view, that they're staying up nights worrying about undocumented workers in this country,"" Sanders said Thursday. ""What I think they are interested in is seeing a process by which we can bring low-wage labor of all levels into this country to depress wages in America, and I strongly disagree with that.""Sanders had already caused some controversy earlier in the week with remarks that some advocates interpreted as critical of immigration.""What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy,"" Sanders said in a Vox interview posted Tuesday. ""Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don't believe in that. I think we have to raise wages in this country, I think we have to do everything we can to create millions of jobs.""The senator said Thursday that he stood by his remarks opposing open borders, adding that ""there is no question in my mind that that would substantially lower wages in this country."" The comments reinforce a perception voiced by immigration leaders in Congress that Sanders has not sufficiently emphasized immigration reform in his campaign. Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), a top proponent of comprehensive immigration reform in Congress, called on the presidential candidate to emphasize the issue more in June.Some immigration reform advocates argued that Sanders' remarks in the Vox interview wrongly implied that more immigration has a negative impact on U.S. workers. By increasing overall consumption in the economy, they said, new immigrants more than compensate for the depressing effect that a larger supply of workers could have on employment or wages. ""Here's the issue: when Senator Sanders falsely pits immigrants as an obstacle to tackling unemployment, he’s just plain wrong,"" said Todd Schulte in a Wednesday statement. Schulte is president of FWD.us, a political action group backed by tech companies that focuses on immigration reform.“The economic data is clear that immigrants create American jobs,"" he said, adding that Sanders' argument is ""exactly the sort of backward-looking thinking that progressives have rightly moved away from in the past years.""Indeed, a 2010 study by the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that immigration had a negligible overall influence on wages. The study, which looked at the years 1994 to 2007, concluded that immigration had a neutral effect on the wages of workers with a high school degree and actually increased the wages of workers with some college training by 0.4 percent. It did show that immigration had reduced wages significantly for some groups of foreign-born workers.Still, if Sanders is ambivalent about the effects of immigration on American workers, he would not be alone among progressives.Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and a supporter of legislation giving undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship, argues that the Economic Policy Institute study and others like it fail to account for the indirect ways in which immigration reduces the real income of middle- and lower-income workers. Specifically, Baker said there is evidence that high immigration increases the cost of housing, which makes up a large share of low-income families’ budgets.Baker pointed to the difference between housing costs in Los Angeles, a city with high immigration, and those in Cleveland, a city with lower immigration. The Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that the ""fair market rent"" of a one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles is $1,103 per month, while a comparable apartment in Cleveland costs $603 per month.""Let's say the wages of people without a college degree remain the same under immigration,"" Baker said. ""The person in Cleveland is doing a lot better.""Regardless of Sanders’ views on the larger economics of immigration, the candidate's public criticism of immigration policies has focused on employers who hire foreign workers when U.S. workers are available for the same jobs. He said Thursday that he does ""not believe that we should be bringing in significant numbers of unskilled workers to compete with"" unemployed high school graduates.It is a criticism shared by lawmakers in both parties. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), one of the most outspoken advocates of immigration reform in the Senate, joined with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), one of its staunchest opponents, in calling for an investigation of Southern California Edison and other companies that use H1-B visas to hire foreign workers while laying off American ones. Sanders has not just spoken out against these practices. In the past, he has bucked Democratic leaders over immigration policies that he believed would undermine U.S. workers. In 2007, Sanders voted against bipartisan immigration reform because of concerns that a guest worker program in the bill could end up depressing wages and depriving Americans of jobs. Some immigration advocates criticized Sanders at the time, but organized labor officials, who supported immigration reform but opposed the guest worker program, commended Sanders for his stance.“Sanders was basically one of our only allies” in the 2007 fight, Ana Avendaño, a former top immigration official at the AFL-CIO, told Politico. “He adamantly put his foot down and said these kinds of programs [allow] employers to bring in more and more vulnerable workers.” Sanders voted for the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill, which also received support from the AFL-CIO. He said on Thursday that the 2013 bill was better, in part because of a $1.5 billion youth jobs program he offered as an amendment.He has promised to push for immigration reform if elected president, and he insisted Thursday that it's not incongruous with his concerns that open borders could hurt U.S. workers. ""There is a great difference in saying that we welcome immigrants, that we're going to provide a path toward citizenship for those people and those families that are in this country today, and saying, oh, we're not going to have any borders at all,"" Sanders said.Also on HuffPost:"

While there, the 3-year-old also had the chance to hang out with Cox, who showed the girl all the different things she can do without arms, RE’s mother Karlyn Pranke told The Huffington Post.  RE's time with Cox made a lasting impression on the child and their moments together were summed up in one powerful snapshot of the two hugging. ""That picture clearly showed that you don't need arms to embrace someone,"" Cox told ABC News. ""It was special that we could feel the same, mutual feeling -- what a hug is without arms."" On top of getting a hug from Cox, RE also showed the motivational speaker how she writes with her feet. Pranke, who arranged the meeting with the speaker through Facebook, told HuffPost that Cox took RE out to an airplane that looks like the one the speaker pilots and the pair took pictures on it. At one point, Cox even showed the 3-year-old how she drives a car with her feet. ""She was shy at first,"" Pranke told HuffPost. ""But [then] she felt comfortable knowing that [Cox] is just like her."" Though Pranke said that she has been in contact with the speaker for quite some time, the premiere marked the first time she and her daughter met Cox in person. She first learned of Cox when she was pregnant with RE and was told about her child's condition. Pranke came across Cox's story on the Internet and felt inspired after seeing the speaker's confidence so she struck up a correspondence with her around the time RE was born.Pranke said that she was happy her daughter was finally able to see Cox in person as their meeting changed RE's outlook.

The Daily Dot online newspaper reported that hackers had gained access to Planned Parenthood's website databases and the names and email addresses of its employees.The Daily Dot reported the hackers, who called themselves ""social justice warriors,"" said they planned to release the organization's internal emails soon.Planned Parenthood has undergone growing scrutiny in recent weeks over two secretly recorded videos that critics said showed the group was involved in the illegal sale of aborted fetal tissue for medical research.Planned Parenthood insists it has broken no laws because abortion providers are allowed to charge costs to cover expenses associated with fetal tissue donations. On Wednesday, the group called for a blue-ribbon panel to review policies surrounding fetal tissue research.Senate Republicans are seeking to cut all federal funding, $500 million a year, that Planned Parenthood receives and redirect that money to other providers of women's health.(Reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Paul Tait)Also on HuffPost: "

Schlinke, who had been with the department since February, resigned from her job in an unrelated personnel matter July 20. She was arrested a week later. Valley Brook Police Chief Michael Stamp said Schlinke was still in training, but had been doing police work under a trained officer, according to NewsOK. ""It's unfortunate,"" Stamp told News 9. ""We as police officers are held to a higher standard.""The scandal is the latest to hit the embattled department. In 2013, a former Valley Brook officer was arrested on kidnapping and domestic abuse charges. In 2011, the department's then-chief was charged with drug trafficking. ""Obviously it shines more negative light upon us,"" Stamp told KFOR. ""But there was nothing in her background that would keep her from being a policeman.""Schlinke remains in Oklahoma County jail on $1.1 million bond. She is scheduled to appear via video feed at an arraignment hearing in Oklahoma County Court on Thursday, a court spokeswoman told The Huffington Post. "

The largest share of Americans in 30 years has a negative view of the Supreme Court, according to a July survey by the Pew Research Center.The Pew survey, released Thursday, found that 43 percent of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of the Supreme Court, compared with 48 percent of Americans who have a favorable opinion of it.The increase in unfavorable views of the Supreme Court was driven by a rise in unfavorable views among Republicans. The percentage of Republicans who said they have an unfavorable opinion of the court went from 40 percent in March to 61 percent in the new survey. The Pew survey results could have been driven by dissatisfaction with recent Supreme Court decisions. The Supreme Court issued rulings in late June legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide and upholding the Affordable Care Act’s subsidies for buying insurance on state-run exchanges, both of which rankled conservatives. Sixty-three percent of survey respondents opposed to same-sex marriage, and 58 percent of respondents opposed to the Affordable Care Act, have an unfavorable opinion of the Supreme Court.Support for the court increased among Democrats over the same period, however. From March to July, the percentage of Democrats with a favorable opinion of the Supreme Court went from 54 percent to 62 percent.The survey results will come as no surprise to Republican presidential candidates, who have elicited applause for attacking the Supreme Court in their stump speeches. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has gone furthest in his criticism, arguing that the Supreme Court justices should be elected.Pew surveyed 2,002 adults between July 14 and 20, using live interviewers to reach both landlines and cell phones."

But far too often the media fails to show the whole picture, neglecting to tell the stories of what is working. From scientific breakthroughs to successful crime-reduction initiatives, the What’s Working Honor Roll highlights some of the best reporting and analysis, from a range of media outlets, on all the ways people are working toward solutions to some of our greatest challenges.  NPR: Anonymous Messaging App Provides Suicide Intervention On College Campuses The anonymity of the Internet can help people feel less self-conscious when asking for help with problems that carry a stigma. College students are doing just that with Yik Yak, an anonymous messaging app, by asking for help from the community when they're feeling distressed or suicidal. Other users are admirably responding to these cries for help with support and encouragement. Yik Yak is seen as a safe place because students can air their feelings and have them treated seriously without the risk of publicly outing themselves. ""We've been educated to never assume that they're joking; you always take them seriously,"" said Jessica Reingold, a recent graduate of the University of Mary Washington. The app gives users the ability to anonymously view and post messages, as well as respond to other users within a 5-mile radius. Although Yik Yak does not necessarily provide an avenue to stop someone from committing an imminent act of self-harm, users have responded to alarming messages with sympathy and have urged the poster to seek help.Samantha Braver, a rising sophomore at the College of William & Mary, told NPR she saw a troubling post, or ""yak,"" that stated: ""I want to turn my emotions off. There's very little left for me to be happy about and it's only a matter of time before those things fade too.""Three students at Braver's school died on campus in the past year, two of which were confirmed suicides. In response to the yak, Braver replied: ""You are loved. Please don't do this.""Since the app is popular among young people, counselors at campuses across the country hope students can rally around their peers who may be depressed and encourage them to seek professional help.MORE:Slate: Why New York City Is Experimenting With New Ways to Desegregate Public Schools  Good News Network: 15 Companies Plan To Hire 100,000 Young People From Low-Income NeighborhoodsThe Guardian: Walmart, Coca-Cola, Google And Others Commit To Obama's Initiative To Reduce The Carbon Footprint Of The U.S.Also on HuffPost:"
