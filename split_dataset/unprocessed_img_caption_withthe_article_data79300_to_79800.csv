And that's no lie: As this Reuters video illustrates, Obama pulled off a pretty smooth routine.Afterward, Obama thanked the crowd for its ""incredible hospitality"" and encouraged the young students to ""keep up your traditions, even as you go out into the big world.""Not quite as entertaining as his predecessor's dance moves, but who's keeping track?"

It costs $149.99.That's definitely not cheap. BB-8 fits in the palm of your hand and will probably remind you of a classic Tyco R/C car. There are a few features beyond rolling around -- an augmented reality setting makes it look like the droid is projecting a holographic video when you view it through your smartphone's camera, for example -- but the core functionality is pretty simple.Sphero's okay with that. The idea isn't to offer a toy that does a million different things: It just needs to do one thing really well.Think about how droids behave in the ""Star Wars"" franchise: They're companions to the main characters. R2-D2 unlocks doors, delivers messages, helps Luke Skywalker pilot his X-Wing and so on. C-3PO nags and speaks Bocce. Robert Maigret, the chief creative officer of Sphero, told The Huffington Post in a recent interview that the BB-8 toy could help people get comfortable with having robotic companions in their homes.""They're going to be our friends, our companions, our helpers,"" Maigret said.He's right: Companies like Honda are already working to develop robots that can aid the elderly and communicate via sign language.Admittedly, BB-8 won't do much beyond put a smile on your face -- but maybe that's the first step toward accepting more advanced robots into our lives.Just be careful with it around your dog. Vanity Fair discovered that it kind of freaks puppies out, as this awesome video shows:For more information about Sphero's BB-8 toy, visit the company's website."

This screen grab from WFV shows a female king cobra that also belongs to Kennedy. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e8440a1400002e002e4cf9.png?cache=0YhkGfcPiD&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Authorities in Orlando, Florida, are on the lookout for an 8-foot king cobra that escaped from its owner's home on Wednesday. Mike Kennedy, who operates an exotic animal shelter on his property, reported the venomous snake missing. Florida Fish and Wildlife officers said he's licensed to own exotic animals, and that he is an experienced snake handler. Fish and Wildlife officials urged residents not to try and catch the green-and-yellow snake if they see it, but instead to call the agency's hotline immediately. Although the snake will be primarily interested in hunting small animals for food, it may become extremely dangerous if cornered by humans. A bite from a king cobra can kill an elephant, according to CNN. In July, a monocled cobra was blamed for the death of a Texas teen. The snake went missing after biting the boy and was later found dead. King cobras are native to India and southeast Asia and can grow up to 18 feet long. In the wild, they primarily feed on other snakes, but sometimes prey on small mammals. That has residents worried. ""I’m a little concerned. I have a small cat at home, and snakes like cats,"" Bryan Shattuck, who lives in the area, told WFTV. The station pointed out that Kennedy's home is also located within a mile of an elementary school. Kennedy's shelter, the Dragon Ranch, is a nonprofit organization that rescues and cares for exotic animals such as crocodiles, leopards and cougars.Also on HuffPost:"

The technical specifications are quite amazing. ""The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.4 million miles from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 119 degrees,"" according to NASA. ""Image scale is 9 miles per pixel.""Here are some additional details about Dione, from Space.com:At 696 miles in diameter, Dione is the fourth-largest of Saturn's sixty-odd moons; only Titan, Rhea and Iapetus are bigger. Parts of Dione are heavily cratered, and the satellite's trailing side features mysterious ice cliffs and fractures that run for tens or hundreds of kilometers. Cassini has also detected a wispy oxygen atmosphere surrounding the frigid moon. No additional close fly-bys of Dione are planned for the Cassini spacecraft.Dione was first discovered by Giovanni Cassini in 1684.Also on HuffPost:"

5,QUEER VOICES,Protesters Say Raid On Rentboy Escort Site Puts People At Risk,Lila Shapiro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sex-workers-rentboy-raid_us_55e8a938e4b0c818f61b4fe4,"But then, sex workers are ""terrorized every day"" by law enforcement.",2015-09-03,<p>People gathered across from the federal courthouse in Brooklyn on Thursday to protest the raid on Rentboy.com last week.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e8c38e1d0000d101146c6a.jpeg?cache=ATrvpXf4zq&ops=crop_9_11_979_582%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- A crowd gathered outside the federal courthouse in Brooklyn on Thursday to protest last week's government raid on a gay escort website, a crackdown that sex workers and LGBT activists have likened to the police raids on gay bars and bathhouses of the 1970s. Protesters demanded that prosecutors drop the charges against Jeffrey Hurant, chief executive of Rentboy.com, and six other current or former employees of the site who were arrested on Aug. 25 for allegedly promoting prostitution. Federal authorities burst into the Rentboy offices near Union Square that day, made several arrests, seized assets and took down the website.Rentboy has racked up $10 million in revenue since 2010, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York.The arrests sent waves of outrage and anxiety through a community of sex workers who meet clients both on the streets and online. Those gathered outside the courthouse said that a site like Rentboy can provide a sliver of security and safety in a world that offers little of either.""Rentboy is widely known, they had a lot of resources regarding safety tips, and it's a community,"" explained Michael, a 22-year-old in white overall shorts and a red hat. ""That's safety.""Michael, who declined to give his last name, said he panicked after learning about the raid last week. ""The first thing that came into my head is, 'How am I going to pay for rent?'"" he said.For the past year, advertising on Rentboy had helped him pay the bills, and the day before the raid, he'd spent $60 on a new ad. His rent was due the day of the protest, and he still hadn't come up with it.""Now, I don't get to choose what kind of work I do,"" Michael said, ""and that's really risky.""As some of the other protesters were quick to point out, their objections to the crackdown on Rentboy aren't just about making a living, but about a larger movement that seeks the legalization of sex work for broader political reasons.""We're here to say that the [charges] need to be dropped but also to broaden the conversation to the way that people in the sex trades are terrorized every day by law enforcement agencies,"" said Andy Medina, a 24-year-old activist with The #HookUp Collaborative, an advocacy group of people who advertise on Rentboy and their allies.Medina, who was wearing a striped shirt and a nose ring, first got involved with the sex worker advocacy movement a few years ago when a friend went missing.""I was just surviving as a young person, and then it began to click -- how this was all structural,"" he recalled. ""I can't call anybody, and actually, maybe I'm putting my friend more at risk if I call the police. It was a really scary moment.""When Medina heard about the Rentboy raid, he was surprised to learn that it had been carried out by a division of the Department of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney's Office. The arrestees are accused of promoting prostitution across state lines. But nothing else about the event surprised him, he said.""This is just another example of law enforcement putting people in the sex trades at more harm,"" he said.Beyond the use of Rentboy, other safety measures that he and his colleagues take can also put them at risk of arrest, Medina pointed out. Carrying a condom, for example, can be used as evidence of intending to trade sex for money.""These agencies don't work to make sex workers safe or have lives free of violence or anything like that. They just criminalize us and put us in harm's way,"" he said.Medina peered over at the crowd of dozens of advocates, some of them wearing T-shirts from groups like the LGBTQ Task Force. The protesters walked in a slow circle across the street from the courthouse, chanting, ""Homeland Security, get out of my bedroom.""""Unless you're paying!"" a woman shouted out to peals of laughter.Last week's raid was no isolated incident, Medina said, in law enforcement's ongoing war on sex workers. Now ""if the charges were dropped as a symbol of some type of change towards recognizing the human rights of sex workers, that would be amazing,"" he said.Similar protests are expected in the coming days in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago. Bizzy Barefoot, a 41-year old artist who has been involved in sex worker advocacy for years, said the reaction to the Rentboy raid may be a sign that the fight for decriminalization is gaining ground. Last month, Amnesty International announced that it would be pushing for the decriminalization of consensual sex work worldwide. ""I haven't seen this happen around this subject before,"" Barefoot said. ""I do think we're hitting a tipping point.""Penelope Saunders, a coordinator with the Best Practices Policy Project who has been advocating for sex workers since the 1980s, disagreed only with Barefoot's phrasing. ""I see it more as one part of the beautiful mosaic of changes that we've seen over the last few years,"" she said. ""This action comes out of more than a decade of the resurgence of the sex worker movement in the United States. Rallies like this don't drop down from out of the sky."""

The clerk, Kim Davis, went to court Thursday after she defied a judge’s order to issue the licenses. She was held in contempt and taken into custody.Also on HuffPost:"

The NFL’s punishment of Brady was “premised on several significant legal deficiencies,"" Berman ruled, including that it had failed to provide the quarterback with adequate notice of “both his potential discipline and his alleged misconduct” as required by the league's collective bargaining agreement with players. The decision is available in its entirety below.""Based upon the foregoing and applicable legal authorities, the Court hereby denies the Management Council's motion to confirm the Award and grants the Players Association's motion to vacate the Award, thereby vacating the four-game suspension of Tom Brady, effective immediately,"" Berman wrote in the conclusion.The judge ruled that Brady had no reason to know that having a “general awareness” of deflated footballs would subject him to a punishment equal to that for violating the NFL’s collectively-bargained performance-enhancing drug policy.Additionally, the judge said Brady had no reason to be aware that potentially violating equipment rules could result in a suspension rather than a fine. (Brady has consistently maintained that he played no role in an effort to deliberately deflate his team's footballs.)“No NFL policy or precedent provided notice that a player could be subject to discipline for general awareness of another person's alleged misconduct,” Berman wrote. “And, it does not appear that the NFL has ever, prior to this case, sought to punish players for such an alleged violation.”Berman also ruled that the arbitration hearing in which Goodell upheld Brady's original suspension was ""fundamentally unfair"" because Goodell did not allow Brady’s attorneys to question NFL general counsel Jeff Pash, a right that should have been respected under league precedent.Goodell’s refusal to provide Brady’s attorneys with notes and witness testimony from the “independent” Wells investigation also tainted the arbitration process, Berman found.NFLPA Executive Director DeMaurice Smith celebrated ""the victory of the rule of law"" in a statement published to the association's website Thursday morning.""This decision should prove, once and for all, that our Collective Bargaining Agreement does not grant this Commissioner the authority to be unfair, arbitrary and misleading,"" he said. ""While the CBA grants the person who occupies the position of Commissioner the ability to judiciously and fairly exercise the designated power of that position, the union did not agree to attempts to unfairly, illegally exercise that power, contrary to what the NFL has repeatedly and wrongfully claimed.""As of now, Brady will be able to play in his team's season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers. But Goodell said in a statement that the league will appeal the ruling ""to protect the integrity of the game."" ""The commissioner’s responsibility to secure the competitive fairness of our game is a paramount principle, and the league and our 32 clubs will continue to pursue a path to that end,"" he added.Berman had previously pushed for a settlement, calling it a ""rational and logical option"" as he saw pros and cons to both sides' arguments. After the NFL and its players union failed to do so during last-minute negotiations, the judge said he would deliver a ruling this week. Deflategate started in January following the the Patriots' 45-7 victory over the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship Game. In May, the NFL released the 243-page Wells Report, which suggested it was probable Brady was ""at least generally aware"" of team personnel deliberately deflating footballs below approved levels. The league then handed Brady a four-game suspension, which Brady appealed and commissioner Roger Goodell later upheld. The decision is the result of a lawsuit filed by the NFL to confirm that it handled the situation properly. The league picked lower Manhattan because the courts there have been historically ""pro-business,"" according to Yahoo Sports' Dan Wetzel. The NFLPA has said Brady's suspension was the result of a “fundamentally unfair arbitration proceeding.""A survey of NFL players by ESPN's NFL nation in August found that while 72 percent said they think the Patriots purposefully deflated their footballs, a similar percentage believe other teams employ similar tactics. Only 16 percent said they were upset about it. Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday offered a striking rebuttal to criticisms of his anti-war views, saying that he is opposed to war because of its lasting physical and mental toll on America’s veterans.“War should be in my view, the last resort of a great nation. We should explore every other option -- and I know that opens up the political types: ‘Oh, you’re wimpy. You don’t want to go to war.’ Well, I don’t accept that. I’ve talked to too many people who came home without legs, without eyesight, with traumatic brain injury,” he said in an interview with the Des Moines Register.The Democratic presidential hopeful has long opposed war: as an activist, he protested the Vietnam War, and as a congressman, he railed against the Iraq War.But Sanders also cares deeply for military veterans and has spent much of his legislative career fighting for better health care, jobs and educational opportunities for veterans. As chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee last year, he brokered a bipartisan deal to pass a bill allocating $17 billion to reform the VA health care system and reduce backlogs at VA hospitals (though veterans continue to experience severe delays in receiving care).On Thursday, Sanders also defended the Iran nuclear deal, criticizing opponents of the deal who say the United States should just impose more economic sanctions.“Do I particularly trust Iran? No, I don’t,” he said. “But I think that this agreement has enough mechanisms in it to say to Iran that if they break the agreement, we’re going to snap back those sanctions, and they will be punished severely, and military force always remains an option. But I think we should do everything we can to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon without having to go to war.”Also on HuffPost:"

But as he began his prepared remarks at Miami Dade College, the vice president couldn't help but slyly comment on the intense speculation over his possible candidacy in the 2016 presidential race. ""Look at all the press you’ve attracted,"" Biden told a gathering of students and faculty. ""Their interest in community college has impressed me. I hope that’s what they are going to write about!”The vice president continues to weigh a presidential bid, and he has said he will make a final decision sometime this fall. Although he has not yet made any moves typical of a candidate testing a potential candidacy -- such as hiring staff in key early primary states or organizing an exploratory committee -- Biden has reportedly sounded out key allies about the prospect of challenging former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the current front-runner in the race for the Democratic nomination.Portions of Biden's remarks in Miami about the need to invest additional funds in higher education sounded like the broad outlines of a campaign speech.""Being in the middle class is not a reflection of your salary. It’s a value set,"" he said, adding that it ""means you’re able to own your home. ... It means you can send your kid to a park and know that they’ll come home safely.""Prior to the speech, Biden visited with a group of students who were conducting an experiment at at the school's biotechnology lab. When one student asked if the vice president would like to lend a hand, Biden demurred.""No, I'm going to watch,"" he said, according to a pool report.

14,POLITICS,County That Gutted The Voting Rights Act Won't Be Paid For Its Effort,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shelby-county-voting-rights-act_us_55e7167fe4b0aec9f3555904,Supreme Court victor wanted $2 million to cover its costs in trying to destroy the law.,2015-09-02,"<p>People wait in line outside the Supreme Court to hear oral arguments in the voting rights case of Shelby County v. Holder on Feb. 27, 2013.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_68_34_4480_2368%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"It's been more than two years since the Supreme Court dealt a major blow to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the case is still moving through the courts. But hopefully not for much longer.On Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit declined to award the winner in that case, Alabama's Shelby County, more than $2 million in attorney fees from the loser in that case, the United States. Under federal law, plaintiffs who help enforce civil rights laws through successful lawsuits are generally entitled to reimbursement of the fees they paid their attorneys. The rationale is that discrimination is ugly, litigation to root it out is expensive, and the bad actors who perpetrate it should pay for that effort.But the federal appeals court found that the Alabama county didn't quite meet the criteria.""Shelby County's problem here is not that this lawsuit may have upset some observers,"" wrote Judge Thomas Griffith. ""We find Shelby County not entitled because its lawsuit did not enforce compliance with the [Voting Rights Act] and because Congress did not intend to use fees to encourage the invalidation of the Act's provisions."" In other words, they're not entitled to anything because they didn't sue to protect citizens from voting discrimination. They sued because they didn't like the law that protects citizens from voting discrimination, and the law wasn't designed to award those who undermine it.Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who specializes in election law, called the county's position in the fees request ""chutzpah.""Let's backtrack a bit: Shelby County filed suit against the federal government because officials sought to free themselves of the onerous requirements the Voting Rights Act imposed on their efforts to change the county's voting procedures.The gist of the county's challenge was that it no longer believed voting discrimination within its boundaries was so rampant that the law should subject it to ""preclearance"" -- the process of asking the Justice Department or a special federal court in Washington, D.C., for permission every time a ""covered"" jurisdiction enacts new election rules.That requirement, Shelby County argued, was unconstitutional because it exceeded Congress' authority and infringed on the county's prerogatives to decide its own election rules. Think of the argument as states' rights vs. voting rights.Five justices of the Supreme Court bought it. In Shelby County v. Holder, they struck down the key provision of the Voting Rights Act that brought the county and other jurisdictions with a history of discrimination under the supervision of the federal government.Once free from the burden of preclearance, you'd think Shelby County would go away happy that it won a big Supreme Court case. Instead, the county asked a lower court to award it $2 million to pay for litigation expenses. After all, it won a case under an important federal statute, right?Well, no.The D.C. Circuit explained that an entity like Shelby County ""can only receive fees if it also shows that it is entitled to them, meaning that its victory in court helped advance the rationales that led Congress to create"" the possibility of an award of attorney fees.Here, the rationale of Congress was simple: The Voting Rights Act exists to safeguard the ""voting guarantees"" of the 14th and 15th Amendments, not to allow a county government to bring a lawsuit that narrows its protections.""I find nothing at all difficult about the question whether the County is even eligible for fees,"" Circuit Judge David Tatel wrote, adding that he wouldn't even engage in a lengthy constitutional discussion. To him, it was clear that the 14th and 15th Amendments ""protect not state autonomy, but rather individual rights against State denial or invasion.""So Shelby County is not entitled to any money, despite winning big at the Supreme Court. In this small respect, it seems that justice prevailed."

Chris Christie (R) on Wednesday offered some more details about his proposal to more closely track immigrants with U.S. visas in order to crack down on illegal immigration.It turns out the hawkish presidential contender does not want to treat people like FedEx packages, as he suggested at a campaign event on Saturday. Rather, Christie said, he would track people who overstayed their visas using existing biometric technology -- or their fingerprints.""I don't mean people are packages,"" Christie said in an interview on Fox News. ""We should use biometric technology to track people who come as visitors. They are not immigrants, they are not immigrating here. They are here to visit for a period of time, get an education or do something we permit them to do to visit our country, and we should track those people and they should not stay over the period of time they do.""""People complain about the 11 million [undocumented immigrants in the U.S.]. Well, 40 percent of those 11 million are here not because they snuck over the southern border -- which we spend a lot of time talking about -- but because we let them in through an airport and decided we do not need to track them anymore,"" the governor went on. ""This is not treating people like packages. I'm not saying put bar codes on people -- that is ridiculous. But we need to use technology in order to be able to secure the border.""Christie said he envisioned a system similar to the one that law enforcement authorities use to track criminals by their fingerprints. The proposed system would issue a red flag if someone with an expired visa used their ID to rent a car or take a flight, for example.""The technology exists. I think you can do it with fingerprint technology,"" Christie said. ""Government doesn't do this."""
