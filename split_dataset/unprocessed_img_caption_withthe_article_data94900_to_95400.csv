2,FIFTY,The Dollars And Sense Of Buying A Vacation Home,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/buying-a-vacation-home-_n_6746262.html,,2015-03-08,"Seaside villa in the resort Casa de Campo, La Romana, Dominican Republic",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb670ab200000c501012226.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SPECIAL FROM Next AvenueBy Craig VeneziaWith Old Man Winter on a rampage this year, it’s no wonder Tad Reeve, 56, and his wife Maria, 47, of St. Paul, Minn., recently headed to Captiva Island, Fla. for some fun in the sun. But this trip involved more than strolling on the beach looking for sand dollars. The couple was also looking at the possibility of buying a vacation home.  “Winters in St. Paul are tough. We always liked the idea of having a place of our own to escape to each year,” Tad says.  The hardy Reeves are hardly alone. Americans bought 717,000 vacation homes in 2013, according to the National Association of Realtors; that’s the most recent data available.“In the last several years, I’ve seen a 25 percent increase in the number of clients looking to buy vacation homes, ” says Steve Goddard, a Realtor with ReMax Estate Properties in Manhattan Beach, Calif. Goddard attributes the trend, in part, to a stronger housing market and historically low interest rates.  If you’re considering taking the plunge, take time to figure out what a vacation home purchase would really cost you. Otherwise, you may find that owning one is no holiday.Expect Stricter Mortgage Requirements  More than 60 percent of vacation-home buyers carry a mortgage (current national average rate: 3.5 percent on a 30-year fixed-rate loan). If you plan to get one, be prepared for more scrutiny from lenders than on primary residences.“These loans tend to have higher credit requirements because people are taking on large amounts of additional debt,” says David Gorman, Regional Sales Executive for Bank of America. “Traditionally, they are more likely to pay the mortgage on their primary homes if they run into financial issues.”  Those higher credit requirements come primarily in the form of higher down payments. Expect to put down at least 10 percent on a vacation home (compared to a 5 percent minimum, or even no down payment, for a primary residence). You may want to put down 20 percent or more, if you can, to avoid paying private mortgage insurance (PMI), which usually runs between 1/2 and 1 percent of the loan amount on an annual basis.  You’ll qualify for the best mortgage rate if your credit score is over 700. Otherwise, you could pay a rate that’s about one percent or more higher.Know the Cost of Insurance  You’ll, of course, need homeowner’s insurance and you may have to buy flood or earthquake insurance (that costs $650 and $800 per year, on average, respectively).According to the Insurance Information Institute, if you plan to use your vacation home exclusively for yourself, insuring it may be as simple as extending the policy you already have on your primary residence.If you’ll be renting it out, though, you’ll need to buy a separate rental dwelling policy; that costs about 25 percent more than your primary home’s policy. Most rental dwelling policies reimburse for the loss of rental income if you can’t rent your place out while it’s being repaired due to damage from a covered loss.  Property Management   Since owning a vacation home means you won’t be there all the time, you may need to hire someone to take care of it during your absences — or when you’re in between guests, if you rent it out.  For townhouses or condominiums, you homeowner’s association dues will handle outside maintenance. No such luck for single-family homes. Regardless, the inside is your responsibility.  If you’ll hire a property management company, figure on spending about $75 a month, not including the cost of repairs. This firm can also help you find renters if you want; expect to pay upwards of 30 percent or more on the daily rent you take in.Understand Tax Implications  Be sure you’re familiar with the vacation home tax rules, too, before making a purchase. The property will still qualify for the mortgage interest deduction, assuming the combined mortgages on both your homes don’t exceed $1.1 million. And property taxes are fully deductible.  Things get trickier, taxwise, when you use the vacation home as a rental property. “If you rent out your vacation home for more than 14 days a year, you will have to report rental income,” says Jared Callister, a tax attorney in Fresno, Calif. “But you will also be able to deduct rental expenses, like repairs and depreciation.”  What you can deduct depends on how much you use the place personally versus renting it out. Also, most states expect you to pay sales taxes on rental income.  Some cities and counties impose such taxes, too; they may go by other names, such as lodging, accommodations, hotel, bed, tourist or transient occupancy taxes. Be sure to find out whether you’d owe them so you’re not hit with a nasty surprise after you become a vacation-home owner.Read more from Next Avenue: 6 up-and-coming places to retire What to do when you inherit your parents' house 8 key money moves after paying off your house"

What follows here is an edited version of my interview with him. The full version will be published in a book.Creston Davis [CD]: You are considered a world-renowned professor in Critical Studies and Education. What drew you to the subject of education? Peter McLaren [PM]: I was drawn to education having had some amazing teachers in my later high school years. I grew up working-class until my teenaged years. I hated school until my last year of high school. Politically, I came of age in the 1960s especially after hitchhiking to San Francisco and Los Angeles to protest the Vietnam War in 1968. While Timothy Leary and I tripped together on LSD, Allen Ginsberg told me to stop taking psychedelics and to concentrate on my writing.  Peter McLaren with Paulo FreireThat was the year that I learned a major political lesson. After returning back to Toronto, and still only 19 years old, the police took me to jail, where I was systematically beaten with a flashlight throughout the night. I had begun to realize that a new generation was being born and life was not going to be easy, especially if you lived your life against the grain.I published a diary of my classroom teaching experiences in 1980 and it became a Canadian best seller. Later, I audited classes taught by Michel Foucault and Umberto Eco, Ernesto Laclau and other critical theorists. Then I met my true mentor, Paulo Freire, in 1985, and my life changed. Freire had been in prison and was in exile because of his radical way of working with peasants in Northeast Brazil. He taught them not only to read the word, but also the world. The Brazilian ruling class became worried. Life in Schools is really my most popular book to this day, although I think that my new book coming out this June, Pedagogy of Insurrection, could replace it in popularity and importance since it deals with the question of spirituality and revolution and engages the topic of Jesus of Nazareth as a socialist revolutionary.  Peter and Me in Southern California   [CD] What kinds of figures, theorists, activists have influenced and shaped your work?  [PM]: I am drawn to the life and teachings of Ernesto Che Guevara, Frantz Fanon, Karel Kosik, Archbishop Oscar Romero, Malcolm X and of course Karl Marx and Rosa Luxemburg. Noam Chomsky, Stanley Aronowitz. Liberation theology became an important part of my formation, especially after converting to Catholicism when I was 25. Peter Hudis's exegesis on Marx and Rosa Luxemburg, and the work of Kevin Anderson, have been very important for my reading of these great giants. Freire, of course, remains central to my work. Howard Zinn was a big influence, as was Istvan Mesaros, Jose Carlos Mariategui, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, Leonardo Boff and of course Ernst Bloch. Decolonial thinkers such as Enrique Dussel and Anibal Quijano and Ramon Grosfoguel have figured prominently in my more recent thinking. So, has the work of William I. Robinson on the transnational capitalist class. And I am very much drawn to the work of Jose Porfirio Miranda on socialism and the bible.  Considered one of the best books on education in the world, Life in Schools.President Hugo Chavez was indeed an organic intellectual, and I admired him a great deal. He was instrumental in convincing me how important critical pedagogy was for the Bolivarian revolution and meeting him in Miraflores Palace was an experience I shall never forget. Spending days in the palace putting up posters of Che Guevara with comrades during the early years of the revolution instilled in me a revolutionary spirit that I shall never forget. Spending time in communities in Mexico that supported the Zapatistas influenced me more than I could have anticipated. And meeting educators in Colombia who risk assassination continually can't help but make you think seriously about your vocation as an educator and push you to do more for the oppressed, for the downtrodden and to create educational spaces to enable people to liberate themselves from the injustice of immiseration capitalism.

What follows here is an edited version of my interview with him. The full version will be published in a book.Creston Davis [CD]: You are considered a world-renowned professor in Critical Studies and Education. What drew you to the subject of education? Peter McLaren [PM]: I was drawn to education having had some amazing teachers in my later high school years. I grew up working-class until my teenaged years. I hated school until my last year of high school. Politically, I came of age in the 1960s especially after hitchhiking to San Francisco and Los Angeles to protest the Vietnam War in 1968. While Timothy Leary and I tripped together on LSD, Allen Ginsberg told me to stop taking psychedelics and to concentrate on my writing.  Peter McLaren with Paulo FreireThat was the year that I learned a major political lesson. After returning back to Toronto, and still only 19 years old, the police took me to jail, where I was systematically beaten with a flashlight throughout the night. I had begun to realize that a new generation was being born and life was not going to be easy, especially if you lived your life against the grain.I published a diary of my classroom teaching experiences in 1980 and it became a Canadian best seller. Later, I audited classes taught by Michel Foucault and Umberto Eco, Ernesto Laclau and other critical theorists. Then I met my true mentor, Paulo Freire, in 1985, and my life changed. Freire had been in prison and was in exile because of his radical way of working with peasants in Northeast Brazil. He taught them not only to read the word, but also the world. The Brazilian ruling class became worried. Life in Schools is really my most popular book to this day, although I think that my new book coming out this June, Pedagogy of Insurrection, could replace it in popularity and importance since it deals with the question of spirituality and revolution and engages the topic of Jesus of Nazareth as a socialist revolutionary.  Peter and Me in Southern California   [CD] What kinds of figures, theorists, activists have influenced and shaped your work?  [PM]: I am drawn to the life and teachings of Ernesto Che Guevara, Frantz Fanon, Karel Kosik, Archbishop Oscar Romero, Malcolm X and of course Karl Marx and Rosa Luxemburg. Noam Chomsky, Stanley Aronowitz. Liberation theology became an important part of my formation, especially after converting to Catholicism when I was 25. Peter Hudis's exegesis on Marx and Rosa Luxemburg, and the work of Kevin Anderson, have been very important for my reading of these great giants. Freire, of course, remains central to my work. Howard Zinn was a big influence, as was Istvan Mesaros, Jose Carlos Mariategui, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, Leonardo Boff and of course Ernst Bloch. Decolonial thinkers such as Enrique Dussel and Anibal Quijano and Ramon Grosfoguel have figured prominently in my more recent thinking. So, has the work of William I. Robinson on the transnational capitalist class. And I am very much drawn to the work of Jose Porfirio Miranda on socialism and the bible.  Considered one of the best books on education in the world, Life in Schools.President Hugo Chavez was indeed an organic intellectual, and I admired him a great deal. He was instrumental in convincing me how important critical pedagogy was for the Bolivarian revolution and meeting him in Miraflores Palace was an experience I shall never forget. Spending days in the palace putting up posters of Che Guevara with comrades during the early years of the revolution instilled in me a revolutionary spirit that I shall never forget. Spending time in communities in Mexico that supported the Zapatistas influenced me more than I could have anticipated. And meeting educators in Colombia who risk assassination continually can't help but make you think seriously about your vocation as an educator and push you to do more for the oppressed, for the downtrodden and to create educational spaces to enable people to liberate themselves from the injustice of immiseration capitalism. What animated this work was a feeling of love for humanity, an overwhelming feeling of community and commitment to serve the people. I began to realize that love and justice are one and the same, and that is the major message of Jesus.   [CD]: You are one of the most prolific writers in education today having published many books. What was your favorite book to write?[PM]: That would be Che Guevara, Paulo Freire and the Pedagogy of Revolution. This might sound a bit odd but I felt the spirit of Che speaking to me as I was writing that book.

Choose it. Choose to be gay yourself. Show America how that's done, Ben, show us how a man can choose to be gay. Suck my dick. Name the time and the place and I'll bring my dick and a camera crew and you can suck me off and win the argument.Carson later apologized for his remarks, but not before catching major heat for his exchange with CNN's Chris Cuomo. He said in the interview there was no comparison between civil rights and gay rights because citizens have no choice of their race, while homosexuality is ""absolutely"" a choice. ""A lot of people who go into prison, go into prison straight, and when they come out they're gay,"" he said.In his essay, published March 4 in The Stranger, Savage, who writes a syndicated sex column, wrote how religious conservatives use the ""choice"" argument to deny civil rights to the gay community.""Like truthers (9/11 was an inside job), birthers (Barack Obama was born in Kenya), and deathers (Osama bin Laden is alive and well and living in West Hollywood), choicers are another group deranged conspiracy theorists who can't be dissuaded by science or evidence or facts. They insist that being gay is a conscious choice that a person makes,"" he wrote.Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who recently finished fourth among potential 2016 GOP presidential candidates in a straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference, has previously compared homosexuality with bestiality and pedophilia. He apologized for those comments as well.H/T Raw Story"

The fact that we are talking about gender equality when 31 million girls receive no education at all is scandalous. We should all reflect on what we need to do as a society to give hope to these girls, not to mention the hundreds of millions more who are forced to drop out of school because of poverty, conflict and discrimination. As someone who did not go to school until very late in life, I think real action is now needed if we want to sustain our mission and promises to get every child, including every girl, into school by the end of 2015. I grew up in an African village where major organizations promised to help young marginalized girls like me, yet we were vulnerable to exploitation. It was only after being a victim of human trafficking that I began learning the very basics in France and found the help of a mentor.At Africa Gathering, my team and I are opening tech hubs for young women in Africa; we believe technology must not be just for those that currently have access to it but that it is for everyone. In our Senegal tech hubs, young girls are learning basic code: they are developing apps and tech solutions and in turn this training is opening up opportunities for them that they wouldn't have had otherwise: for example, girls in Uganda are now able to learn about their health and wellbeing through use of family planning and other apps which improve their lives at a local level.In recent years, there has been progress when it comes to getting girls safely into school and learning. African governments have received support from major organizations working on strengthening education systems, including the Global Partnership for Education and UNESCO, and global movements such as A World at School are being led by young ambassadors for education, often still in their teens. Yet we are still not doing enough to close the gender gap; it is girls in rural areas who will be the last to go school. The harsh reality is we cannot talk about the prosperity of women and girls in Africa if we don't tackle the reasons girls are discriminated against and made vulnerable to exploitation in the first place.Gender inequality is a major problem in most African Countries -- indeed it is not unique to Africa -- but concrete actions such as increasing funding for STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects, removing the barriers to an education and even legalizing land ownership must be some of the priorities for today's African leaders. Africa has the opportunity to unlock the potential of its women and girls. They are its wisest investment.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post in partnership with A World At School's ""Girls Stand #UpForSchool"" petition launch on International Women's Day 2015 (March 8).

He opened up a new phase in the U.S. military's ongoing goal of keeping afloat the Saigon government. The United States was using the airfield near Da Nang as a base of operations for the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV). The landing of 3,500 Marines (two battalions) in the port city was to protect a U.S. airbase from National Liberation Front (NLF) attack and it marked a turning point in what would become a gigantic commitment of U.S. forces in Vietnam. Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, one of the war's chief architects whose mea culpa came 30 years too late, estimated that the war cost the lives of over three million Vietnamese. Fifty-eight thousand Americans also died in Vietnam over the course of the conflict, with about 250,000 wounded.The following month, Johnson sent to Vietnam two more Marine battalions. The process of escalation had begun. And by 1968 the U.S. military presence in Vietnam grew to over 500,000 soldiers. The U.S. airbases in the south had become targets for NLF assault, such as the one at Pleiku, given the fact that many Vietnamese didn't like the idea of a foreign power setting up shop in their country and using its real estate as a base to bomb their relatives in the north. Johnson's special assistant for national security affairs, McGeorge Bundy, assured the president that ""Pleikus are like streetcars,"" meaning the U.S. wouldn't have to wait long for a pretext for ""retaliatory"" bombing. On February 24, 1965, the U.S. launched ""Operation Rolling Thunder,"" a ""sustained reprisal"" air war in ""retaliation"" for Vietnamese hit-and-run strikes against U.S. bases. For the next three years ""Rolling Thunder"" made 100-plane bombing raids a daily routine in Vietnam (with a few ""pauses"" thrown in largely for U.S. public consumption).In what has become a kind of footnote in history because Vietnam overshadowed it, on April 14, 1965, President Johnson sent 23,000 Marines into the Dominican Republic to crush what he considered an anti-U.S. revolution on the island. Foreign capitals, especially in Latin America, generally viewed the intervention as a heavy-handed expression of old-style Yankee imperialism (which it was). But a Harris poll taken in May 1965 showed that 57 percent of Americans approved of Johnson's handling of both the escalation in Vietnam and the Dominican invasion. On May 6, 1965, New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy, in his first address to the Senate, said that President Johnson's Dominican invasion, along with his Vietnam policies, were part of a ""seamless web"" that relied too heavily on brute military force. Kennedy called Johnson's choice to escalate the war in Vietnam ""a deep and terrible decision."" He sought what he called a ""third course"" for the United States in Vietnam, one where the political conflict in Saigon would be ironed out through negotiations and possibly a coalition government. In both Vietnam and the Dominican Republic, Kennedy criticized the Johnson Administration for failing to differentiate between Communists and non-Communist nationalists. ""I do not believe we should be under the self-delusion that this military effort will bring Ho Chi Minh or the Vietcong to their knees,"" he said.Over the course of the next three years it was as if the war's blowback and toxicities leached back into the United States' body politic. American society had become so polarized that even the daughters and sons of the ruling elite were rebelling. The Vietnam War laid bare all of the contradictions and hypocrisies of America's Cold War foreign policy. It showed the world how far the United States would go to fight the spread of Communism in Southeast Asia.Like the neo-cons today who always see a silver lining for the United States even when their policy prescriptions prove to be catastrophic, LBJ's Secretary of State Dean Rusk claimed that the bombing, the ""free fire zones,"" the cluster bombs, the napalm, the defoliants, and all the rest of the carnage was justified because (in his crackpot realist worldview) ""we"" really showed them Russkies how far America would go to stand by its allies.Too bad Secretary Rusk remained incapable of seeing that the maniacal death machine that he helped unleash in Vietnam proved to be a public relations disaster for the United States in Western Europe (and much of the rest of the world) as well as a propaganda bonanza for Soviet leaders who said: ""Look at what the Americans are doing in Vietnam -- and they think they can lecture the world about democracy and freedom?""By 1968, the Vietnam War had so torn apart the Democratic Party that Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy both challenged President Johnson for the party's nomination. The assassination of Kennedy on June 6, 1968, and the rioting that ensued at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago after the party rejected a peace plank in the platform, altered the nation's perception of Democrats and foreign policy. This assessment continues to reverberate whenever you hear a right-winger scream that Democrats are ""appeasers,"" just as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did before a joint session of Congress on March 3rd. Still A Lot to Learn These days, it has become far more difficult to teach the history of America's war in Vietnam because one of the chief lessons of that war we thought we had learned (""No More Vietnams"") has been soundly disproven in recent years.The Iraq debacle erased that presumption pretty thoroughly.The Iraq War had its own ""Gulf of Tonkin Incident"" in the form of non-existent ""weapons of mass destruction."" It had its own ""light at the end of the tunnel"" discourse when Thomas Friedman and other prognosticators always saw real progress in Iraq just ""six months"" over the horizon, which became known as ""Friedman Units."" Like Vietnam, the Iraq War had its own body counts and mounting civilian death toll and even its own My Lai massacre in the form of the torture photos from Abu Ghraib prison. Vietnam had ""Hamburger Hill""; Iraq had Fallujah.After the end of the conflict Vietnamese civilians suffered for years from land mines, unexploded cluster munitions, and birth defects and cancers brought to them by Monsanto, the manufacturer of Agent Orange. Iraqi civilians, too, have suffered birth defects and cancers from the depleted uranium rounds the U.S. fired all over the place, and from the toxins left behind in myriad forms, even from burning waste. In Vietnam and Iraq civilians suffered the highest number of casualties and deaths. Like Vietnam, the Iraq War spawned a peace movement (even breaking all records internationally for citizens who tried to stop a war before it began). The February 15, 2003 demonstrations were so massive, that even the New York Times had to acknowledge it as being a significant representation of popular will. (President George W. Bush dismissed it as a ""focus group."")Iraq had its own ""domino theory"" where Paul Wolfowitz and other neo-cons promised that toppling the government in Baghdad would have a salutary effect on other nations in the region. And like Vietnam, the Iraq War's popularity among the American people plummeted as it wore on and the initial justifications for the war proved to be based on deception. Iraq has given us roughly the same Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and suicide rates among returning veterans and the same dismal welcome home of wounded soldiers by a strained Veterans Administration health system. And like Vietnam, when it comes to Iraq no one has been really held accountable for perpetrating the worst crime any public servant or government official could ever commit: Lying your country into war."

Martin O'Malley (D) continued to position himself to the left of Hillary Clinton on financial regulation this weekend and called for the reinstatement of a key piece of regulatory legislation that was repealed under President Bill Clinton.O'Malley, who is considering a 2016 White House bid, told reporters in New Hampshire on Friday that he favored reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that required banks to keep their commercial and investment activities separate. The law was repealed with President Clinton's backing in 1999, which allowed banks to make risky bets with depositor money. O'Malley also said that Democrats shouldn't shy away from standing up for Wall Street regulation.“I can tell you when it comes to reform of Wall Street, I think that we would make a mistake as a party if we held ourselves out as becoming some kind of a version of Dodd-Frank Lite,"" he said, according to The New York Times, referencing the 2010 financial reform law that Republicans have repeatedly tried to weaken.O'Malley made similar remarks speaking last weekend in South Carolina, where he said that Democrats should ""be very clear"" about their position on Wall Street regulation.“Trying to find ways to make sure that nobody’s feelings are hurt when we talk about re-invigorating and making more robust the regulation of Wall Street so that rank speculation and gambling with other people’s money does not once again wreck our economy and our common good, you have to be very clear about the beliefs we share and the best way forward,” he said, according to  The Washington Post.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has also called for Congress to reinstate Glass-Steagall. Some have suggested that O'Malley's best chance of beating Clinton, heavily favored to win the Democratic nomination, is by running to her left. The comments help distinguish O'Malley from Clinton, viewed by many in the party to be cozy with Wall Street."

The only way to end bad behavior is to pass more stringent laws and to put teeth into enforcing them. That's what Independent Sector should have been asking for when it visited Congress.,2015-03-08,"Dark clouds are seen behind the U.S. Capitol as a storm moves through the area, Thursday, June 13, 2013 in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ecc03c000018010dffd6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last month Independent Sector, the coalition of big foundations and nonprofits, held a major event on Capitol Hill calling attention to newly updated guidelines on accountability it hopes every nonprofit will follow.Some of the updates it has made to the guidelines, which were first issued in 2007, are strong, but the entire endeavor misses the point: Asking nonprofits to voluntarily transform their behavior has done little to stomp out the biggest problems in the nonprofit world. The only way to end bad behavior is to pass more stringent laws and to put teeth into enforcing them.That's what Independent Sector should have been asking for when it visited Congress. After all, the numbers of scandals in the nonprofit world is a key reason the news media, state lawmakers, and others have continued to express concern about a major breakdown in nonprofit accountability.Let's look at what's happened since the guidelines -- which cost $2 million to develop -- were first issued after Sen. Chuck Grassley announced legislation to crack down on charity abuses.Little has changed in the year since Independent Sector took action. Transparency and public accountability are still problematic. The sums nonprofits pay in salary and perks to their chief executives are going through the roof, rivaling the salaries and benefits of people in corporate America. Sweetheart insider deals and other forms of ""self dealing"" seem to have become a more frequent, if not commonplace, nonprofit practice. Government oversight and enforcement activities have broken down.The long arc of justice does not seem to have bent toward equality and public accountability. If anything, nonprofits and foundations are more skewed toward wealthy donors and large nonprofit groups, seemingly impervious to the plight of the neediest Americans and grass-roots nonprofit groups.While the updated guidelines will do little to change that situation, they should, nonetheless, help organizations steer their course more wisely and effectively. The emphasis on the responsibilities of boards is particularly welcome, given the key role nonprofits play in ensuring the integrity and accountability of their organizations.The new guidelines also provide more flexibility on administrative and overhead costs, urge greater caution about fundraising and online-solicitation procedures, and encourage more effective retention and protection of organizational data and documents.And the drumbeat of attention the guidelines give to the importance of transparency and accountability is particularly positive because nonprofits have struggled for so long to measure up on both counts.Even though I don't believe self-regulation will solve the thorniest problems in the nonprofit world, I would have hoped that Independent Sector would have offered stronger language on several key issues.For example, it should have encouraged foundations and other nonprofits to issue an annual or biannual report to the public, perhaps making an exception for small groups that can't afford to do this kind of reporting.Among the other areas for improvement:Do more to discourage payments to board members. The report smartly acknowledges that nonprofits have a tradition of not paying board members but then does little to encourage organizations to stick to this principle. What's more, the guidelines ignore the fact that some nonprofits are increasingly willing to pay above-market rates to board members who provide legal, accounting, and fundraising services.Make clear that excessive pay has no place at nonprofits. The updated guidelines do not offer much guidance about executive compensation, even though so many scandals at nonprofits are caused by the enormous compensation packages many nonprofit CEOs receive. Are salaries of over $500,000, $1 million, or more reasonable? Are huge bonuses reasonable? What should be the standard of reasonableness?What's more, the guidelines urge nonprofits to compare salaries not just to comparable nonprofits but also to businesses. The corporate world should not be the model for nonprofits.Add accountability guidelines for foundations. Perhaps because Independent Sector gets most of its money from foundations -- both as members and in grants to support its work -- it decided it was too touchy to say anything in its guidelines about grant makers.The foundation world is in desperate need of transformation, so Independent Sector erred by focusing its guidelines only on charities. In its discussions of governance and accountability, it never mentions the problems caused by the growth of big foundations run by just two or three family members, even though they are a real threat to democracy and lack public accountability, as are boards composed mostly of elite individuals.The guidelines don't raise questions about the adequacy of the 5 percent minimum distribution rate or about ways that foundations can help nonprofits, like accelerating board meetings to review grants to shorten the amount of time nonprofits have to wait for their money. Nor does it make any useful suggestions about how foundations could be more accountable by allowing more nonprofits to apply for funds; today, so many foundations fail to accept solicited proposals that many worthy nonprofits have nowhere to turn.Strengthening the guidelines in such ways would be useful, but the most important thing Independent Sector could do if it wants to improve accountability is to call for new legislation and tougher enforcement.As Dean Zerbe, managing director of the Alliant Group and former tax counsel to the Senate Finance Committee, told The Chronicle, voluntary guidelines are useful, but tougher government laws and regulations are necessary.But Independent Sector appears perfectly comfortable with the status quo, failing to acknowledge that the IRS has been so decimated by staff cuts that it does little to enforce the law. Nor have state attorneys general demonstrated that they are capable of enforcing the rules that govern nonprofits. Why isn't Independent Sector lobbying Congress for additional revenue to enable the regulators to do their jobs?The answer is that Independent Sector doesn't want any tightening of federal regulations or enforcement. It believes that self-regulation can do the job.But self-reform by itself has never worked, and it never will.Pablo Eisenberg is a senior fellow at the Center for Public and Nonprofit Leadership at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy."

John Cabello (R-Machesney Park) last week introduced a bill to restore capital punishment, but in a different form than when it was abolished in 2011. “Obviously, we don’t want the same bill -- the same language -- that we had before,"" Cabello told The Huffington Post Friday. ""We have to have something in place for the worst of the worst. The bill is to make sure the discussion is there."" In 2003, troubled by questions of fairness, then-Gov. George Ryan (R) cleared the state's death row in the waning hours of his administration. Gov. Pat Quinn (D) ultimately signed legislation that abolished the death penalty outright. Quinn called it the hardest decision he ever had to make as governor. Because the legislation was not retroactive, Quinn commuted the sentences of the 15 men on death row. Illinois is now one of 18 U.S. states that have abolished the death penalty.Cabello said he wants his bill to facilitate a discussion of reforming the justice system in the House Judiciary-Criminal Committee, for which he serves as spokesman. Even if his bipartisan bill makes it to the House floor, he said he wouldn't likely call for a vote. ""I want to make sure we’re going to discuss every type of penalty, every type of issue, that could possibly come up within this commission to see what and how we want our criminal justice system to look like,"" Cabello said. The bill would bolster court-appointed defense teams, funding defense experts and investigators, allowing law students to help provide research and legal aid, and providing training to county public defenders. Though Cabello said he personally supports the death penalty, he said it should only be brought back ""if we came up with perfect reforms for the criminal justice system"" and for ""certain ironclad cases."" The punishment would apply to the ""worst of the worst,"" which he defined as including those convicted of murdering a first responder or a child under 12, or committing mass murder. Cabello is on leave from his job as a detective at the Rockford Police Department. As a lawmaker, he said he'd like to reduce state's prison population by 25 percent within the next 10 years. He also has introduced legislation that would allow someone convicted of a non-forcible felony to have that record sealed upon successful completion of prison educational or vocational training. ""We do an excellent job of putting people in prison,"" Cabello said. ""We do a lousy job of getting them back into society.""Cabello said his proposed legislation shouldn't define him as soft on crime. ""I’ve unfortunately had the opportunity to investigate murders, child sex crimes, every kind if crime you can’t possibly imagine and don’t want to imagine,"" he said. ""It's about getting smart on crime, not soft."" "

German forces had intended to sweep from the northwest into northern France in an attempt to break through the French lines and encircle the French army in a broad enveloping movement. Once surrounded, the hammer of the German right flank would fall against the anvil of the German center and left flank. Caught in the middle, the French forces would be annihilated and France would be forced out of the war. This was the strategic essence of the Schlieffen Plan. The Allied response was to slow down and blunt the German attack and prevent the encirclement and destruction of the French Army. The German plan failed. In that sense the Germans were defeated, although not yet vanquished. For the Allies, however, the German defeat was not the same as an Allied victory. German forces still controlled the industrial heartland of France and the Allies seemed incapable of rolling back the German tide.The Western Front 1915-1916For the next three years each side would look for a decisive breakthrough that would allow it to outflank its opponent and roll up its forces. Relying for the most part on massed infantry attacks across a no-man's land of barbed wire obstacles and mine fields preceded by a preparatory attack of sustained artillery bombardment, both sides continued to pour men into a meat grinder with seeming indifference to the mounting human losses. In the first years of the war, existing technology tilted the battlefield sharply in favor of defending forces. Human courage and determination was simply no match for rapid-fire machine guns and massed artillery. In time, both sides brought in their technological prowess to develop weapons that would change the odds in favor of the attacker: tanks, flame throwers, more effective forms of poison gas, all helped to reduce the overwhelming advantage held by the defenders. Even then, the war on the Western Front would remain largely static, its boundaries limited, at best, to a few miles on either side of the line of trenches. In most cases, progress was measured in yards. The only thing that changed was the mounting toll of dead and wounded. The Battle of Neuve-ChapelleBy the spring of 1915 on the Allied side of the line, Belgian forces controlled a 21-mile front along the Yser River and the Yperlee canal, from Nieuwpoort to Boesinghe. The British Expeditionary Force guarded a line stretching to south of St. Eloi in the valley of the River Somme. The rest of the line, all the way to the border with Switzerland, was the domain of the French army.  Once the battle lines of the Western Front had been drawn, the two sides searched for ways to break them. As Marshal Joffre's planners poured over the maps, one obvious possibility jumped out at them: a bulge in the line of trenches near the town of Compiègne, on the river Oise. According to Joffre's plan, British and French forces would attack from both sides and cut off the bulge, or salient.2nd Gurka Rifles at the Battle of Neuve ChapelleAccordingly, the morning of March 10, 1915 saw an assault by four British Empire divisions (including a large contingent from India) along a 2-mile front at the village of Neuve-Chapelle in the Artois region. The attack followed a 35-minute artillery bombardment and was supported with aerial attacks by Britain's Royal Flying Corps (RFC). The thrust was initially successful, with the German defenses overrun and the village secured, but the advance was held up by a determined German rearguard and poor communications. Two days later came a counterattack from forces commanded by Crown Prince Rupprecht and the campaign was called off on March 13. In recapturing about one mile of ground, the 40,000 Allied troops who took part in the Battle of Neuve-Chapelle had suffered 11,200 casualties - 7,000 British and 4,200 Indian. The Germans had suffered much the same fate.German Prisoners of War, Battle of Neuve ChapelleThe Battle of Neuve-Chapelle would prove to be the first of a long series of inconclusive battles on the western front. Determined to achieve a breakthrough, the Germans would unleash a devastating new weapon at the next major battle to follow, poison gas. That battle would be remembered as the Second Battle of Ypres."
