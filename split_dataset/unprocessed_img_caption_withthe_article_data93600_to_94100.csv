The show addresses the relationship between content creator and content consumer in the Internet, and consists of two major elements: On the lower floor of the space, six performers are using the Internet for different activities, and on the upper floor, their combined digital output is presented via two eyeholes in a large shipping crate. We had the chance to meet with Ryder Ripps in the exhibition and speak with him about the show. In this video, Ripps talks about the basic concept of Alone Together and the different elements of the work, his background, his work in general, and future projects.Ryder Ripps is a 28-year-old conceptual artist living in New York City. His first solo exhibition opened at Postmasters Gallery in January 2015. He has participated in group shows at MoMA PS1, Long Island City, Eyebeam, New York, Carroll / Fletcher, London, and Royal College of Art, London, as well as given talks for ForYourArt, Rhizome, and Sotheby's. Ripps received a BA from The New School. He is an alumni of City As School, class of 2004.For more videos covering contemporary art and architecture, go to VernissageTV."

Yet, the nearly $2 billion of U.S. taxpayers' money committed by the Administration to the New Alliance is being used to fund large agribusiness projects, some of which force poor farmers off their land.One of the first of these projects to break ground is by a Swedish-owned company, EcoEnergy, which is fronted by an investor nicknamed ""Ethanol Jesus"" by his country's tabloids.The company is already facing a police investigation in Sweden, following news that its head bought the rights to the project in Tanzania from his former company SEKAB for the sum of 400 Swedish Crowns (approximately $50), despite three Swedish municipalities being reported to have invested millions of Crowns in support of the project.ActionAid's research has found that families are being forced off their land in Bagamoyo following an inadequate consultation process conducted by EcoEnergy. Many of the people affected reported that they were not allowed to choose whether to leave their land, and that they were denied crucial information about the impact of the project on their ability to make a living off the land and feed their families. Land in demandThe Bagamoyo project will cover 20,000 hectares -- an area of land bigger than Washington D.C.EcoEnergy claims that its project will inject $45 million a year into the local economy, but ActionAid estimates that it may only generate a maximum of $11.5 million per year. With the plantation likely to produce sugar for ethanol, both the product and the profits are set to leave the country.One of the ways that EcoEnergy says the project will benefit the communities is through on ""outgrower"" scheme in which farmers would grow sugarcane and supply the company at an agreed price. But this will bring huge risk for the farmers, who will need to take out loans equivalent to $16,000 per person, or 30 times the minimum annual agricultural salary in Tanzania. The company estimates that it will take at least seven years for the farmers to pay back the loan and make a profit. But even then, they will face higher costs as the food that they used to grow themselves will have to be bought, and they will have to pay for housing for their families elsewhere.With more than 20 large land projects already in the pipeline in Tanzania alone, land in Africa is in huge demand. The large amounts of public cash on offer mean that international companies such as the tax-dodging beer giant SABMiller and other big players like food conglomerate Cargill and Monsanto, are keen to get in on the action. This spells trouble for Africa's smallholder farmers -- the very people that produce up to 80 percent of the continent's food. Rather than allowing these farmers to be pushed aside when a big investor comes calling, countries like Tanzania and big donors like the U.S., should be providing the support that these farmers need to ensure food security and sustainable growth for African economies.President Obama has a history of supporting constructive international programs that can reach women smallholder farmers with critical investments -- including his flagship L'Aquila initiative, some of the Feed the Future programs and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, but he got it wrong with the New Alliance, and it needs to be scrapped. It's time for the administration to end its support for the New Alliance and focus its funding on supporting smallholder farmers in Africa, rather than initiatives that take away their land and livelihoods."

3,COMEDY,30 Days of Online Dating: Naughty by Nature,"Stacie Corliss, ContributorWriter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/30-days-of-online-dating-_12_b_6850994.html,,2015-03-24,2015-03-11-1426112196-5095841-TinderTrevorNaughty.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-11-1426112196-5095841-TinderTrevorNaughty-thumb.jpg,"This is a modern dating experiment. One girl. Five dating sites. Hundreds of chats. Thirty days. Thirty dates. Eighteen guys. (?) boyfriend. To start at the beginning, click here -- or jump right in below.Coming up on the halfway point of this project, I find myself surprised and, admittedly, almost a bit disappointed by the wealth of nice, normal guys I've met online. Sure, it has required a serious time commitment and thousands of messages/swipes to suss out the ones I might actually connect with -- and there have been plenty of grammatical errors and insecurity-ridden pick-up lines along the way -- but, on the whole, most of the men I've matched with have seemed to be some variation on the average Joe.Where are all the creepers, crazies, and pervs?? Where is all the hilarious fodder for my blog?? Fortunately, just as I'm about to let down that guard I've been white-knuckling since puberty, Tinder Phil* steps in to pick up the slack for misogynists everywhere.TP and I have been chatting on Tinder for a few days - a fairly bland tête-à-tête bolstered by the fact that we have several friends in common. Apparently, TP decides our convo could use a little spice:I gag with repulsion. Me: Has that line ever actually worked for you? Just out of queasy curiosity...TP: I don't know. I've never tried it before.So happy I could be your first.I immediately screenshot our convo and send it to one of our many mutual friends, subject line: YOU KNOW THIS MAN??Turns out, TP is her manager. Classy. She fwds the email to her co-manager, who sends it back TP's way, indubitably warning of forthcoming Tinder-shame.I awake the next morning to an email -- nice of him to go to all the trouble of tracking down my address:Long story short. My buddy Jason* got on my tinder account last night when I was in the other room and wrote that spanking response to a bunch of girls. So not my style. I'm so sorry. We have friends in common and I would never write some sleazy response like that. I got really pissed at Jason. So sorry. Seriously, sorry.Fine. Sure. Whatever. No big deal. Sort of hilarious. I reply in kind:Oh man - I was definitely a bit taken aback. No worries - I appreciate the message. That's kind of hilarious and slightly tragic. Hopefully your buddy's line worked on one of the chicks.I think we are done here. I am incorrect. Our mutual friend, who -- God bless her motherly soul -- loves the both of us, thinks that, despite this little misstep, TP and I might actually get along in real life. She asks TP if she should ask me if I would be interested in a set-up. TP:  No, that's ok. She sounds a little uptight for my taste. Regardless if it was a joke email from my buddy. I need nothing but fun girls in my life right now....Uptight. Fun girls.Please excuse me while I go on a syntax-driven feminist rage spiral. Because I'm uptight like that. Sidenote: The word 'naughty' seems to be seeing a resurgence amongst a certain demographic of men. Remember the  forty-year-old British NPR/BBC contributor I met via OkCupid? Judging from his photos, he wasn't really my type physically, but I'm a sucker for people who are good with their words. Unfortunately, he decided to pull one out from the bottom of the gross barrel just five texts into our first conversation:BritInLA: What time are you thinking tomorrow? Me: 4:30 or 5? BritInLA: That should work...where are you thinking? Me: Somewhere in Beverly Hills? (Yes, this is me being completely and totally selfish haha)...BritInLA: You're naughty......What? Ew. Where did that even - How does that - never mind. Just please stop. *shudder*twitch*shudder* I'm suddenly busy forever. Xo UptightInBH *not his real name"

6,TRAVEL,Around Greenland's Coldest Settlement in the Depths of Winter: Going Barmy instead of Balmy on the Looney Front - Part 2,"Mike Arkus, ContributorJournalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/around-greenlands-coldest_b_6823342.html,"Here a bright whitish aura spreads across the horizon, waves at us a little, shoots up a couple of fountain-like columns now and again. But that's about it.

It wasn't that it was 60 miles above the Arctic Circle; many of their settlements were far further north than that.  Kangerlussuaq, in black on west coast -- NASA mapBut this rugged region of crags and fjords a scant few miles from the permanent Ice Cap was apparently far too cold in winter even for them, far away from the relatively speaking much balmier coastal climes, even if they visited on hunting expeditions as the area abounds in muskoxen, caribou and gyrfalcons. Top end of Kangerlussuaq fjordIt took World War II and United States security needs to found what is now Greenland's coldest inhabited place. Way back in 1941 the U.S. Air Force decided that this little patch of permafrost was the ideal spot for an air base, and what is now Greenland's main international airport began its life as Bluie West-8, restocked by boat during the fjord's summer melt. At the end of the war it was renamed Sondrestromfjord base after the Danish Søndre Strømfjord until the U.S. air force left in 1992, bequeathing a ready-made airport for international flights and a permanent community of some 500 mainly Inuit attracted by service work. Kangerlussuaq airportIt was also rechristened Kangerlussuaq (big fjord) under Greenlandic Home Rule, which saw indigenous names replacing Danish and other geographical terms, including Kalaallit Nunaat (land of the Kalaallit) for Greenland in what is now an independent country within the Danish Kingdom.  Airport, ground view This year has been particularly cold in Greenland. In Kangerlussuaq it's not unknown for the mercury to dip to -51 Celsius, -60 Fahrenheit, and that's without the wind chill factor. Although Svalbard off northern Norway is much closer to the North Pole, only about 800 miles away, it's much warmer there thanks to the Atlantic current than it is here at double that distance, which the airport signpost records in flight time at three hours 15 minutes.  Airport signpostOn this particular day in late February the temperature has just gone up to a balmy -32 Celsius, or -27 Fahrenheit from the -36C or -32.8F, it was clocking on the airport café's digital time-weather-date piece a couple of hours ago. Settlement at top of airport Beyond the airport there's not much to Kangerlussuaq. The buildings, including inns, are all situated around the top of the runway, many in metal or wooden container-like structures painted in various glaring hues of red, yellow, blue and green.  A Kangerlussuaq street And anotherThe settlement's port is nine miles west of town at the end of Greenland's longest fully asphalted road. A couple of boats emerge, frozen in the ice, and the large fuel tanks for the airport are already stocked for the winter. The fjord, between snow-draped craggy cliffs, won't melt until about June 1, freezing over again by early December. Kangerlussuaq's frozen portThe scenery is nothing extraordinary, but pleasantly wild. Bald bushes push their barren branches up through the snow as do yellow-green stalks. In the summer the snow and ice on the lower levels will be gone and the crags will be covered in sage green and wonderful Lilliputian trees and flowers, barely a few inches high, mirroring the full spectrum of colours of their larger more southerly cousins. Kangerlussuaq's winter plantsThe heating in the red high-wheeled tourist box contraption that takes visitors around is not working properly so our breath is leaving all sorts of intricate vapour trails within. Fortunately the heat is working in the somewhat larger white box we use for a night drive out of town to escape light pollution and view the Aurora Borealis, the fabled Northern Lights.  Unheated red boxWell, at least it's a little more successful than last March's spectacular fiasco in Svalbard and Tromsø, northern Norway, where I succeeded in seeing absolutely zilch. Here a bright whitish aura spreads across the horizon, waves at us a little, shoots up a couple of fountain-like columns now and again. But that's about it. Ms. Aurora is definitely a tad shy tonight. What about all those billowing curtains of deep iridescent greens and shocking electric purples that you see sweeping the northern heavens in all those films and photos?  Another fjord overviewAt one point she seems about to turn a column green. It's going a bit sickly - but nah! She can't be bothered.Kangerlussuaq being the epicenter for Greenland wildlife -- excluding polar bears, that is, who prefer coastal regions further north and along the east coast -- we're back in the red tourist box, this time with the heat working, for a morning's royal hunt for animals in them thar hills.  Airport and town from the hillsThere are some 25,000 musk oxen in this region of Greenland alone. Actually they might be called oxen but they're of the goat family, all descended apparently from a few ancients who decided to go walkabouts across the frozen strait from what is now the Inuit province of Nunavut in Canada some 5,000 years ago. They get the musk addition from the pong males emit when rutting.From photos and stuffed specimens in museums their heads have the longish narrow structure of the bison, and they have a bone plate that parts neatly in the middle of their foreheads. Males can weigh up to almost a ton, and they particularly like it here because it's easy for them to dig through the powdery snow for shoots and other delectables in winter.  Red tourist 'box' in snowy wildernessSome 3,000 are killed annually, mostly for food but sometimes by stupid frigging arseholes who go trophy hunting. Snowy wilderness and frozen lakeWell, give us this: we do at least see a few paw prints. But of the 25,000, not a single one. On the other hand we do espy a couple of unimpressive female reindeer, cousins of the European reindeer, who because of their sex have no horns. And packs of beautiful sled dogs are howling nicely in their enclosures on the edge of town down below.

Or, nothing is like I thought it would be. A symptom of age, maybe. I missed the boat, or what did I do wrong, or in the worst of times, it's not fair. We've all been there, or soon will be, even the youngest of us getting older, the inevitable fate we all share. Maybe life's a lighter load when we're 20, because it feels like there's all the time in the world. By the time 40 rolls around, the ticking clock hurts our ears. Flickr/Jason ParksAge really is the great measure of modern culture. Young = good, old = you don't want to know. How young was Mark Zuckerberg when he founded Facebook? How old was Madonna when she fell off that stage? When can you party, when can you not, at what age should you be a VP? Age weighs, it compares, what should happen, how am I doing, even if whatever it is, is not meant to be.Age seemed different for our parents. They appeared older, sooner, settling into the middle of their story without worrying about what it looked like on Facebook. At least from the perspective of a 12-year-old, whose biggest concern at the time was the fate of Marty McFly. The earliest parental age reference I remember is when my mother said she was about to turn 42. Forty-two! Life is over.And now here we are, my friends and I on the same 40-something train. This destination we feared so much, it's not so bad, really, and nothing like the stereotype in your head. I'm still a kid on the inside, though the mirror begs to differ. Why embrace the idea that middle age is where dreams go to die? We could still have another 50 years -- or more -- on this planet. Companies have been built, novels have been written, families have been raised in less time. Think of all we can still achieve. Flickr/David MichalczukGetting older isn't bad as an absolute value, considering the alternative. I don't know the official definition of middle age, to me it's always been five years from now, though Wikipedia tells me otherwise. We try to Botox and SoulCycle and organic-free-range-whole-foods our way out of it, squinting for the fountain of youth at the bottom of a Pressed Juicery, but chasing youth only validates the false belief that old is bad. Why is age associated with potential, with worth, anyway? Maybe we should embrace a new paradigm that measures not on age, but on something else. Like time. Time invested, time working your ass off, building relationships, time sweating the small stuff, getting good, making something great. Time to stumble upon a bit of luck. Skill. And it's passion. Working hard to achieve that dream, at 26, or 62.Time, skill and passion. We can do that at any age, because we're valuable at every age. In other words, age is meaningless. Don't let anybody tell you it can't be done. Some proof:Kate Pierson is one of the singers in the B-52s. She is also 66 years old and just released her first solo album. To rave reviews. Frank McCourt published his first book, Angela's Ashes, at 66. And won the Pulitzer the following year.Michael Keaton's first Oscar nomination was this year, at 63, for Birdman.Also:Greta Pontarelli started pole dancing at 61. Lloyd Kahn learned to skateboard at 65. Yvonne Dole is still an ice skating competitor, at 89. Ruth Flowers, a DJ at 68. And the list goes on.I'm proud of all my north-of-40 friends, breaking every stereotype as they have their own epiphanies about what's next. Will, going back to school for his degree. Tony, who wrote a book about Shakespeare, while directing Shakespeare plays. Lisa, crafting a children's book, while writing a pilot on the side. Forging ahead, no matter what. Flickr/VestmanLet's get real though, there are no guarantees. Whatever you want, may not come to pass exactly as you wish. Make plans, God laughs. But is the pursuit still worth it? If pursuit means the chance of achievement is somewhere north of zero, then the answer, without question, is yes. Especially when the joy is in the doing.It might take a long time to have your own epiphany. But better to get a late start down the right road. Better to chase the right thing then spend a lifetime with your head in the sand. Find your life's calling, even if it takes a lifetime. It's the most important thing.One other thing. Age has an upside: wisdom. I have smarts I couldn't buy at 25. Even if I had a DeLorean, I still wouldn't go back. Age is nothin' but a number."

Here, an essential who's-who of the early Paris art scene.   Much like the 1970s punk rock scene belonged to New York and Los Angeles was the birthplace of 1950s film noir, no locale is more synonymous with Modernism than Paris. Aspiring and established artists alike flocked from around the world to access the creative energy, visual innovation and flourishing social network the city offered.Newly revitalized in the wake of the Belle Époque, Paris was a hotbed of culture. ""It was a new city,"" explains Deborah Ripley, Director of Contemporary Art at Auctionata. ""Pair that with the strong aesthetic tradition and artistic educational infrastructure Paris was known for, and you can understand why it attracted more innovative talent than ever before.""What may be most magical about the Parisian art world at the turn of the century, though, is that for such a thriving industry, it was infinitely unified. In fact, it's rare to come across two artists from this time and place who weren't somehow affiliated. Ripley credits the city's renowned Salon system: These public critiques, designed to uphold specific stylistic ideals, unified those within a school of thought -- and, as norms were challenged, outliers who found their style outside the accepted parameters.As the city approached its creative height and the Cubist, Impressionist, Fauvist and Expressionist movements flourished, their respective proponents banded together. These like-minded artistic communities were highly interactive, frequenting the same venues and neighborhoods, and even living within blocks of one another. Inspired by the many connections found within Auctionata's dynamic Modern Masters sale, this visual map details the names and faces of the city's most influential players."

Then came the phone call from the program director: Justin's behavior at camp was unacceptable.It had begun on the playground on the second day of camp with bullying of other children and foul language directed at a camp counsellor. The next day during arts and crafts, the 8-year-old had snatched another child's artwork out of her hands, declared it to be ""stupid,"" and had torn it into tiny pieces. On day four, Justin's group went swimming and he pushed a girl on the pool deck, causing her to slip and fall. The program director had seen enough.""We have given Justin time outs, we have talked to him numerous times about his behavior and we have done our best to manage him, but he is making camp unsafe for the other children,"" the director told Sophie. ""Enough is enough. Justin is not welcome in this program any longer.""The news was devastating to Sophie, but hardly surprising. Justin had always been a difficult child: he was highly explosive, easy to anger and very unpredictable. He frustrated easily and was overly sensitive to criticism. Other children kept their distance -- often at the instruction of their parents -- and Justin was no longer invited to birthday parties or on play dates.Sophie had tried everything she knew to help Justin with his behavioral challenges, but it wasn't working. She also knew that Justin needed more help than she alone could give, and had to figure out a way to effectively advocate for him before it was too late.Related: How to stay calm when your child isn'tIf any of this sounds familiar, it may be time to seek some outside help.Here are five steps parents can take to effectively advocate for their child with emotional or behavioral issues:1. Don't wait. Act now.Even though parents believe that they are responsible for their child's well-being, they're often unsure of what to do when serious behavioral issues arise. As a result, they wait to seek help and the child's behavior gets worse, often resulting in negative, long-term consequences. Talking to supportive family, friends, teachers or other adults can be a good first step to getting a plan in place.2. Talk to your pediatrician.Frequent emotional outbursts and volatile, disruptive behavior may be a sign that something else is going on. Make an appointment with your pediatrician and discuss whether it might be appropriate to consider having an evaluation done. Understanding the symptoms and potential medical causes can be a positive step toward helping your child.3. Learn the language.Your son or daughter may have frequent emotional and behavioral challenges, but these should not define the child. Despite the stigma often attached to mental health issues and emotional and behavioral challenges, consider what help your child needs. Speak up for your child. Learn what his or her triggers are as well as your child's strengths. Understand the treatments and medication options that might be suggested. Most importantly, help others to understand these challenges, including teachers, neighbors and your own family.Related: 9 ways to help your toddler work through anger4. Enlist allies.You aren't in this alone; others will help if you ask. Sophie did the right thing when she enlisted her friend Allison to help. Allison brought her son Matt over to Sophie's house, where the two boys could play and their moms could closely supervise the activities. There was a minor disagreement over a toy -- nothing out of the ordinary for two boys entering the third grade. The dispute was resolved with Sophie's help, and the play date went well. Sophie had stepped out of her comfort zone, asked for help and effectively advocated for her son.5. Take care of yourself!Raising a child with emotional and behavioral challenges is no picnic. It can drag you down if you let it. Join a parent support group. Contact PACER Center for resources. Turn to your friends for help, even if it's only a listening ear. Your child needs you now more than ever, and you need to be physically and emotionally healthy to be his or her most effective advocate.  Has your child experienced the type of outbursts and aggressive behavior Justin exhibits? Do you have a friend whose child is dealing with similar issues? Please share your stories and offer ideas for managing children's emotional and behavioral issues.More on Babble:To the parents of toddlers that have public meltdownsMy toddler won't stop hitting meMy daughter is getting the mean girls treatment in kindergartenI didn't truly know my own daughter until I did this"

In the morning we went to the impressive Mehrangarh Fort, constructed over centuries, from 1490 through the 1700s. The history of this enormous structure is so complex that to attempt explaining it would be a disservice.Let's just say if you're planning to visit these sites, hire a guide who can walk you through the labyrinth of history. We were blessed with Adil Ali, who shared his knowledge of these rich and colorful stories with us. What I found most interesting was the merger of the Hindu and the Muslim (Mogul) empires that helped create peace in the region. The architectural styles seen in this fort and palace therefore are a blend of both Rajisthan and Moorish themes. In later years the Brits came on the scene and added their touches to the interiors, and the Germans also helped by providing funds to restore sections of the palace that were in ruins.The museum displays were fascinating, depicting the artifacts and lifestyles of the royals. I was especially amazed by the howdahs (the coaches they rode in atop the elephants) and the palanquins (elegant carriages the noble ladies rode in carried by servants). The palace was filled with paintings depicting the royal lifestyle and battle scenes, halls full of weapons, and rooms of great splendor with mirrored ceilings and walls. They illuminated their interiors with candles and torches which when reflected off of the mirrors created the effect of glittering diamonds. The opulence was overwhelming and in sharp contrast to the surrounding city we observed. As we exited the building down steep stone streets, we were able to get another overview of the high vertical walls rising up from pure stone. This fort is a feat of engineering! (Just a side note: the woman sweeping is a close up from the first image looking down -- can you find her?)One of the most wonderful things about this entire trip has been meeting the people. Here are a few of the faces that caught my attention today.We had lunch at a fabulous place called On the Rocks -- evidently one of the few really good spots for lunch in Jodhpur. The beautiful courtyard was shaded by enormous trees and all the tables were set beautifully beneath them. The lunch was spectacular (you could even get a burger here), although we were just as happy to dine on their Indian specialties.We were honored in the afternoon to take a Jeep ""safari"" to a small village of shepherds an hour or so out of town. After a hair-raising, pot-hole ridden ride through the city streets, we eventually pulled off the ""main"" road onto a small dirt road that at times was hard to distinguish for the bushes encroaching, until we arrived at our first stop. The leader of the tour explained that they bring these villagers clothes and treats as a way of saying thank you for letting us come to visit. He advised us not to give them money, as they would then just become beggars. So we all agreed. He also told us that the village was now populated just by women, as the men have taken their sheep, camels and goats in search of more land to graze on. Their homes were in various states of disrepair and the most incongruous sight was a satellite dish on top of one of the primitive huts. Our guide explained that yes, they do have a television! I was trying to imagine the disparity between what they would see on TV compared to their own reality.The kids were so soulful and loved getting their pictures taken. They were especially entertained to see themselves on our camera displays with big grins all around. Some of the girls were wearing their school uniforms, which was heartwarming. These pictures show the lady of the house with her baby, her kitchen, and her laundry area.We continued on to meet the women and children of the Bishnoi community who have been living in this area since the 1400's. They are an off-shoot of the Hindu faith and live by 29 principals, which include living a life of peace; being strictly vegetarian; burying not cremating their dead to save wood; not castrating their male animals so they won't feel pain; and of course not consuming drugs, alcohol or tobacco. They are spread out over the region and often will build a home on their own piece of land (instead of living in villages). The men wear all white with a red turban, and the women wear red skirts, as they believe these are sacred colors.I was touched to have had a glimpse into the lives of these people, however difficult and incredulous their way of living may be to me. Some members of our group felt that the ""safari"" was not appropriate, and appeared to be taking advantage of these rural people. At the end of the day, what I'm most aware of is gratitude for all the ""mundane"" conveniences back home that I've taken for granted and for all the blessings in my life.Tomorrow we embark on our longest road trip from Jodhpur to Jaipur, so come along for another adventure!Mary Anne Erickson is an artist who has been documenting the demise of the American roadside culture for over 30 years in paintings and photography.

But according to Nate Graziano, it's not that the games are too long; it's that we've become too damned impatient.___We have a problem with pacing in our society. And if baseball -- as I've long hypothesized -- is a microcosm and a metaphor for said society then it should come as no surprise that the pace of the game has been targeted as one of the biggest issues for fans, especially the younger demographic raised on video games and constant stimulation. I would argue, however, that the games, now weighing in at roughly three hours, are not too long. The real problem is that people have become too damn impatient. I went to a game at Fenway Park last season and witnessed a relatively new phenomenon that irritated me more than watching A-Rod trying to sound contrite at the press conference. During any given pitch, when I looked around Fenway Park, about half of the crowd has their collective heads buried, staring at their phones. Now, MLB is worried that the games are too long, and the fans are tuning out. No shit. These are the same ""fans"" that shrivel if they have to wait more than 30 seconds for a Wifi connection. These are the same fans that live in perpetual fear of being, God forbid, bored. So far, in order to pick up the pace, the brain thrusts at MLB have decided to start issuing fines of $500 -- at the umpire's discretion -- to batters taking both feet out of the box between pitches where they haven't swung. Also, they are experimenting with a 20-second clock between pitches in both Triple and Double A this season. I realize the length of games have continued expand in the past 20 years, especially since more teams, like the Red Sox, have started to buy into the philosophy of Bill James and ""Money Ball,"" working counts and drawing more walks. But what seems to be lost here is that baseball is a pastoral game by design and one of the few sports that is played without a clock. It is meant to have a slow, methodic rhythm. The American poet Walt Whitman wrote of baseball, ""It will take our people out of doors, fill them with oxygen, given them larger physical stoicism. Tend to relieve us of being a nervous, dyspeptic set."" Baseball, in my opinion, is the antithesis of technology and everything associated with the breakneck pace of our society. MLB may decide to appease the anxious and impatient fan by installing pitch clocks, and who knows how the fines will work out. While it is undoubtedly shortsighted to think that there aren't some pitchers who take too much time between pitches and hitters whose rituals outside the batter's box border on absurd, baseball is still a slow game, its rhythms smooth and calming. There are things in this world where prescribing a pace borders on sacrilege. Imagine a time clock for sex -- although dudes who are quick on the draw might not mind it. But, again, with sex the pace is everything, so leave it alone. And leave baseball alone. Learn to relax. Put away your phone, and enjoy the damn game.____________By Nathan Graziano, contributor to The Good Men Project Sports.This piece originally appeared in The Good Men Project.For more Good Men Project Sports, Like them on Facebook here."

I thought this message was right on target and so clear that it got me to start working on my self-image and take my mind off what I expected from a man. Point was that by appreciating a man for what he is, while still being true to yourself, you will learn what love is, and that this process will help you get past your differences. This advice was perfect for me and led me on a journey of becoming a better version of myself with all my relationships. Like I did, you too might discover, through practicing this method, that you still have fundamental self, the true you, that you co-created from a deeper truth, even in the event of a broken relationship; and that's because you haven't invested all of your time in just trying to please your spouse or partner.  Most of us have some idea of what we want in life that keeps us striving toward that goal. Mine became clearer after a tragedy in my life. My heartfelt dream was to be a homemaker, wife, and mother again. Your senses may be flooded with a different longing than mine, perhaps a calling to a certain career or professional trade, one that deeply fulfills you. This journey will nourish the deepest part of you, making you the best version of yourself, living a life you were meant to live, and in which you will be your happiest.  To become the person you'd want to marry, you first have to decide what you want in this relationship and start from here. I knew exactly what I wanted in my life, but I didn't know how to achieve it until I read that wonderful essay that charted the plan and light my course. This wasn't always easy to stick with at times, but I believed in it. And I'm so glad that I persevered because it worked wonders for me, and I believe it'll work for your relationships, too.   Imagining who I'd want to marry if I were a man was the easy part. I would want someone who enjoyed being a homemaker and who was nurturing; someone who would ensure that our children were well taken care of and properly educated so I could focus on working to provide for the family's needs. I would want a woman who was interested in planning family meals to be shared together and keeping the house in order. She would also be a devoted daughter and sister, one who honored and served both our families. She would be joyful about sharing her faith and life experiences, and exemplifying gratitude, especially to our children. She would be my helpmate and partner and show appreciation for her starring role in our family. She would respect my income but also share with those who were in need. And she would give of herself and her talents both to our children and to others who needed her, visiting the sick and helping the needy. All of these things would help our family to grow in love, while enhancing my job success.  I know this is a lot of responsibility that usually goes unnoticed. But remember, you get to choose your own role here. And it's the job that you choose. For me, these family responsibilities are just like those of any other job that demands our attention and service. I saw those same kinds of demands in my husband's career. And our roles grew to complement each other. My husband's position requires 100 percent of his time and frequent travel; meanwhile, I'm free to continue investing time in the people in our lives. His busyness reminds me to be happy with the commitment I made a long time ago. I might still have some ups and downs, just like everyone else, but I am more deeply committed than ever through perseverance and understanding our differences. Through grace, I'm living the life I always longed for.   For many of us, day to day family life can be a constant struggle. We might forget about gratitude and instead look for another's appreciation or a change in their behavior to make us happier. Or we may begin to feel invisible or taken for granted by those closest to us. When these doubts surface, remember the life that you've dreamed of and stay true to yourself. Then you'll be comforted in seeing the difference you've made and how you've brought love and happiness to others by the choices you've made, inspired by God, who put that longing in your heart in the first place.

18,WOMEN,Starving for a Fantasy,"Samantha Levine, ContributorPrevious Spokesperson for former Mayor Bloomberg and and creat...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/starving-for-a-fantasy_b_6920540.html,"Healthy Lily James may be, but that is not the message that girls are receiving -- not from the plain, old images they see and certainly not when they hear that an already thin woman needed to avoid food to fit into a costume.",2015-03-23,Nice glass slipper on dark blue background with free space for text,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d96b413b00005d30ec946f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A surprising number of articles in usually progressive outlets insist on calling the current version of Cinderella ""modern"" or feminist. I'm willing to accept that a more assertive Cinderella is... nice. But what is distinctly not feminist is sending the message to little girls that not eating is how we fit into clothing. And that's been a woefully underreported component of the latest Cinderella story.  When the film's trailer began circulating, it triggered a lot of flurry and speculation around Cinderella/actress Lily Jame's exceedingly narrow waistline. Was the woman's (already thin) frame Photoshopped? Or was she made smaller as result of her corset, an optical trick further exaggerated by width of her skirts?  The question was settled by the actress herself during an interview with E!Online when she revealed that the corset of her dress was so tight that she couldn't eat while wearing it: When [the corset] was on we would be on continuous days so we wouldn't stop for lunch or a lovely tea like this -- you'd be sort of eating on the move. In that case, I couldn't untie the corset. So if you ate food it didn't really digest properly and I'd be burping all afternoon in [Richard Madden]'s face, and it was just really sort of unpleasant. I'd have soup so that I could still eat, but it wouldn't get stuck.Strangely, despite the admission of having to avoid solid food for this role, public fascination -- and concern -- continues to fixate on the question of digital alteration: As stated in the Daily Beast,the outrage, at least according to James, is unnecessary: 'I find that the fullness of the skirt makes the waist look smaller. And I pulled it in a corset... It's sad to think that people are looking at it in a negative way. I'm proud of that dress. I'm a healthy girl.Healthy she may be, but that is not the message that girls are receiving, not from the plain old images they see and certainly not when they hear that an already thin woman needed to avoid food to fit into a costume. If we weren't a society that was so accustomed to women needing to look a certain way this would seem absurd on its face. After all, this isn't the case of an actor losing weight for a specific role (which has its own complications) to accurately portray a true story adaptation. We are instead talking about a real woman playing a cartoon character, wearing a costume designed specifically her. But instead of the designers' tailoring the clothing so that the actual person can wear it and still eat food, the actual person has to NOT EAT in order to wear the costume.  This is, of course, made even more troubling when we consider that Cinderella is targeted toward young girls: 10-year-old girls, -- 80 percent of whom are afraid of being fat and adolescent girls, 35-57 percent of whom engage in crash dieting, fasting, self-induced vomiting, diet pills or laxatives, as the National Eating Disorder Association points out on their website.  Sadly, this is a strategy that can turn deadly. In the United States, 20 million women and 10 million men suffer from a clinically significant eating disorder at some time in their life (girls express concerns about their weight as early as age six). Anorexia is the most deadly mental health disorder, with four times the death risk as major depression.  Significantly, girls recognize the images they see are unhealthy and unrealistic, yet they still idealize and strive to meet them: Sixty-three percent of girls think the body image represented by the fashion industry is unrealistic and 47 percent think it is unhealthy, yet 60 percent say that they compare their bodies to fashion models, 48 percent wish they were as skinny as the models in fashion magazines, and 31 percent of girls admit to starving themselves or refusing to eat as a strategy to lose weight.  Cinderella took in more than 70 million dollars when it opened last weekend and is expected to gross roughly half that this weekend. That's a lot of viewers and a lot of influence. What is the takeaway here for little girls? Would the magic have been lost if Lily's corset were an inch or two looser?  Is it really asking too much to let the princess eat?"

They're reliably left on social issues and reliably right on economic issues like tax policy, unions, and corporate giveaways.",2015-03-23,"CHICAGO, IL - APRIL 22: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel attends the opening day event for Motorola Mobility headquarters at Chicago's Merchandise Mart on April 22, 2014 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for Motorola Mobility)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8eea8260000360083c232.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rahm Emanuel is in trouble. His re-election as Mayor of Chicago is no longer a lock. His challenger has come out of nowhere, parlayed unease with his right-wingish economic policies, and a big controversy, to gain real traction in the April 7 run-off. Her name is Zephyr Teachout.Wait, that's wrong. His name is Jesus Garcia. But if you're looking for explanations, it's the right mistake to make. Teachout rode the same wave, organized similar political forces in New York, and got almost 40 percent of the Democratic gubernatorial primary vote in New York, against the previously formidable Andrew Cuomo. What's up with that? Well, the parallels are eerie. Pundits point to Emanuel's tough guy personality, budget and financial issues, and coziness with corporate interests, stoked by a particular controversy about school closings. In New York, the same complaints emerged, but the controversy was about public ethics.It's a description that fits both men. Both have records that include major accomplishments. But both men made a political calculation that backfired. Emanuel and Cuomo are ""progr-actionaries."" They're reliably left on social issues and reliably right on economic issues like tax policy, unions, and corporate giveaways. It turns out that voters, especially Democrats, want no part of that calculated positioning, no part of austerity economics, Tea Party cuts in government spending, and tax policies that favor the 1%. That may be sound policy, or not. But it's a lesson that any politician needs to understand. Are you listening, Hillary?After years of unchallenged dominance, the era of supply-side economics is over, at least to voters. Progressives and voters have been shaping an economic message that promotes demand-side economics, things that increase the spending power of middle-income and poor Americans. Jobs are created, not by bankers and CEO's whose taxes are cut, but by minimum wage increases, progressive tax policies, and government spending on human and physical infrastructure.Cuomo/Emanuel missed an electoral shift, and are paying a political price, as they should in a democracy. Emanuel seems like he will struggle through with a Cuomo-esque margin, and egg on his face.It will get more interesting. The organized forces promoting progressive, demand-side economics will shortly turn to the 2016 Presidential race. Hillary's inevitability notwithstanding, those folks are rumbling that her economic policies suffer from the same defects as Cuomo/Emanuel's do. She could ignore the problem: After all, where will the left go in 2016, to Elizabeth Warren? Or Jeb Bush? Unlikely.But the lesson is there to be learned, if she's listening. Cuomo/Emanuel's electoral problems flow from a fundamental disconnect with voters over economic issues. Candidates supporting austerity, supply-side economics face electoral trouble, especially in Democratic primaries: Candidates who support the minimum wage, living wage, investment in schools, hospitals, roads and bridge, tax the 1%, an end to corporate giveaways, they prosper. I happen to think it's good economics. But I know it's good politics."
21,IMPACT,Fighting the War on Women: South Africa 2015,"Kuro Tawil, ContributorFounder of Kuros!",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fighting-the-war-on-women_3_b_6920366.html,"For our first round of Kuros! pepper spray drops in Africa, we had planned to conduct a number of the drops in the ""squatter camps"" surrounding Johannesberg, South Africa.",2015-03-23,2015-03-23-1427068931-5905471-KurosGroupBanner.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-23-1427068931-5905471-KurosGroupBanner-thumb.jpg,"For our first round of Kuros! pepper spray drops in Africa, we had planned to conduct a number of the drops in the ""squatter camps"" surrounding Johannesberg, South Africa. These ""governmentally unrecognized"" camps are where many people who flee from neighboring Botswana, Mozambique and Zimbabwe end up. The extremely high population density and absence of any government funding create an extremely hostile environment when coupled with abject poverty and the lack of any real police presence in the area. Provision of even basic aid like food and water falls onto the backs of non-governmental organizations.The people most at risk in these camps are always the women. The official statistics in South Africa indicate that a sexual assault occurs every eight minutes, yet some estimate that the number is closer to 1.5 million rapes anually. With the incidence of attacks being so high, many women living here do not leave their camps; as even walking to a major road to get a ride into town for work is too dangerous. These women do not feel safe anywhere. Not even in their own homes, as men break into their ""shanties"" and sexually assault them while they are at home alone.After leaving Texas for South Africa last Thursday, I met up with Janine Rowley & Marieli Jonsson, the women who run a non-governmental organization called Woman Against Rape, also known as W.A.R. throughout the country. W.A.R. has been working on the front lines in South Africa with rape survivors for the last decade and a half, and over the past several days we have been traveling around Gauteng, a provice in northern South Africa. For our expansion into South Africa, Kuros! purchased a pepper spray called SABRE Red. SABRE, for those who are unfamiliar is actually manufactured in the United States and is the exact same pepper spray carried by almost every police department throughout America. As I've said before, this stuff works, and we know the pepper spray we are giving to these women will be effective when they need it most.Having been around Pretoria and Johannesburg, we traveled into Mooiplaas to visit their squater camp. We sat down with a number of the women living there to listen to what they go through on a daily basis. They all expressed a similar feeling, a lack of safety at all times. As one young woman stated, ""If we walk alone we get attacked, if we are in our homes we get attacked, and with no police stations around. We do not know anything about self defense. We become victims as women... We do not know what to do."" For nearly all of them, the option of fighting back and being able to defend themselves was something they had never considered to be a possibility.So we offered the women an explanation and gave a demonstration of what pepper spray is and how it is used. After learing about it and how affective it can be when used correctly, the women said they felt extremely confident in their ability to use it to protect themselves. After they all had been shown the process and they were able to demonstrate an understanding of how to use it, Kuros! gave each of them a can of SABRE Red pepper spray.One Kuros! drop at a time. This was just one drop of many that will be taking place throughout South Africa with our newest partner W.A.R. as there are squater camps like this all over the country, all filled with women who are in desperate need of the option to defend themselves. We are proud to have W.A.R. join Kuros! in the fight to give women around the world a fighting chance in the years to come.I still have a few days here in the country, but I would like to give a special thanks to Janine and Marieli of W.A.R. for their incredible kindness and dedication to the women of South Africa. Ivan and Anthony of SABRE South Africa for the pepper spray and demonstration. Solly and Diksie from Pretoria for their translation skills and help in the camps, and my family for all of their love and support. I am extremely forunate to be surrounded by such great people. - Kuro"

If you are not familiar with the art of drumming called Taiko, it's an extraordinary drumming extravaganza and as a friend said, ""A great way to empty out aggressive energy."" Surprisingly Taiko is performed largely by females, but 'KODO' performers are mostly male. This ancient but modernized drumming requires tremendous dexterity and strength. A gift of physical power and suppleness that requires a young body to engage with some drums that are larger in size than they are. With consistent & determined skill, 'KODO'S' artists harmoniously brought forth the shine and sparkle akin to the northern lights that can only be seen under perfect conditions. Seasoned artistic director and performer, Tamasaburo Bando, who has often acted in traditional Kabuki Theater calls this production 'Mystery.' He explains that, ""In the folk arts that have been handed down across Japan, there's a sacredness, an air of mystery within prayers. The drums express this, and I'd like for the audience to feel it. I hope theater-goers will experience the same sort of other worldly splendor that you sense in a temple or a shrine, or when you discover things in nearby woods."" Truly Mr. Bando with 'KODO' producer Nobuyuki Nishimura achieved this with their amazing ensemble of 15 performers, who transformed from dragons to musician's, from athletes to actors.

Suzy spends every ounce of extra bandwidth that she has to ""bring awareness to the connection between the environment and livestock production. The goal: to help make the world a better and healthier place for future generations."" If you combine all transportation in the world, it accounts for 13% of greenhouse gases. If you combine all livestock production in the world, it accounts for 14.5% of greenhouse gases.

It has been scientifically proven that consumption of animal products increases the probability of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity and autoimmune disease substantially. Suzy doesn't want our children to live with that. Do you? How do we solve this problem and the many others the Forum has on its timely agenda?I invited several participants in the Forum - Sir Ken Robinson, Stephan Turnipseed, Susan McCalmont, Deborah Wince-Smith, and Jamie Gallagher - to weigh in on important issues about which Creative Oklahoma believes #YourIdeasMatter. ""When the teacher and the student engage in performance based assessment - things they make, do or show; cognitive debate using open ended questions; or project based learning embedded in the community with research and presentations of findings, it is possible for the student to demonstrate true mastery of a content area."" -- Stephan TurnipseedHalf of all teachers resign after five years. How do we improve teacher retention?Stephan Turnipseed (@Lego_Education): Teacher retention, like employee retention, is based on setting clear goals, providing a positive environment of success within which to work, and offering leadership support and professional development to achieve results. The average teacher in the first five years sees little to none of this. They see burdensome bureaucracy, high stakes testing and single point accountability coupled with a system that does little to create positive culture. There are exceptions of course, however, these are increasingly fewer in number. To reverse this trend, we must focus on liberating the classroom from the tyranny of policy and process that inhibit rather then promote a positive learning environment.Sir Ken Robinson (@SirKenRobinson): In the US, the main way is to improve the status and conditions of teaching as a profession. Apart from essential issues of compensation, there are three related steps, which most high performing systems already understand and practice. The first is to set a high bar for entry into the profession. Entrant teachers should not only have appropriate qualifications in the materials and disciplines they are to teach, they should have demonstrable abilities in and an appetite for teaching itself. Second, there should be regular programs of staff development and support. And third, given their expertise, teachers should then be left to get on with the job, within a general, not stifling, framework of professional accountability.Susan McCalmont (@SusanMcCalmont): The solution to teacher retention begins with a reconsideration of what it means to be a teacher in the 21st century classroom and a redefinition of the role. The 21st century classroom teacher should possess both knowledge and passion for a particular discipline while imparting that knowledge and infectious passion along to the student in a non-threatening, respect-filled environment. The teacher should serve as a mentor and guide the student in her learning while encouraging critical thinking and creative work. The 21st century teacher should be a champion of student self-discovery encouraging utilization of technology to expand knowledge and global connectivity.The reality is that few teachers in 21st century classrooms have the luxury to teach in this manner due to the administrative demands, bureaucratic paperwork, superfluous testing, and disciplinary issues.Empower and release the teachers to teach to their passions, engage in a collaborative learning environment with students, and remove the barriers inhibiting discovery. Teacher retention issues will be widely resolved. ""The best way to cultivate responsibility for energy sustainability and conservation is to make it pay! Since the cost to generate electricity varies minute-by-minute, new technologies deployed on a smart grid can provide energy price signals to individual consumers based on supply and demand, helping consumers consider prices, make informed decisions, better manage their electricity use and the size of their electricity bill."" -- Deborah Wince-SmithThere has been a lot of controversy over high-stakes standardized testing. Aside from standardized tests, what are some ways to get an idea of what students are able to do?Stephan Turnipseed (@LEGO_Education): In many places of the world assessment (testing) is defined as ""of"" learning, ""as"" learning and ""for"" learning. Using formative (as and for) assessment drives student success through teacher led and student led assessment. When the teacher and the student engage in performance based assessment - things they make, do or show; cognitive debate using open ended questions; or project based learning embedded in the community with research and presentations of findings, it is possible for the student to demonstrate true mastery of a content area. This mastery is often missed when summative (end of course) multiple choice testing, based primarily on memorization, is the only data point. Sir Ken Robinson (@SirKenRobinson): Assessment is an important part of organized education. Effective forms of assessment can offer valuable diagnostic information on students' progress and abilities, and useful summaries of their attainments at the end of a program of work. Some forms of standardized, multiple choice tests can be helpful in both areas. But much of what matters in education cannot be assessed in those ways, and some of it, not at all. Overall, students, teachers and others can benefit more from more descriptive forms of assessment, including portfolios and peer assessment.With the growth of home schooling and online college degrees, does the traditional school and college model need to change to meet the needs of students who want to take charge of their own learning? Stephan Turnipseed (@LEGO_Education): Milton Chen describes the ""Any Child"" as learning any time, any place, any path and any pace. This radically connected learner will demand that schools either change or become irrelevant. In fact, without the current truancy laws, many students would depart traditional education sooner rather than later. Smart devices and Google define the landscape of their everyday world. Yet in stark contrast, their schools focus on rote drill and kill memorization. The children can see the fallacy of such a model of education that, while efficient, will not prepare them for the life they face. There are about 2.2 billion children in the world, and 1 billion of them live in poverty. How can we allocate the world's abundant resources to provide for children in need?Deborah Wince-Smith (@DWinceSmith): In the long run, it's not about the allocation of resources. The only sustainable long-term solution to global poverty is economic development and growth. Energy is the lifeblood of an economy, and billions of people are stranded in energy poverty. No country has been able to reduce poverty and raise standards of living without energy. If you depend on wood and animal waste for energy, there will be no economic development.Answering this challenge presents a tremendous opportunity for energy innovation and energy markets. Distributed energy such as biomass has potential, and simple technologies such as solar water heaters could make a huge difference in securing energy for the poor. The potential is large for small wind turbines to harness the power of wind, water-pumping windmills for irrigation, and hydrokinetic energy devices can be deployed in any water resource.  ""Rather than the traditional 'you find us' job-fair model, we will implement a 'we find you' outreach model [for connecting veterans to potential employers]. Companies will receive benefit by virtue of a PSA campaign which will identify them as participants in this program from the onset and be featured in the success stories as they unfold."" -- Jamie GallagherHow do we cultivate individual social responsibility for wise energy use at home and at work? Deborah Wince-Smith (@DWinceSmith): The best way to cultivate responsibility for energy sustainability and conservation is to make it pay! Since the cost to generate electricity varies minute-by-minute, new technologies deployed on a smart grid can provide energy price signals to individual consumers based on supply and demand, helping consumers consider prices, make informed decisions, better manage their electricity use and the size of their electricity bill.In addition, some clean renewable energy technologies are becoming more cost competitive, for example, residential solar energy. And with net metering, consumers with solar energy systems earn credit for the surplus electricity they provide to the electric grid. This reduces electric bills considerably, helping make home solar affordable.By 2025, two-thirds of the world will live in water-stressed conditions. How do we prepare for this change?Deborah Wince-Smith (@DWinceSmith): The need for clean water is a tremendous opportunity for innovation and new markets, especially in the rapidly developing world. Researchers and companies are tackling the clean water challenge with different approaches at different scales - from personal point of use purification systems such as the LifeStraw to revolutionary technologies applied to large-scale industrial desalination. Nanotechnology promises to revolutionize water purification and treatment through nanotube membranes for water desalination, and nanomaterials to eliminate germs from water. For example, Tata has created a home water purifier that uses rice husk ash impregnated with nano-silver to filter out bacteria and viruses. It requires no power or running water to operate, costs about $20, stores 5 gallons, and filters that can clean about 800 gallons of water cost about $6.50. In another interesting approach, in some developing countries, people are harvesting clean water from fog! A fog harvesting system that produces 500 gallons of water a day costs about $15,000 and lasts 10 years. In the right locations, these systems could meet basic water needs for drinking, cooking, bathing, and sanitation for about 10¢ a day per person. New water-attracting and hydrophobic (water-repelling) films created with nanotechnology could increase the effectiveness of water harvesting from air. There were 437 homeless veterans in Oklahoma in 2013. How could we better connect veterans in need to potential employers?Jamie Gallagher (@FaberCastell): Fortunately in this case, the ratio of vets to companies is manageable. That ratio is important because personal engagement, which communicates individual value and worth, is critical in making this work. Rather than the traditional ""you find us"" job-fair model, we will implement a ""we find you"" outreach model. Companies will receive benefit by virtue of a PSA campaign, which will identify them as participants in this program from the onset and be featured in the success stories as they unfold. We start with 50 companies each reaching out to 10 vets. We will engage a university to create the program ""tool kit"" which companies can use as a foundation for their outreach.For more ideas that matter. Top Row: C. M.

Ferrell was a member of Delta Tau Delta during his undergraduate days the University of Southern California. The actor and comedian was answering questions from NYT readers at South by Southwest. Ferrell had been asked if he would comment on his own fraternity experience and ""why (or why not) fraternity membership is still a worthy consideration for a college student.""""The incident in Oklahoma, that is a real argument for getting rid of the system altogether, in my opinion, even having been through a fraternity,"" Ferrell said. ""Because when you break it down, it really is about creating cliques and clubs and being exclusionary. Fraternities were started as academic societies that were supposed to have a philanthropic arm to them. And when it’s governed by those kind of rules, then they’re still beneficial.""The Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at Oklahoma was disbanded after members were caught on tape singing, ""There will never be a n****r SAE."" Students at SAE chapters -- other than in Oklahoma -- have since come forward saying they too heard the song at their campus.""I was lucky in that the one I was in, we were really kind of the anti-fraternity fraternity,"" Ferrell continued. ""We were considered good enough to get the exchanges with the good sororities. We couldn’t get anyone to vote on anything, but if you needed 40 guys to show up and build a 20-foot-tall paper-maché version of the Matterhorn, we were there and ready. But we didn’t take it too seriously. It was just about having fun. But I think it’s an interesting dilemma for universities these days."""

""We don't sell any recreational marijuana. We don't sell any medical marijuana. This is a place for cardholders to come and share their own cannabis,"" she said.The residence is home to multiple medical marijuana cardholders, as well as the club, she said.""I saw them uproot a couple of marijuana plants. They took some bongs and pipes and phones and computers, and that's pretty much it,"" Greene said on scene as bags of items were carried out by police.Greene said she reopened the club on Saturday.""By opening back up bright and early, less than 24 hours after the local police department's failed scare tactic, we, at the Alaska Cannabis Club, have made it clear that the will of the people is stronger than any force they have — and we aren't going anywhere,"" she said in an email to The Associated Press.Greene said she was ""incensed"" the police executed a search warrant on her instead of focusing on a stabbing and shootings that happened nearby just a few hours before.Alaska voters last year approved a ballot measure legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. But it's still illegal to sell the drug.Guidelines for the regulation of the marijuana trade are under consideration by the Legislature.Anchorage Police Department spokeswoman Jennifer Castro said it's ""very important that people don't try to jump the gun until the state sets our other rules and protocols for the sale and commercialization of marijuana.""No arrests have been made or charges filed in connection with the raid.

At the same time, it is impossible to build a strong, skilled youth workforce without developing and expanding access to quality education and training opportunities. When governments' formal education systems do not compel children to stay in school, it falls to civil society to fill in the gaps with alternative education programs. From Chittagong to Jakarta, Bangalore, and Mumbai, we highlight four exemplary initiatives that tailor learning to the real needs of young people.In Chittagong, youth drop out of school when the opportunity cost is high, particularly when the benefits from employment are higher than the perceived benefits from education. Caritas Chittagong and the social company Taratari have partnered to build vocational training centers that diminish that opportunity cost. More than 4,000 school dropouts obtain a technical education at the Regional Training Centers each year. These centers provide auto-mechanic, electrical, welding, and tailoring courses for six to twelve months, during which students stay in hostels to reduce accommodation expenses. The hands-on education boosts students' chances of finding employment when they complete their training. Taratari produces fiberglass boats with traditional Bengali designs. Young men from the fishing community who dropped out of formal school have the opportunity to learn how fiberglass boats are produced and to find employment at Taratari or in other shipyards.In Jakarta formal education is provided for free, but additional fees add up and mean that poorer parents may prefer their children to help them at home and contribute to the family income rather than go to school. Near the slum houses around the Ciliwung river, pastor and activist Father Sandyawan established the Ciliwung Merdeka Center to teach young people to be independent and tolerant toward different ethnicities, religions, and races. Academic programs offer lessons in drawing, math, literature, English, voice, music, storytelling, and theater arts. The young people learn skills such as sewing, making recycled paper, stencil printing and others that may help them to earn a living. The Ciliwung Center does not intend to replace basic education with informal education but to increase opportunities for the younger generation by providing them with tangible technical skills according to their interests, mitigating the opportunity costs of education.In Bangalore, an organization called Unnati has been working to harness the potential of the city's underprivileged youth for more than a decade. Many Unnati trainees dropped out of the traditional school system at a young age and have few mentors in their networks to guide them in mapping out an appropriate alternative plan, so Unnati's 70-day program works to fill that gap. The center aims to provide a quality curriculum on par with the country's elite academic institutions. The last week of Unnati's training program is dedicated to setting graduates up with work placements, including in positions as administrative assistants, retail sales and marketing representatives, guest care workers, bedside assistants, and beauticians. Unnati is exceptional in that all of its programs are free. Youth are provided with shelter, food, and training without charge, allowing the poorest of the poor to take advantage of this unusual opportunity.Girls raised in Mumbai's brothels deal not only with challenging living conditions but also with physical, mental, and sexual violence. Several NGOs provide education and skills training to the children to try to break the cycle of prostitution, but few have their sights set beyond traditional work. An organization named Kranti aims to change that norm, and runs a program involving mental health services, skill-enhancement trips around India and abroad, a safe, supportive home, and an emphasis on education. In fact, Kranti's belief system challenges the country's current education system, reinforcing the need for a curriculum that includes social justice and the view that the purpose of schooling ""should be to develop leaders and empowered communities rather than supervisors and corporate employees."" Kranti believes that it is exactly their experiences of marginalization that will make the girls into compassionate, thoughtful leaders -- or ""revolutionaries,"" as they are called at the home Kranti runs. In face of significant opportunity costs pulling youth away from formal education, these initiatives seek to maximize the benefits of learning through tailored curriculums that are underscored by a belief in the individual young person's potential for success.

Building self esteem comes from more sources than that.",2015-03-23,Young girl in kitchen doing homework with mother in background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ea227250000320036f118.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My son, who recently turned 12, transitioned into public middle school this year, and it's been nothing short of challenging in more ways than I ever would have anticipated.We've had to change his classes, deal with the departure of a new teacher, bring in a learning specialist, create strategies for tracking homework, books, long-term projects, tests to be signed, etc., etc. Anyone whose child is in the Common Core curriculum knows just how hard it is... on everyone. Homework is given even on weekends and over holiday periods. Some days, it feels like my son is a manic homework-doing machine, with my husband and I doing our best to assist, if needed, and at the very least, ensure it all gets done. Some weekends, we haven't even left the house because it was all quite overwhelming.As it was explained to me at a school meeting featuring the local education powers that be, the Common Core was created to make American kids more competitive with the rest of the world.I ask the question... how does this figure in if a child has special needs? And, what about factoring in self-esteem?What is the impact on a child when it all feels like such a struggle?How many tutors or learning specialists should parents have to hire, and what if your budget doesn't permit?We live in a good school district -- one of the very reasons we made a home here -- but even then, it's felt like a full-time job to oversee my sons academics and share with the teachers what he needs and what we experience at home.All this said, I've strongly encouraged my son, despite the workload, to participate in select after school activities. He chose LEGO Robotics and Stage Crew. I am so proud of him for what he's achieved with both. His Robotics team made the Long Island Championship... the furthest their school team has ever gone. It was such a feeling of accomplishment for all involved, and instilled a wonderful sense of teamwork.The school's production of 42nd Street was performed this past weekend, and it required many hours of Seth's participation, on some days, creating a pressure situation to get his homework and studies done, but he persevered. He was assigned the role of curtain puller -- an important task -- and one that required a lot of focus, which is one of his greatest challenges. He did it! They presented four performances, and he pulled on cue.I'm a huge theatre lover, and have helped to instill this in my son. I treasure that this is a passion we both can share and enjoy shows together. I was involved on both a high school and college level with theatre, and to this day, I have strong, positive memories of it. In high school, I did props for Arsenic and Old Lace and acted as one of the Angels in Anything Goes. In college, Hofstra University, I was a French minor, and one of my classes was French Drama, where I had to act in French, and I loved the challenge and experience.While I certainly want my son to have a positive academic experience, there is more to school, life and ultimate success than grades. Building self-esteem comes from more sources than that. As parents, we need to do all that we can to instill a belief system in our kids that inspires them to achieve and not just in terms of meeting standards and requirements. Some of the most successful and happy people march proudly to their own creative drum and introduce breakthrough innovations that enhance all our lives. All the world's a stage, as the expression goes, and the better my son feels about himself, the more motivated he will be to pave his own way in the world, leaving the Common Core in the wings."
