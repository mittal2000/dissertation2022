0,THE WORLDPOST,Worldwide Executions Surge To Highest Levels In 25 Years: Report,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/global-death-penalty-2015_us_57040f0fe4b0daf53af13542,The U.S. ranks fifth worldwide for annual executions.,2016-04-06,A growing number of countries are abolishing the death penalty.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570436df2e00002d0095083c.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Worldwide use of the death penalty rose sharply last year, with 2015 tallying the highest number of executions in 25 years, according to a report released Tuesday by Amnesty International. At least 1,634 people were executed last year, according to available data as well as executions corroborated by the international human rights group.Despite the high rate of global executions last year, the number of countries that have the death penalty is growing smaller by the year. Fiji, Madagascar, the Republic of Congo and Suriname all abolished the death penalty in 2015, while Mongolia's abolition takes effect on July 1. At least 60 other countries that still have the death penalty but have not used it in a decade are what the United Nations considers ""de facto abolitionists.""The seemingly opposite trends -- a 25-year record high of executions, and an ever-shrinking number of countries that perform them -- hinge on just a few countries that carry out executions at a disproportionately high rate, according to Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.""Globally, you’re seeing generally reduced use of the death penalty except countries like the four major outliers — China, Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia,"" Dunham said.Just three countries -- Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia -- are responsible for nearly 90 percent of all executions that Amnesty International recorded last year.Iran led with at least 977 confirmed executions, mostly by hanging (though Amnesty International believes there were more) -- 58 of which were held in public. Pakistan's 326 executions was the highest figure Amnesty International said it has ever recorded for the country; it notes the surge comes in the year following a lifting of a six-year-old moratorium on executions. Saudi Arabia, where executions were up 76 percent from last year, had at least 158 confirmed executions, mostly by beheading. The country that ranks fifth for the most executions worldwide (including China as the presumed leader): the United States.The U.S. had 28 executions last year, the lowest number since the early 1990s.Amnesty International notes that for the first time since the death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s, more than half of states have abandoned the death penalty in either ""policy or practice"": 18 U.S. states have abolished or repealed the death penalty, while nine more have not had executions in at least a decade. Dunham said trends with the U.S. penalty system are in some ways a microcosm of what's happening worldwide. “Just as most of the United States is moving away from the death penalty and most of the world is moving away from the death penalty, there are concentrated pockets of where we see outlier practices.""Domestically, three states — Texas, Missouri and Georgia — carried out 86 percent of all the executions in 2015. Add Florida, and the four states accounted for 93 percent of all U.S. executions last year. Rick Halperin, a human rights and death penalty expert from Southern Methodist University, noted that high rates of execution are partly explained by unfair trials and the low threshold in countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia: People there are executed for supposed crimes like drug trafficking, adultery, blasphemy and homosexuality. And while Americans may balk at such actions being punished by death, Halperin notes the U.S. has been sluggish on bringing its capital punishment system in alignment with international law. It wasn't until 2002 that the U.S. stopped allowing the execution of people with intellectual disabilities, and it wasn't until 2005 that the execution of juveniles (or those who committed a crime as a juvenile) was ruled unconstitutional. Up until 2008, some states were considering crimes other than murder a capital offense.""No matter how 'good' a country’s human rights record is, if it’s killing people in the name of the law, it can’t have a good human rights record,” Halperin said. Amnesty International notes that a significant number of executions -- including those in the U.S. -- run afoul of international law. ""Amnesty criticizes the U.S. for its violation of human rights treaties. Despite the constitutional prohibition against executing people with intellectual disabilities and people who have become mentally incompetent, the U.S. still carries out executions of individuals that fall within those categories,” Dunham said, citing the 2015 execution of Virginia murderer Alfredo Prieto, whom Dunham notes was also a foreign national. Both Halperin and Dunham said countries that break international treaties with regard to the death penalty and human rights -- including the treatment of condemned inmates -- do so with impunity. Bodies like the U.N. have no mechanism to sanction countries committing the violations and can do little more than publicly chastise them.The international community's ability to pressure countries is significantly undermined by the U.S.'s own track record, Dunham notes. ""When you look at whose company we’re keeping, it is a group of countries who are not known for their adherence to and promotion of human rights,"" he said. Dunham noted that in Belarus, the only European nation to still have the death penalty, capital punishment advocates have cited the U.S.'s ongoing system as justification of their own. Halperin, who opposes the death penalty, said U.S. abolition would have ""profound ramifications for the rest of the world.""""Smaller countries that talk about reintroducing it, like Guatemala or the Philippines, can still use the argument that we have it,"" he said. ""In a pure human rights context, it would finally put the U.S. on a higher moral plane. While we have other human rights problems, we wouldn't have this central problem of the death penalty."""

A second vote will be needed to finalize it.Two months ago, the council voted unanimously to create a task force to study the licensing of marijuana clubs and ending the ban on public consumption of pot.A law that took effect in February 2015 allows adults to possess small amounts of marijuana and grow and consume it at home.

It remains illegal under federal law.Kate Bell, a legislative analyst for the Marijuana Policy Project, an advocacy group, said the task force should have been allowed to do its job.""We are very disappointed that the council voted to permanently impose this unnecessary ban on the freedoms that the vast majority of the voters support,"" she said in a statement.(Reporting by Ian Simpson; editing by Grant McCool)"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5703f1342e000064009507c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Scientists are just beginning to understand the effects and potential long-term damage of head trauma on the brain, but of all the things we don't know about head injuries, we know this for certain: Chocolate milk doesn't help improve cognitive functions in people who've had concussions.One group of university researchers, however, tried to stake that claim. In December 2015, researchers at the University of Maryland publicized a study claiming that Fifth Quarter Fresh, a new brand of chocolate milk that comes from ""super, natural"" cows (quite a disingenuous comma placement), helped improve concussed and non-concussed high school football players' cognitive and motor scores in multiple test measures. Less than a month later, the Health News Review, a health watchdog group, debunked the study, noting that the university publicized it before subjecting it to crucial stages of peer review and publishing. Last Friday, the university disavowed the study, saying that it represented a ""concerning lack of understanding of the basic principles of conflict of interest in research at all levels of the process.""Ah, so about that conflict of interest. Critically, how did real university researchers and professors -- people supposedly sworn to high standards of academic scrutiny -- manage to cook up such an irresponsible piece of non-science? Money.Fifth Quarter Fresh, along with a co-op of milk producers, paid the university $228,910 through Maryland Industrial Partnerships, a collaborative program between the school and commercial entities in Maryland that exists to promote job growth between the two. Naturally, the partnership produced a salient form of misleading native advertising for commercial interests, this time involving chocolate milk. (Maryland Industrial Partnerships hasn't been implicated in any other case of wrongdoing.) The University of Maryland, through the power of dollars lacking sense, reduced their researchers to a snake oil brand spokesman on concussion-alleviating products, much like Russell Wilson and Recovery Water. Let's give chocolate milk some credit though. Nutritionists agree that flavored milk, because of the balance of sugar (carbohydrates) and protein, is beneficial for muscle recovery and rebuilding. It's a good choice to slurp down after a workout. But when it comes to concussions -- a medical problem for football players and athletes around the world -- chocolate milk, and Fifth Quarter Fresh in particular, is anything but a good choice -- it's an irresponsible one.

""An honest evaluation of marijuana legalization would include the undeniable benefits of legalization, like the massive drop in marijuana arrests, the billions in taxes, and the transition from an underground market to a regulated one."" Sens.

Often that makes people think of the low wages it pays most of its workers (and the subsequent low prices), but cutting costs is not just about labor. For Walmart, it's also a reason to go green.Walmart last week joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s CE100 platform, a group of companies committed to reducing waste in their production process. The foundation's aim is to create a ""circular economy,"" where all energy is renewed and products are created in such a way that every part is reusable somehow.Walmart has already started to make its internal procedures more circular. For example, it has a system for the big refrigerators it uses in its stores. If one breaks and can't be used, the whole machine doesn't get thrown away. Walmart has a team that inspects the equipment for any parts that are salvageable. Those parts get sent to a central warehouse and catalogued. Then, when another refrigerator part breaks in a different store somewhere else in the country, recycled parts from the warehouse can be used to fix it. The company ends up replacing far fewer refrigerators than it would if it didn't salvage parts.“Waste represents inefficiency,” according to Fred Bedore, a senior director on Walmart’s sustainability team. “We want to root out the inefficiencies. We want to be operating [Walmart] at the lowest possible cost.”For Walmart, that means committing to eliminate waste in the company’s energy use, operations and the products it sources. While Walmart might not be the first company that comes to mind when you think of sustainability, it’s actually a strategy that fits rather naturally with its business model.That means both finding ways to make its own business more circular -- things like the refrigerator repair system, and incorporating more renewable energy into its business -- and working with suppliers and vendors to make their businesses more circular as well. ""We want to make sure that we are using resources effectively, and not creating more waste than is necessary,"" Bedore told the Huffington Post. And, of course, less waste means even lower prices. "

In the candid cover story, the 29-year-old actress talks about the women that follow ""GoT,"" explains her character's disturbing rape scene and discusses all the male nudity she wants to see. “I love that so many women watch the show,"" Clarke said of the 40 percent female viewership following the HBO series. ""If you look at 'Game of Thrones' on face value -- blood, tits, dragons, swearwords -- you’re like, ‘Oh, this must be for guys.’ But if you take that away, the story lines are fascinating depictions of the struggle for power.

And, as Clarke told Glamour, if she was allowed to end ""Game of Thrones,"" Khaleesi and her dragons would rule the world -- and give the viewers a little more male nudity while they're at it. ""I want to see Daenerys and her three dragons share the throne,"" the actress said. ""Eat goat they’ve barbecued. And bring back all the pretty boys, get them to take their trousers down, and be like, ‘I’m now the queen of everything! I’d like close-ups of all the boys’ penises, please.'""

Although his personality was aggressively harmless, there was certainly something deranged about actor Tony Hale's portrayal of the youngest Bluth brother on the show. It was almost as if the character existed in the uncanny valley, where only some great evil could have turned him into such an eccentric, humanoid figure: in other words, the New York City subway system and its riders.After Hale appeared on a HuffPost Facebook Live segment, we caught the actor in the hallway (hale-way?) to talk about ""Arrested Development."" In this conversation, Hale revealed the basis for Buster Bluth ... a typical, neurotic New York City subway rider.""He’s just anxiety-ridden,"" said Hale of his character, explaining that the character was modeled after subway riders who have to deal with ""the awkwardness of having people on a subway and just the anxiety."" Buster Bluth is simply a man who has been aggressively beaten down by the MTA.As Hale said in a previous Reddit AMA, he lived in New York City for eight years and observed various subway characters he apparently would later draw inspiration from. ""New York was so tense,"" Hale told HuffPost, ""That I could just watch people and how they dealt with the anxiety, and [Buster] was just a combination [of these personalities].""Hale also said that the character was a ""9-year-old trapped in a 32-year-old’s body,"" which also doesn't sound too dissimilar from the cliché trust fund New Yorker. Now, if you're ever riding the subway, you can worry about turning into the real-life incarnation of Buster Bluth."

The announcements came hours after another tech giant, PayPal, said it would cancel plans to expand in North Carolina -- a move that was expected to bring about 400 jobs to the state -- as a result of the Tar Heel State's anti-LGBT law. IBM said in a tweet it is ""disappointed"" that Mississippi Gov.

It's a familiar cast of characters. All three companies publicly opposed similar legislation in other states, with nearly identical explanations for their stances.If the saga in Mississippi plays out as it has in other states, this is likely only the beginning. Last week, the LGBT advocacy nonprofit Human Rights Campaign published a letter, signed by more than 90 business leaders, condemning North Carolina's law. Chief among the signatories was Bank of America, the state's biggest company by revenue and fourth-largest employer.Japanese automaker Nissan, the biggest employer in Mississippi, told The Huffington Post it prohibits discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and opposes legislation that would allow discrimination against them.

Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) in a third-party bid, instead backing her primary challenger. But he is still promising to back an independent candidate if Ayotte makes it to the general election, which could take votes away from her and help Democrats. In November, Day, who chairs the Republican Liberty Caucus in New Hampshire, had vowed to jump in against Ayotte if the state legislature voted to expand Medicaid.Day was upset that Ayotte had weighed in on a 2014 debate over who should be the GOP speaker of the state House of Representatives and had opposed a candidate favored by many conservative activists. Ayotte's preferred choice also lost, leading to a third candidate who won with the help of Democratic votes.""Republicans were set to return a conservative, who opposed Medicaid expansion, to the Speaker's chair until Ayotte interfered,"" Day told Breitbart last year. ""She and the GOP establishment think Medicaid expansion will help them politically. They should understand that such an action will doom them politically.""This Tuesday, Gov. Maggie Hassan (D) signed Medicaid expansion into law. It will allow nearly 50,000 New Hampshire residents to keep their health care coverage, made possible by Obamacare, for another two years. Hassan is running against Ayotte for the Senate. Ayotte has repeatedly voted to repeal Obamacare, but largely stayed out of the Medicaid expansion fight in her state. She said she didn't want government to ""pull the rug out"" from under low-income people who have received insurance.Day told The Huffington Post that rather than jumping into the race himself, he is supporting Jim Rubens, a former state senator whose campaign has become an outlet for conservative frustrations against Ayotte. ""Republicans have got to come to grips with the fact that, if Kelly Ayotte is the nominee, base and anti-establishment voters will boycott or vote for an independent. I’m running to bring our party back together and save this Senate seat for Republicans,"" Rubens said when announcing his candidacy on March 7. Day added that even if Rubens loses, he still won't back Ayotte. ""If he doesn't win, I will support Andrew Hemingway as an independent in the general election. I have a whole slate of independents for whom we have collected the necessary signatures to get on the ballot,"" he told HuffPost.Hemingway, a former New Hampshire gubernatorial candidate, has not yet officially entered the Senate race. Jon Kohan, Ayotte's campaign manager, recently told the New Hampshire Union Leader that the senator is happy to face off against anyone. ""Kelly's deep grassroots support is backed by a town-by-town network of activists across the state,"" Kohan said. ""She has a strong conservative record of delivering results for New Hampshire and she will continue to carry that message to every corner of the state in the months to come.""The New Hampshire primary is on Sept. 13. Ayotte is considered one of the most vulnerable Republican senators up for re-election this year, and if she survives her primary, polls show her in a tight race against Hassan. Ayotte's chances could be further hurt if conservative voters back a third-party candidate instead of turning out for her. “Frustration with Kelly Ayotte’s record of putting special interests ahead of the people of New Hampshire clearly runs deep and across the ideological spectrum in the Granite State,"" said Melissa Miller, spokeswoman for the New Hampshire Democratic Party. ""Not only does she have to contend with a primary opponent, but she also has a potential conservative third-party challenger creating turbulence for her uphill reelection bid.""This piece has been updated with comment from Miller.

14,POLITICS,Feds Push Back Against Blanket Bans That Keep Ex-Offenders From Finding Housing,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hud-housing-guidance-criminals_us_5702e54ae4b0a06d5806ad52,The ability to find housing is critical for successful re-entry into society.,2016-04-05,"Julian Castro, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, released new guidance Monday that warns landlords and property owners against broadly disqualifying housing applicants with criminal records. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5702fe8e150000ad000b402e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Landlords and property owners who exclude people with criminal records from renting or buying may be violating the law, according to new guidance released by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.While people with criminal records are not a protected class, the guidance released Monday from HUD's general counsel Helen R. Kanovsky notes, landlords and home owners who deny housing to an ex-offender solely based on their criminal record could be viewed as discriminatory -- even if they don't intend to discriminate -- because of systemic disparities in the United States criminal justice system that disproportionately affect African Americans and Hispanics.""While the Act does not prohibit housing providers from appropriately considering criminal history information when making housing decisions, arbitrary and overbroad criminal history-related bans are likely to lack a legally sufficient justification,"" the guidance reads. ""Thus, a discriminatory effect resulting from a policy or practice that denies housing to anyone with a prior arrest or any kind of criminal conviction cannot be justified, and therefore such a practice would violate the Fair Housing Act.""The guidance says that landlords and property owners must distinguish between arrests and convictions, and not ban an applicant solely based on an arrest, given that an arrest doesn't indicate an individual was necessarily guilty of any crime. When an applicant does have a record of conviction, property owners must take into account the ""nature and severity"" of the crime before excluding an applicant. The only exception is individuals convicted of manufacturing or distributing drugs, whom landlords can continue to exclude broadly, the guidance notes.People who have been incarcerated, or have a record of conviction, can face significant obstacles in finding a job and a home. And research has shown that stable housing is one of the keys to reducing recidivism. But HUD Secretary Julian Castro says individuals with criminal records are routinely blocked from housing.""Right now, many landlords use the fact of a conviction — any conviction, regardless of what it was for or how long ago it happened — to indefinitely bar folks from housing opportunities,"" Castro said in a statement Monday. ""When someone has been convicted of a crime and has paid their debt to society, then they ought to have an effective second chance in life. The ability to find housing is an indispensable part of that second chance.""The U.S. is home to nearly 25 percent of the world’s prisoners, despite having less than 5 percent of of the global population, and about a third of American adults have some sort of criminal record. Moreover, because blacks and Latinos are arrested, convicted and incarcerated at disproportionate rates in relation to their percentage of the general population, barring housing based on criminal records is ""likely to have a disproportionate impact"" on minorities seeking housing, the guidance says.The guidance follows the ""disparate impact"" legal principle established by the U.S. Supreme Court last year when it ruled that housing policies and practices with discriminatory outcomes can be challenged under the Fair Housing Act, even if there was no intent to discriminate. Though the FHA protects against many forms of discrimination, disparate impact is seen by fair housing advocates as a particularly vital tool for fighting racial inequality, as it permits lawsuits to be brought against policies that disproportionately affect people of color, even when no overt racial motive can be proven.Advocates for fairer housing policies applauded Castro for the move. ""[H]aving even a minor criminal record can present lifelong barriers to the basic building blocks of economic security and mobility — including housing, as four in five landlords use criminal background checks on potential tenants,"" Carmel Martin, executive vice president for the policy at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement. ""By ensuring that American families have a fair shot at securing housing, this measure has the potential to address housing discrimination, keep families together, and save taxpayer dollars in the form of reduced incarceration costs -- all while increasing public safety.""

15,POLITICS,"16 Months After Killing Handcuffed Man, Nevada Still Shooting Prisoners",Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nevada-shooting-prisoners_us_57041324e4b0daf53af13cfb,"Nevada officers fired a live shotgun round once every 10 days between Jan. 1, 2012, and June 26, 2015.",2016-04-05,An inmate at High Desert State Prison says the facility is still using shotguns to break up fights. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570413932e00006400950809.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- An unarmed, handcuffed inmate died in 2014 after a Nevada Department of Corrections officer shot him with a 12-gauge shotgun loaded with 7 1/2-birdshot, the tiny pellets hunters use to kill birds and rabbits. Correctional experts urged the state to stop using shotguns to break up serious fights — a practice that's unheard of in other modern-day U.S. prisons. But Nevada officers are still shooting inmates.An inmate at High Desert State Prison, which is less than an hour from Las Vegas, alerted The Huffington Post to another shooting in a handwritten letter dated March 24. A lieutenant told the inmate ""the shotgun rounds did more damage than the fight did,"" he said in the letter. NDOC spokesperson Brooke Keast confirmed last month's incident, but said the shotgun was used to stop potential injury or death. Four inmates assaulted a lone prisoner on the yard at High Desert with handmade weapons, and continued the assault despite warnings, the firing of a blank round and rubber ""stingers,"" she said. An officer had to skip three rounds of birdshot off the ground, she claimed, because the assailants wouldn't give up. The victim suffered multiple stab wounds. His attackers sustained multiple pellet wounds, with one hit ""in his thigh, buttocks and neck"" and taken to the infirmary, according to Keast.  Prison fights, including those involving weapons, are certainly not unique to Nevada. But other systems typically use alternative methods to break them up, like Tasers, chemical spray or talking the inmates down. The reason most systems developed this way is simple: Prisoners are supposed to be unarmed, and they definitely aren't routinely packing guns. Nevada officers fired a live shotgun round once every 10 days between Jan. 1, 2012, and June 26, 2015, according to a Huffington Post Highline investigation. Nevada has claimed the way it uses birdshot — skipping pellets randomly off the floor — is a non-deadly tactic used only as a last resort to prevent injury or death. But at least 22 inmates at three facilities were injured by shotgun blasts last year. Over the years, uninvolved bystanders have also been hit or blinded. In November 2014, an officer shot at two scuffling inmates who had their hands cuffed behind their backs, killing 28-year-old Carlos Perez. It took months for the true story of Perez's death to emerge. Initially, the prison accused the other inmate -- who was also handcuffed -- of murder, and disciplined him with solitary confinement, even though a death certificate issued later clearly stated Perez was shot to death. (NDOC's Keast disputed that his punishment, disciplinary segregation, should be defined as solitary, because inmates ""can be out of their cell as much as possible depending on the unit's schedule, safety and security of the facility, staffing needs, etc."") The state attorney general's office has still not announced any results of the investigation into the incident, and none of the officers involved have faced charges. Months after HuffPost submitted public records requests, NDOC has not produced any photos or videos related to a number of shootings.Perez's family is suing the state over the incident. In a February court filing, the state argued the law allows officers to fire shots in a prison setting in order to restore order. But after Perez's death, the Association of State Correctional Administrators, an independent organization, determined Nevada should phase out the routine use of birdshot. NDOC refused. The state has taken recent measures that have led to a decrease in shootings, including adding rubber stingers, issuing chemical spray to officers, and beefing up training, including teaching officers ""verbal judo."" But the state still has a chronic understaffing problem — annual starting salaries are reportedly only $39,000 a year — and ASCA has said that's why the system has relied on shotguns in the past. After the HuffPost investigation came out, Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval asked at a prison board meeting in January why more states weren't using birdshot if the practice saves lives. ""Because we are right and everyone else is wrong,"" said interim NDOC director E.K. McDaniel — who took over after the previous director abruptly resigned — according to prison meeting notes. He added that it's been successful, and ""other departments may not use it because of the perception of shooting someone with a live round."" Last month, Sandoval announced he was replacing McDaniel with a new director, James Dzurenda, who has experience in the Connecticut and New York City correctional departments, which do not use birdshot to stop fights. It is not clear whether Dzurenda will continue the birdshot policy — he started work this week — but Sandoval emphasized the system needs to focus on ""humane treatment,"" and Dzurenda ""will bring a necessary fresh perspective to our current department.""This article has been updated with comment from Keast on the prison department's definition of solitary confinement.

16,POLITICS,GOP Moderates Plot Way Out Of House Budget Mess,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-moderates-budget-mess_us_57040573e4b083f5c6092c20,They're tired of the most conservative members of their party setting the agenda.,2016-04-05,"Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), chairman of the Tuesday Group, said the Republican Conference's more conservative members should be held accountable for their obstructionism.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570406102e00002d009507e9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As House Republican leaders look for a way out of the ongoing budget standoff, moderates in the GOP conference have cooked up a potential way out of the mess – or, at least, a way to challenge their more conservative colleagues.Members of the so-called Tuesday Group, a caucus of roughly 50 centrist Republicans, are proposing a quirky congressional procedure that would give Republicans and Democrats votes on a number of individual budget agreements, with the highest vote-getter carrying the day. The twist to this “King of the Hill” procedure, however, is that if no budget secures a majority, then the current budget number of $1.070 trillion would be automatically “deemed” -- or made official without actually agreeing to a budget -- without a vote, thus circumventing the disagreement among Republicans over that top-line spending number and allowing the House to move forward with appropriations bills at that level.The plan would require conservatives to vote for a rule setting up the Byzantine process, something they seem loath to do. But that might be the entire point.The chairman of the Tuesday Group, Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), told The Huffington Post on Monday that if members vote against a rule that would allow their budget to be considered, “they’re acknowledging that their budget doesn’t have 218 votes.”“They insist that we pass budgets, but then some of them are voting against the rule for considering a budget,” Dent said. “If they vote against the rule, they’re not for considering a budget.”Dent’s plan, which he recently brought up in a closed-door meeting with his colleagues, seems designed to test the mettle of conservatives and groups like the House Freedom Caucus. Votes on rules are typically sacred affairs split directly along party lines -- and Republicans who vote against rules have been punished in the past. (Dent himself was kicked off a leadership team in 2013 for voting against the rule that steered Congress into a shutdown.)Over the last year, the Freedom Caucus has challenged the notion that rules must be supported, most notably voting against the resolution to bring Trade Promotion Authority for fast-track approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal to the floor.But Dent wants to see how many Freedom Caucus members would dare vote against a rule that would set up consideration of their own $1.040 trillion budget proposal, or the even more aggressive Republican Study Committee budget level of $974 billion.“I don’t see it as a gimmick,” Dent said of his budget process proposal. “I see it as an open and honest process. But I also understand that the end result might be that no budget gets 218 votes.”Dent said some Freedom Caucus members have told him they’re actually open to his idea -- though that could turn quickly, once they realize that without enough votes for a majority they'd most likely be voting to codify the current budget level of $1.070 trillion.Last year, conservatives argued that the Trade Promotion Authority rule was “convoluted"" and amounted to legislating, rather than just setting up a process for a bill to come to the floor. Their argument with Dent’s plan would probably be similar. But last year’s budget made its way through the House via a similar, highest-vote-getter process -- though there was no deeming resolution attached in the event that no budget secured a majority. Dent understands that his plan is a bit of a legislative Hail Mary, but he suggested that conservatives should be held accountable for their obstructionism. If they don’t want to vote on a budget, that should be made clear, he said. If Congress can’t agree on a budget, he added, the institution will face criticism that it's “ineffective and can’t do its job.”“And I suspect that House Republicans will take the brunt of it,” Dent said.But Congress might also catch flak for its irregular process, something that Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) vowed to keep regular order when he took the speakership at the end of last year.More recently, Ryan has told his Republican colleagues that they weren’t going to “deem” the $1.070 trillion level, which would most likely require Democratic votes. He has also spoken out against deeming resolutions when Democrats relied on them.“Whatever happened to Congress actually doing its job? Whatever happened to actually passing a budget?” he said on the House floor in 2010.“What is the primary responsibility of the legislative branch of government?” Ryan also asked. “Budgeting. And what is this majority doing? They’re not budgeting.”Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong told HuffPost on Tuesday that “discussions amongst members continue on the best way to proceed with the budget.""But Dent thinks Ryan genuinely wants to pass a budget, that he mostly sides with moderates like himself, and that if he wants to move forward with appropriations bills, this is a good plan. “He knows that we’re not the problem,” Dent said. “We know where the problem is.”Dent, who is the chairman of the least controversial appropriations subcommittee, said his panel was moving forward with its fiscal 2017 bill, and he mentioned that there were only two real achievements in a budget: setting a top-line number for the next year and setting up a process to do a reconciliation bill to get around the 60-vote threshold in the Senate.“The budget process in Washington is often an exercise in Confederate money,” Dent said. “It’s not real.”Except in those two categories, of course.The budget showdown is becoming a true flashpoint for Ryan and his young speakership. The most conservative Republicans insist they won’t support a spending blueprint at the higher number. Moderate Republicans say they won’t support a budget at the lower $1.040 trillion level. And Ryan is left to work out a solution that allows the House to move forward with appropriations bills while not angering either side in a delicate election-year climate.Ryan has made a point of not turning to Democrats to bail him out of the tricky situation. But Dent, whom Democrats floated as a potential consensus speaker last year, seems to think there’s no evil in working with the other side, especially when more conservative Republicans find themselves voting with Democrats and against their own party.“When they do it, it seems to be high-minded,” Dent said. “But when we do it, it’s considered to be capitulation.”"

He didn't get Seda's commitment until a day later.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5702e6e12e00006400950696.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To understand how oddly personal the Iowa caucuses are -- how political campaigns and ordinary voters mix so deeply that it's impossible to sift them apart -- you need to know Kennan Seda.Seda, 58, has a degree in computer science. He used to do programming for large companies in Chicago before returning to Iowa to take care of his mother. He's a Democrat: He voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and served on the party platform community at the congressional district level. And on the evening of Dec. 28, 2015, he was arguably the most important voter in his state. That evening, as Iowa and much of the Midwest was pelted by a terrible snow storm, Seda ventured out to a townhall event in Tama being hosted by Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley. He didn't know at the time, but every other candidate had cancelled events on account of the weather, and no one else was showing up for the O'Malley event. And so, for 45 minutes, he and the former Maryland governor sat at a round wooden table and talked shop -- a whiteboard reading ""Tama welcomes Gov. Martin O'Malley!"" positioned nearby. In the latest ""Candidate Confessional,"" O'Malley recounted that experience, describing it as equal parts quaint, frustrating, charming and surreal. Well before he reached Tama, O'Malley had a sense that the entire day would be futile. He had seven events scheduled and wondered if maybe 20 voters total would end up attending. But his staff still wanted him to barnstorm the state, if only to show just how doggedly he was working for the votes. ""We are going to do every event. And we are going to be the only presidential campaign that does every event. And the people in Iowa are going to love it,"" an aide insisted.In the end, ""we probably saw 17 people,"" O'Malley said.The situation got hairiest toward the end of the day. The snow now blinding, O'Malley began to think that his aide (and driver) Jake had some special talent -- fine-tuned over his years in Iowa -- for driving on the road even when he couldn't see it.""I turn to Jake and I say, 'Jake! What is the secret?'"" O'Malley recalled. ""And he turned to me, white-knuckled, and said, 'I've never seen it this bad before. I have no idea.'""They soldiered on. A call was made to the staff at the Tama event -- their last stop -- to see what the crowd looked like. They delivered the bad news: One man had showed. His name was Kennan and he was very excited to meet the governor. In a phone call with The Huffington Post, Seda said that while he was indeed excited, he was also aware of just how abnormal the event would be. When he arrived, there were only two O'Malley staffers there. About 15 minutes went by and three or four more staffers showed up, along with the governor. Finally, someone else came. But it was a reporter for ABC News and her cameraman. They'd seen 13 cars in the ditch along the way to the event. Not wanting to waste his personal audience with a presidential candidate, Seda started talking. He and O'Malley discussed Donald Trump's proposed ban on Muslims immigrating to America and wondered whether Trump's first wife, Ivana, would have been caught up in a similar blockage had the U.S. refused to let in anyone from Communist countries in the 1970s (Ivana actually left Czechoslovakia for Canada before coming to the U.S.). O'Malley went through his record as governor and -- since they had time to kill -- explained the historical significance of the Port of Baltimore.Seda told O'Malley that he found it repulsive when big-pocketed donors were given plush assignments overseas as a reward for their largesse. Why, he asked, couldn't someone like him be considered for ambassador to Luxembourg?Eventually, O'Malley had to leave to get back to his hotel. He asked Seda if he had his vote. Seda said he was still undecided.Around 2 p.m. the next day he called Seda to make another pitch, O'Malley told ""Candidate Confessional."" This time, he got a commitment to caucus for him. ""And to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, he did,"" O'Malley said. ""And he also was kind of funny about it. He said, 'Look, I don't want anything from you, except to be ambassador.'""Seda didn't lie. When it came time a few weeks later, he caucused for O'Malley. But he was the only one in the room of roughly 85 people who backed the Maryland governor. On the second vote, with O'Malley having missed the 15 percent threshold to win delegates, Seda switched to Hillary Clinton. That evening, O'Malley would announce that he was suspending his campaign.Still, Seda's hopes of an ambassadorship to Luxembourg haven't completely evaporated.""He's just got to pass along the word to Clinton,"" he said. Reflecting on their evening discussion several months later, Seda and O'Malley offered the same simple explanation. ""That's Iowa,"" they said, as if everyone even remotely familiar with how presidents are elected in America understands that one random man can end up in a room by himself with a candidate for 45 minutes.Listen to the podcast above, or download it on iTunes.

Growing up on a corn and soybean farm in Illinois, McCarthy had to make her own fun in her early childhood. The actress sat down with Howard Stern on Monday to promote her new film ""The Boss"" and ended up discussing how the time she spent alone as a child informed her comedy roots. ""I was bored. I had no neighbors, I had no kids to play with. So I'd be, like, running around the barn pretending I was a detective or something,"" she said on ""The Howard Stern Show."" ""I had tons of friends but no one lived around me.""Back in 2013, the actress spoke to Michigan Avenue magazine about how the bucolic setting served as the breeding ground for the boundary-pushing, no-holds-barred performances we've come to expect from her onscreen. ""I was kind of a handful, I think -- pretty energetic,"" she said. ""I would run around the farm, climb up into things I wasn’t supposed to, and get up into the rafters in the barn. I went up into the silo once when I was really tiny, and the farmer had to come and get me down. It was an amazing way to grow up.""But once she left Illinois for New York City, initially intending to start a career in fashion, McCarthy immediately gravitated toward the comedy scene. The now-famous shoe designer and close friend to McCarthy Brian Atwood was the catalyst for the actress' comic career, urging her to go to an open mic night almost immediately after her arrival. ""The second night [Atwood] goes, 'You're gonna do stand-up,'"" she told Stern. ""Once I got up there, I just started telling weird, long self-involved stories.""And the rest is Hollywood history. Head over to ""The Howard Stern Show"" to hear more from McCarthy's interview. "

Politico said in January that VandeHei and star political writer Mike Allen would depart the company after the November election. HuffPost reported at the time that VandeHei had clashed with owner Robert Allbritton over budgets and wanted to start his own media venture. VandeHei has had little presence of late in the company's newsroom just outside Washington in Rosslyn, Virginia, according to staffers. Some said his influence has waned so much that it was a surprise last week when VandeHei was identified on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" as Politico CEO and president. But Politico hadn't officially announced any change in VandeHei's status until Monday night. In a staff memo, co-founder and editor-in-chief John Harris said VandeHei would be leaving sometime this spring. A source familiar with the move said it was likely to happen this month. Harris told staff that he and VandeHei had ""worked closely on a smooth transition that worked in the best interests of the publication and its new leadership team.""In the memo, Harris touted recent Politico achievements, including a record 30 million unique visitors in the past month. ""Having not only met but surpassed our goals, Jim and I and agreed that it made sense for him to wrap up his tenure at Politico this spring,"" Harris wrote.Harris said in the memo that chief operating officer Kim Kingsley and chief revenue officer Roy Schwartz -- both of whom were announced in January to be leaving sometime later this year -- also will depart this spring. Executive vice president Danielle Jones, who was among those Politico had said was leaving, will continue working for the publication as a consultant, Harris said. The memo didn't mention Allen, who is said to be joining VandeHei in a future venture. Though there have been rumors inside Politico that Allen might leave after the Republican and Democratic conventions this summer, Politico has said the reporter will remain through the election. Politico will not only need to find a replacement for Allen, whose Politico Playbook remains a must-read and spawned a newsletter franchise for the company, but also editor Susan Glasser. She's scheduled to keep the top newsroom job until November, when she'll move to Israel to be with her husband, Peter Baker, and son.Baker, a New York Times White House correspondent, has been tapped as the paper's next Jerusalem bureau chief and will move there in the coming months.Read Harris' full memo to staff below:Team,"
21,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Ted Cruz And Bernie Sanders Lead In Close Wisconsin Primary Races,"Natalie Jackson, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-ted-cruz-wisconsin-primary_us_5703b2cce4b0daf53af0ca9e,It could be a long night waiting for results.,2016-04-05,https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2016-04-04/nato2.png,https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2016-04-04/nato2.png,"Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton seem likely to lose in Wisconsin, but it won't do much damage to their delegate leads. Republicans don’t want someone who hasn’t been running -- like Paul Ryan -- to become the nominee in a contested convention. And more than three quarters of Republicans think America has lost its identity. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, April 5, 2016. CRUZ LEADS IN WISCONSIN GOP POLLING - Five of six polls conducted in the last week show Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ahead of Donald Trump by margins of 1 to 10 points. While all the remaining candidates have seen their support grow as other hopefuls dropped out of the race, Cruz has been the biggest beneficiary, more than doubling his support in the state since mid-January. HuffPost Pollster, which includes all publicly available polling, gives Cruz an average 41 percent of the vote to Trump's 38 percent, while Kasich averages 21 percent.But one poll tells a different story - An American Research Group poll released Monday found Trump leading Cruz by 10 percentage points. The only other recent poll to show Trump ahead in Wisconsin was from the Republican firm 0ptimus, which gave the businessman a 4 point lead but also showed about a fifth of voters still undecided. It’s possible that the poll, which is the most recent survey of the state, caught late movement among Republicans. It's more likely, though, that it's simply an outlier. Excluding the poll from the HuffPost Pollster average doesn’t change things much -- Cruz’s lead increases to 5 points. DEMOCRATIC RACE IS CLOSE IN WISCONSIN - Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders holds a slight lead over Hillary Clinton in the HuffPost Pollster average, with 49 percent support to Clinton’s 46 percent. Sanders has only emerged as the leader in the last two weeks, jumping a full 5 percentage points in the Pollster average between March 22 and March 28. In the final week of polling, his margin has varied from 6 points behind Clinton to 8 points ahead of her. WISCONSIN PROBABLY WON’T CHANGE DELEGATE PICTURE MUCH - There are 42 delegates up for grabs for the GOP candidates, and 96 for the Democrats to split. Candidates not named Clinton or Trump need to win big to put a dent in their delegate deficits. Jonathan Martin and Nate Cohn: “If Mr. Cruz wins easily — say, by more than 10 percentage points — few will argue that it was anything but a good showing for him. But a closer contest could be followed by a debate about whether Mr. Trump had really lost ground or merely hit a speed bump on his road to the nomination….Mr. Sanders’s overall deficit — he trails Mrs. Clinton by about 230 delegates — is becoming so large that winning only modest victories puts the Democratic nomination farther out of his reach. He needs to win around 57 percent of the outstanding vote to win a majority of pledged delegates. If he falls short of that bar in Wisconsin, his target in later states will be ratcheted up even higher.” [NYT] REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT A NEW CANDIDATE TO BE CONSIDERED IN A CONTESTED CONVENTION - Lesley Clark: ""A majority of Republican voters want Trump to get their presidential nomination if he’s ahead but short of a majority heading into their convention, according to a new McClatchy-Marist poll. And a big majority want any contested convention to be off limits to politicians who didn’t first run in the primaries - such as House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin or 2012 nominee Mitt Romney….Fifty-two percent of Republicans said the party should nominate Trump if he has more delegates than any rival heading into the convention, with only 40 percent saying the party should look elsewhere."" [McClatchy]TRUMP SUPPORTERS FAVOR SOME OF HIS FOREIGN POLICY PROPOSALS - Kathy Frankovic: ""Trump has claimed that he opposed the 2003 war in Iraq before it began, expressed serious doubts about the value of NATO membership for the United States, in the same interview questioned an activist foreign policy, and would close U.S. borders against Muslim immigrants. Is he reflecting his supporters? Only sometimes. Most Trump supporters clearly side with their candidate when it comes to their opinion of NATO….Trump supporters are less likely than supporters of the other two remaining Republican candidates to believe the U.S. has a responsibility to give military assistance in trouble spots around the world when it is asked to do so by its allies….Trump’s position opposing Muslims traveling to the United States gets the support of 90% of his voters (and that position is also shared by 78% of all Republican primary voters). "" [YouGov]NEARLY 8-IN-10 REPUBLICANS THINK AMERICA HAS LOST ITS WAY - Quinnipiac University: “There is a deep well of dissatisfaction among American voters who say the U.S. has lost its identity, that they are falling behind financially, that their beliefs and values are under attack and that public officials don't care what they think... A total of 57 percent of all voters 'strongly agree' or 'somewhat agree' with the statement, 'America has lost its identity,' as 43 percent 'somewhat disagree' or 'strongly disagree.' Among all Republicans, 79 percent agree, while only 36 percent of Democrats agree. The highest level of agreement is expressed by GOP supporters of Donald Trump, as 85 percent 'agree'.” [Quinnipiac]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

The Constitutional Responsibility Project is hitting the streets Tuesday morning with a billboard truck, driving by the Supreme Court and displaying the number of days since Obama nominated Merrick Garland. It will be on the road eight hours a day, five days a week, until the Senate acts. The effort is being organized by a group of veterans of the Obama White House under the #WeNeedNine campaign, which has been coordinating the on-the-ground action to get the Senate to move forward on filling the vacancy. It has had people standing outside the Supreme Court every day with the amount of time that has lapsed since Obama nominated Garland as a constant visual reminder. Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (Iowa), vowed to block Obama's Supreme Court nominee even before he publicly put forth Garland on March 16. They argue that the next president should get to choose the replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia -- hoping, of course, that a member of their own party will win in November and choose a more conservative jurist. Senators couldn't even get away from the issue when they were in their home states over the past two weeks. Republicans faced frequent protests, and Grassley ended up simply keeping the details of many of his events in Iowa secret. Newspapers also weighed in with editorials urging them to give Garland a fair hearing.About 40 constituents from Iowa, Kentucky, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin -- states with key GOP senators -- are coming to Washington Tuesday to lobby the senators on Capitol Hill. Two of the constituents are former Grassley staffers. The group will also hold a press conference outside the Supreme Court, meet with officials at the White House and attend a briefing at the Center for American Progress. Progressive groups have been going full court press in their attempts to pressure the GOP on Garland. On Monday night, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will hold a grassroots organizing call with activists hosted by MoveOn.org and 16 other groups. Garland has been on Capitol Hill meeting with senators about his nomination, although so far, there's been little movement from Republicans who are standing by their leader. One exception is Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), who is considered one of the most vulnerable senators in the 2016 cycle. Kirk has called on the GOP to ""just man up and cast a vote"" on Garland. "

And if Trump wins the GOP nomination, anti-Trump candidates from the party establishment are considering doing the same….In an election season that already has upended the expected, there are the ingredients that have fueled third-party bids in the past. They include a mercurial potential contender with money — Donald Trump, meet Ross Perot — and the sort of ideological divide that prompted moderate congressman John Anderson to run when the GOP shifted right in 1980 to nominate conservative Ronald Reagan. The power of the parties has gotten weaker since then and the rules for getting on state ballots easier.Voters increasingly are open to voting for someone other than the Democrat or the Republican. In the most recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll, taken in February, only a third of those surveyed said the two major parties did a good job of representing Americans' political views….Running for president this year as a third candidate isn't easy. That doesn't mean it's impossible.” [USA Today]INDIVIDUAL DELEGATES COULD HAVE A BIG ROLE IN THE GOP- Jeremy W. Peters: “For the first time in 40 years, the delegates to the Republican National Convention could be more than just a rubber stamp on their party’s nomination process….The procedural peculiarities of the nominating process this year are adding a new twist. All 50 states, plus the five territories and the District of Columbia, have a vote, but several states and territories have given themselves outsize influence by allowing their delegates to act as free agents….Uncommitted delegates are free to decide whom they will support. They can promise allegiances or switch at will, operating with no constraints binding them to the outcome of a statewide primary….All told, there could be several dozen totally uncommitted delegates on the convention floor in Cleveland, a tiny fraction of the 1,237 needed to clinch the nomination, but enough to swing a close race.” [NYT] Delegate strategy matters for Democrats, too - John Ralston: “Despite losing the state on Feb. 20 in the caucus, Bernie Sanders' campaign swarmed the Clark County caucus and probably flipped two delegates from Hillary Clinton's camp….because the caucus process allows some delegates to be unbound, 12 [delegates] were up for grabs at the 17 county conventions Saturday.Sanders had 600 more delegates in Clark on Saturday despite losing the state's most populous county by nearly 10 percentage points..” [Ralston Reports] TED CRUZ COULD HURT TRUMP BY WINNING WISCONSIN - HuffPollster: ""Wisconsin’s GOP primary may be crucial for Republicans hoping to stop Donald Trump from clinching the nomination outright, with recent polling giving them hope that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) could pull off a significant win. The state has 42 delegates up for grabs, with 24 awarded by district and 18 going to the statewide winner. Even if Cruz wins by a small margin, he’ll automatically take all 18 state delegates and likely a good portion of district level delegates. That would probably keep Trump below the level he needs to win a majority before the Republican convention. Of the six surveys taken of the race since March, all but one show Cruz ahead, with margins ranging between 1 and 10 points. Recent Marquette Law School and Fox News polls, both of which were conducted using live interviewers, each find Cruz with a relatively comfortable 10-point edge, up significantly from earlier in the year."" [HuffPost] Looking farther ahead, Trump has big leads in New York and Pennsylvania - Anthony Salvanto, Fred Backus, Jennifer De Pinto and Sarah Dutton: ""In [Donald] Trump's home state of New York, however, Trump has a dominant lead over the field, 52 percent to 21 percent for Cruz and 20 percent for Kasich. The billionaire leads by wide margins as best to handle multiple issues including terrorism, bringing back jobs, and the ability to defeat Hillary Clinton if she is the Democratic nominee. And in Pennsylvania, coming up at the end of April, Trump also enjoys a strong lead at 47 percent while Cruz and Kasich are well back at 29 percent and 22 percent respectively...There isn't a lot of evidence that Donald Trump's most recent controversies have hurt him, at least in terms of costing him supporters, though it may be limiting his ability to convert new supporters.""

They can promise allegiances or switch at will, operating with no constraints binding them to the outcome of a statewide primary….All told, there could be several dozen totally uncommitted delegates on the convention floor in Cleveland, a tiny fraction of the 1,237 needed to clinch the nomination, but enough to swing a close race.” [NYT] Delegate strategy matters for Democrats, too - John Ralston: “Despite losing the state on Feb. 20 in the caucus, Bernie Sanders' campaign swarmed the Clark County caucus and probably flipped two delegates from Hillary Clinton's camp….because the caucus process allows some delegates to be unbound, 12 [delegates] were up for grabs at the 17 county conventions Saturday.Sanders had 600 more delegates in Clark on Saturday despite losing the state's most populous county by nearly 10 percentage points..” [Ralston Reports] TED CRUZ COULD HURT TRUMP BY WINNING WISCONSIN - HuffPollster: ""Wisconsin’s GOP primary may be crucial for Republicans hoping to stop Donald Trump from clinching the nomination outright, with recent polling giving them hope that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) could pull off a significant win. The state has 42 delegates up for grabs, with 24 awarded by district and 18 going to the statewide winner. Even if Cruz wins by a small margin, he’ll automatically take all 18 state delegates and likely a good portion of district level delegates. That would probably keep Trump below the level he needs to win a majority before the Republican convention. Of the six surveys taken of the race since March, all but one show Cruz ahead, with margins ranging between 1 and 10 points. Recent Marquette Law School and Fox News polls, both of which were conducted using live interviewers, each find Cruz with a relatively comfortable 10-point edge, up significantly from earlier in the year."" [HuffPost] Looking farther ahead, Trump has big leads in New York and Pennsylvania - Anthony Salvanto, Fred Backus, Jennifer De Pinto and Sarah Dutton: ""In [Donald] Trump's home state of New York, however, Trump has a dominant lead over the field, 52 percent to 21 percent for Cruz and 20 percent for Kasich. The billionaire leads by wide margins as best to handle multiple issues including terrorism, bringing back jobs, and the ability to defeat Hillary Clinton if she is the Democratic nominee. And in Pennsylvania, coming up at the end of April, Trump also enjoys a strong lead at 47 percent while Cruz and Kasich are well back at 29 percent and 22 percent respectively...There isn't a lot of evidence that Donald Trump's most recent controversies have hurt him, at least in terms of costing him supporters, though it may be limiting his ability to convert new supporters.""
