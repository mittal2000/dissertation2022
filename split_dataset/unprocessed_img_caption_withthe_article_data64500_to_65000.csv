The irritable driver is seen plowing down a Pompano Beach road Tuesday morning, zipping around cars, when a funnel cloud appears in the dark sky.Anthony Ciarrocchi uploaded the video to Facebook shortly after, writing that he could not see the tornado because of the rain.Even when debris gets tossed into the roadway and cars come to a halt, he doesn't appear to spot it. He instead excitedly exclaims that he's in the middle of ""a f--king hurricane"" and carries on driving and honking at other cars to move.""If anyone of the nay sayers (sic) have ever driven in S.FL during any storm. you would know it comes down in sheets, roads flood quickly and you have to keep your eyes on the road.."" he posted in the profanity-laced video's comment section on YouTube. ""Drivers suck in the rain and I Do not care to sit in a Tornado and watch it destroy stuff...""On Facebook and YouTube, storm enthusiasts expressed shared excitement over the footage, as well as shock and horror.A YouTube account for the Southeast Louisiana Storm Spotters remarked on how ""extremely stupid"" it is to drive straight into a tornado.""Even the most experienced chasers don't do this. YOU Anthony almost lost your life and if you are a ‘Storm chaser’ you're not a very smart one,"" the group posted in the YouTube video’s comment section. A man identifying himself as an extreme weather chaser in Australia also marveled at the video on Facebook, calling the footage -- and the driver's action -- ""incredible.""""Some people spend years and thousands of dollars to intercept a tornado in the name of science (deploy probes for research). Then there are guys like this who put their life in danger for a bit of a giggle. It's mind boggling to be honest,"" Thomas Hinterdorfer wrote.If caught in a tornado while driving, experts advise drivers to not try to outrun the twister but stop your vehicle and stay inside.""There is no safe option when caught in a tornado in a car, just slightly less-dangerous ones,"" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration states on its website.The federal agency recommends that if far enough away, drivers drive out of the tornado’s path at right angles.If caught in extreme winds or flying debris, drivers are advised to park as quickly and safely as possible, out of traffic lanes, and to stay inside with seat belts fastened and heads covered below windows with hands or any soft item -- like a blanket or cushion.If possible, seek shelter from a sturdy building or underground until the storm passes.Also on HuffPost:"

Comeback is on and that the media should get in on the ground floor of this amazing narrative. The media, however, has decided that a comeback for Marco Rubio is on, and that Jeb Bush should get on the ground floor of this amazing narrative. What will happen to Jeb Bush if the only regular column documenting his comeback switches to covering Marco Rubio's comeback? Let's find out!. Way, way back in December 2014, The Daily Beast's Michael Tomasky asked a question that, at the time, no one could really answer: ""Can Marco Rubio even win a primary?"" How often does it happen that a presumed front-runner can lose the first four contests and stay in the race? On the Republican side, it’s never happened. At the time, Rubio was trailing in the polls in all four of the early state contests, so it was worth asking. Now, however, he ... well, he's lost two contests and is trailing badly in the other two. But guess what! The Florida senator is winning the political pundit primary, much to the disappointment of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, because that was supposed to be the primary Bush and all his super PAC money was going to win.And there you have it! Marco Rubio is an unstoppable force because he got some endorsements and is drawing crowds and this is physics now. Is there anything Jeb can do to stop all the Marcomentum?Whoa, whoa, hold up, Jeb! Don't go using your gun to stop #marcomentum, especially if you have your name engraved on it! Instead, take comfort in the fact that the third-place finish Rubio is hoping his comeback gets him will net him precisely the same number of delegates that a second-, fourth-, or fifth-place finisher in South Carolina will accrue: zero.Ha, yes, that's the one thing that's been forgotten in the race to get Marco Rubio a comeback narrative: The South Carolina primary is winner-take-all. So sorry!This has been the Jeb! Comeback Watch for Feb. 16. Jeb Bush finished in sixth place in Iowa (2.8 percent), and fourth in New Hampshire (11 percent). He is currently in fourth place in South Carolina polls (9.2 percent), and in fifth place nationally (5.3 percent). ~~~~~Jason Linkins edits ""Eat The Press"" for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast, ""So, That Happened.""

2,POLITICS,Plant Shutdown Threatens Pennsylvania Town's Water Supply,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/allegheny-technologies-water_us_56c4e5d1e4b08ffac127733c,Allegheny Technologies has already locked out its workers in a labor dispute.,2016-02-17,"Richard Harshman is chairman, president and chief executive officer of Allegheny Technologies Inc.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c4e8d01d00002700df6241.jpeg?ops=crop_6_109_2994_1703%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The tiny town of Midland, Pennsylvania, is worried it won't be able to afford water if the company that owns a local factory gets its way.In an unusual arrangement, the western Pennsylvania town has bought water from the steel mill on the Ohio River for the past hundred years. But now the company that owns the plant, Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, wants to charge a much higher rate for the water that the town says it can't pay.Dan Donatella has worked for the Municipal Authority for the Borough of Midland as a consultant for more than 20 years. He said the town of 2,600 won't pay what the company wants to charge. ""Midland Borough is an economically depressed community,"" Donatella said. ""This is a crisis for us.""The authority said that until now, it paid roughly $250,000 per year and that ATI has jacked the annual price to $1.4 million, citing the cost of pumping the water, maintenance and wages for eight workers. The company, a Pittsburgh-based specialty metals supplier boasting $4 billion in revenues, announced in December it would idle its Midland steel plant for a year or two because excess steel supply had made operations less profitable. Allegheny also happens to be in the midst of a labor dispute in which it had locked out more than 2,000 union workers from 12 plants in six states, including at the Midland plant. The National Labor Relations Board deemed the lockout illegal last week, setting up a potential trial. Midland officials said they didn't think ATI's water issue was connected to the lockout. A spokesperson for the United Steelworkers union, which represents the workers, didn't respond to a request for comment. A company spokesman said ATI would continue to operate the water pumping station and share costs.""We will work with the [Midland water authority] to explore options to the current arrangement, all in an effort to minimize the impact of the idling of ATI Midland Operations on the MWA and the local community,"" ATI spokesman Dan Greenfield said in an email.Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) has gotten involved, asking the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help Midland build infrastructure to pump water from the river itself. A USDA spokeswoman told HuffPost the agency's rural development office is working with Midland ""to explore ways we can help them affordably finance the needed water infrastructure improvements.”Midland buys and treats raw water that ATI pumps from the Ohio River, then sells the treated water back to the company and to several thousand consumers who live in and around the borough. Before it was idled, the plant itself had been the borough's largest water customer. But as of this month, the company is no longer buying treated water back from the town, so it has less interest in staffing the intake system. Donatella said Midland will keep paying the rate it had paid before and that if the company threatens to shut off the water, the authority will go to court to get an injunction. Long-term, Midland had already been exploring options for building its own water intake facility. ""What we want, ultimately, is for ATI to have the factory up and running again,"" said Joe Widener, chief of staff for the Beaver County Board of Commissioners. For now, Widener said the commission wants ATI and Midland to reach some kind of water agreement."

6,POLITICS,The Only Weapon Obama Has In Supreme Court Fight Is Public Shaming,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-supreme-court_us_56c49802e4b08ffac1272210,The one way to get a justice through the Senate is to embarrass Republicans.,2016-02-17,Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) thinks Democrats will have trouble getting a nominee confirmed to the Supreme Court.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c4a8d21900002900377d9d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- As the White House and allied Democrats begin a high-stakes push to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, they are coping with a major hurdle: they have little to no leverage over Republicans.The process for replacing a justice on the court is supposed to be simple. The Constitution gives the president the authority to make a nomination, and gives the Senate the power to advise and consent. When there have been vacancies in the past, things have proceeded in a straightforward way. A name is offered up and the Senate Judiciary Committee receives it, holds hearings and votes on it. Presuming the nomination passes through the committee, it goes to the full chamber. Though the nominee could be subjected to a filibuster, in which 60 votes are required for confirmation, that's really only happened once, and whether it was technically a filibuster remains in dispute.But we live in illogical times. In the immediate aftermath of Scalia's death on Saturday, Senate Republicans said that not only are they likely to filibuster President Barack Obama's eventual nominee, but they would not even bother holding a hearing, in hopes of delaying the matter until a Republican is in the White House. And Senate Democrats, who are in the minority, are largely powerless to change this dynamic. ""No we don't,"" said Anita Dunn, a long-time party operative, when asked if Democratic leadership had much leverage in the upcoming fight.Jim Manley, a former top aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), said it was unlikely for a nominee to move forward. ""Is there any leverage, no,"" he said.Even those occupying positions of power concede that the procedural cupboard is bare. ""I don't know of any that are allowed,"" Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said, when asked if there were mechanisms that might allow the party to put Republicans on record.So party officials are turning to a shaming campaign, seeking to badger Senate Republicans and label them obstructionists, in hopes that a few of them -- presumably those with uphill re-election battles -- will stop echoing the party line. Obama, speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, made the argument that refusing to consider a nominee would show clear disregard for constitutional norms. ""I’m amused when I hear people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution suddenly reading into it provisions that are not there,"" he said. ""This will be another test whether norms, rules, basic fair play, can function in Washington these days.""But other Democrats have made more overt threats should Republicans demand that a replacement for Scalia only be considered by the next president. ""I think this could be a high-water mark where Republicans just reach so far that they get punished in the elections, and realize that if they don't get back to reality and let us vote they could be punished severely,"" said Schumer. Recognizing the competing pressures Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will face, Schumer predicted that he would eventually conclude that control of the Senate was more important than the affection of his base. ""You know, survival is very important both for McConnell and the Republicans who are up for re-election, and I think they are going to really suffer here,"" he said. Already, there is some evidence of Republican anxiety. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) has encouraged his party to at least hold hearings on a nominee. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), in a 57-word statement that said barely anything, suggested her party shouldn't rush to judgment. And Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), up for re-election this year, backtracked on Tuesday to say he'd be open to hearings. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Judiciary Committee, left the door ajar to holding hearings. And outside Congress, several operatives and legal officials have said that the process of replacing a justice is too sacrosanct to succumb to partisan gridlock.White House officials have gleefully pointed to these developments as evidence that the dam is cracking. But even they aren't confident that it will fully break. After all, as an addendum to his call for hearings, Tillis encouraged Obama to nominate someone who echoed Scalia's ideology and jurisprudence, which would make sense if Obama were a conservative. Alas, he's not. And while Johnson said he'd be open to hearings, he didn't bother to feign openness to the possibility that he would vote yes. ""I don’t think there’s much of a difference one way or another,"" he said.""If you take McConnell at face value, I can't imagine he will reverse course,"" said Manley. ""There will be hell to pay within his caucus and among Republican activists if he decides to do so."" Faced with this, sources close to the administration say that Obama is leaning toward nominating someone who has been confirmed by the Senate before, who has either an apolitical resume or good existing relations with current senators. That type of nominee, they hope, would be difficult for Republicans on the Judiciary Committee to reject outright, especially given the fact that the voting public can't fathom what the fuss is all about. They point to past standoffs over funding for the Department of Homeland Security and Planned Parenthood, as well as raising the debt limit -- instances in which Republicans initially demanded strict policy concessions only to eventually fold -- as precedent. ""I just don't think the politics of obstruction play well -- especially when Republicans are facing a tough map, in a presidential election year ... AND obstruction vis a vis the court, which is supposed to be an apolitical body,"" emailed Ben LaBolt, a former Obama administration spokesman on judicial matters. But at some point, the shaming campaign will have diminishing returns. Were a nominee to actually get a hearing, Democrats would still need to get him or her through the committee. Then, they'd need McConnell to bring the nomination up for a vote and, potentially, five Republicans to vote for full passage. And even at this juncture, top officials aren't willing to demand that last step. ""Members are going to continue to vote 'no' as I have done,"" said Schumer, noting that in 2007 he called for lawmakers to consider but not support President George W. Bush's nominees for the court till he left office. ""But that doesn't mean there should be no consideration."""

10,POLITICS,John McCain Sure Has Changed His Mind About Supreme Court Nominees,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-mccain-supreme-court-nominees_us_56c3ab12e4b0c3c550531205,He used to think the Senate should vote on them.,2016-02-17,Perhaps McCain no longer believes elections have consequences.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_48_268_2935_1585%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The top Democrat vying to challenge John McCain for his Senate seat this fall is accusing the Arizona Republican of hypocrisy over the effort to replace -- or rather not replace -- the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.Once McCain was a very prominent member of a bipartisan group of 14 senators who united in the second term of George W. Bush's presidency to ensure that the Senate dealt with judicial nominations.The idea, as McCain has often said, was that elections have consequences, and that the president gets to have his nominees approved if they are qualified, regardless of whether senators like their politics. The gang of 14 eased the confirmations of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito.McCain still has an explanation for his bipartisan stance on his website:From Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to Senator Jon Kyl, Arizona has a rich and storied legal history. For Senator McCain, one of the best ways to honor that legacy is to work with whomever is the President and other Senators to fill vacancies with the most qualified people who are willing to serve their country as judges.But McCain declared Monday that he supported the plan of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to refuse to even consider filling Scalia's seat.“I believe that we should wait until after the next election and let the American people pick the next president, and we should consider who the next president of the United States nominates,"" McCain said on a Phoenix radio show.That came as a surprise to many observers familiar with McCain's long-standing position that presidential nominees should receive a vote -- even some he didn't think were qualified.The campaign team for Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.), who's running to replace McCain, found the senator's switch so noteworthy that they went looking for those previous occasions when he explained why presidents deserve votes on nominees. And they found them.Speaking about getting votes on Bush nominees in 2005, for instance, McCain told MSNBC's Chris Matthews, ""The American voter was very well aware of what kind of judge the president of the United States was going to appoint and they decided to re-elect him.""More such quotes can be found on Kirkpatrick's website, and you can watch McCain below.UPDATE: 11:25 p.m. -- McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero responded with a statement criticizing President Barack Obama's policies and saying that a Senate Democrat's 2007 speech had set a new ""precedent,"" although McCain has backed nominations since then.Here is Romero's statement:""It was Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick who said no one should 'second-guess' President Obama, so it's no surprise to see her marching in lockstep with the Democratic Party machine once again.

Cook County States Attorney Anita Alvarez's political allegiance to the city's powerful police union creates a conflict of interest that prevents her from ""zealously and effectively"" prosecuting the cop charged in the killing, claims a legal petition filed in criminal court and signed by Rep. Danny K. Davis (D-lll.) Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), the Cook County Bar Association and the Chicago Urban League, among others. ""States Attorney Alvarez lost the public’s confidence when she delayed charging Officer Van Dyke for 400 days,” Cook County Commissioner Chuy Garcia said Tuesday during a news conference announcing the petition. Officer Jason Van Dyke shot McDonald 16 times as the 17-year-old walked away from police in October 2014, but wasn't charged with first-degree murder until the city was forced to release police dashcam footage of the killing in November 2015.Calls for a special prosecutor are increasingly common in police misconduct cases, but few formal requests are actually filed. Even fewer are granted. ""It only happens when there’s a great public outcry,"" said Flint Taylor, a civil rights lawyer with the People's Law Office who helped file the petition.Taylor said an independent prosecutor has only been appointed in a handful of Chicago cases in the last 40 years. ""It always takes a tremendous amount of public pressure to have an independent prosecutor appointed,"" he said.Under Illinois law, institutional connections between the police and the prosecutor's office aren't enough to require an outside prosecutor, Taylor said. ""What is required is proof that there is actually a conflict. That is, a competing interest on the part of the states attorney that actually interferes with her ability to conduct an independent and zealous investigation and prosecution,"" said Locke Bowman, executive director of the MacArthur Justice Center at Northwestern University's law school who also is a co-petitioner in the independent prosecutor request.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and real estate mogul Donald Trump, the current front-runner in the race for the nomination. The governor's endorsement also follows nods from South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and and Rep. Trey Gowdy, all popular representatives among the state's conservatives, in backing Rubio's candidacy. The Indian-American governor is the first female and minority governor of South Carolina, and was viewed as a natural fit for Rubio's campaign. The senator, who is also the son of immigrants, has framed his candidacy as a generational choice about the future of America - one that can appeal to minority constituencies that largely rejected the Republican Party in the last presidential election.Haley has been mentioned as a potential vice presidential nominee. She also delivered the GOP response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address earlier this year, in which she took aim at Trump. On Tuesday, the governor sharpened that criticism, stating that the businessman represents ""everything a governor doesn't want in a president.""Haley endorsed Mitt Romney during the race for the 2012 GOP nomination. The nod did not move the needle for the former Massachusetts governor, however, as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich went on to win the South Carolina primary.Asked about a potential Haley nod by NBC News on Tuesday, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a presidential candidate who had also courted the governor, called it the most powerful, meaningful one in the state."""
21,POLITICS,House Republicans Struggle To Find Path Forward On Budget Impasse,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-republicans-budget-impasse_us_56c4c78ae4b0b40245c8b8f9,There might be no good way out.,2016-02-17,Speaker Paul Ryan is dealing with a budget conundrum that threatens to derail House Republican plans for 2016.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c4de2d1300002a00141695.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Speaker Paul Ryan wanted House Republicans to drive the policy conversation in 2016. Now, with a GOP budget suddenly in doubt if Republicans can't agree on a top-line 2017 spending number, the House is in danger of putting forward next to nothing this year. And that leaves leaders with a make-or-break question: How do they get out of this mess?Ryan brought House Republicans together on Friday to lay out three options.Option one: appease conservatives by adopting a budget at the lower sequester spending levels, only to see the Senate block appropriations bills and Congress end up with a continuing resolution.Option two: add more defense dollars to the current spending number set under a bipartisan deal in October, only to see the Senate block that, too.Option three: adopt a budget at the current, agreed-upon $1.07 trillion spending level that lays out conservative principles and lets Republicans get on with the appropriations process.It's clear Ryan himself would go with Door No. 3, but it's not clear there's a coalition of 218 Republicans to get him there, which is forcing Republicans to get creative.House Freedom Caucus member Andy Harris (R-Md.) floated another idea on Friday: pair the new spending number with an offsetting amount of cuts to mandatory spending.Most Republicans are keen on tackling entitlement spending to some degree, it's just unclear if those cuts would actually be enacted.One HFC member who has been working on the mandatory cuts plan told The Huffington Post on Tuesday that he seriously doubts that idea could find 218 supporters. ""I don't see it without real legislation to address mandatory spending being passed first,"" the HFC member said, ""and even then, it will be a heavy lift.""Another idea, floated by HFC member Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.), is to adopt a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution requiring the budget to be balanced in 10 years. You want him to agree to an already-enacted spending level that's $30 billion higher than the current trillion-dollar number? Get going on that amendment.The one idea that has gained a lot of traction among Republicans is to just ""deem"" the current spending number -- or, in other words, just adopt it. In the conservative telling of this scenario, Democrats would supply Republicans with the necessary votes to affirm the top-line number, letting the majority of Republicans maintain their ideological purity by voting no.Of course, that sort of Washington maneuver has its opponents. As Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho) recently told HuffPost, ""That's how you get a guaranteed President Trump.""It's also unclear how that would solve the main issue for Republicans. Once they've adopted that number, do they expect Republicans to vote for individual appropriations bills that maintain that spending level? How many bills? One? Two?The truth is that many conservatives just don't see what's in it for them by adopting a budget. Sure, they get to do appropriations measures. But to what end?Asked about Ryan's argument that adopting a budget would enable lawmakers to go on to debating spending measures, conservative Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) said he didn't buy it and offered a two-word rebuttal: Donald Trump.He said the anger that swept his tea party class into Congress in 2010 was twice as potent now, and that politicians had better act accordingly. ""We've got to listen to what's going on,"" he said.What's going on, Gosar says, is fury over business as usual and anger about Republicans in Congress presiding over an explosion of debt -- with new Congressional Budget Office baselines suggesting that deficits are only getting worse.And suddenly, with voters picking up a particularly aggressive strain of ""throw-the-bums-out,"" conservatives are taking a hard line against the budget.""It is mind-boggling to me how Washington continually ignores our financial Judgment Day in order to win on the next Election Day,"" Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told HuffPost on Tuesday.Brooks insists a $30 billion cut is just the beginning. ""We have to start getting real here,"" he said, adding that if Congress couldn't even make that cut, he wasn't going to vote for something that is ""financially irresponsible.""""Again, I'm not convinced that the elected officials in Washington understand the danger of the situation,"" Brooks said, speaking of a $19 trillion debt.The question for leadership is just how many Republicans are like Brooks. With 246 Republicans in the House, GOP leaders can lose almost 30 votes and still adopt a budget. The problem is, this may be a battle leaders end up fighting on two fronts.As Ryan alluded to when presenting his three options, there is some pressure from defense hawks to raise the spending number further, most likely in the form of additional money for the Overseas Contingency Operations Fund. On the Senate side, Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) said he would ""raise hell"" to get more money for defense, which he said was $17 billion short of last year.In the House, defense hawks seem to be waiting to see what Ryan can do on the budget before they begin what is becoming a yearly ritual of demanding more money for their votes.""Right now, we're kind of letting the speaker see if he can herd everybody together,"" one of those defense-minded Republicans, Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, told HuffPost on Friday. ""Our intention is not to blow up any processes.""But conservatives see those Republicans waiting in the wings -- Labrador also recently told HuffPost ""that's how we get to a $19 trillion debt, is when you have defense guys who have no respect for budget caps"" -- and many of them start thinking the best way to defend against additional spending is to just sink the entire budget process.Of course, the alternative is to just do what conservatives ask: Put forward a budget that goes back on the October 2015 deal and reduces the budget by $30 billion. What was once unthinkable is now in the realm of possibility. One leadership aide told HuffPost that putting forward a budget with the lower number was ""still a very active discussion"" and that leadership was not ""predetermining anything.""Ryan appears to be distancing himself a bit from the budget. He told Republicans on Friday that they don't have to do a budget, that they're not ""staring down a cliff."" And while it might be a shame not to do a budget, the sky won't fall. Ultimately, it's the members' decision, not his.Meanwhile, Budget Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.) is sticking with the eternal sunshine that Republicans will adopt a budget.Asked whether he still thought the House would get a spending blueprint done, Price was emphatic that the answer is yes.""I'm an optimistic guy,"" he said.And what if he weren't an optimistic guy?""I wouldn't be in this profession,"" Price answered.Also on HuffPost:"

And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.""Apple introduced stronger security to its mobile operating system in 2014. At the time, the company said it would not be able to comply with government requests to pull data from an iOS device.""For all devices running iOS 8 and later versions, Apple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants because the files to be extracted are protected by an encryption key that is tied to the user’s passcode, which Apple does not possess,"" Apple posted on its privacy website.Of course, debate over the encryption has followed since. Privacy advocates applaud the security measure for protecting customers, though the San Bernardino case clearly outlines the grievances of those who worry over national security. Theoretically, the iPhone in question could contain information that helps an investigation and prevents another attack.Apple isn't having it.""The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers -- including tens of millions of American citizens -- from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals,"" Cook wrote. ""The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe.""You can read the full letter on Apple's website.UPDATE: 1:30 p.m. -- The White House reportedly fired back at Apple following the publication of Cook's letter. Authorities aren't asking the tech company to create a ""backdoor,"" a representative said -- they just want access to the single iPhone in question.Also on HuffPost:"
25,POLITICS,Vulnerable GOP Senator Now Says He's Willing To Vote On Obama Supreme Court Nominee,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ron-johnson-supreme-court_us_56c38b7ee4b08ffac126d21d,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) says he still thinks it should happen after the election, though, under the next president.",2016-02-16,Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) doesn't want the Senate to move forward on a potential Supreme Court nominee put forward by President Barack Obama.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c38c2f1900002a00377ced.jpeg?ops=crop_0_260_3000_1519%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is trying to pre-empt criticism he and his party may face for refusing to move forward on President Barack Obama's expected Supreme Court nominee, arguing Tuesday that ""doing nothing is also an action"" and indicating a willingness to possibly vote on a candidate.Shortly after news broke Saturday about Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's death, Senate Republicans came out and promised to block any replacement chosen by Obama. They said the next president should get to choose, even though Obama will be in office through the end of the year. Johnson quickly signed on to that approach.""I strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate,"" Johnson said in a statement Sunday.Democrats have been hammering Republicans for declaring their intent to block an Obama nominee without even giving that person a fair hearing. ""It would be unprecedented in recent history for the Supreme Court to go a year with a vacant seat,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Sunday. ""Failing to fill this vacancy would be a shameful abdication of one of the Senate's most essential Constitutional responsibilities.""On Monday, Johnson stood by his remarks, citing the position of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) -- all of whom also said Sunday that they wanted to wait until after the election.""Leader McConnell came out literally, within, I'm not even sure he took an hour, maybe two hours. And then Sen. Grassley, who's chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which would be the first hurdle any nominee would have to go through. And then Sen. Orrin Hatch also. All three came out basically saying the same thing,"" Johnson said in an interview with radio host Vicki McKenna.Johnson was a bit more defensive about his comments during a radio interview Tuesday on ""The Jerry Bader Show,"" trying to justify blocking a nominee and saying he'd be open to voting on someone.""Maybe I haven't quite heard exactly what Leader McConnell or Sen. Grassley has said, but ... from what I've heard and what I've also said is, our advice is that ... when the American people are going to be deciding the direction of the country, we should let them decide the direction of the Supreme Court as well,"" he said.""I've never said that I wouldn't vote, or that we shouldn't vote. ... I have no idea how the process plays out, I'm not in control of it. I'm not the majority leader, I'm not chairman of the Judiciary. By the time I would actually take the vote, if it comes to that, I'll take a vote,"" he added. In another interview Tuesday, as reported by ThinkProgress, Johnson also said he'd be open to an up-or-down vote on a nominee.""So put it up for a vote and vote an individual down,"" he said when radio host John Howell said Republicans might look like ""petulant children"" if they don't vote. ""I don’t think there’s much of a difference one way or another.""Johnson is one of the most vulnerable GOP senators up for re-election in 2016. Other at-risk senators, such as Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire and Richard Burr in North Carolina, have also said they'd like the next president to pick the nominee.This strategy carries risks in the elections, as Democrats, hoping to take back control of the Senate, gear up to paint the GOP as creating gridlock.""I would also say that doing nothing is also an action, kind of bolstering the advice that, let's let the American people decide through their vote who the next president is that should make that appointment,"" Johnson said Tuesday during the Bader interview. ""So again, I think it's blown way out of proportion, quite honestly, what the people have said.""Democrats have to defend only 10 seats in 2016, the residual benefit of the shellacking they took in 2010 when tea party Republicans swept into office. The GOP, meanwhile, needs to defend 24 -- and six of them are in states that Obama won twice. The two Democratic seats most at risk are in Nevada and Colorado.Johnson's Democratic opponent, Russ Feingold, said the Senate must ""do its job by working in a bipartisan way to vote on the nominee.""Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) broke from the talking points of his party Tuesday, saying Republicans risk being seen as ""obstructionist"" if they refuse to consider any Obama nominee. Grassley, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, recently said he hasn't ruled out a hearing for Obama's forthcoming Supreme Court nominee either.""I would wait until the nominee is made before I would make any decisions,” Grassley told reporters in a Tuesday morning interview. ""In other words, take it a step at a time.""Still, even if Obama does get a nominee to the floor for a vote, passage will be tough. He'll need the support of all 46 Democrats in the chamber plus another 14 Republicans.This piece has been updated with additional remarks by Johnson.Also on HuffPost:"

The target of Lane’s playful wrath continues to smile gamely through selfies with eager young women, all dressed in their rose ceremony best (lace bodycon dresses, teetering heels, sequins), as Lane gives Albers the finger. The semicircle of ladies gathered around Lane, in as many tight rows as an onion has layers, grows fidgety. “JJ, get down here,” one yells, grabbing at him. The “Bachelor” fans are here for charity, and they need their selfies.A few weeks ago, I thought I’d spend Valentine’s Day the normal way -- on the couch, ordering calorie-dense takeout and scrolling through the on-demand options for a few hours with my fiancé. Sometimes, though, duty calls. Duty doesn’t care about your brick oven pizza plans. When I heard tell of a New York City-area charity auction and watch party for the 20th anniversary “Bachelor” special hosted by Ashley Iaconetti (she of the teary lashes), I knew my night would be spent marinating in a -- er -- different kind of romantic atmosphere. Emma Gray, who co-hosts HuffPost’s “Bachelor” podcast “Here to Make Friends” with me, would be on a well-deserved vacation, so I would be repping the podcast alone, and I was ready.Without doubt, it would be the most fan-favorite-filled night in “Bachelor” history. Aside from Iaconetti, “Bachelorette” icons including Nick Viall, Jared Haibon, JJ Lane and Ben Zorn would be auctioning off a precious hour of their time to benefit THON, all while the year’s most adorable reality TV couple, Jade Roper and Tanner Tolbert, tied the knot on approximately 47 hi-def TVs all around the venue. I bought a ticket -- $65, to benefit charity. Cocktail attire was requested, perhaps in order to create a natural habitat for our “Bachelor” stars. I curled my hair and eyelashes and put on a dress I would describe as “from Urban Outfitters.” I also put on a coat I would describe as “enormous,” because it was 2 degrees out, and sallied forth. I had lip gloss in my purse. My heart was open. My “please come on HuffPost’s reality TV podcast” pitch was ready. “Can I steal you for a second?” hung on the tip of my tongue. This journey was just beginning.When I arrived, the first thing I noticed was the coat check. Several minutes later, I noticed the line for the coat check, which was not where I thought it was. The 45 minutes I ultimately spent in this line, while frustrating, especially as I did not arrive with a buddy to send off to the bar for coat check line drinks, did at least provide me with ample opportunity to scope out the crowd. It was very, very female. I saw a couple of men, who were pretty clearly attentive significant others or the advertised “Bachelorette” stars. But that’s hardly a surprise, given that the show is coded so female -- most women showed up in pairs or small gaggles, while it may be more embarrassing for even men who enjoy the show to admit to friends they’d like to go. Besides, Iaconetti was the only advertised gal on the auction block. At the event, she herself told Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan, the fashion bloggers known as the Fug Girls, that male fans often seem to watch the show along with their wives or girlfriends and approach her simply to say hi, not hit on her. For the Nicks and Joshes in the club, the fan attention leaned more carnal. A handful of the endless waves of women in attendance seemed like sweet, eager fans, fresh-faced in flat shoes and everyday hair, just looking for a moment with their favorites; the majority looked ready to volunteer for a sudden opening in one of the “Bachelor” limos. Professional blowouts and barrel curls bristled in every direction. The eyeliner game on display made me ashamed of my own half-hearted smoky eye. Dresses had been chosen to flaunt curves; heels for their pencil-slim height. Manicured hands clutched at rose-hued cocktails as necks craned searchingly, seeking any nearby “Bachelorette” heartthrob. When the “Bachelor” bachelor auction started, this attention became more focused, as all the semi-celebs were pulled up to the auction block. Nick Viall was entrusted with auctioning off his compatriots, starting with Ben Zorn, a clumsily hunky fan favorite who quickly sold for around $1,200, despite some confusion amongst the auctioneers about who was actually bidding and who was just being effusive. (This would be a problem throughout the night.) A lull followed, as Albers, Lane and Josh Murray went for prices in the high hundreds. Jared Haibon, the sweet bartender adored by viewers -- and Ashley Iaconetti -- modestly cracked a thousand. Michael Garofola, an NYC-based attorney, leveraged his purportedly cute new puppy to sell himself for over $5,000, as Iaconetti and Viall clearly began to feel a bit intimidated by the realness of the money being pledged. Iaconetti went up for auction, though I didn’t spot a single unattached man present except for those onstage. Her friend Haibon gallantly snatched her up for around $700, then stepped up to shill the inimitable Viall himself, a two-time ""Bachelorette"" runner-up, to the crowd. Not much shilling was needed, and the frenzied bidding war ultimately carried the prices up to an all-night high of $5,600. (I mean, he is a pretty decent conversationalist.)As the auction ended, the stars dutifully spread through the club, circulating among the non-auction winners for selfies (in her pre-event message, Iaconetti requested “as few retakes as possible”). Almost immediately, each man found himself the sun at the center of a tightly swirling solar system of squealing, iPhone-wielding women. A couple rows back, the ladies were more calm and calculated, scanning the room for a better Bachelor, or a Bachelor with a smaller crowd around him to penetrate, or just casually judging (“Ugh, I just don’t get it,” you’d hear in passing as a small gaggle of girls swept disdainfully past Haibon as he held court). In my personal life, I have a deeply socialized desire not to seem pushy or demanding that overcomes me at events like this. It’s partly why the aggressiveness of the other female fans present awes me. How did these women escape the near-universal messaging that men hate forwardness, that acting semi-predatory will seem grotesque and unladylike? Lane himself told me later that he actually relishes rejecting women who approach him, a satisfying reversal of the mating role he’s used to. Is the fandom of Bachelor Nation's women stronger than their socialization? Are they refusing to let their fears hold them back from what they want? Is society truly getting more equal? I put this complex anthropological question aside as I elbowed through a tight knot of women to introduce myself successively to Lane, Albers, Iaconetti, and Haibon. I was there to make professional contact. But also, I felt a little flutter of excitement in my stomach. I was actually seeing these people in real life. I mean, not that I care.Soon, the night started to wind down. The “Bachelor” alumni were scheduled to end the evening with 45 minutes of one-on-one time with their winning bidders in the VIP area at the back of the club, and the rest of us filtered out. Well, most of us. Viall told me the next day, as he and Lane joined me on the podcast, that his second-place bidder hung around meaningfully, waiting for him to finish his bought-and-paid-for date so she could whisk him away herself, despite the numerous requests to leave.  And it wasn’t just during the auction date -- watching “The Bachelor” had seemingly induced some bad habits all around. “Some women would come up,” Viall said, wincing, “and be like, ‘Hey, can I steal you…’ and I’d be like, ‘I can’t really leave.’” The ladies of NYC were there for their romantic meet-cute, one worthy of the show itself. (Actually, he emphasized, the vast majority of them were very nice and appreciative of their selfie moment and brief chat. For the record.) “Our lives suck,” joked Lane, who seemed simultaneously exhilarated and exhausted by the avalanche of female scrutiny and desire.Ah, to both long for and fear the demands of romantic attention from the opposite sex -- what's that's like? ""The Bachelor"" dudes might just be experiencing what it's like to be the hot girl at the bar, but more so, and as we all know, that's a position that's fraught with both benefits and serious drawbacks. But for Lane, Viall and co., there isn't much time to ponder this: They've got selfies to take.For more, check out Nick Viall and J.J. Lane on HuffPost's ""Here to Make Friends,"" along with a recap of this week's episode of ""The Bachelor"":Also on HuffPost:"

Well, most of us. Viall told me the next day, as he and Lane joined me on the podcast, that his second-place bidder hung around meaningfully, waiting for him to finish his bought-and-paid-for date so she could whisk him away herself, despite the numerous requests to leave.  And it wasn’t just during the auction date -- watching “The Bachelor” had seemingly induced some bad habits all around. “Some women would come up,” Viall said, wincing, “and be like, ‘Hey, can I steal you…’ and I’d be like, ‘I can’t really leave.’” The ladies of NYC were there for their romantic meet-cute, one worthy of the show itself. (Actually, he emphasized, the vast majority of them were very nice and appreciative of their selfie moment and brief chat. For the record.) “Our lives suck,” joked Lane, who seemed simultaneously exhilarated and exhausted by the avalanche of female scrutiny and desire.Ah, to both long for and fear the demands of romantic attention from the opposite sex -- what's that's like? ""The Bachelor"" dudes might just be experiencing what it's like to be the hot girl at the bar, but more so, and as we all know, that's a position that's fraught with both benefits and serious drawbacks. But for Lane, Viall and co., there isn't much time to ponder this: They've got selfies to take.For more, check out Nick Viall and J.J.

Still, BuzzFeed decided to share a quick reminder of this unbalanced side of the Internet.A man and woman did the same things on Periscope, a live streaming app, in a new video from BuzzFeed Yellow. After asking for suggestions on how to deal with a hangover and dancing, the participants in the video received distinct reactions from viewers.For his hangover, the man received recommendations like ""sleep it off"" and ""get your ass out of bed and suck it up."" As for feedback for the woman, one viewer completely ignored her request for suggestions and jumped right into, ""Are you lesbian?"" The woman, who also consistently had more viewers than the man, continued to receive comments about her appearance (and even demands) during her live stream such as ""show me boobs"" and ""remove your shrit [sic] babe.""At the end of the experiment, the man described the differences as ""very severe."" Sadly, the woman said the results weren't all that ""surprising.""""I didn't have to say anything interesting,"" she said. ""I didn't have to do anything to get attention, which kind of negates that I have a brain.""So would she give live streaming another shot? ""Probably not,"" she said.Also on HuffPost:"

Sebastian Goldman from the Hueytown Police Department in Alabama stopped by a Food Giant store, earlier this month, when he noticed that the 19-year-old employee who was helping him had wound duct tape around his worn-down shoe.With the rain coming down outside, Goldman was concerned that the teen would have to walk home with his taped shoe. So after he left, he bought the worker a brand new pair out of his own pocket and delivered them to the teen that day. The officer's beautiful gesture was documented by Facebook user Angela Roach Scory, who shared the good deed on social media.The teen, who wishes to remain anonymous, was extremely grateful for Goldman's kind act. “I just want to thank him, I shook his hand and everything, but I just want to thank him for what he did,” he told ABC33/40. Goldman was at the store buying food for jail inmates, AL.com reported. As the 19-year-old helped the corporal load up his car with groceries, Goldman asked about the teen's footwear. ""I looked at him and said, 'What's up with duct tape?''' the law enforcement member told AL.com. ""Is that something all the kids are doing? A fashion statement?""The corporal discovered that the teen's shoes had split while he was working and taped the shoe together to hold him over until pay day, when he could purchase a new pair, ABC33/40 reported. But before he left, Goldman asked the teen for his shoe size, AL.com reported. After dropping food off to the inmates, Goldman took a trip to a shoe store and then brought the new pair to the unsuspecting employee.""I said, 'Man, here you go. I didn't know payday was Friday or two weeks from now,''' Goldman told AL.com, recalling the interaction with the teen. ""He said, 'What do I owe you?' and I told him to just pay it forward.""The teen was far from the only one completely taken aback by Goldman's compassion.

31,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders In 2013: 'I'm Not Obama's Biggest Fan',Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-obama-fan_us_56c3a95ce4b08ffac126f1ed,The senator maintained his distance back then.,2016-02-16,Do you think the White House remembers remarks like that?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_27_36_4610_2768%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"President Barack Obama has tried his best to be diplomatic about which candidate in the Democratic presidential primary he thinks hews closer to his agenda. But at a press conference on Tuesday, he tipped his hand a bit.Speaking in southern California, Obama made the now-rote point that the differences between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are far narrower than those between Democrats and Republicans. But he added that he knows Clinton better (from her time as secretary of state) and suspects that ""on certain issues, she agrees with me more than Bernie does.""Obama quickly noted that ""there may be a couple of areas where Bernie agrees with me more."" But it seemed more like an effort to prevent a bad headline than a full-throated endorsement.And that gets to a larger point. Veterans of this White House don't feel particularly invested in boosting Sanders. They feel that way because the Vermont senator wasn't always there to boost them. The latest evidence of that was passed along to The Huffington Post at the same time that Obama was speaking. It's a video from an April 2013 episode of ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" on which Sanders was a guest.The topic turned to the economic recovery, which at the time remained relatively slow. Maher, however, was incredulous that Republicans (in this case, columnist Stephen Moore) were acting appalled after having been apologists for Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush. Sanders agreed. But he wanted to burnish his credentials first.""I'm not Obama's biggest fan,"" he explained. ""I supported him, I'm an independent, but I'm critical of many aspects. When Obama came to office, there were 700,000 people a month who were losing their jobs. A month. So to say that 88,000 is not good, yeah, but compared to what.""This was not some new philosophical terrain for Sanders. He regularly argued that Obama didn't do enough to spur economic growth or address income inequality. And he has consistently argued that Obama was too keen on negotiating with Republicans when they were simply bad-faith negotiators. The comment to Maher doesn't mean that Sanders was nothing but a critic of Obama. As Sanders' campaign spokesman Michael Briggs noted, the two have ""worked together on many issues,"" including reforming veterans' health care and supporting community health centers. Obama campaigned for Sanders in 2006, and Sanders supported Obama after the primary season concluded in 2008 (as well as 2012). ""Bernie considers the president a good friend,"" said Briggs. ""They've had differences, of course, but not nearly as many as Hillary Clinton had with Obama when she ran against him for president in 2008 and called Obama's foreign policy views 'naive.'"" (The last point refers to Clinton's 2008 criticism of Obama's pledge to negotiate with America's enemies without preconditions.) But it was the language that Sanders used to make his point to Maher -- ""I'm not Obama's biggest fan"" and ""I'm critical of many aspects"" -- that rankled White House aides. And in a Democratic primary where fidelity to Obama is proving to be a big asset, that is language that could come back to haunt him."
32,POLITICS,This Video Proves That Bernie Sanders Fans Will Do Just About Anything To See Him,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-michigan_us_56c354ffe4b08ffac1269393,Thousands of Sanders supporters waited in the freezing rain to see him in Michigan.,2016-02-16,It was a full house in Michigan on Monday when Bernie Sanders came to town.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c357171900002900377c8c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"YPSILANTI, Michigan -- It’s one thing to hear official attendance tallies touted by a campaign -- 15,000 in Seattle, 18,000 in Denver, 28,000 in Portland. It’s another thing entirely to see that mass of humanity huddled together on the side of a road on a frigid Michigan day. But that was the spectacle on Monday, when the Bernie Sanders campaign came through Ypsilanti, a college town adjacent to Ann Arbor and just beyond the western suburbs of Detroit.Michigan holds a key primary on March 8. For Sanders, the independent Vermont senator seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, the visit was a chance to show his support extends beyond Iowa and New Hampshire, where he spent months building a movement, handshake by handshake, and where typical Democratic voters are both older and whiter than the party’s base as a whole.The turnout was certainly impressive. He spoke at Eastern Michigan University’s Convocation Center and the line at one point extended for about half a mile outside, as the above video, uploaded by Tom Masuga of Ann Arbor, makes clear -- even though the temperature was 29 degrees and a light sleet made it feel at least 10 degrees colder. The Sanders campaign said 9,400 people filled the center. That’s the arena’s official capacity and, given that nearly every seat was full, the count seemed about right.In one respect, the demographics were predictable. Sanders has drawn his most enthusiastic support from young people. According to polls, voters under 30 broke for Sanders over Hillary Clinton by 70 points in Iowa. Among the thousands who attended Monday’s rally, I spotted maybe a few dozen who appeared to be older than 30 -- including Secret Service and the guy in the mirror when I went to the restroom.But the audience was ethnically and racially diverse, including plenty of African-Americans -- a key constituency in Michigan and, of course, the Democratic Party as a whole. Sanders spent plenty of time Monday addressing issues on the minds of black Michigan voters. He started his speech by talking about the lead contamination of water in Flint, and some residents he had met there a few hours earlier.Sanders and his rival for the nomination, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have vied to demonstrate concern for the people of Flint. Clinton has been endorsed by Flint’s mayor, Democrat Karen Weaver, who said she was the first candidate to reach out and ask how she could help. The Democrats will be debating in Flint on March 6, two days before the state holds its primary.“It is beyond my comprehension that in the year 2016, in the United States of America, we are poisoning our children,” Sanders said. He spoke about his vision for repairing the nation’s infrastructure, including its public water systems, and got a huge round of applause when he called for the resignation of Michigan’s governor, Republican Rick Snyder.Later, Sanders invoked the Civil Rights movement and spoke about how activists reacted to the church bombings in Birmingham, Alabama -- both to emphasize his commitment to building an inclusive society, and to demonstrate that mass political movements can challenge the establishment and change public policy. “They stood up for human rights, that’s courage,” Sanders said. “When you think today is a tough struggle, think about Birmingham, Alabama. Think about the people who stood up. If they could do it then, we could do it today.”Sanders challenged Clinton’s narrative that he wouldn’t do as well in states like Michigan, whose electorates are less old and white, by arguing that his campaign would continue to beat expectations.“When we began, we were 30 points down in New Hampshire. Didn’t quite turn out that way,” Sanders said. “When we began, we were way down in Michigan. It ain’t going to turn out that way.”Samantha Lachman contributed reporting from Washington, D.C.Also on HuffPost:"

But he said during a news conference in South Carolina on Monday that the party has broken the agreement by packing the weekend debate audience with party loyalists who booed him and for failing to condemn Sen. Ted Cruz' intensifying attacks. “I signed a pledge but it’s a double-edge pledge, and as far as I’m concerned they’re in default,"" Trump said of the Republican National Committee. ""That means the other side can do what they have to do.""Before his pledge, Trump threatened repeatedly to run against Republicans if the party didn't get behind him. In August, he refused to rule out an independent bid during a GOP debate and has since hinted several times that it wouldn't be off the table should he lose the Republican nomination.Trump also threatened on Monday to file a lawsuit against Cruz (R-Texas) challenging his eligibility for president unless Cruz stops running ads containing what Trump called ""lies."" Trump has taken issue with Cruz ads suggesting he's in favor of abortion rights, Obamacare and gun control.""If Ted is going to continue to lie with such desperation, I have no choice but to fight back,"" Trump said in a statement. ""One of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President. If he doesn’t take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately.""The Guardian noted Trump's threats come at an odd time, considering he has a commanding lead in South Carolina just days ahead of the primary on Saturday.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
