Scott Walker speaks during the Freedom Summit in Des Moines, Iowa. Shifting his focus to Washington, Walker is expanding his political operation as he fights for early momentum in the increasingly crowded field of GOP White House prospects. The two-term Republican governor will address a Washington audience for the first time this year on Friday afternoon, (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e691739230000d11a0c2528.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) on Friday continued to dance around controversial comments made by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.Asked whether he agreed with Giuliani's contention that President Barack Obama doesn't love America, a remark made at a private dinner for Walker in New York, the governor said, ""I don't really know what his opinions are on that one way or another.""“I assume most people in this country love America,"" he told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in an interview in Washington, D.C. ""And to me I don’t think it’s worth getting into the battle over whether he does or he doesn’t. He can handle that himself. I know I do.""""And I know there are great people in this country who love this country and who ... feel this country’s exceptional and it doesn’t necessarily align by party,"" he added. ""I think there are Republicans and Democrats and plenty of people in between. I’ve never asked the president so I don’t really know what his opinions are on that one way or another.”Walker also punted on the matter earlier this week when he told CNBC, ""I'm in New York. I'm used to people saying things that are aggressive.""Walker's response stands in sharp contrast to some of his potential rivals for the GOP presidential nomination. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said earlier this week that he had ""no doubt"" that Obama loves America, ""but I just think his policies are bad for our nation."" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul took a similar approach. The prospective White House hopeful told a CNN affiliate on Friday that while he disagreed with Obama's policies, he felt that it was a ""mistake to question people's motives.""Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is also contemplating jumping into the presidential race, said that he doesn't ""question [the president's] patriotism or love for our country."""
1,POLITICS,3 Reasons Why Americans Should Be Cautious of $2 Gas Prices,"Patrick Donohoe, ContributorFinancial Strategist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-reasons-why-americans-s_b_6693626.html,"Though falling gas prices are affording Americans some financial breathing room, the dramatic drop is in no way an indication that we are approaching utopia.",2015-02-20,"A customer refuels his automobile with 95 octane fuel at the fuel pump of an OAO Gazprom Neft gas station in Belgrade, Serbia, on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2015. Serbia sold a 51 percent stake in NIS to Gazprom Neft for 400 million euros ($536 million) in 2009, when the company had 993.8 million euros in capital. Photographer: Oliver Bunic/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e8d0240000310057781b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I must say, filling up my 20 gallon gas tank for $35 instead of $65 feels kind of nice. I know I'm not alone in feeling the price ease -- Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have been inundated with #GasPrices photos. Regardless of the gas price burden being lifted, the economist in me is going crazy. Low gas prices could result in some unintended and painful consequences. My advice? Be optimistically cautious.Over the last few months, I have been perplexed at the speed in which oil prices have shot through the floor. Barrels are transacting as low as $46. Though everyone, including myself, is enjoying the extra spending money, gas price reduction should be considered with caution. Here are three reasons why the low gas prices are not all they're cracked up to be:  1. Gasoline ""Savings"" Is a MythA few years ago I watched a fascinating PBS documentary titled Mind over Money. In the documentary, NOVA presented a very telling experiment exposing the irrational human behavior around money decisions (pbs.com).In this special, several couples were interviewed and asked the following question: ""If you were given the choice to receive $100 in one year or $102 in one year and one day, which option would you take?"" The blanket response amongst those interviewed, was they would wait the extra day for the $2. The same couples were then presented with the same scenario, but with a simple change in time period. They were asked, ""Would you take $100 today or $102 tomorrow?"" The response shifted 180 degrees. Everyone answered ""yes"" to taking the $100 immediately.According to the documentary, the rational choice in both scenarios would have been to wait for the extra money. However, the second scenario illustrates an individual's logic being clouded with what behavioral economists call, present-bias (making an incorrect choice that your future self would have preferred to not make). Like the experiment on NOVA, the gasoline ""savings"" euphoria is due to people's present-bias. For example, the so-called gas savings that is underway is based on a projected annual savings of about $500 per year for the average family if they purchased the same amount of gasoline (US Energy Information Administration, EIA.com).However, data from Cardlytics show that consumption of gasoline by the average American has risen six percent, in addition to an overall increase in spending at about four percent (cnbc.com). Although, Cardlytics states that the average savings per person, per month is $18, the same report also included the surprising spike in other consumer spending by $45 per month. The $500 per year in gas savings becomes obsolete, considering consumer spending in restaurant and retail categories is on the rise. In reality, if Americans are spending $45 more per month, instead of saving $500 per year, they're actually spending $540 per year! This is present-bias proof of the emotional mind trumping the logical mind when it comes to money. 2. Green Tech Innovation HaltedInstead of building more green technology, like fuel-efficient automobiles, low gas prices are causing the making of hybrid and electric vehicles to decrease. At one time, the purchase of popular vehicles like the Prius, Ford C-Max and the Honda Civic Hybrid were the highest sold vehicles in states like California. Since gas prices have dropped, those car companies have been hit with a double digit decrease in sales.Americans are justifying the purchase of gas guzzlers because gas is now less expensive. Professor of energy economics, Chris Knittel, told the L.A. Times, ""People are less likely to adopt more fuel-efficient vehicles, and companies have less incentive to invest in new technologies."" (LATimes.com) 3. The Tax Still Man ComethAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, ¢42.52 is the average tax per gallon of gas (which includes federal tax of ¢18.4 and state tax of ¢24.12). (EIA.gov)Since gas prices have plummeted, the federal government and several states have jumped on the opportunity to raise their respective per gallon tax. Senator Corker (R, Tennessee) has proposed a ¢12 per gallon hike from the ¢18.4 -- that is over a 65 percent increase (Washingtonpost.com). Many other states like, North Carolina, Utah, Michigan and Wisconsin, are looking to increase the per gallon tax anywhere from ¢.05 to ¢.20. Though falling gas prices are affording Americans some financial breathing room, the dramatic drop is in no way an indication that we are approaching utopia. To stay ahead of the curve and keep yourself financially free from swift economic turns, I suggest spending with an alert fiscal conscience. Taxes and inflation already rob the majority of us of our hard-earned money, let's not allow the mask of low gas prices do the same."
2,IMPACT,"Here's Who Is Helping Women Forced Into Prostitution, Teen Pregnancy During Ebola Outbreak",Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ebola-teen-pregnancy_n_6709404.html,,2015-02-20,"MONROVIA, LIBERIA - AUGUST 15: A girl sits on a fishing boat in the seaside favella of West Point on August 15, 2014 in Monrovia, Liberia. Poor sanitation and close living quarters have contributed to the spead of the Ebola virus, which is transmitted through bodily fluids. The epidemic has killed more than 1,000 people in four West African countries. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1d514240000500096e4b8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.N. is optimistic that West Africa can hit zero Ebola cases by mid-April, but vulnerable girls in the region are facing a new debilitating epidemic -- a spike in teen pregnancy and prostitution. Due to prolonged school closings and widespread deaths of parents and caregivers, girls in Sierra Leone and Liberia -- two of the hardest-hit regions -- have become more susceptible to sexual exploitation and experts say it’s up to on-the-ground agencies to better protect them.""Our children are out selling in the community, helping their family to get food,"" a Liberian mother who declined to give her name told Plan International, an aid group that supports impoverished children. ""Some of the younger girls will soon start prostitution, because we can’t control the children if we can’t provide for them."" To gauge the scope of the issue, Plan International dispensed research teams to communities in Liberia to interview more than 740 children, parents and community leaders. The organization learned that poor girls in the Ebola-stricken area, particularly those who have lost family members to the epidemic, are at a heightened risk of rape, prostitution, teen pregnancy and child marriage. Though Liberia has made concerted efforts in recent years to curb sexual assaults, going so far as to open a court that specializes in rape cases, the country has seen a rise in rape since the Ebola outbreak hit, AllAfrica reported last month. In Sierra Leone, a number of factors have led to its rise in teen pregnancy.In an interview with Ebola Deeply, Sierra Leone's first lady, Sia Nyama Koroma, said that teen pregnancy has ""worsened"" since the outbreak struck. According to Matthew Dalling, UNICEF's head of child protection in Sierra Leone, the country is experiencing a surge in ""transactional sex,"" he told AFP. While it’s not quite prostitution, desperate people are trading sex for something they desperately need, for example, some bread or a mobile phone. ""It's hard to estimate how much [teen pregnancy] has increased, but combined with the levels of vulnerability, the lack of schools, the impossibility of going anywhere, it makes sense that it must be growing,"" Dalling told the news outlet. Plan International attributed such spikes in Liberia to a number of factors.Girls who have lost parents and caregivers also have lost the protectors that once helped to shield them from sexual attacks. They’re also often expected to take on the role of caretaker and find ways to support the family, which often means resorting to prostitution. Some families have sent their kids to areas that are safe from Ebola, but not sexual assault. A Liberian father told Plan International that he thought he made a judicious choice by sending his daughter to another area to stay with her uncle, but someone in that community raped her. Experts agree that the key to preventing sexual exploitation is improved education access. More than a million children are out of school in Sierra Leone, according to AFP, and classes are set to resume in March. While schools reopened in Liberia on Monday, advocates are concerned that many children won’t resume their studies because they either can’t afford the fees or they feel obligated to help support their families, Plan said in a statement. An elementary school student in Liberia, for example, pays 6,755 Liberian dollars (about $80).Alex Wou, acting principal of St Lawrence Catholic School in Nimba County, Liberia, said he expects no more than half of students to come back. Plan International has urged the country and its school system to investigate different means of financing students’ return to school. To keep kids in Sierra Leone engaged in their studies, UNICEF partnered with the government in October to launch a radio educational program. The hour-long lessons are broadcast on 41 stations, and about half of households surveyed have gotten involved, according to NPR. To help curb the teen pregnancy rates, and support young people who have gotten pregnant, Koroma has committed to partnering with agencies and government ministries. She’s also connecting girls with services that offer birth control, she told Ebola Deeply. ""It’s frustrating, but I am not going to relent,"" she said. ""I will keep using all my powers to advocate for girls’ and women’s empowerment, and the first step is to reduce teenage pregnancy rates."" Like Us On Facebook   Follow Us On Twitter  "
3,EDUCATION,No Child Left in Isolation,"Randy Miller, ContributorTeacher & Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/no-child-left-in-isolatio_b_6710294.html,"If you want to close achievement gaps between poor students of color and their wealthier white counterparts, you must reduce the high levels of socioeconomic isolation in urban communities.",2015-02-20,Side profile of students standing in line for a school bus,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5babe5483c000066000aff82.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just about any discussion about No Child Left Behind is a contentious one. Discussions about the viability of the program will likely happen in Congress this year. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the issue of how money is spent will be central to any discussion. Unfortunately any congressional discussions over Title I spending and its impact on the academic gains of economically disadvantaged students will be more of the same because that's the status quo; discussions about patch work solutions instead of attacking the root of the problem. That is because Congress, much like our nation, is not ready or willing to have a discussion on what it will really take to close achievement gaps.Title I funding is the money allocated to low-income school districts in their attempts to close academic achievement gaps between whites and the economically disadvantaged non-white. Many on the right side of the political aisle favor of portable Title I funds. That is funding children instead of schools; wealthier school districts would be in line to receive Title I funding if they had economically disadvantaged students on the rolls. Those left-leaning legislators are naturally opposed to portable funds, citing that money will be taken from poorer school districts, who need it, to be given to wealthier districts, who don't need it as much. The fear is tipping the scales even more against low-income students. It's safe to think that people don't want to see poor students of color put at an even further disadvantage academically, but who can argue that the current way we do things is working effectively? The system as is currently constructed is a well-oiled machine when it comes to producing what we already have. But who wants more of that?Yet, we're unsure if portability would really impact those students in high poverty schools; students who attend schools where a majority of their classmates are also poor. But does giving high poverty districts more money change the fact that the majority of these student are poor? Does it change the neighborhoods that these students live in or the experiences that they have in those neighborhoods as a result of their socioeconomic isolation? If you want to close achievement gaps between poor students of color and their wealthier white counterparts, you must reduce the high levels of socioeconomic isolation in urban communities. One way to do that is not necessarily throwing more money into school districts that serve this category of students, or simply moving students to wealthier districts and sending Title I funds with them. What it will really take is to actually reduce, if not eradicate, poverty in poverty centers, specifically areas with high concentrations of poverty. And so the million dollar question is how to rid poverty where there is poverty? If I had the answer, maybe I'd be a politician. But when it comes to this matter of socioeconomic isolation's impact on the educational outcomes of children of color, people tend to fall into one of two camps. One is either a culturalist, emphasizing the importance of self-perpetuating norms and behaviors, or a structuralist, emphasizing the role of white privilege and institutional racism's impact on economic circumstance. Regardless of what side of the ledger you fall on, it is irrefutable that your philosophical view shapes any solution you may bring to the table. If you lean hard on the culturalist side of the ledger, you may believe in the ""culture"" of poverty, you may think institutions, like society, are colorblind and that any man, woman or child can succeed if they simply work hard and carry themselves according to the Protestant ethic. If you lean hard on the structuralist side of the ledger, you may believe that white supremacy shapes most, if not all, of the institutions and experiences within our nation's borders, and that there is an eternal struggle between the excellence of people of color and white mediocrity -- more victories being held by the latter. If you fall hard on either side, and you take those hard stances into the urban classroom or in the meeting rooms when discussing education policy, be assured that no one will ever accuse you of ending poverty. With that frame of thinking, it is impossible. Hard stances like that set people of color up for failure.What is needed in any educational discussion regarding poor children of color is a philosophical balance which accounts for the truths offered by both perspectives. Unfortunately, such discussions are often led by those with a culturalist point of view. But here is a news flash for white lawmakers; people of color, particularly those among the poor, tend to have strong work ethics, they tend to not make excuses and they believe in accountability for themselves and their children. These are lessons shared in black and Latino households daily. Maybe white lawmakers should consider things beyond the control of blacks and Latinos in high poverty areas; the fact that federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, amounting to $15,080 per year. According to the 2014 guidelines, the poverty line for a family of three is $19,790 per year. Or, the fact that women only get paid 78 cents to every dollar a man makes (64 cents for Black women and 56 cents for Latinas); there are a lot of female led single-family households in high poverty areas. Or, maybe, the fact that average cost of childcare for an infant in the United States is a little more than $800 per month. These things are not issues of culture, but rather they are institutional and structural hindrances for many residents of high poverty areas. For the Conservatives, portability is about injecting market forces and choice in public education. Maybe they and others should consider facilitating market changes to inject economic sustainability in the lives of low income public education parents. Maybe then, we could honestly say that no child is being left behind."
4,FIFTY,5 Reasons Cold Weather Is Actually Good For You,Ann Brenoff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reasons-to-love-cold-weather_n_6710160.html,,2015-02-20,thermometer in the snow with temperature below zero degree Celsius,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6703b200000c7010121f0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Record low temperatures are predicted for more than six dozen locations across the East. Single-digit temperatures are possible in Georgia and Tennessee. Wind chills will be in the teens in Florida. And February seems hell-bent on convincing the last global-warming denier that something weird is going on. But it got us thinking -- OK, desperately looking for -- is there a silver lining to all this? Could it really be that we keep better in the cold? Here are five reasons why maybe -- just maybe -- the cold is good for something:1. Cold weather may help you lose weight. As we age, our metabolism slows and we tend to gain weight. Well the good news is that there are two types of fat in the human body: white fat and brown fat. The brown fat is the heat-producing, calorie-burning fat that babies need to regulate their body temperatures, said the Harvard Health Letter. Most of our brown fat disappears with age, but PET scans have shown that we retain some of it. And guess what? When we are cold, our bodies fire up those brown fat cells to keep us warm and we burn more calories.2. Cold weather can be good for what hurts you. In some countries, the use of cold temperatures for medical purposes is taken quite seriously. Finnish researchers reported the results of a study of 10 women who took cold-water plunges (20 seconds in water just above freezing) for three months and submitted to whole-body cryotherapy sessions. The women's blood showed a two- to three-fold jump in norepinephrine levels after exposure to the cold water. Norepinephrine is a chemical in the nervous system that wears many hats, including having a role in pain suppression, according to the Harvard report.While being outside in cold weather is different than whole body cryotherapy (and may not have the same effect), in Japan, this ""cold"" therapy has been used to treat pain and inflammation from rheumatic and other medical conditions for about 30 years. Patients typically spend up to three minutes in a room cooled to -166 degrees. Even post-50 celebrities like Demi Moore have tried it.Think about it: Ice has long been considered nature's anesthesia. It numbs our injuries and reduces swelling. 3. Cold weather may improve your sex life. A National Institutes of Health report found that testosterone levels in men spike in the autumn and again in February; the levels drop during the warm summer months.  So the colder it is, the higher the testosterone. While testosterone isn't the only fuel for a man's sex drive, low testosterone can reduce the ability to have satisfying sex. Now combine that seasonal surge of testosterone with the idea that frigid temperatures tend to keep us house-bound. Not everybody is binge-watching TV. 4. Cold kills disease-mongering insects. Harvard Health says that cold temperatures may actually be performing a great public health service: They kill off disease-mongering insects and microorganisms. One of the big worries about climate change is that winter will lose its pestilence-fighting punch.5. Cold weather has been linked to living longer. In a study published in Cell, researchers from the University of Michigan discovered that worms exposed to cold temperatures had a genetic response that triggered longer life spans. In 2006, scientists at the Scripps Research Institute found that reducing the core body temperature of mice extended their lifespan by up to 20 percent. And a Stony Brook University study in 2009 found that while mussels in the warm waters of Spain lived only 29 years, mussels in frigid Russian waters lived upward of two centuries. Of course the leap from simple organisms to humans is a big one requiring more research.But before anyone moves to a colder climate, it’s important to remember the toll that cold weather can take. Yes there is a darker side. Studies have shown that death rates are higher this time of year. Blood pressure increases in the winter. And flu season is a wintertime event because flu viruses spread faster when the air is dry and chilly. Plus if it's too cold out, we tend to stay indoors and get less sun exposure, which means less vitamin D. All of which makes the case for California dreaming.

Rent Your Gear in Advance Some rental shops encourage customers to commit to renting their gear in advance by offering 15- to 25-percent discounts if you reserve your gear online before getting there. Not only will you get cheaper skis and boards, but you and your group can avoid the hassle of filling out paperwork in the shop as you sweat through your turtleneck.In fact, in many ski areas, you can skip the lines completely and have an affordable ski package delivered directly to you from great companies like Black Tie Ski Rentals.2. Bring Your Own Lunch This is a time-honored tactic of the thrifty skier.Next time you hit the slopes, consider stopping by a grocery store beforehand and whipping up a sammy or two. You'll find that a square sandwich will fit perfectly in most of your pockets.Pro Tip: When ordering your sandwich, avoid adding the mustard and mayo as it could get seriously messy in your jacket or pack! When it's time for lunch, simply grab some free condiment packets from the mountain grill and enjoy.3.

Perhaps you were raised in one religion, but now, you feel drawn to explore the other religion.",2015-02-20,"'A Hanukkah menorah and a Christmas tree together, symbolizing an interfaith holiday season. Focus is on the Christmas tree.'",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fb6c250000cf003a0df8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Imagine for a moment that you are a teenager, arriving at college for your first year, and that you come from an interfaith family. Perhaps you were raised in one religion, but now, you feel drawn to explore the other religion in your family background. Or perhaps you were raised with both religions, and plan to stay connected to both. Or perhaps you were raised with neither religion, but now plan to explore both family religions, or all religions.Now, imagine you are handed a survey and asked to choose one religion, and only one religion, as your identity. Your only other choices are to choose ""none,"" or ""other religion,"" or to skip the question altogether.I went through this thought experiment as I read ""The American Freshman,"" an annual report released earlier this month, based on a survey of more than 150,000 college freshmen in the annual CIRP (Cooperative Institutional Research Program) survey, produced by the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) at UCLA. The survey only allows students to pick one religion as their ""religious preference."" I suggest that as a result of this restriction, the researchers are missing an opportunity to better understand the changing landscape of American religious identity. As summarized recently by Robert P. Jones of the Public Religion Research Institute, that landscape includes the following: one in five Americans is religiously unaffiliated, a quarter of the unaffiliated still see themselves as religious, one in six Americans follow the teachings or practices of more than one religion, and about one quarter have a spouse or partner of another religious background.This year's American Freshman survey found that nearly 28 percent of the students chose ""none"" as their religious preference, up from some 15 percent in 1971. And yet, more than 16 percent of these ""religious nones"" in 2014 rated their own spirituality as ""above average"" or in the highest ten percent. I asked Kevin Eagan, the director of the survey, for additional information on the students who came from interfaith families. In 1973, about 22 percent of students reported having parents with two different religions or denominations (or having one parent with no religion). By 2014, almost 30 percent had such ""religiously discordant"" parents. When I asked whether the researchers had considered allowing students to check more than one religious preference, Eagan replied in an email: ""Unlike race/ethnicity, we have not heard feedback from students or institutions that respondents have felt boxed in by restricting them to just one preference for religion."" I can only reply that both my college-student daughter and my college-bound son do feel boxed in, as do I. And based on the college students I surveyed and interviewed for Being Both, my book on interfaith families, I suspect we're not the only ones.I also asked Eagan what he thought of the idea that students from interfaith families would check ""none"" if they could not check more than one box. ""I would think that students who wanted to check multiple religions would either skip the question entirely (i.e., be coded as missing data) or choose the option of 'other religion' rather than choose 'none,'"" Eagan wrote me.As someone who claims an identity formed by both my Jewish and my Christian heritage, I would not choose ""other religion,"" a category that seems designed for Sikhs or Jains or Pagans. Interfaith is not a religion: it is an identity based on the synergy and symbiosis of two distinct family religions. Often, those of us honoring both family religions are accused of trying to form a new religion. In order to avoid feeding this kind of concern, I would make a point of not checking the ""other religion"" box. My 18-year-old son says, ""At least checking 'other' sends the message that they need to expand their options."" But does it send that message?The choice to just skip the question creates the unfortunate result that people with complex religious identities from interfaith families will not be counted or included in the study results on religious identity. And we are tired of not counting. I agree that some students might just skip this question since there would be no way to express their true religious preferences within the parameters of the survey. My argument is that by allowing them to check more than one box, researchers would be able to gather data to better understand the religious identity of these students.Why would students who feel connected to more than one religion choose ""none""? Those of us who are interfaith children grow up hearing ""you can't be both"" and ""if you try to do both, you're really nothing,"" and being told that clergy, or religious texts, do not accept the existence of interfaith families. A survey that does not allow students to check two or more religion boxes, but does allow them to check ""none,"" effectively steers respondents from interfaith families to the ""none"" box. And yet, this is clearly an uncomfortable box for interfaith children who celebrate more than one religion. My 18-year-old son explains, "" 'None' strips you of your religion. They're saying that because you don't fit into one of our categories, you can't have any religion."" There's a simple solution to all of this. Allow students to check more than one box. Allow them to check both Buddhist and Jewish. Allow them to check, whether or not you agree that it is a valid choice, Jewish and Catholic. The results will be more complex, perhaps harder to summarize. And more true."

(Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e9b61f00004002257a9b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The biggest economic policy fight of 2015 is creating serious headaches for congressional Democrats, and particularly Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).As the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Wyden is the party's point-man on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a controversial free trade pact the Obama administration is negotiating with 11 other Pacific nations. President Barack Obama and Republican leaders broadly support the deal, saying it will expand economic growth. But many Democrats in Congress and liberal organizations oppose it, concerned that it could exacerbate income inequality, undermine key regulations and reward regimes that abuse human rights.The deal is also not popular among Democratic voters. On Thursday, the liberal group Democracy for America released a Public Policy Polling survey that found significant discontent with the TPP deal in Wyden's home state of Oregon. When Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) announced a hearing on tariff standards early Friday, Wyden's office responded with a statement saying it cannot support even holding a policy hearing on trade issues, given the current state of negotiations. ""Today’s hearing announcement is premature,"" Wyden spokesman Keith Chu said in the statement. ""There is no agreement on Trade Promotion Authority, or other aspects of the legislative trade agenda more broadly. Sen. Wyden is continuing to fight for more transparency, more oversight and provisions to ensure American workers come first in our trade policy.""Trade Promotion Authority -- or ""fast-track,"" as it is also known -- would strip Congress of its ability to amend any trade agreement inked by the Obama administration. Every president since Richard Nixon has enjoyed such powers, but the authority has become increasingly controversial since the Clinton years. While many conservative activists oppose TPA, Republican leaders, including House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), support it.""TPA is not granting authority to an executive branch,"" Ryan told reporters last week. ""TPA is Congress asserting its authority in the early stages of a trade negotiation, telling the [administration] what a trade bill needs to look like, what are the guidelines and how they have to continually consult with the legislature throughout the entire process.""TPP talks are not in their ""early stages,"" however. Obama has been pursuing the pact for years, and U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman says the deal is close to being finalized. Congress has not yet voted on a fast-track bill presenting negotiation instructions.Many members of Congress are frustrated that talks thus far have not reflected their concerns. On Thursday, five co-chairs of the LGBT caucus sent Obama a letter expressing dismay at the administration's inclusion of Brunei in the negotiations, as that the regime is implementing a Sharia penal code that punishes LGBT people with execution by stoning. Nearly 18 months ago, 119 House members and 10 senators raised similar objections. In a January Senate Finance Committee hearing, both Republicans and Democrats lamented that the Obama administration had not pursued TPP terms to curb currency manipulation, despite years of input from lawmakers.TPP likely cannot pass without fast-track authority. Since the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over trade policy, Wyden, more than any other Democrat, holds sway over what will be included in a fast-track bill, and ultimately whether the TPP can clear the Senate.Sabrina Siddiqui contributed reporting."

But, it's precisely for those reasons that while I'll be the first to talk about the problems in the series, you won't see me complaining about the franchise.",2015-02-20,"LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - FEBRUARY 12: Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan attends the UK Premiere of 'Fifty Shades Of Grey' at Odeon Leicester Square on February 12, 2015 in London, England. (Photo by Julian Parker/UK Press via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafd6ec2400003100551a9f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a lifestyle kinkster, educator and founder of Touch of Flavor, I understandably have mixed feelings about Fifty Shades of Grey. But with all the kinksters bashing the books, including here on the Huffington Post, (and here), it would probably surprise you that I think the Fifty Shades franchise has been beneficial, both for the BDSM community and the general population. Why the difference in opinion? Because as an educator, I work with the general public, an entirely different segment of the population than the one most of the professional dominants and submissives providing opinions for these articles deal with.Shortly after Fifty Shades came out, I was having a discussion with Susan Wright from the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom. Susan is a household name in the BDSM community, and has dedicated an enormous amount of her to life fighting for acceptance and freedom for people involved in the BDSM lifestyle. When our discussion turned to the book, she told me: ""This is the BDSM communities' Stonewall, and no one even got hurt.""That quote has stuck with me because it's true. Like any minority community, the BDSM community has a history of being misunderstood and persecuted. Not so long ago, the only place to meet like-minded people was in back rooms at seedy bars with a referral and a secret knock. Admitting to, or worse yet, indulging in, the kinky fantasies that so many of us have would have resulted in you being ostracized and could have resulted in you losing your job, your children or even being institutionalized or arrested.Nowadays? There's a thriving BDSM community in almost every large metro area. People meet for munches and discussions at restaurants, kink events are booked in upscale hotels and venues catering to kink are operating -- legally -- out in the open. I've been in the community long enough to see much of that change, and while most kinksters will agree that the rise of Internet social networking is largely responsible for our community's growth, surprisingly few are willing to admit that Fifty Shades of Grey has done more for our acceptance in the mainstream than any other single factor.And it's not hard to figure out why. Research has shown that lots of people harbor some fantasies that could be considered kinky. The Fifty Shades franchise gave people who would never have otherwise been exposed to BDSM a framework for those fantasies, and made them realize kink was something they might be interested in. When you have books that have sold over 100 million copies (we're talking Twilight and Harry Potter territory here) and a movie breaking February box office records, it becomes clear that those of us interested in kink aren't a minority at all. And the general public has realized it as well. Kink has become an everyday topic of conversation. Women's Health is giving tips on how to tie up and spank your partner, floggers are popping up at sex stores and on Amazon, we're seeing Dom shirts at our local mall and celebrities being suspended in music videos. Fifty Shades has probably set us ahead ten years in terms of acceptance.The hatred for the franchise from the kink community doesn't surprise me; I understand it. Even though Fifty Shades has given us a huge boost in terms of acceptance, the relationship between the two main characters isn't healthy or an accurate depiction of BDSM. It is fraught with consent and abuse issues; and the impression that you have to have some kind of traumatic background to want to dominate someone isn't true. Like many other kinksters, I'm afraid that those readers with a new found interest in kink will be headed down a dangerous path without further education.But, it's precisely for those reasons that while I'll be the first to talk about the problems in the series and try to point people in a better direction, you won't see me complaining about the franchise (though I might make a fun, educational parody). You certainly won't seem me ridiculing Fifty Shades fans.When I went to the opening weekend to see Fifty Shades a gentleman who grabbed me up after the film asked me: ""Why are all the kinky people so angry with us? Don't they understand that we know it's just a movie? It's not like when we saw World War Z everybody started boarding up their houses."" While I agree with him, I think now that the kinky rabbit has been let out of the bag educating these new, interested people is of the utmost importance. When this phenomenon first started I made it my mission to provide these kinklings with the education they need to avoid making the same mistakes as the characters in the books. I've been interacting with these kinklings more than most for the last two years, and I have found that if you respect them and validate their desires, most of them are willing to learn.On the other hand, if you aggressively attack and ridicule the only bit of framework they have for their fantasies, you're effectively ridiculing their fantasies as well, and people stop listening and stop learning. When I'm interacting with these kinklings or the media (broadcasting to kinklings!) I ask myself what's more important: venting about the books and movie, or teaching people the right way to do thingsFor me, education always wins."

Life is short and time keeps ticking by. Don't waste another minute limiting yourself with wimpy words and negative self-talk. Talk brave; start today!",2015-02-19,Portrait of modern business woman in white office.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e8f16250000360036e99f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The most important conversation you will ever have is the one you have with yourself. This is what I say, and it's one that has been super important to me in my life. You see, I found that my negative self-talk has had a negative impact on my life for many years. As I started to ""clean up"" my self-talk, focusing on positive reinforcement and positive messaging, I noticed a shift in how I felt, how I carried myself, and the way I tackled challenges that popped up. Recently, I've discovered another way to increase my confidence and productivity, while helping me break out of my comfort zone, I call it, ""talking brave.""I have lots of big hopes and dreams; lots of things I want to achieve and bucket list items that are far beyond anything I would have imagined just a few short years ago. I have found that when I talk to others about these things I start to feel more confident about them.I was brainstorming with a colleague about a seminar I wanted to host. It was a bit of a stretch for me but the more I talked about it the more I felt like I could do it. After talking to a few more people about it I found myself feeling more confident and I ultimately scheduled the session and began the planning and marketing for it. Instead of just wanting it to happen, I started to take steps to make it happen. If you've read the book, The Secret, you probably get the premise of believing things will happen and then watching as the universe rearranges itself to make things happen for you. While I enjoyed the book and I believe that there is something to the premise, I also believe if you want things to happen you have to get off your butt and work for them to happen. But I have noticed that as I've started to tell people about my goals and dreams, opportunities to make them happen have started to come my way. I was daydreaming with my friend about going out to California someday and hosting a series of wellness retreats. Not long after, I received an invitation to go to Monterey Beach in October to be a presenter at a wellness retreat that is being organized by some of my fellow health coaches. So where does talking brave come in? Talking brave is about using empowering words to verbalize what you want out of life. It involves speaking in a tone of confidence and using action words. It's not about ""wishing"" that you could go to California. It's about talking brave and stating, ""I plan on going to California."" It's about swapping out those ""wimpy"" words for words that are more empowering and action-oriented. Instead of hoping and wishing for something, it's about planning, creating a strategy, and preparing for it.Instead of waiting and praying, it's about believing, working hard, working toward, and expecting to. When I started talking brave I actually felt differently. My confidence level soared and I started to really believe that I would reach my goals. I felt empowered to start working more diligently. And people that I talked brave to started talking brave as well. They started to stand a little taller and walk with a little more purpose. One of my coworkers even remarked that they felt more powerful and better about themselves whenever we chatted; I took this as a compliment! Want to start talking brave? Go ahead and start. Instead of saying, ""I wish I could do that,"" start saying, ""I think I'm going to try doing that."" Instead of, ""I hope I get that promotion,"" say, ""I'm going to work toward that promotion."" And instead of waiting to get the corner office, waiting for the cute girl down the hall to ask you out, or waiting for the money to take your dream vacation, start talking about how you're going to make those things happen for yourself.   Talking brave is about changing your mindset and believing that you can have, do, and be all the things you want to have, do, and be. Life is short and time keeps ticking by. Don't waste another minute limiting yourself with wimpy words and negative self-talk. Talk brave; start today!"

But as passionate as I am about our national pastime, there are some things that need to be changed.

Some of my fondest  childhood memories are of collecting baseball cards (with the pink bubble gum), getting autographs of countless players during Spring Training (I still have every one), pouring through the pages of Hy Turkin's old Baseball Encyclopedia and playing simulated baseball board games like APBA for hours on end. Later in life I even co-authored a series of popular baseball books. To echo the words of the immortal Babe Ruth: ""Baseball was, is and always will be to me the best game in the world.""But as passionate as I am about our national pastime, there are some things that need to be changed. Here then is what I hate most about the game I truly Iove:1. The Hall Of Fame's 5-Year Waiting Period: Why make a great player like Derek Jeter wait for half a decade before he is eligible for Cooperstown? Are the Lords of Baseball concerned that a player will un-retire after his induction? How cool would that be? Now batting... Hall of Famer Derek Jeter! Don't like that scenario? Then the Hallowed Hall could pass a new rule: Once inducted you are no longer eligible to play Major League Baseball. Either way, let's honor those who deserve to be immortalized while the memory of their outstanding career is still fresh in our minds and hearts.2. All World Series Games Played At Night: Baseball is desperately trying to reach younger fans. Then why are all the Fall Classic games broadcast so late that many kids can't stay up to watch them? It's high time to make at least one of the weekend games a day game. Better to sacrifice some prime-time TV revenue now for the longer term benefit of attracting a younger demographic to an aging game. 3. Players Who Don't Tip Their Cap To The Fans: The home town pitcher has hurled a terrific game but he starts to struggle and the manager needs to give him the hook. The fans are on their feet saluting the pitcher's outstanding performance as he walks off the mound toward the dugout. A few players in this situation will tip their cap. Once in a while they'll even doff it. But most players don't even bother to look up at their adoring fans. Tip Your Cap, Guys! It's a simple thing to do and it will endear you to your fan base, especially the kids, forever. 4. The Sacrifice Fly Rule: Why isn't a batter charged with an official at bat when he hits a sacrifice fly? And why is it even called a sacrifice? It is not the same as a sacrifice bunt where it's obvious that a batter is deliberately giving himself up to move a base runner. As it stands now, if a batter swings away and happens to hit a fly ball that happens to be deep enough to score a runner who happens to be on third, he is credited with a sacrifice fly and no official time at bat. But if the batter hits a fly ball to that very same spot and the base runner is on second and advances to third, the batter is charged with an official 0-for-1 at bat. Time to change this nonsensical rule. Charge the batter with an out, give him an RBI and stop calling the play a sacrifice when it clearly is not. 5. The Wave: It's the eighth inning. The game is on the line, growing tenser by the moment. So what do the fans do? They start popping up out of their seats, waving their hands in the air and ignoring the drama unfolding right in front of them on the field! Here's a novel idea: Watch the game! If you feel compelled to perform this hackneyed tradition, why not do it between innings? 6. Showboat Relievers: In football, players are penalized for excessive celebrations. So why does baseball allow showboat relief pitchers who close  out games to perform celebratory rituals on the mound that stick it in the face of the losing team? Fernando Rodney pretending to shoot an imaginary arrow into the sky after saving a game is the poster boy for this offensive behavior. The Commissioner should fine any pitcher who resorts to such bush league theatrics. Take a lesson from Mariano Rivera, who walked off the mound after every one of his record saves with grace and dignity. 7. Video Challenges: What could be more boring than a manager calling time and then trudging ever so slowly onto the field to give his guy in the dugout enough time to review a controversial call and let him know if it's worth challenging? This slows down the game and, more importantly, robs it of its controversy and excitement. I miss managers rushing out to protest a call, engaging in a nose-to-nose shouting match with the umpire and then getting the old heave-ho. Imagine what the game would have been like with a more docile Bobby Cox or Lou Piniella cooling their jets while some unseen arbiters in New York watched a video replay of a close call and issued their final ruling. I understand the value of technology but baseball is an imperfect game. Players make errors and so do umpires. Dump video challenges and let the brouhahas resume! 8. The All-Star Game Played For World Series Home Field Advantage: Starting players in the Mid-Season Classic rarely if ever play an entire game because managers want to give everyone a chance. So when the game -- and home field advantage in the World Series -- hang in the balance in the late innings, it's the reserves who are playing, not the best players who were elected by the fans. How then can this exhibition game's result be allowed to possibly influence the outcome of games that count the most -- in the World Series? It can't. The team with the best record in baseball during the regular season should enjoy home field advantage in October... period. The All-Star Game used to be special because it was the only time that players from the National and American Leagues competed on the same field. Now with inter-league play, this is commonplace. Maybe inter-league play should be abandoned to make the All-Star Game more significant again. But that's an argument for another day. 9. The MLB Policy Of Not Selling Alcohol After The 7th Inning: It's a terrific policy but then why allow the stadium's premium clubs to continue selling alcohol long after the game is over? The fans in the cheaper seats are encouraged to sober up before the drive home while those in the luxury clubs continue to ply themselves with booze and leave the stadium inebriated! The Commissioner needs to clamp down on every stadium in the game: No selling alcohol after the seventh inning to anyone -- from the worst seat in the house to the best. 10. Hitters Stepping Out Of The Batter's Box After Every Pitch To Adjust Something That Doesn't Need Adjusting: Baseball is trying to speed up the game. Sending a batter to first with an intentional walk without any pitches being thrown is just a band-aid. The best way to accelerate the action is simple: Keep the batter in the batter's box! Don't let him step out to adjust his gloves (or pretend to be doing it), take a practice swing or satisfy any of the neurotic superstitions that many players possess. A batter should only be able to step out of the box when he is hurt or impaired in some way. No more Nomar Garciaparra rituals! Long live the national pastime -- warts and all!

The second sign-up season under President Barack Obamaâs health overhaul starts Saturday with hopes that consumers will have a positive experience this time and fears that entrenched political opposition and renewed legal challenges may yet collapse the program. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e973200000070201d89d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The second year of Obamacare enrollment just ended. Or did it?The Department of Health and Human Services has hinted it might reopen enrollment on the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchanges in 37 states around the tax filing deadline April 15, with the aim of enrolling people who learn for the first time they owe a fine under the law’s individual mandate to have health coverage. Already, Minnesota, Vermont and Washington have done so, and states including California may do the same.Since Obamacare’s exchange marketplaces first opened in October 2013, federal and state authorities have simultaneously emphasized the importance of the deadlines to sign up for coverage and then fudged them to accommodate their own errors and a public that remains uninformed about the 5-year-old health care law’s requirements and benefits. “We’ve got millions of people who are still qualified who have a chance to sign up, but you’ve got to do it by Feb. 15,” Obama said at the White House earlier this month.Maybe not, it turns out just a few days after that supposed deadline. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell will announce plans for the federal health insurance exchanges using HealthCare.gov within two weeks, she said at a press conference Wednesday. “What we try and do -- as we have throughout this open enrollment -- is focus deeply on the issue of the consumer,” she said. A group of congressional Democrats has urged the administration to permit more people to sign up, as have tax-preparation companies and groups that support Obamacare.Allowing more people to enroll in health insurance has obvious benefits for the Obama administration and states like Vermont that operate their own exchanges. It would also help at least some of the consumers who might sign up. More uninsured people would gain coverage, fewer people would owe tax penalties next year and the backlash about the fine would be mitigated.“It would be awful for a Vermont family to have to pay a fee of several hundred dollars or more, and then have to pay 100 percent of their medical care on top of that, just because they didn’t know the penalty existed,” Lawrence Miller, chief of health care reform for Gov. Peter Shumlin (D), said in a press release Thursday.But the approach also carries risks. Reopening enrollment after hyping the previous deadlines could contribute to confusion about when people are supposed to act in future years. It could also lead consumers to conclude upcoming deadlines aren’t real, especially considering the many other parts of the Affordable Care Act that have been delayed or even canceled since the law passed in 2010. And there’s a small chance it could encourage people to postpone getting coverage until they have medical needs, which would increase costs.If a special enrollment period is going to succeed without causing problems for consumers and insurers this year, authorities will have to communicate that it’s a unique event for a specific population, said Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for the trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans.“Special enrollment periods need to be clearly defined in terms of who qualifies and the start and end date to make sure that consumers understand and health plans can help those folks navigate that process,” Krusing said.One reason a special enrollment period may be deemed necessary is that outreach campaigns have downplayed the mandate and the penalty. The individual mandate is the least popular part of an unpopular law, and enrollment efforts instead have focused on positive messages, like the availability of subsidies and access to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.""There's been such a reluctance to talk about the mandate, and so, shockingly, people don't realize that they have to buy coverage,"" said Caroline Pearson, who leads the health reform practice at Avalere Health, a consulting firm. The Treasury Department estimates as many as 6 million people will owe the penalty for not having health coverage last year, despite a slew of exemptions from the mandate. Signing up for coverage during one of these special enrollment periods wouldn’t eliminate the penalty for last year, and taxpayers who sign up for insurance would still owe a partial penalty for this year because the law allows only a three-month grace period.This tax season is the first time Americans have to factor health insurance into their returns. The Obamacare mandate fine starts at $95 per person, but will be based on a percentage of income -- and thus be higher -- for most households subject to it for the 2014 tax year. And it gets a lot bigger for 2015: at least $325 or a percentage of income. The minimum fine goes up to $695 for 2016.“There still remain millions upon millions of people who are unaware about these penalties,” said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy organization supportive of the Affordable Care Act. “And there are still millions of people who are not even aware of the subsidies they may be eligible for,” he said during a conference call with reporters Wednesday.Obamacare uses fixed time periods for enrollment to dissuade consumers from putting off getting coverage until they get sick and need costly medical care. That’s the same way most employers handle job-based health benefits, and how Medicare handles sign-ups for prescription drug and Medicare Advantage insurance plans. “It really goes to the core reason that the Affordable Care Act has an open enrollment period instead of enrollment periods throughout the year,” Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, that state’s exchange, said on the Families USA call. “The right question is, does having a special period for one time cause injury to that and affect the risk pool?”So far, the dates for regular enrollment have varied every year: Oct. 1, 2013, to March 31, 2014, for last year; Nov. 15, 2014, to Feb. 15 for this year; and tentatively Oct. 1, 2015, to Dec. 15, 2015, for next year. And that doesn’t count prior deadline extensions, or the practice of allowing people who didn’t complete their applications on time to finish them after deadlines passed, which has been happening since Sunday.Since all of this is so new, now may be a good time to be flexible, but the exchanges must have deadlines that matter at some point, said Sydney Smith Zvara, executive director of the Association of Washington Healthcare Plans in the Evergreen State. “Down the line, some people could end up after it’s tightened up being disappointed that they are held to a deadline, because it looked like they were so elastic,” she said.Overall, the health insurance industry doesn’t appear concerned so far. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont and MVP Health Care each endorsed Vermont’s decision, according a press release from the exchange. Insurers in Minnesota also aren’t worried about the special enrollment period disrupting their operations, Jim Schowalter, president and CEO of the Minnesota Council of Health Plans, wrote in an email. Washington state insurers support getting more people covered, but some companies are wary of creating incentives for people to postpone buying insurance, Zvara said.Minnesota's MNSure is permitting new enrollments only for people who owe a fine from March 1 to April 30, Vermont Health Connect is available starting Thursday until May 31 for those subject to the penalty, and Washington Healthplanfinder reopened sign-ups for this group this Tuesday through April 17. “This is just a one-time opportunity. It’s not going to be throughout the year. It’s very defined,” Richard Onizuka, the CEO of Washington state’s exchange, said on the Families USA call.California will reveal its decision early next week, and the exchanges in Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky and New York are weighing more enrollment this year, officials from those states said. By contrast, states including Colorado and Maryland currently are not eying reopening their exchanges, representatives told The Huffington Post. Early moves by Minnesota, Vermont and Washington states could put pressure on authorities elsewhere to follow suit.Allowing uninsured people who owe the mandate fine to sign up late actually could benefit insurers, Pearson of Avalere Health said. Individuals who remain without health coverage may be healthier than those already enrolled, because sick people are more driven to get insurance, she said. “It’s mostly upside. I think you have the potential to actually get a reasonable enrollment bump, and I don’t think there’s really significant risk,” Pearson said. “As long as it stays limited.”"
