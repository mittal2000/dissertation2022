How did she feel after handing back the cash? ""Like someone told you that you won the lottery, but it's not.""""I asked him, 'Did you put it in the checkbook?' He said he wasn't sure about it because he was a little drunk,"" she added. According to Fox News, he said he accidentally handed over a stash of $100 bills instead of $1 notes.Thai-born Anantatho, also known as Bee, immigrated to the U.S. with her husband, Surachai Surabotsopon, five years ago. She said she was ""disappointed"" for her staff.Luckily, she'd told her employees to keep hold of the money and they were able to pay the man back immediately. He ended up leaving a still-generous $40 tip, and Anantatho is confident that she dealt with the awkward situation in the best possible way -- and that the man will return as a customer.""It's just the way it is,"" she said."
1,HEALTHY LIVING,The Music Of Strangers: A Film Review By Dr. Lloyd Sederer,"Lloyd I.

Yet, as many have said, what we need more",2016-06-19,"<em>The Family Guide to Mental Health Care, by Lloyd Sederer, MD, WW Norton, 2013</em>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5766d3991500001b0073b5e0.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The barbarity of the Orlando club massacre casts a pall on our civilization. Yet, as many have said, what we need more than anything in the wake of such human ugliness is evidence of our beauty, determination, and capacity for unity and generosity.We all start off as strangers to one another – as did the diverse group of international musicians and visual artists who came together under the spell and leadership of the legendary cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Their commonality was their devotion to music and to sustaining their respective cultural legacies, as well as a commitment to change the world – especially Mr. Ma.In 1998, Mr. Ma established Silkroad (a reference to the ancient trade route that connected people and cultures across vast expanses), in which dozens of creative artists became an ensemble seeking to deliver our universal language, music, especially to those whose countries and cultures are in upheaval. Silkroad began touring, performing and educating in 2000. A year later came 9/11, which further galvanized their resolve. Since then over 2 million people in 33 countries have been uplifted by their gifts of music, inclusion and promise.In this film, which is as much a concert as it is a movie, we meet and follow the lives of a half dozen of the artists, including Mr. Ma. They seem chosen to feature their diaspora, their journey from family and homeland and their efforts to discover and recover their place in life, including their new homes. They are men and women from Syria, Galicia (Spain), China, Iran, the USA, and many other places. Mr. Ma quotes T.S. Eliot when commenting on his beloved fellow travelers: We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.Silkroad’s journey has not been without struggle, despite the magic touch of Mr. Ma. But they clearly never lost sight of their mission: they remain very much alive as an ensemble and enterprise today. You witness the energy of their personalities and their deep kindnesses when watching The Music of Strangers. Throughout the film, there were many lovely moments of joy and fervent musical interludes. But, as viewers, we also visit Syrian refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan. The horror of the camps and the agony of the forced migrants is inescapable even if mitigated – in some – by the presence of and hope imparted by these undaunted international (musical) ambassadors. Participant Media (whom I once described as a media company with a conscience - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lloyd-i-sederer-md/company-with-a-conscience_b_854598.html) co-financed and produced the film. Their tradition of creating film and television programming dedicated to social change is evident in their oeuvre of over 70 films, including Spotlight, Contagion, Lincoln, The Help, He Named Me Malala, CITIZENFOUR, Food, Inc., and An Inconvenient Truth.  Participant, with this film, worked with FilmAid International (http://www.filmaid.org) and Silkroad to bring music and arts workshops to three Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, engaging those so far from home (in so many ways) and nurturing their spirit. It is hope, coupled with the power of human resilience, which these displaced people, young and old, are in dire need of as they face their profound personal and national losses.The Music of Strangers debuted in selected theatres starting June 10 and will be followed by a broadcast premiere on HBO. The images of this film continue to infuse my mind and I can still hear the extraordinary music. The first thing I did when I got home from the theatre was to order the latest Silkroad album, Sing Me Home. Bravo to Mr. Ma, his intrepid co-travelers and to the producers of this film for giving us proof that humanity is alive and well - that grace exists even in moments of horror and grief.--The opinions expressed herein are solely my own as a psychiatrist and public health advocate.

Bystanders saw two men in a van throw the two dogs out of the vehicle -- which had a covered license plate -- in the parking lot of Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha's Ciudad Real campus, Ana Robles Pérez, a spokeswoman for the group, told The Huffington Post in an email. That happened on June 11, and the police have been investigating since then to try to find out the identity of the drivers.The dogs, which the group says are a type of hunting dog, were severely dehydrated and malnourished, with scabies and various infections.“They were more dead than alive,” Pérez said in an email. Extremely graphic photos of the dogs upon intake can be seen in a Facebook album by the group.But while the dogs are understandably very shy, they’re already beginning to trust humans again.“The first days they preferred to stay alone, without people,” Pérez said. “Now, when they see their [caregiver], they move their tails!” Even so, it will likely be a long recovery, physically and mentally, she said. Eventually, the group hopes to adopt out the pair together to a new home in Spain.While Raiz and Tierra have been getting the most media attention, Pérez noted they now have a third dog, Bosque, who they believe came from the same place.“We're sure that he's another victim, too, of this case,” Pérez said. “He was abandoned near the University too and in the same situation.” Raiz and Tierra also appeared to recognize Bosque.Based on this video of the three dogs together, they’ll never have to be afraid again."

He cited Trump's response to last week's mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, in which the presumptive nominee posted a self-congratulatory tweet and doubled down on his proposal to ban Muslim immigrants.""We now know who Donald Trump is. But what is the Republican Party? Most Republican leaders still hold out hope that despite the fact that Trump is, in George Will's accurate description, the most anti-conservative presidential aspirant in their party's history, he will suddenly get religion and embrace their agenda,"" he said.""They believe that a 70-year-old megalomaniac, whose entire life has been devoted to ceaselessly promoting himself, and using any means to tear down others, would suddenly develop deep empathy for the party, though so far, he has used it solely as a vehicle for his own personal advancement,"" Zakaria continued.The CNN host argued that the onus to mobilize against Trump is also on former cabinet members and advisers. Many foreign policy experts have argued that electing Trump would be dangerous and reckless for America's reputation abroad, but only a handful have declared that they will not support him. Meanwhile, many of the party's most influential voices have been silent on Trump.""Not one former secretary of state, defense or treasury has signed on or publicly announced that he or she will not vote for the man,"" Zakaria said. ""Where are George Shultz, James Baker, Condoleezza Rice and Hank Paulson? Can their reputations survive their silence?""Zakaria saved his sharpest critiques for Republicans who have resigned themselves to supporting Trump, even while condemning his rhetoric and policy proposals. He singled out Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has backed Trump, despite the real estate mogul criticizing McCain's military service and questioning his bravery as a prisoner of war.""All John McCain needs to do to preserve his honor is to say two words: Never Trump,"" Zakaria said.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

(Reuters) - A Tennessee jury found a former Vanderbilt University football player guilty on Saturday for the June 2013 rape of an unconscious female student in a case drawing national attention to sexual assaults on college campuses.The trial of Brandon Vandenburg, 23, was heard by a jury brought in from Memphis, 200 miles (300 km) from the university in Nashville, because of concern that media coverage had made it hard to find impartial local jurors.In a retrial after his first conviction was thrown out in a mistrial, Vandenburg was once again found guilty of five counts of aggravated rape, two counts of aggravated sexual battery and one count of unlawful photography.Vandenburg showed no emotion when the verdicts were read, although he did exchange emotional hugs with his defense team before he was escorted to jail. He faces 15 to 25 years in prison for each rape charge when sentenced in July.Vandenburg and teammate Cory Batey, two of four former Vanderbilt football players charged in the case, were found guilty when tried together in January 2015. Batey has since been retried and convicted.Judge Monte Watkins declared a mistrial in June 2015 and set aside the convictions because one of the jurors had failed to disclose that he had been a victim of rape.Vandenburg and the victim, who had been dating, met on that June evening for drinks at a bar popular with Vanderbilt students. Both had been drinking prior to meeting, according to testimony.Vandenburg tried to take the victim, who was unconscious, to her apartment, but could not get in. He then took her back to his dormitory, where the other three men who were charged in the case helped cart her to his room, where the attacks took place.The men used cell phones to video their crimes, with those videos playing crucial roles in the convictions. Defense attorneys had argued that Vandenburg was too intoxicated to commit an assault and should be acquitted.Prosecutors and a university spokeswoman praised the victim for having the strength to testify once again at the retrial.""It is our sincere hope that today's verdict strongly sends the message to victims and to perpetrators that sexual assault will not be tolerated in our communities,"" Beth Fortune,Vanderbilt's vice chancellor for public affairs, said in a statement.(Reporting by Tim Ghianni; Editintg by Daniel Trotta)"

My younger sister feels the same, but this is less about her (sorry, not sorry), and more about me and the admiration I have for a man who taught me how to live and love. For the record, my mom’s pretty damn magical, too ― but since Father’s Day is Sunday, I want to pay tribute to my dad and all the important life lessons he has taught me, and my sister, over the years. Hopefully, some of these lessons will come in handy for you, too: 1. He taught me that education is everything, and that if I wanted to achieve anything in life, I could.2. He taught me that life is about learning, and that seeking the truth would teach me more about myself, and the world, than anything else I could imagine.3. He taught me that independence comes with responsibility, and he allowed me to learn that the hard way. 4. He taught me I can do anything I put my mind to ― if I can manage to put my smartphone down for long enough. 5. He taught me that a good book is the best vacation, and that play is just as important as work. 6. He taught me that corny is cool (enough), and that laughing at your own jokes is, too... even when no one else laughs with you, dammit.7. He taught me that procrastination isn’t cool, and that’s a lesson I’m still learning.8. He taught me that my words matter, and that I should always write and say what I mean. 9. He taught us that grammar and spelling are important ― and that editing is, too. 10. He taught me, during every summer break, that ""we're all perpetually learning. School never ends, because life schools us every day."" 11. He taught me that time is life's most valuable resource, and what I do with it is a reflection of who I am.12. He taught me how to give back to my people and community.13. He taught me that family is fundamental, and love is our foundation.14. He taught me that our family's black history is revolutionary, and I should carry on that spirit in everything I do.15. He taught me that being Ethiopian is a beautiful thing, and I have always expressed that proudly. 16. He taught me that kindness is key, and that while ""it's nice to be important, it's more important to be nice.""17. He taught me how to handle my money, and that if I ""look[ed] after the pennies, the dollars would look after themselves."" 18. He taught me no one is ever too old to learn, and that we should always be willing to try anything (within reason). 19. He taught me that ""I love you"" means more when you show it than when you say it -- that love needs to be felt, not just said. 20. He taught me to be grateful for my blessings, and how to find faith freely. 21. He taught me that simplicity is the goal, and clutter is the devil. 22. He taught me how to balance humility with confidence, and that those two traits would get me far in life. 23. He taught me that no matter how badly or how often I fumble, he always has my back.24. He taught me that people constantly evolve, and that the woman I want to be tomorrow can always be a better version of the woman I am today.25. He taught me that no matter how far apart we are, laughter will always bring us closer. Happy Father's Day, Daddy. I love you forever and always, ""so much, so much."""
12,FIFTY,A WWII Vet's Advice To His Daughter Lasts A Lifetime,"Iris Ruth Pastor, ContributorSlice-of-life columnist, motivational speaker and pod caster, ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/advice-to-daughter-lasts-a-lifetime_b_10432324.html,"My father gave me a firm foundation in which to grow. And wings with which to soar. Without him, I would never have had the motivation, the zest, and the inspiration to get through life. Much less enjoy it.",2016-06-19,2016-06-13-1465793728-8966020-PikeLevineflightjacket.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-13-1465793728-8966020-PikeLevineflightjacket-thumb.jpg," Not surprisingly, one of my earliest memories is of my father telling me something. ""You're run of the mill, Iris,"" he would say. ""Just run of the mill."" Maybe it was my first lesson in intuition, insight and savvy. I knew by the way he said it that what he actually meant was, ""You're special. Very special."" And he knew I knew. And so the dance began.  In 1947, my father was a young GI coming home from Europe to his war bride -- my mother. I was born within a year of his returning stateside -- part of the first wave of baby boomers. Eventually my mom and dad moved out of my grandparent's house into their own place. The wooden kitchen cabinets were painted yellow. A Lazy Susan was bought for Sunday night dinners of corned beef, pickles and rye bread. A deep maroon paisley couch with tassels was picked out and delivered. So was a metal swing set. Not assembled. The metal swing set is new, bright, shiny, massive and all mine. My dad works all day assembling the metal monster as I sit and watch. After hours of tedious labor, he digs four holes in which to place the swing set's main poles. To my surprise, he sets the poles in concrete. Most Dads just dug a shallow hole and set the swing set's main support poles in the dirt. The higher the swing went, the more the poles wiggled, vibrated and lifted out of the hole. Swinging kids squeaked with terror and delight as the whole structure rose, shuttered and fell back into place. I was always afraid that one day the entire swing set would just tumble over. Perhaps sensing my fear and having lived through his own fears during combat missions as a ball turret gunner in the European Theater during World War II, my dad grounds my swing set in concrete. I can swing as high as I want -- unencumbered by dread of the entire mass becoming airborne. I plant my bottom on the red metal seat. The heat from the metal stings the backs of my bare legs. I grimace. I squirm a little from side to side. The toes of my clean white Keds brush the grass. I bend my knees and swing my feet forward. Lean back and push off. I start the climb to the sky -- head tilted back to see the great blue expanse -- my pony tail waving wildly from side to side. ""Okay, Daddy, you can push me now,"" I scream. ""Real high. I'm ready.""  The years pass. The grass underneath the swing set is matted down. Then worn away. Then reduced to finely ground brown grains that look like home plate on a kid's makeshift baseball field. The red seats are not as shiny. The supporting poles have a few dents from my swinging crazy. And rust spots are starting to appear.  I still swing.  More years pass. I graduate. Go to college. Marry. Divorce. Remarry. I have the kids and bake the cookies. And do the wash. And drive the car pools. Always with back-up, behind-the-scenes coaching from my dad, an Eighth Army Air Corp veteran: Never let them see you sweat Make it look easy Do it your way Do it Many years later, my own kids move away. And then my husband and I move away too. And my father, the jaunty World War 2 staff sergeant, dies just weeks before his 90th birthday. When I come back to visit, I notice that the swing set is now old and rickety. The push off mound is sunken in with shallow gullies. The chains are disjointed. The rust is heavy. The seats hang crooked. The swing set, like me, is well past the half century mark. We are both defined, grounded, centered and structured. Marked by age. Touched by repeated exposure to the elements. I approach the swing's red seat warily. It looks so flimsy. Can it hold me? I settle in. Squirm around. Slowly push off and up. I arch my back and hang on tight. ""Okay, Daddy, I say softly to myself. ""You can push me now. Real high. I'm ready.""  My father gave me a firm foundation in which to grow. And wings with which to soar. Without him, I would never have had the motivation, the zest, and the inspiration to get through life. Much less enjoy it. ""Thanks, Dad -- not just for your past military service to our country -- but for the outstanding job you did after the war as my dad. I wish you were still around so I could spend Father's Day with you.""If you want more information about Iris's forthcoming book Tales of a Bulimic Baby Boomer, or to sign up for her weekly newsletter, visit www.irisruthpastor.com or follow her on Twitter @IrisRuthPastor.

Photo: WFP/Giulio d'AdamoZero hunger by 2030: that call, the echo of Sustainable Development Goal #2, was blessed by the General Assembly of the United Nations in September 2015. At the Rome headquarters of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), June 13 saw a sharp focus on the ethical and religious as well as practical dimensions of this goal. Pope Francis, in a first ever visit to WFP, echoed the call for Zero Hunger and reflected on what it involves. In parallel WFP's governors explored with WFP's leadership and an interreligious group how religious institutions and beliefs are involved in the global and local call to action to end hunger by 2030.Ending hunger involves at least four areas for action. First, it means getting enough food to the right places, and ensuring that food is accessible to those in need. Second, the ""monster"" of malnutrition that stunts bodies and minds of children and adults can be defeated only with multidimensional approaches that convey information and encourage healthy behaviors, including breast-feeding babies and balanced diets for all. Third, agriculture is deeply involved as the motor for production, meaning land reform, research, knowledge for farmers, and attention to sustainability. The world's gigantic and dynamic food markets must be part of the solution. And fourth, Zero Hunger demands a political will grounded both in a conviction that hunger is unacceptable in a just, modern society and that acting on that conviction can and must be a priority.It is ironic that virtually every religious tradition has from time immemorial focused on food and hunger but paths towards common engagement to end hunger have often lacked strategic focus. Religious communities are powerful advocates for action - witness, for example, the relentless focus of Bread for the World in the United States on political action, the central focus of the Sikh tradition, Langar, on serving others through free meals, and the hundreds of thousands of soup kitchens and food pantries across the world that focus on those in need. The World Faiths Development Dialogue (WFDD) is documenting the extraordinary diversity of religious engagement on every dimension of the zero hunger challenge. When WFP called on its regional offices for example of partnerships with faith traditions, it was flooded with examples from every world region. But better and well analyzed knowledge of what is being done is needed if the full potential for a global effort is to be realized.Pope Francis in his WFP address called Zero Hunger ""a great goal"", and gave high praise to WFP's work, as an institution that focuses less on its declarations, than on the work of its members. He stressed two themes: the ""normalization"" of extreme poverty as people grow immune to people's tragedies as they are overloaded with information in this interconnected world of instant communications. ""We hear weeping but do not comfort it"". His solution: not ""broad reflections or .. endless discussion, constantly repeating things everyone knows"" but working to ""de-naturalize"" or de-normalize extreme poverty. As an example he focused on food waste: ""Food discarded is in a sense stolen from the table of the poor and the starving"". And he also attacked bureaucratic behavior: ""Forms of aid and development projects are obstructed by.. incomprehensible political decisions, skewed ideological visions..."", and hunger is even used as a weapon of war. He urged that consciences be de-anesthetized: ""Do not grow weary or let problems dissuade you. Believe in what you are doing and pursue it enthusiastically"", he urged WFP's staff. His call was for creative solutions leading to change and transformationInterreligious discussions, first with WFP's leadership and then its governors, highlighted similar themes. Partnerships on hunger issues are a natural focus for action, less controversial than other development and humanitarian goals. With the deep engagement of religious institutions, in humanitarian action in situations of war and conflict but also in local communities everywhere, there are countless opportunities to work better together to end hunger. The discussions brought together Catholic, Muslim, Protestant, Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh, and boldly interreligious perspectives, as exemplified in supporting statements received from widely varied leaders. They echoed bold calls for immediate action.What we need most of all is a new and genuine conviction that hunger can and must end, and that Zero Hunger is a universal, shared moral and political call. That means that every case of hunger demands action. Zero means no case of hunger is acceptable.

I would tell anyone who would listen that I was ""stuck on pink."" The socks proved to be incredibly effective in fulfilling a need I couldn't explain. My parents eventually learned that the socks were a gateway into harder things -- soon I was binging on Rainbow Brite, Punky Brewster, and Jem and the Holograms. This leaning to the ""sparkle side"" would end up informing much of my childhood and adolescence. Ok, fine. It still informs my life today.  In spite of the late 80s being an amazing time for a little gay boy to be inspired and entertained -- we're talking the era of My Little Pony and Strawberry Shortcake -- I was taught early on that my natural tendencies were not...natural. This conflict was aided by the fact that I was born in Salt Lake City to Mormon parents. In fact, my father's Mormon lineage dates back to the earliest days of the religion in the 1830s.   My father followed every rule and lived his life in the specific order a good Mormon man would live. At 8, he was baptized into the faith by his father. At 12, he received the priesthood -- a sort of magical power, by which Mormon men believe they can heal the sick through prayer, among other things. The strength of his priesthood powers increased every two years, until the age of 19. At that point, he was given the full priesthood and sent to live as a missionary in South Africa for two years. He then returned, started college, and met my mother within a few years. After 6 weeks of dating, they became engaged. 5 months later, they were married ""for time and all eternity"" in the Salt Lake City Mormon temple. Within 2 years, they heeded the advice of their church elders and began to ""multiply and replenish the earth."" Then I entered the picture.  I lived in a conflicted state. I wanted to make my dad as proud of me as he was of my younger brother, the baseball star. But I wanted to do this in my own way. My early attempts at athletics were embarrassing. In fact, the very first baseball practice I had as a 6 year old ended with me getting hit in the groin with a ball. This was the universe telling me to stay in my lane (which was theatre).  When I finally came out at the age of 21, no one was shocked. My parents began to slowly tolerate the changes they saw in me -- tighter jeans, and better hair, mostly. But, this began a period of estrangement from my family for me. I had three younger siblings, all of whom were still practicing Mormonism. While I could still see my family, there was a disconnection between being my true self and being a member of the family. I wasn't to speak of the boys I was dating, let alone introduce them to the family.  This tense time boiled over in November 2008. The same night that my friends and I celebrated the election of Barack Obama was also met with angst, as the largely Mormon-funded Prop 8 was voted into law. The anger was palpable. It was truly one of those ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore"" Network moments. The only thing we could think to do was march in protest around the Salt Lake City Mormon temple -- the very temple where my parents and grandparents were married.  When I told my parents what I was doing, they were very upset. In their eyes, I was crossing a line. Attacking them and their way of life personally. But wasn't their church doing the same thing to me? Looking back, that evening was one of the turning points of my life. I also took this opportunity to formally resign from the Mormon church. In doing so, I forfeited all rights and privileges that Mormonism afforded a man. I guess there will be no planet for me in the afterlife.Change came to my family from two unforeseen sources. First, one of my younger brothers also came out. It came a surprise to my entire family -- myself included. I suppose I was too focused on my own gay journey to notice. He was always a devout Mormon, even serving a mission in the Netherlands for two years. This meant that my parents belonged to a religion that more or less excluded half of their children.Second, a 19-year-old Mormon kid who lived near my parents hanged himself in his backyard. It shook the community, but like everything in Mormonism, people were quick to sweep it under the rug. Depression got lead billing as the cause, and there was no mention of his struggle with his sexuality. It's part of a greater problem in Utah, which ranks fifth in the nation for youth suicides. Something snapped in my mother. She could not comprehend the loss of this boy, and why the circumstances around his death were being hushed. Rather than screaming at a temple, she turned to PFLAG (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), the Nation's oldest family and ally organization, to figure out how she could help. She ended up founding the third chapter of PFLAG in Utah, serving as its president for 5 years. To celebrate my mother's contributions to PFLAG, I flew back with my now-husband, to surprise her by joining in the Utah Pride March. As we prepared to join the parade route in downtown Salt Lake City, I looked around at the amazing love surrounding me, at my family, at those in the crowd who weren't so lucky to have their family's support. The metamorphosis of my family was a slow burner, but it was worth the process. I can say wholeheartedly that I receive unconditional love from my family. That is a blessing more valuable to me than eternal salvation on my own planet. As we joined the march, I looked over at my father, a man who had been proud in his youth, but now a man who was a different, more loving kind of proud. A man who understood that being a father is supporting your kids, providing a toast at their wedding -- even if it's another groom to whom he's toasting. We rounded the corner of a side street, turning onto the main thoroughfare. I was blown away by the thousands of people lining the streets. Suddenly I heard someone yell ""Yeah! Proud Dad! Thank you!"" I looked over and saw that my father was holding a sign that said ""Proud Dad"" in bubble rainbow letters, which he had drawn himself. Tears began to roll down my face. I walked over to him, an even prouder son, and gave him the biggest hug I could.Note: This essay originally appeared in longer form in La Petite Mort, a publication from the Manhattan-based design and strategy studio Sub Rosa."

21,POLITICS,"Fathers Can't End Violence In A Day, But There Is No Better Day To Start.","Jeff Bleich and Peter C. Harvey, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fathers-cant-end-violence_b_10551794.html,We can't be good fathers as long as we tolerate the epidemic of sexual assaults against young women and girls.,2016-06-19,"Paul Harrison holds a sign that reads: ""Rape is rape"", during the Wacky Walk portion of the Stanford University commencement ceremony in Palo Alto, California, U.S. June 12, 2016. REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d421a83b00004e27ec7dd6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This month, the public expressed justified outrage that a 20-year-old Stanford student received a 6-month sentence for raping an unconscious girl. The most disturbing thing about the light sentence should not be how grossly out of the norm it was, but just the opposite; that it is all too normal. The judge's June 2 sentence tracked a probation officer's recommendation that the rapist should get 4-6 months, because -- in the department's view -- the perpetrator had been drinking, had not committed other crimes, and had otherwise been an upstanding student-athlete with his whole life ahead of him.That evening there were no outraged headlines in newspapers. There were no noisy protests by prosecutors or pickets outside of the courthouse. The sentence that was handed down was business-as-usual in a system that still does not get it. The only reason that people discovered this injustice and reacted so angrily was the bravery and eloquence of the victim whose impact statement was published by Buzzfeed.This situation is familiar to us. There was a time when courts operated in the same way when it came to drunk driving or domestic abuse. Until the 1980s, it was common for a court to give drunk drivers a light sentence -- because it was normal to drink, because people's judgment is impaired when they drink, the lines of when someone was too drunk to drive were blurry, and because many drunk drivers were otherwise upstanding citizens or young people with their lives ahead of them. This reasoning led courts and society to tolerate the notion that a certain number of innocent people would die or be horribly maimed each year because of drunk drivers. Likewise, for most of our lifetimes, courts took a lenient view toward domestic abuse. Light sentences were given to domestic abusers --because a person who is drinking might momentarily lose his temper, the lines of fault between a fighting couple can be blurry, and because many abusers were often otherwise upstanding citizens or young people with their lives ahead of them. And so Courts and society accepted that a certain number of women would live in terror in their homes with no protection from their abusers. Today, we live in a world where based on that same logic we accept that 1 in 4 girls are sexually assaulted before the time they are 18.The veil of silence about these sexual assaults has finally begun to lift from college campuses, military barracks, high schools and middle schools where these sexual assaults are all too common. Thanks to movies like The Hunting Ground, The Invisible War, and Audrie & Daisy, the public is finally coming to terms with the epidemic of violence against our girls that has been tolerated for far too long. The solution, as with drunk driving and domestic violence, is for the public to rise up and demand more from their courts, from their communities, and from themselves. There is no excuse, ever, for getting behind a wheel drunk, or hitting a spouse, or having sex with a person who did not or cannot consent. This message needs to be reinforced among judges, prosecutors, probation officers, campus administrators, military commanders, principals, teachers, doctors, but also parents. The public also needs to understand that most people who engage in these actions are not usually upstanding. The vast majority of these crimes are caused by a small number of people who have not been deterred.Between the two of us, we have three sons and three daughters, and it's our responsibility to make sure our boys know that it is never okay to assault a girl, or to look away as another boy does. It's also our responsibility to make sure our daughters know that it is never okay for them to be assaulted, and that we will have their back if and when they choose to speak out. If a parent, or coach, or mentor, or teacher, or a judge does not know how to start, there is a manual to help: http://teachearly.org This Father's Day offers us all a chance to reflect on doing the two things every father is expected to do: raise their kids to lead good lives, and protect them until they are old enough to protect themselves. We can't be good fathers as long as we tolerate the epidemic of sexual assaults against young women and girls. Re-educating courts is a start. But changing a culture that has allowed this situation to exist, means taking that a step further and pledging to change all of our attitudes."

In a post to Facebook on Monday, Baldwin County Commissioner Tucker Dorsey wrote his ""soul aches for the families"" of those killed in the Orlando, Florida, massacre at a gay nightclub, but that lowering the flag in the wake of mass shootings or terrorist attacks ""is not a valid circumstance or memorial as specified in the U.S. Flag Code.""That code requires the American flag be lowered on Memorial Day and upon the death of government officials. It also empowers the president to alter, modify, repeal or prescribe additional rules ""whenever he deems it to be appropriate or desirable.""Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley joined Obama in ordering that flags remain lowered until sunset June 16 as a ""mark of respect for the victims of the act of hatred and terror"" in Orlando.In his Facebook post, Dorsey said he similarly ignored Obama's orders to lower the flag in the wake of the terror attacks in Paris last November and the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, in December.Dorsey said the flag flying at full-staff represents American citizens ""holding our head up with courage above all others.""""When the flag is at half-staff, our country's head is figuratively held low, and quite frankly, I am not willing to hang my head down because of a terrorist attack against our people and our allies,"" Dorsey wrote. ""I am not willing to hang my head down because evil shoots up a church, school, or movie theater. We need more than a gesture as a response. I want us, as Americans, to stand tall, courageously, and fight back against the forces of evil, and let’s fight like we intend to win.""Dorsey's post makes no mention of the LGBT community. It does, however, describe the shooter as ""another follower of Islam"" who decided to ""shoot up a bunch of innocents."" Read the full post below:""Evil exists in the world, and it seems to be expanding at a rapid rate,"" Dorsey wrote. ""It is evil, not guns, killing innocents, but that is a different essay."" He ended the post by asking others to join him in ""regular prayer for peace, for our military, law enforcement, and first responders along with their families.""While some sided with Dorsey, many blasted him on social media and some even called for his resignation. However, Dorsey wasn't alone in his position.Commissioners in Cole County, Missouri, which is home to the state capital of Jefferson City, initially took a similar stance, voting 2-1 on Monday against lowering flags there, the News Tribune reported. ""I want to honor those who have served our country, but we can't lower it for every event like this that occurs,"" Commissioner Kris Scheperle said. ""I do feel for those who were gunned down, but I don't think it warrants lowering the flag.""Scheperle later changed his vote ""due to the negative attention"" the issue brought to the county, he told the News Tribune in a statement. ""The bottom line is my concerns for Cole County citizens."""

And it marks a significant win for progressive groups, which are pressuring major companies to boycott the convention over Trump.Apple specifically pointed to Trump’s comments about minority groups, immigrants and women in explaining its choice, two sources with knowledge of the decision told Politico.“The Apple news raises the bar for other corporations,"" Rashad Robinson, a spokesman for ColorOfChange PAC, said in a statement. The PAC is leading efforts to pressure companies not to participate in this year's GOP gathering.""Not only has Apple declined to support the Republican National Convention, but they’ve explicitly told Republican leaders that Trump’s bigoted rhetoric is the reason that they’re sitting out,"" Robinson said. ""This is what real corporate responsibility looks like.""There is likely little love lost between the tech giant and the presumptive GOP nominee. Trump called for a boycott of Apple in February when the company refused to unlock the iPhone of one of the gunmen in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California in December. (Nonetheless, Trump continued to use Apple products after his pronouncement.)An Apple spokesman declined to comment. The Republican National Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Emily Lauer, a spokeswoman for the Cleveland 2016 host committee, a nonprofit helping finance this year’s GOP convention, said the committee has already raised 90 percent of its budget. That means it raised funds at a faster rate than the previous two Republican conventions, according to Lauer.“While the media’s focus has been on those who aren’t participating, what continues to be looked past is the fact that the Cleveland Host Committee continues to make forward progress in our fundraising efforts through the participation of more than 100 donors,” Lauer said.The nonprofit host committees have taken on an increasingly important role in financing the costly conventions. Unlike the party-run organizing committees, city host committees can receive direct cash donations from corporations, not just in-kind contributions.Apple did not participate in the two major parties’ national conventions in 2012, but several other companies that did are either declining to do so this year or have greatly reduced their contributions.Wells Fargo, United Parcel Service, Motorola, JP Morgan Chase, Ford and Walgreens all contributed to the 2012 GOP convention in Tampa, Florida, and have announced they will not play a role in the convention in Cleveland this July, according to Bloomberg. The companies would not say what role Trump played in their decision.Hewlett Packard Inc., once a major Republican funder, announced at the end of May that it would be sitting out the Cleveland convention.Coca-Cola will be donating $75,000 to both parties’ conventions, a drop from its $660,000 donation to the Republican convention in 2012.Microsoft will provide technology and associated services to the convention in lieu of cash, even as it plans to give cash to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia later in July. The company donated money to the Republican convention, but not the Democratic one, in 2012.Other titans of the technology industry, which has a socially liberal reputation, will also be providing major in-kind contributions to the GOP convention in spite of protests by civil rights groups. Google, Facebook, Twitter and Cisco Systems will all be sponsoring the convention in that fashion. But activists aren't letting up.""Any company that wants to be on right side of history should follow Apple’s lead before it’s too late,” Robinson said.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

After many criticized Swift for staying silent on Orlando, while other celebrities paid tribute to the victims with powerful speeches and tearful pleas, the ""1989"" singer shared an Instagram post on Friday night to all those touched by the mass shooting. ""As you bury your loved ones this week,"" she wrote alongside a handwritten card with the names of the 49 people killed in the attack, ""please know that there are millions of us sending you love and our deepest sympathy in the face of this unthinkable and devastating tragedy.""Many people praised Swift for the powerful message in her mentions. But others were quick to address how her response only came after nearly a week of criticism from members of the queer community, who've supported the star throughout her career. And now all eyes turn to another LGBTQ fave who's remained silent in the wake of the shooting. What's good, Nicki Minaj? "

""Very simply, it works by staring at a star -- you can't see the planets directly, because they just reflect too little light or they're too close to their star. Now and again, the planet sometimes will pass in front of the star, blocking some of the star light for a short amount of time."" Essentially the star ""winks"" at us, the first visual clue that a planet may be passing in front of it. An advanced extraterrestrial race could, in a similar way, detect Earth as they see a dip in the brightness of our sun as our planet passes in front of it every 365 days on our orbital path.But there's a way Earth could make its appearance stand out to other civilizations -- and a way ETs could send an unmistakeable sign to Earth, Kipping said.""An alien civilization might choose to try and make their transit signature -- as seen by Earth -- look weird or funky. One thing they might do is turn on a laser beam and make any pattern they want in the transit signature,"" said Kipping.The kind of laser-created patterns Kipping talks about are geometric forms -- circles, squares, triangles, even a laser-based city skyline -- anything totally unexpected that our scientists, and the Kepler telescope, would notice.""This has lots of advantages,"" Kipping added. ""We are already looking for their signature. Somehow, if they follow the same path of detecting planets, they would perhaps assume this very simple method might be one way to broadcast themselves.""The idea of deliberately trying to make our presence known to other civilizations is the subject of some debate. Leading those who say Earth shouldn't reach out and say hello to the cosmos is renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, who warns that aliens might not have the best intentions for earthlings.With that in mind, Kipping and Columbia graduate student Alan Teachey wrote a paper explaining how laser technology may be useful to cloak our planet from the prying eyes of those in deep space who would do us harm.They put together this video to make their point:Are you for or against the idea of letting other advanced cultures know we're here?Kipping said the idea of whether humans are alone in the universe is perhaps our species' ultimate question.""Who can predict what possible benefits a confirmed signal would have? It's impossible for us to foresee how that could change our society,"" Kipping said. ""There's over 2,000 confirmed planets, and we definitely have examples, no matter how you slice and dice it, of planets which resemble Earth in the Kepler data.""To say that I hope, certainly it would be intellectually extremely interesting if we discovered something. In that sense, it would be fantastic."""
28,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Is On A Mission To Rebuild The Democratic Party,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-democratic-party_us_57645313e4b015db1bc95fd3,A 50-state strategy has been tried before. Her staff think they can do it right this time.,2016-06-18,"Howard Dean tried to build a 50-state strategy, but he faced pushback from his own party.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign will maintain staff in all 50 states during the general election with an eye toward overwhelming Republicans in the fall and rebuilding the Democratic Party's infrastructure thereafter.The strategy, described to The Huffington Post by Clinton campaign aides, is a continuation of the Ramp Up Grassroots Organizing program that the campaign applied to the Democratic primary. But unlike that approach -- which had the immediate objective of competing with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in each state contest -- the current one carries risk.Many states in which Clinton will be employing staff and spending resources will almost assuredly vote against her anyway. She could end up wasting money that is needed to win swing states. But her staffers say the investment is well worth it.""This is something that needs to happen every presidential cycle. It needs to be sustained. And I think if we continue to do that, we will help build the party long-term,"" said Marlon Marshall, the Clinton team's director of state campaigns and political engagement. ""I truly believe we have a historic candidacy with Secretary Clinton, and we can use this opportunity to bring more people into the party."" Democrats have long been divided over the efficacy of a 50-state strategy. When he took over the Democratic National Committee following the 2004 election, Howard Dean implemented an across-the-map approach to rebuilding the party, arguing that Democrats could only regain a foothold in lost territory if they put people there. Congressional leadership bristled, arguing that resources were better spent on toss-up races and not unwinnable contests in Mississippi or Alaska.Amid the celebratory mood following the party's gains in the 2006 election, those tensions spilled out in public. Dean was accused of ""Rumsfeldian"" incompetence for not capturing even more congressional seats. He and his defenders noted that the party had just taken back the Senate and the House.Dean stayed on at the DNC. Two years later, he found the ideal vessel for his vision. The presidential candidacy of Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) brought voter excitement, greater turnout and tangible investments in states that aren't traditionally Democratic strongholds. Obama not only won big over Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), but Democrats expanded their control of both chambers of Congress.But that proved to be a high-water mark. Since then, the party has lost control of the House and Senate, 12 governorships and more than 900 state legislative seats. Privately, Democratic officials have grumbled that the only elections Obama concerned himself with were his own. Obama's allies have countered that his grassroots organizing efforts helped produce legislative wins.Clinton has a different mindset on these matters than the man she's hoping to succeed. It is, in some respects, an extension of her lengthy history in the party, from her time in state government (as first lady of Arkansas) to her role at the White House and her tenure in the Senate. Aides say she recognizes how much thinner the Democratic bench has become over the last seven years -- having seen longtime allies lose their seats -- and wants the trend reversed.""I think it is important to lay a foundation for the future,"" said Marshall, who has worked in the Obama administration and pushed Dean's 50-state strategy as an organizing staff member in Kansas in 2005. ""State House members are going to be your next folks running for Congress or running for governor, and one of them may be your next president of the United States.""Clinton's approach is also born from a belief that institutions, more than personalities, form the basis for political progress -- that even the most moving rhetoric runs up against the procedural rules of the House and Senate.""The 50-state strategy worked. It gave us the majorities in the House and the Senate, and then it was abandoned because Obama chose to go with OFA [Organizing For Action], which did not work, and the DNC scaled way back on it,"" Dean, a supporter of and consultant to Clinton's campaign, told HuffPost. ""But I'm very pleased it is going to be rebuilt. I think they totally get that her legacy depends on having a Democratic Congress and that she has to start now.""The Clinton campaign isn't Pollyannaish about how a 50-state strategy will work. No one expects Oklahoma to be overrun with Democrats by November. But as her team and others see it, the benefits to having an expansive staff network are more immediate than flipping control of local chambers.""From a tactical perspective, this is going to be enormous for the Clinton campaign,"" said Mitch Stewart, founding partner of 270 Strategies and the battleground states director for the 2012 Obama campaign. He noted that an organizer in a traditionally Republican state could generate a network of volunteers who could be used to get out the vote in critical swing states.""You are generating capacity,"" Stewart said. ""Even if you have one person in Mississippi, voter contact ramps up the closer you get to the election, like a hockey stick. Let's say that one person has organized 10 phone banks. They will be generating phone calls all day. It won't turn that state blue because one person is there. But that volume will have an impact elsewhere.""Already, Clinton has made moves to put her plan into action. Her campaign has begun overhauling the DNC, with a lingering question of whether she will keep its current chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), in place.Her approach has the notable side effect of placating Sanders, who argued this past week that the party ""had turned its back on dozens of states in this country,"" allowing ""right-wing politicians to win elections in some states with virtually no opposition.""Clinton enjoys the benefit of having to add relatively few personnel for the general election. Many in-state staffers simply remained in place after their primary or caucus concluded. Their focus will now shift slightly toward organizing general election volunteers, hosting events, mobilizing turnout and registering voters. In time, the hope is, that work will provide the foundation for a President Clinton's governing agenda.""It can definitely be difficult in a state like Oklahoma to engage in a general election,"" Nicole McAfee, Clinton's Oklahoma organizer, told HuffPost. ""In the primary, it was a little different. But we have some really good volunteers. I want to see Oklahoma and Oklahoma Democrats feel stronger and more engaged in every election. It's a long-term project, but it is an incredibly important one."""

Be Patient With Them.,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/orlando-shooting-be-patient-with-community_us_57644fd8e4b0853f8bf0dccd,The massacre in Orlando was an assault on Queer America. And we're still reeling.,2016-06-18,"A man holds a candle during a vigil in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in memory of the victims of the Pulse gay nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, June 15, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587c50731700002e00fdec91.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It already feels so long ago. And yet, at the same time, like it just happened minutes ago.When I woke up to news of the shooting deaths of what initially were thought to be “about 20” victims at Pulse nightclub, a gay bar hosting a Latinx night in Orlando, Florida, on Sunday morning, my initial reaction was pure anger that America had allowed another mass shooting to take place.Later, it was confirmed that 49 people had already died in the shooting and at least 53 others were wounded in what some have deemed the deadliest mass shooting our nation has ever seen, at least in recent years. It was reported that the shooter, whom I refuse to name in this piece, was openly homophobic and racist despite repeatedly frequenting the gay nightclub prior to the shooting. He was familiar with his target and also pledged allegiance to a terrorist organization.None of these victims were blood family of mine. But they were family. That's how queer people used to refer to each other: ""Family."" And it still holds. All queer Americans lost dozens of family members in Orlando.As this story has continued to unfold throughout the week, my emotions as a queer-identified person living in this nation have been on a non-stop cycle — from sadness to apathy, full of fear one moment, full of rage the next. I haven’t been sleeping well, waking up in the middle of the night to make sure my windows are locked. I feel sick to my stomach, everything tastes salty. I can’t concentrate and I’m constantly on the verge of tears. My sweat somehow smells different.I feel like a different person. A sadder person, but maybe a less naive person. A more engaged and enraged person.Maybe that’s a good thing?On Monday, I was sitting at my desk in my office, trying to focus on my work. I typically report on food and water issues in America, and was attempting to work on stories that felt significant in those areas. Compared to the tragedy unfolding all around me, nothing seemed to pass that test.One moment, I found myself reading about Juan Ramon Guerrero and his boyfriend Christopher “Drew” Leinonen who reportedly planned to marry one day. They can’t do that now, because they were gunned down by a man with a history of domestic violence and being on a terror watch list who still managed to get his hands on a semi-automatic rifle designed for military use. Instead, their families are now planning a joint funeral.I burst immediately into tears, bolted from my desk and ran into one of my office’s private phone rooms, where I sobbed uncontrollably for 10 minutes. When I emerged puffy-eyed from the room, none of the 10 or so officemates I rushed past — I couldn’t accurately count them through my tears — asked me how I was doing or if I was all right.The answer, then, was “no.” The answer, still, is “no.” I’m sorry if that makes you uncomfortable to read if you're a well-meaning coworker or friend of mine, but it’s the truth.We’re expected, as queer people, to somehow proceed with our lives like nothing happened, but everything — at least for me — is harder to do. Even mundane tasks like getting the mail, walking down the street or returning a phone call. I feel uncertain and like I’m in a fog, forcing a smile or a laugh or an “I’m doing better” here or there.One of the hardest aspects of experiencing what happened in Orlando as a queer person in America is being reminded just how many people out there in this nation and world today still explicitly hate people like me and my queer brothers and sisters. Some are even celebrating the shooting. And no, I'm not talking about ""radicalized"" Muslims in a faraway land. Muslim leaders around the world have condemned Sunday's violence and I'm not about to pin one U.S.-born gunman's crime to an entire faith. I'm talking about born-and-raised Americans. I'm talking about our neighbors.In the days that have passed since the shooting, I’m also reminded of how many people simply don’t understand or care to learn how to begin to understand what it feels like to move through the world after experiencing this layer of trauma on top of the already overwhelming feelings of fear and grief.I do recognize my privilege as a white person who is read as male living in a city (Chicago) with a relatively visible and active queer community in all of this. I understand that for many people who do not look like me, particularly queer people of color, are already much more accustomed to these feelings of vulnerability and fear. It’s a privilege I’m attempting to reconcile as I hope I'm not contributing to a white-washing of this tragedy which explicitly targeted queer Latinx people.The bottom line is that no one should have to move through the world feeling this way. It’s unacceptable, and yet the expectation is that it’s time to move on. Time to stop crying and time to start healing, right?For me, that process truly started on Wednesday night at Burly, a monthly queer night in a “straight” bar in Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood that I co-host.Going into the night, I questioned what we would do if violence broke out at our queer enclave. I double-checked where the emergency exits were. I thought, for a very brief second, that maybe going ahead with the event in light of what happened in Orlando wasn’t the right decision.Very quickly, my co-organizers and I knew we’d made the right decision to move forward. The bar was packed all night as we danced to Drake and Selena, Whitney and Rihanna, Beyoncé and Donna. The night’s guest DJ, [X]P, helped flip the vibe of our typically low-key, candlelit party into a late-night rager. Queer nightlife has never been more needed or more important than it is right now. This is our church, this is our sanctuary.At the end of the night, we disassembled the tiny altar dedicated to the Orlando victims and distributed the flowers to our friends who had stayed and danced right up past last call. We collected our earnings from the bar, all of which were donated to the victims’ fund, and went home to join our loved ones in bed.That night, I went to bed genuinely smiling for the first time all week.But I’m still having a hard time. And I know many of my closest friends — my chosen family — still feel completely devastated. Even hopeless at times.So how long are we allowed to mourn? Is it one week? Because I’m going to need a lot longer than that. And I’m sure the same can be said for many other queer people as well as their loved ones and supporters. Please be patient with them. Be patient with us. Continue to check in. Something as simple as a text can go a lot further than just another Facebook post or retweet. Failure to do so can feel like an endorsement.It’s hard to know if you’re feeling “better” when you’re not even sure who “you” are anymore — you smell a little different now, you walk a little different now.Maybe we’ll never be the same again.Because you also love a little different now. Looking around at your queer family, as they’re tearing it up on a dance floor or holding their partner’s hand a little tighter, you feel closer to them than ever before. You hug them a little tighter. You laugh a little louder. You kiss longer and harder. You feel more determined than ever to make sure this never happens again.Maybe that’s a good thing."

When asked again what his name was, Mair calmly repeated: ""My name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain.""""Bearing in mind the name he has just given, he ought to be seen by a psychiatrist,"" Deputy Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot told the court.Mair, balding with a grey goatee beard, made no further comment in the 15-minute hearing, his first appearance in public since police arrested him in the town of Birstall, Yorkshire, where Coxwas killed.His brief comment in court furthered suggestions that the attack was politically-motivated as it echoed the message put forward by those supporting a so-called Brexit that leaving the EU would be a vote for freedom.The case is also being by handled by the counter-terrorism unit of Britain's Crown Prosecution Service.Prosecutor David Cawthorne told the court that those who witnessed the attack said Cox had been repeatedly stabbed and then shot three times as she lay on the ground.Her attacker was heard saying ""Britain first, Keep Britain independent, Britain always comes first,"" Cawthorne said. When he was arrested by police he told them ""I'm a political activist,"" the prosecutor told the court.Material relating to far right ideology was found in a search of his home, Cawthorne said.Mair is charged with murder, causing grievous bodily harm, and possession of a firearm and a knife. He was remanded in custody and will appear at London's Old Bailey court on Monday.The killing has shocked the nation. Both sides have temporarily suspended campaigning ahead of Thursday's vote, which has far reaching implications for both the EU and Britain.A British exit from the EU would rock the bloc - already shaken by differences over migration and the future of the euro zone - by ripping away its second-largest economy, one of its top two military powers and by far its richest financial center.Pro-Europeans, including former prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major, have warned that an exit could also trigger the break-up of the United Kingdom by prompting another Scottish independence vote if England pulled Scotland out of the EU.'VILE ACT'Prime Minister David Cameron joined Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Friday to lay flowers in Birstall.""It is a vile act that has killed her,"" Corbyn said.Cameron has agreed to recall parliament on Monday to allow lawmakers to pay tributes to the popular Member of Parliament (MP), who was only elected in 2015.The murder has sparked debate in Britain, which has strict gun controls, about the safety of lawmakers, the heightened tempo of political confrontation and any impact on the EU vote.Both sides in the referendum contest have put on hold their national campaigns until at least Sunday.Polls have suggested the vote hangs in the balance, but in the last week a series of surveys have indicated that the campaign to leave had been taking the lead.A telephone survey by BMG for Scotland's The Herald newspaper on Saturday showed the ""In"" camp on 53 percent and ""Out"" on 47 percent, although a separate online poll by BMG showed Out leading by 10 points, with 55 percent support compared to In's 45 percent.Both polls were carried out before the killing of Cox.Those wanting to stay in the EU can count on the support of many of Britain's biggest businesses, most economists and foreign leaders such as U.S. President Barack Obama, who spoke to Cox's husband on Friday to offer condolences.The International Monetary Fund, which has previously warned that Britain and the world economy could be hit by a so-called Brexit, said on Saturday an exit could leave Britain's economy more than 5 percent smaller by 2019.However, the ""Out"" campaign's message that EU membership is responsible for a loss of political control as well as uncontrolled immigration appears to have struck a chord.Members of the 'Out' campaign say Britain would prosper if it broke free from what they say is a doomed German-dominated bloc that punches way below its weight beside rivals such as Russian President Vladimir Putin.Both sides have accused each other of making up facts to support their case, and debates had become more heated and personal in the days before Cox's death, with London Mayor Sadiq Khan telling Sky News politics had become ""poisonous.""""The referendum was always about more than Europe; it was always about what kind of Britain we are and what we aspire to be,"" former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in Saturday's Guardian newspaper.""But some have attempted to hijack a decision on the future of Britain in Europe and turn it into a vote on immigration, and then on immigrants and those who support immigrants.""LAWMAKERS FEARSCox had arrived in Birstall for an advice session with constituents in a public library.Bernard Carter-Kenny, a 77-year-old who had taken his wife to the library, intervened to try to protect Cox after she was attacked and is in hospital after being stabbed in the stomach.Armed police patrol Westminster, where lawmakers do much of their work in parliament, but there is often no security in their home electoral districts, or constituencies.The last British lawmaker to have been killed was Ian Gow, who died after an Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb exploded under his car at his home in 1990.The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that women MPs had repeatedly raised concerns about their security with Cameron's office, with one writing to say if it was not improved there would be a ""tragic fatality.""Police have said they had reiterated advice and guidance to MPs, some of whom have canceled surgeries after the killing of Cox, a former charity worker whose job took her to countries such as Afghanistan and Darfur.In Birstall, hundreds of bouquets of flowers were laid in the town center with locals still stunned by what had happened.""Over the last few weeks the debate about Europe has not been what it should be,"" local vicar Paul Knight told Reuters.""We all recognize the exaggerations, hyperbole, and anger. And unless that changes, and we've only got a few days for that to change, then it's very sad.""I hope people reflecting on this will realize democracy actually means speaking, and not violence and not anger.""(Additional reporting by Paul Sandle; Writing by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Richard Balmforth)"

Both sides have temporarily suspended campaigning ahead of Thursday's vote, which has far reaching implications for both the EU and Britain.A British exit from the EU would rock the bloc - already shaken by differences over migration and the future of the euro zone - by ripping away its second-largest economy, one of its top two military powers and by far its richest financial center.Pro-Europeans, including former prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major, have warned that an exit could also trigger the break-up of the United Kingdom by prompting another Scottish independence vote if England pulled Scotland out of the EU.'VILE ACT'Prime Minister David Cameron joined Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Friday to lay flowers in Birstall.""It is a vile act that has killed her,"" Corbyn said.Cameron has agreed to recall parliament on Monday to allow lawmakers to pay tributes to the popular Member of Parliament (MP), who was only elected in 2015.The murder has sparked debate in Britain, which has strict gun controls, about the safety of lawmakers, the heightened tempo of political confrontation and any impact on the EU vote.Both sides in the referendum contest have put on hold their national campaigns until at least Sunday.Polls have suggested the vote hangs in the balance, but in the last week a series of surveys have indicated that the campaign to leave had been taking the lead.A telephone survey by BMG for Scotland's The Herald newspaper on Saturday showed the ""In"" camp on 53 percent and ""Out"" on 47 percent, although a separate online poll by BMG showed Out leading by 10 points, with 55 percent support compared to In's 45 percent.Both polls were carried out before the killing of Cox.Those wanting to stay in the EU can count on the support of many of Britain's biggest businesses, most economists and foreign leaders such as U.S. President Barack Obama, who spoke to Cox's husband on Friday to offer condolences.The International Monetary Fund, which has previously warned that Britain and the world economy could be hit by a so-called Brexit, said on Saturday an exit could leave Britain's economy more than 5 percent smaller by 2019.However, the ""Out"" campaign's message that EU membership is responsible for a loss of political control as well as uncontrolled immigration appears to have struck a chord.Members of the 'Out' campaign say Britain would prosper if it broke free from what they say is a doomed German-dominated bloc that punches way below its weight beside rivals such as Russian President Vladimir Putin.Both sides have accused each other of making up facts to support their case, and debates had become more heated and personal in the days before Cox's death, with London Mayor Sadiq Khan telling Sky News politics had become ""poisonous.""""The referendum was always about more than Europe; it was always about what kind of Britain we are and what we aspire to be,"" former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in Saturday's Guardian newspaper.""But some have attempted to hijack a decision on the future of Britain in Europe and turn it into a vote on immigration, and then on immigrants and those who support immigrants.""LAWMAKERS FEARSCox had arrived in Birstall for an advice session with constituents in a public library.Bernard Carter-Kenny, a 77-year-old who had taken his wife to the library, intervened to try to protect Cox after she was attacked and is in hospital after being stabbed in the stomach.Armed police patrol Westminster, where lawmakers do much of their work in parliament, but there is often no security in their home electoral districts, or constituencies.The last British lawmaker to have been killed was Ian Gow, who died after an Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb exploded under his car at his home in 1990.The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that women MPs had repeatedly raised concerns about their security with Cameron's office, with one writing to say if it was not improved there would be a ""tragic fatality.""Police have said they had reiterated advice and guidance to MPs, some of whom have canceled surgeries after the killing of Cox, a former charity worker whose job took her to countries such as Afghanistan and Darfur.In Birstall, hundreds of bouquets of flowers were laid in the town center with locals still stunned by what had happened.""Over the last few weeks the debate about Europe has not been what it should be,"" local vicar Paul Knight told Reuters.""We all recognize the exaggerations, hyperbole, and anger. And unless that changes, and we've only got a few days for that to change, then it's very sad.""I hope people reflecting on this will realize democracy actually means speaking, and not violence and not anger.""(Additional reporting by Paul Sandle; Writing by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Richard Balmforth)"

Lee Kaplan, 51, was found living with the teen, now 18, as his wife, along with 11 younger girls, when a neighbor’s tip sent child welfare workers and police to his small Bucks County house on Thursday, police said. He was jailed under $1 million bail on charges of statutory sexual assault and corrupting the morals of minors. ""We kept finding more children,"" Lower Southampton police Lt. John Krimmel told The Philadelphia Inquirer. “It's just a crazy situation.""Police also arrested the girl’s parents, who they said were Amish, as they began peeling back the story of how so many children wound up in the house. Daniel Stoltzfus, who told investigators he had researched the legality of giving away his daughter on the internet, was charged with conspiracy to commit statutory sexual assault and child endangerment. Savilla Stoltzfus, who investigators said acknowledged she knew of her daughter's sexual relationship with Kaplan, was charged with child endangerment. The children included a 3-year-old and 6-month-old, who the 18-year-old girl said were hers, fathered by Kaplan, according to court documents cited by NBC-10. Authorities said the girls all appeared in good health and were in protective custody together. The Stoltzfuses told detectives the nine other girls found in the house all were their children, Bucks County District Attorney David Heckler told WPVI-TV. ""But I don't know if we believe them,"" Heckler added. He said some of the girls had positive comments about Kaplan, but appeared to be “brainwashed.”The Stoltzfuses told police they were losing their Lancaster County farm until Kaplan ""came out of the blue and saved them from financial ruin,"" Heckler told The Associated Press. The criminal complaint says Daniel Stoltzfus told police the couple gave their child to Kaplan four years ago as thanks.Neighbor Jan Betz told WPVI she complained about the house after repeatedly seeing girls there -- always wearing blue dresses and looking afraid.""I saw a couple girls last week standing in the driveway,"" Betz told the station. ""They just looked unhappy and sad, and again in the blue dresses, and I've been telling my husband for years something isn't right."""
