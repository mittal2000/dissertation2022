2,MEDIA,Republican Debate Demands Threaten Networks' Editorial Control,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-debate-demands-tv-networks_us_56369136e4b0c66bae5ccc38,"Requests include barring reaction shots of the audience and ending ""lighting rounds.""",2015-11-02,GOP presidential candidates and their campaigns are setting a number of requirements for TV networks in future debates.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Republican presidential campaigns may require TV networks that sponsor future debates to follow a set of restrictions that would threaten editorial control, including barring certain camera angles and styles of questions, and requiring pre-approval for on-screen graphics. The 15 campaigns’ requests, a draft of which was published Monday by The Washington Post, could also affect who is chosen to moderate the debates. Campaigns say they will consider the “quality and fairness” of moderators’ questions in previous debates to determine if they’ll participate in a network's future contests.A dozen Republican campaigns met Sunday night to discuss the path forward in response to last week’s widely panned CNBC debate and their growing frustration with how the Republican National Committee has handled the debate process this election cycle.Ben Ginsberg, a Republican lawyer and past debate negotiator who led Sunday’s meeting, provided the campaigns with a draft of the letter at the start of the summit and has now updated it with additional concerns the campaigns aired during the gathering. The latest draft of Ginsberg's letter may change, with a final version expected to be agreed upon and sent to the networks this week.Most of the requests are reasonable and unlikely to cause any friction with the networks. The campaigns understandably want to know what criteria the networks are using to decide which candidates are included, how the debate will be aired and distributed, the names of the moderators and other individuals asking questions, and the onstage setup, including whether candidates will use lecterns or sit at a table. They also want to know the time limits on responses to questions and rebuttals. Meanwhile, they are asking networks to agree to a minimum time limit of 30 seconds for opening and closing statements, and to keep the debate hall temperature set at 67 degrees -- a request that comes after candidates complained of excessively hot conditions in past debates. But other requests are more problematic, since the TV networks producing the debates are reluctant to give up any control over the direction of the broadcast.For instance, campaigns would ask the networks to pledge not to use some specific camera shots, including reaction shots of members of the audience and moderators, as well as shots from behind the candidates that show their notes.The campaigns are also demanding the right to pre-approve graphics and candidates' on-screen bios, and are asking to ban the practice of “lighting rounds,"" which they say are frivolous and possess a ""gotcha"" nature. In addition, the campaigns want each candidate to receive equal speaking time and an equal number of questions -- a requirement that would constrain how moderators conduct the debate and would also be difficult to enforce, since rivals may mention a specific candidate, who would then receive more opportunities to offer a rebuttal, and thus, more speaking time. The campaigns also want “equal quality” of questions for each candidate, a subjective metric that would be hard to enforce. These requests would go into effect after the next Republican debate on Nov. 10 on Fox Business Network. Fox News, CNN, ABC and CBS are currently slated to sponsor future Republican debates, while NBC's February event was suspended after Republican campaigns criticized last week's CNBC debate.

3,POLITICS,Elizabeth Warren Warns Democrats Against Wall Street Defections,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-democrats-wall-street_us_5637c0c7e4b0c66bae5d5196,The influential senator urged her colleagues to hold the line against big banks.,2015-11-02,Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is a fierce Wall Street critic.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5637c2181800002b003039b6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Monday warned House Democrats to oppose a series of GOP-backed bills designed to roll back the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation.Warren posted a statement on her official Facebook page calling on Democrats to vote against the Republican proposals, which are scheduled for a vote in the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday.""Democrats must stand strong and fight back Republican efforts to weaken oversight,"" Warren wrote. ""Rolling back the rules on our largest and riskiest institutions is a terrible idea for just about everyone except a handful of well-connected financial firms – and we weren’t sent here to work for them.""Warren's post is an effort to persuade Wall Street-friendly Democrats, who have defected from the party line to undercut other financial reforms. In 2014, Republicans secured a measure to reinstate federal subsidies for derivatives trades -- the risky contracts at the heart of the 2008 meltdown. They did so by slipping the measure into a must-pass government funding bill on the grounds that it wasn't terribly controversial, since many Democrats had supported the provision in committee. The bills that will be under consideration Tuesday deal with large financial firms deemed ""systemically important"" by key regulators -- essentially firms that are ""too big to fail."" The legislation would make it harder to designate a firm as ""systemically important"" by gumming up the process with additional red tape. Republicans also want to bring the Financial Stability Oversight Council under the Congressional appropriations process, which would allow Republicans to defund the agency or hold its budget hostage with demands over specific rules or actions.While Democrats have become more reluctant to attack Dodd-Frank since the 2014 derivatives fight, a few serial advocates of deregulation have already signed on to the Republican bills as co-sponsors, including Reps. David Scott (D-Ga.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and John Delaney (D-Md.).Warren has been a key ally of Wall Street watchdogs on the House side, teaming up with the top-ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), to help generate public opposition to the derivatives fight. Dodd-Frank opponents, however, frequently take her words out of context -- along with those of former Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) -- to build their case for weakening the law. Putting out an explicit public statement helps Warren clarify her position.Read Warren's full post here.Zach Carter is The Huffington Post's senior political economy reporter and a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast, ""So That Happened.""

Steve King (R-Iowa) gets his way. The immigration hawk's office circulated a bill on Monday that would authorize U.S. Capitol Police to help enforce immigration laws. The ""Ending the Sanctuary Capitol Policy"" has the specific aim of targeting protesters, according to an email sent to House offices by King legislative director Jared Culver.King introduced the bill on Wednesday with six Republican cosponsors: Louie Gohmert and Lamar Smith of Texas, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, Paul Gosar of Arizona and Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania.King said in a statement that ""the lawlessness of the Obama administration ... has even invaded the Capitol grounds where the laws are written,"" making clear the bill was about targeting protesters.""The Capitol Police, a federal law enforcement agency, do not have explicit statutory authority to enforce our immigration laws,"" he continued. ""Without clear authority they are not investigating the immigration status of protesters openly claiming they are here illegally while disrupting Committee proceedings and shutting down Congressional offices.""""Any office that has been flooded with protesters calling for amnesty realize how the current environment encourages fearless protest no matter the legal status of the protester,"" he wrote.The email was shared with The Huffington Post by a recipient and confirmed by another recipient. Neither Culver nor a spokeswoman for King responded to a request for comment.King is a frequent target of immigration reform protests, including a cantaloupe delivery in 2013 after he infamously said many young undocumented immigrants have ""calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.""He tried earlier this year to add an amendment to an enforcement bill that would allow Capitol Police to apprehend people based on immigration status, but it was left out of the legislation. GOP members of both chambers are pushing to end so-called sanctuary policies where police do not fully cooperate with deportation efforts. The House voted in July to strip federal law enforcement grants for those jurisdictions, while the Senate blocked a similar bill last month.UPDATE: Nov. 4 -- King introduced the bill on Wednesday with six Republican cosponsors: Louie Gohmert and Lamar Smith of Texas, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, Paul Gosar of Arizona and Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania.King said in a statement that ""the lawlessness of the Obama administration ... has even invaded the Capitol grounds where the laws are written,"" making clear the bill was about targeting protesters.""The Capitol Police, a federal law enforcement agency, do not have explicit statutory authority to enforce our immigration laws,"" he continued.

6,POLITICS,Anthony Kennedy's Citizens United Disclosure Salve 'Not Working',Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/citizens-united-anthony-kennedy_us_5637c481e4b0631799134b92,"The author of the controversial opinion should have known, even in 2010, that his ""instant disclosure"" fix didn't exist.",2015-11-02,"Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy says that disclosure is ""not working the way it should"" in the wake of his 2010 Citizens United opinion.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5637c7de2900002f004dbf2f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- When Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy penned the 2010 Citizens United decision allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited sums of money on elections, he did so with a promise that instant disclosure of election spending over the Internet would be enough to prevent corruption.“With the advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters,” Kennedy wrote in the decision.The problem with Kennedy’s belief in instant online disclosure is that, at the time of his opinion, plenty of loopholes in campaign finance disclosure law already made it possible to cover up unlimited spending. Many opponents of Kennedy’s majority opinion noted this at the time.Now, Kennedy has admitted that his belief in disclosure hasn’t turned out the way he thought it would.In an interview with Harvard Law School dean Martha Minow last week, which can be viewed below, Kennedy defended his Citizens United ruling. “You live in this cyber age. A report can be done in 24 hours,” he said. But he also added that disclosure is “not working the way it should.”Disclosure didn’t work the way Kennedy thought it would because instant disclosure laws do not exist for the supposedly independent corporate and union spending that Citizens United allowed. Further, corporations and unions can spend undisclosed ""dark money"" on elections through nonprofit corporations, which are not subject to campaign finance disclosure laws due to a prior Supreme Court ruling and a Federal Election Commission rule change in 2007 that eliminated a key reporting requirement.Transparency about non-candidate spending on independent electoral efforts decreased for several years after that. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, fully disclosed independent spending fell from 65 percent of all independent spending in the 2008 election cycle to 48 percent in 2010 and 40 percent in 2012. It recovered to 59 percent in 2014, but dark money continues to finance many election races.Disclosure of Independent Spending, 1990-2016Source: Center for Responsive Politics. Forty-three percent of the $35.6 million of independent spending in the 2014 Kentucky Senate race between Sen. Mitch McConnell (R) and Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D) came from undisclosed sources. Thirty-one percent of all independent spending in Colorado’s 2014 Senate race came from non-disclosing groups, and dark money accounted for one-quarter of independent spending in the 2014 Alaska, Georgia and North Carolina Senate campaigns.It should have been completely clear to the justices hearing the Citizens United case that granting corporations the right to spend unlimited sums on elections would lead to decreased transparency in election finances. The case centered on a conservative nonprofit organization called Citizens United that wanted to use corporate funds it had raised to create a negative documentary about Hillary Clinton, who was running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2007. The group planned to offer the documentary as an on-demand option on DirecTV and to run advertisements to promote it. The Federal Election Commission determined that the advertisements and documentary were express advocacy against a candidate that could not be funded with corporate money.Justices on the court should have known that a nonprofit organization like Citizens United was not required to disclose its corporate donors. This is not only because nonprofits have been largely protected from targeted disclosures of their membership rolls since the 1958 NAACP v. Alabama decision, but also because the FEC loosened disclosure rules enacted in the 2002 McCain-Feingold reform law in 2007.That year, the court ruled in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. that corporations could fund so-called “electioneering communications” (which name a candidate without explicitly calling for their election or defeat within a certain timeframe prior to an election). The FEC responded by gutting a disclosure provision from the McCain-Feingold law that required groups to disclose their donors when reporting independent spending. The new rule mandated disclosure of donors only if they gave money to run a specific ad or other election effort. Contributions to a group with no stated purpose from the donor would no longer need to be disclosed. This FEC rule is now being challenged in court by Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).While Kennedy may now bemoan that disclosure post-Citizens United is “not working the way it should,” he should have known that his imagined disclosure regime was not working before the decision, either."

The Democratic front-runner said she was disturbed by the video of former Spring Valley High School resource officer Ben Fields manhandling a 16-year-old student known only as Shakara. “The adults in a school should be modeling appropriate behavior to deal with any disciplinary issues that might arise, and that was clearly not the case in the incident we have seen in the school in South Carolina,” she said.Critics have characterized Fields' actions as assault, and the footage has led the FBI and Department of Justice to launch investigations into his conduct. Fields, who was also a sheriff's deputy in Richland County, South Carolina, was fired Wednesday after a 48-hour investigation.Todd Rutherford, a South Carolina congressman and Shakara’s attorney, told the New York Daily News that the girl is currently in foster care. Fields, who is known around school as “Officer Slam,” was called into the classroom because Shakara was, allegedly, being disruptive and wouldn’t put away her cell phone fast enough during math class. Clinton said school administrators and teachers should develop alternative measures to handle students who are being “difficult.” “I don’t know the facts around the young woman who was thrown to the floor -- as we all saw -- but whatever the facts are, it doesn’t justify behavior like that,” she said. “And it’s important that we all take a deep breath here and try to understand better how to deal with kids who may have different challenges in their lives, and they need to be addressed in a more effective way.”Black students are suspended and expelled from schools three times as often as their white peers. For black girls, the rate is twice that much. In South Carolina, black students make up 36 percent of the state’s total enrolled student population but they make up 60 percent of those suspended from school. “I know a lot of adults complain that kids aren’t as respectful, that they don’t follow authority. Well, the fact is we are responsible in many ways for modeling the behavior we want from our children,” Clinton said, addressing the crux of arguments supporting Fields' handling of Shakara. “And people in positions of authority -- particularly teachers, police officers, etc. -- we need to take a very hard look about how we deal with the problems kids have today, and try to help children where they are. And if they’re acting out, there’s a lot of alternatives to picking them up and throwing them on the ground.”Clinton also responded to the criticism that she is taking the black vote for granted. “Not at all,” she said. Student activists interrupted Clinton’s speech unveiling her criminal justice platform last week at Clark Atlanta University. Two of the students told The Huffington Post that they believe Clinton is only offering rhetoric and no concrete solutions to the issue of mass incarceration. But Clinton said Monday that the purpose of her speech was to present her solutions for black America’s issues -- such as police reform, mass incarceration, education, health care and employment along with rebuilding and empowering marginalized communities. “People in general -- this is not about any particular community -- but people in general right now in our country are turned off by politics. Some of them have given up on politics. They are discouraged or disappointed,” she said. “And I have a big task in front of me to really convince people that it matters who is elected -- what our goals are; what our experiences are; what we want to do to try to empower and enable people from all walks of life to live out their own dreams … So I’m not taking anybody for granted, and I’m not taking any issue for granted.”Listen to the entire interview:"

Prop. 1, known as Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance -- or HERO, for short -- is a broad civil rights measure that would protect people from discrimination on the basis of race, age, military status, disability and 11 other categories. (Religious organizations and institutions would be exempt from the requirements.) The protections for sexual orientation and gender identity have attracted the most attention and controversy.Opponents of the measure are using the slogan ""No men in women's bathrooms."" They argue that men will take advantage of the transgender protections and invade ""a safe space for women and girls,"" in the words of one Houston-area pastor. Conservative activists attempting to sink the ballot measure -- dubbed the ""bathroom ordinance"" -- have aggressively pushed this message. In August, they released a radio ad featuring an unidentified woman who said she was pregnant and worried about raising a child in the city. ""There are already federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination against pregnant women but this ordinance will allow men to freely go into women's bathrooms, locker rooms and showers,"" the woman in the ad said. ""That is filthy, that is disgusting and that is unsafe.""The most recent TV spot released by the anti-Prop. 1 coalition Campaign for Houston shows a man entering a bathroom stall with a young girl.

""And the ad leaves out the fact that the law protects tens of thousands of Houstonians from job discrimination based on their race, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability.""Other Texas cities that have adopted LGBT protections have said they haven't seen an increase in sexual assaults in women's restrooms.Prop. 1's biggest backer is Houston Mayor Annise Parker (D), a lesbian who has been a vocal supporters LGBT rights and is in her final term in office. Parker has four adopted children -- a son who is black and three daughters who are mixed race -- and has noted that the ordinance would also affect them.""It is personal, and it's not only personal because of sexual orientation,"" Parker told the Los Angeles Times. The Houston city council narrowly approved the equal rights ordinance last year, but after a petition drive by anti-gay activists, the Texas Supreme Court ordered the city in July to either repeal it or put it on the November ballot.The fight has attracted national attention, with Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton both tweeting their support for the measure.A slew of celebrities, national companies and local businesses have also spoken out in favor of Prop. 1.""Apple is proud to be a part of Houston with four stores that employ over 500 people,"" the company said in a statement last week. ""Our stores and our company are open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love. Apple supports Proposition 1 as it sends a clear message that Houston is focused on a future of inclusion, diversity and continued prosperity.""Many local businesses fear that the city could see a backlash if it rejects the measure, similar to what Indiana experienced when Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed an anti-gay ""religious freedom"" law. Pence eventually signed a revised version of the measure.There is no federal law protecting LGBT individuals from discrimination, although a group of lawmakers introduced a bill in July that would provide comprehensive protections. Early voting, which ended on Oct. 30, has been particularly strong in conservative and African-American areas, which political scientists note could be bad news for Prop. 1 supporters.

Parker has four adopted children -- a son who is black and three daughters who are mixed race -- and has noted that the ordinance would also affect them.""It is personal, and it's not only personal because of sexual orientation,"" Parker told the Los Angeles Times. The Houston city council narrowly approved the equal rights ordinance last year, but after a petition drive by anti-gay activists, the Texas Supreme Court ordered the city in July to either repeal it or put it on the November ballot.The fight has attracted national attention, with Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton both tweeting their support for the measure.A slew of celebrities, national companies and local businesses have also spoken out in favor of Prop. 1.""Apple is proud to be a part of Houston with four stores that employ over 500 people,"" the company said in a statement last week. ""Our stores and our company are open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love. Apple supports Proposition 1 as it sends a clear message that Houston is focused on a future of inclusion, diversity and continued prosperity.""Many local businesses fear that the city could see a backlash if it rejects the measure, similar to what Indiana experienced when Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed an anti-gay ""religious freedom"" law. Pence eventually signed a revised version of the measure.There is no federal law protecting LGBT individuals from discrimination, although a group of lawmakers introduced a bill in July that would provide comprehensive protections. Early voting, which ended on Oct. 30, has been particularly strong in conservative and African-American areas, which political scientists note could be bad news for Prop. 1 supporters.

10,BUSINESS,HP CEO Says That Carly Fiorina Is Not Qualified To Be President,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meg-whitman-carly-fiorina-president_us_56376f54e4b0c66bae5ced9f,"""Literally having some experience in politics is probably an important criteria,"" Meg Whitman says.",2015-11-02,Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman says Carly Fiorina's lack of political experience pretty much disqualifies her for the job of president.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56377de914000093013c9a5c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Current Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman doesn’t think former HP CEO Carly Fiorina is qualified to be president because the Republican contender has no political experience.“I just think literally having some experience in politics is probably an important criteria for the highest office in the land,” Whitman told CNN over the weekend. “I think it's very difficult for your first role in politics to be president of the United States. I think having experience in the Senate or as the governor of a state is really important. It’s just hard to be dropped down in Washington, D.C. never having experience in politics before.”Indeed, only five U.S. presidents have landed the job without prior electoral experience -- Ulysses Grant, Zachary Taylor, William Taft, Herbert Hoover and Dwight Eisenhower. Whitman’s been running HP since 2011, when she took on the role after a run of disastrous leadership at the struggling computer maker, and she is now preparing to split the company into two publicly traded entities. She’s probably most well-known for leading eBay from a startup to a booming auction site, but she did try her hand at politics in a failed run for governor of California. That's another thing she has in common with Fiorina, who lost a bid for senator in California in 2010. Whitman also happens to be backing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in his bid for the presidential nomination. He’s not exactly the leading candidate for the role, and Whitman has declined to say who she will ultimately support in next year’s election.There’s little evidence that business experience is a critical skill for U.S. presidents. Historically, the presidents with the most business experience have presided over periods of slow economic growth, according to an analysis from Robert McElvaine, a history professor at Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi. “The startling bottom line is that the nation’s GDP has grown more than 45 times faster under presidents with little or no business experience than it has under presidents with successful business careers,” McElvaine wrote in The Washington Post in 2012.Fiorina and rival Donald Trump, however, have made business experience the cornerstone of their campaigns. In last week’s GOP presidential debate, Fiorina said the chief executives of public companies are held to a higher level of accountability than those in political office. “I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail,” she said. “If I misrepresented those results in any way I was held criminally liable. Imagine if a politician was held to that standard of account.” Fiorina was fired from her job as CEO of HP in 2005, after struggling to manage the tech company through the dot-com bust and presiding over a huge drop in the company's stock price. As CEO she engineered a merger with Compaq betting that scaling up into an even bigger computer maker would save the business. HP has been struggling to recover from the disastrous tie-up ever since. The problem was that Fiorina apparently failed to understand the direction of the PC business -- it was increasingly becoming commodified. Desktop computers were getting cheaper and less profitable. HP competitor IBM simply got out of the market entirely. Prior to holding the CEO position at HP, Fiorina held a top role at telecom company Lucent.CORRECTION: There have been five presidents without prior electoral experience. An earlier version omitted Taft and Hoover."
