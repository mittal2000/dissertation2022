Initially, the CDC and local health officials were looking at as many as 100 people who may have had direct or indirect contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, who was diagnosed with Ebola earlier this week.“After reaching out to those individuals, there’s now approximately 50 individuals that we feel we need to follow on a daily basis,” David Lakey, M.D., commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, said in a press conference. Most of these 50 people are considered at low risk for Ebola; they range from people in the community, to potential contacts in the hospital. However, there are 10 individuals who are considered at “high risk.” “We continue to watch those individuals very carefully,” Lakey said. None of these 50 people have shown any symptoms of Ebola. High-risk individuals who are being monitored are visited daily by a member of the public health team, who checks their temperature twice a day. Meanwhile, low-risk individuals who are being monitored have no travel restrictions in place, and are being monitored daily with a phone call and a self-check. There are certain people who are considered “high risk” who work in the health care field, who are currently on furlough from work with pay. The high number of potentially exposed people is due to health officials casting a “wide net,” said Beth Bell, M.D., M.P.H., the director of the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. “We have a very low bar for deciding to follow patients,” Bell said in the press conference, adding that most of the 50 people being monitored really do have a low risk of having been infected with Ebola. “But contact tracing really is the pivotal component for responding to Ebola cases, and we think that it’s prudent to continue to check in with these people during the 21 day incubation period just so we know how we’re doing.” Unfortunately, there's nothing that can really be done before symptoms of Ebola have set in to lessen the virus's impact, if any of these 50 people are in fact infected. However, these people have been educated on the symptoms to be on the look out for, as well as the importance of early medical attention, Bell said. "

Ponchartrain Park was designated one of the fastest growing neighborhoods post-Hurricane Katrina, thanks in no small part to Pierce's nonprofit organization, and his grocery business, Sterling Farms, has expanded across the South to provide fresh food to underserved areas. In the first part of our extended interview, Pierce shares his motivation for taking on the difficult issue of food access.JBF: You started off with a focus on rebuilding your neighborhood of Ponchartrain Park after Katrina. Were you thinking about food access then? Or did it come later?WP: Absolutely not. Wasn't thinking about it at all, wasn't conscious of it to any degree. No, I was just focused on rebuilding my neighborhood. But then I started to I started to look at the variables of why there was so much commercial property and opportunities that were sitting abandoned as a part of the recovery, and I realized that New Orleans was a food desert even prior to the storm.As I was trying to bring back the commercial district, I realized that grocery stores are a major anchor for any sort of commercial development, and then I saw the lack of grocery stores in underserved communities in New Orleans. I educated myself about food access, and realized that the private sector was standing on the sidelines. So I kind of backed into it. Business 101, you see a need, you fill it. You either innovate something that's never been done before, or you fill the need that is there. You look back through all of the dark periods of Wall Street and the recessions and depressions of America. The one thing that is constant is that food is necessary. It does well across all socio-economic communities. So that's how I got into the fresh food business, that's how I became aware of the problems of food inequity and lack of access.JBF: You chose to start a business, rather than continue to do nonprofit work. Why work in the private sector? WP: It was an opportunity to try to deal with an important issue at the same time as creating a business, and I thought that would be more attractive to get the partners I needed to work with me. But the solution's on both sides. I look at the nonprofit world, what's happening in this area, and it's just phenomenal. A lot of times it's the private sector that's missing the boat, and it's seen in the response from people, in these underserved communities, who for years have demonstrated loyalty to brands and to different stores. They'll travel half an hour, usually on public transportation, just to go buy groceries.One of my business mentors is Magic Johnson. He's proven to the American corporate industry that underserved or low-income communities will buy it if you bring it to them. One of Starbucks's biggest stores in New York is right there on 125th Street, and it's because Magic Johnson brought it in. If we can look at China and India as emerging markets, we can look at our underserved communities, rural and urban, and see them as emerging markets, too. That's the reason I chose to try to deal with it through a business. I saw it as an emerging market, and not as the target of a nonprofit where so much time and energy goes into fundraising.JBF: Why do you think these food deserts exist in New Orleans, a city with such a vibrant culinary culture?WP: Companies are ignoring opportunities and giving in to prejudice -- and the companies that don't give in are all the poorest choices: the fast food, the processed foods. We allow our prejudices and our insecurities to color what would and wouldn't work in certain communities. Who says that someone from these areas wouldn't love a grocery store like Whole Foods or Trader Joes? I'm in California right now, I tell you, if you brought Tender Greens into those communities people would go to Tender Greens. Why? Because it's all about taste. It's all about ingredients, isn't it? The barometer by which you judge cuisine is the same: does it taste good or not? And people would eat cardboard if you made it taste like coq au vin. Before we even think about people's behavior, let's give the people a choice. We have all these solutions that are out there, and now we need to actualize them and magnify them.Check back during Health Month for the next installment of our in-depth interview with Wendell Pierce.Maggie Borden is assistant editor at the James Beard Foundation.

This is HuffPost Entertainment's premiere podcast episode, ""Bootycast.""Sir Mix-A-Lot cannot lie, which is why he's such an invaluable commentator on the subject of booty in popular culture. The rapper's beloved hit ""Baby Got Back"" was recently sampled by Nicki Minaj for her song, ""Anaconda,"" and he's often cited as helping start a ""trend,"" which maybe isn't really a trend at all (despite what Vogue might have some believe).""The black, female body was not accepted as the norm anywhere. For years, all you saw on television was overweight black maids or black women who would assimilate to white culture, as far as the look is concerned,"" Sir Mix-A-Lot, whose real name is Anthony Ray, told HuffPost Entertainment during the first episode of our podcast. ""I wanted to do something that was tongue-in-cheek but, at the same time, making a real point.""That was ""Baby Got Back,"" which was followed in the landscape by other booty focused hits by, among others, Juvenile, Sisqo, and Trina, whose song ""Pull Over"" was one of the first to tackle the subject from the female perspective.""When I did the song, I wasn't trying to speak for women. Because I knew black women were proud of what they had. When women, like Trina stepped to the forefront, you'll notice I curtailed my message,"" Sir Mix-A-Lot said. ""I didn't have to speak anymore because the actual, African-American queens were speaking for themselves. Coming from a woman, it was far more powerful than coming from me. Coming from me, it can be confused as sexist. Coming from a woman you know it was real.""For a further look at the topic, check out Lauren Duca's piece, ""Actually, Vogue, The Era Of The Big Booty Began A Long Ass Time Ago.""

But all this stimulation could be having a damaging effect on the brain. At the Thrive CEO Summit at AdWeek on Wednesday, leading neuroscientist Richard Davidson told host Arianna Huffington that the way we live today has led to a ""national attention deficit."" ""I think if we're all honest about it, we all suffer from attention deficit disorder, and it's in part attributable to the kind of exposure we have to digital devices,"" Davidson, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told Huffington, the editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post. ""The kind of feedback that we get from them is immediate feedback and it's highly reinforcing, so it becomes like a drug. And in fact, it co-opts the same brain systems that are indicated in addiction."" This underscores the immense need for antidotes, like mindfulness and stress-relieving practices. But we don't need to eliminate technology to improve our relationship with it, according to Davidson. We can actually turn to digital tools, like social media-blocking plug-ins and meditation apps, to help us use technology more mindfully. ""A combination of the ancient wisdom using simple meditation practices, along with using digital devices to help us and remind us [to unplug], can be a very effective combination,"" said Davidson. "

The Great March for Climate Action started in LA on March 1st and is slowly making its way across the country to arrive in Washington, DC on November 1st. You can look up their path on this 3,000-mile journey and join them for a part of the way, or attend one of their events. The stated goal of the march is to ""change the heart and mind of the American people, our elected leaders, and people across the world to act now to address the climate crisis"". Last week another march, the People's Climate March, rallied an estimated 400,000 participants who voiced their concerns with climate inaction by taking to the streets in New York City. The message was received by the President, who made mention of the march in his speech at the U.N. last Tuesday. But while the words spoken by world leaders at the U.N. climate summit may have been more committing to solving the climate crisis than in the past, words are still cheap, and the abhorrent lack of leadership on this issue goes back decades. When President Obama has failed to take significant action to help preserve a livable planet, it is hardly surprising considering that the solutions necessary at this late stage run contrary to the interests of the few who profit most from our consumption driven, high growth dependent economy. The same dirty energy companies interested in maintaining the status quo have successfully stalled meaningful action to reduce carbon emissions and avoid catastrophic climate disruption by means of their significant political influence. Already today, Earth's changing climate is costing the global economy $1.2 trillion a year, but much worse, killing 1,000 children a day, according to a report by DARA. The annual death toll stands at 400,000 people worldwide and most of the casualties are ""due to hunger and communicable diseases that affect above all children in developing countries"" concludes the study. As global warming intensifies in the coming years, the death toll could rise to 700,000 a year by 2030. As is always the case when disaster hits, it is first and foremost the poor who are dying, and more specifically it is the children and women who are paying the steepest price for two centuries of indulgence with fossil fuels, which has primarily benefited the more developed parts of the world. Although most of human suffering and economic damage is happening in the world's poorest nations, nobody will be insulated from the effects and climate impact could cut the U.S. GNP by 2% by 2030. A new study, partly sponsored by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, has highlighted the prospect that global industrial civilization could collapse in coming decades due to unsustainable resource exploitation and increasingly unequal wealth distribution.In her latest book, This Changes Everything, Canadian journalist and writer Naomi Klein reasons that solving the climate crisis will require switching to local, renewable energy production that will break the control on power of entrenched dirty energy companies. She also postulates that this is an opportunity to create a new economy that depends less on unregulated exploitation of resources and people, and more on producing services and values to benefit the many, close the gap between rich and poor, and reinvigorate democracy from the ground up.The only way to stave off the most catastrophic climate disruptions and preserve a livable environment for humans on Earth is to stop burning fossil fuels, and leave 80% of the known carbon reserves in the ground. We have to realize that this flies in the face of the business plans of the major players in the carbon economy, not least the companies that control the major coal, oil, and gas reserves in the world. They are hell-bent on extracting all that carbon and selling it to us at increasing prices, no matter what the consequences are, and we have to stop them. Efforts to divest from carbon are championed by organizations like 350.org, working for example with student organizations to get universities to stop funding fossil fuels. If you have your own investments, ask your financial advisor whether dirty power is included in your portfolio. For a greener 401K alternative, check out Social(k).Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in the largest climate march ever on September 21st to tell the fossil fuel industry to back off. The march sent a clear message to elected officials in the U.S. and abroad that the people wants carbon regulated, and the transition to renewable energy sources can't move fast enough.Head in the sand doesn't solve the climate change issue. It's time to face it with all that it takes. I'm happy to report that my company, USAgain, was represented by a small contingent at the climate march in New York, and I know more, including myself, would have liked to be there. There will be more opportunities. We understand the marching isn't over yet. The fight for a cleaner and better future is just starting to heat up."

The mailer provided a phone number and urged voters to call Fisher personally to tell him what they thought of the health care law. The phone number on the mailer, however, is a direct line to Fisher’s 91-year-old mother in a nursing home. According to the Gazette, the number is registered to Fisher, but connects directly to his mother's room.“To direct people to call a suffering woman who deserves peace and comfort is beyond the pale,"" Fisher said in a statement to the Gazette. ""Their lack of ethics and contempt for personal privacy is just another reason for people to question what –- or better, who –- the Republican Party stands for, so that they can make a wise decision at the ballot box on Nov. 4.""Fisher’s Republican opponent, Kalamazoo County Commissioner Brandt Iden, said his campaign had nothing to do with the mailing. Fisher called on Iden to denounce the state GOP. Representatives from the Michigan Republican Party did not return a request for comment.This isn’t the first time this election cycle that the privacy of a candidate’s family has been jeopardized. In May, a man was arrested after he allegedly broke into a nursing home and took photos of the bedridden wife of U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.). The photos were allegedly used in an ad against Cochran that was eventually removed from the Internet. "

""This campaign against violent extremism predates our administration and it will outlive our administration.""He also said that ultimately, the Islamic State militants posed little risk to the United States.""Our response must be deadly serious but we should keep this in perspective.

(Photo by Bauer-Griffin/GC Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badffc91f0000df0022d2cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In what took Usher most of his 20-year music career to accomplish, it took Justin Bieber just a short five years to reap similar financial success and actually surpass his mentor. Usher Raymond IV was an R&B phenom who started his career much like Bieber as a young teen and is among America's top selling artists. He saw something special in the young star during their initial meetings. But that does not explain the rate in which Bieber shot to fame compared to his current counterparts such as Jason Derulo, Trey Songz and even Chris Brown. In fact, Justin Bieber rose to financial prowess singing R&B/pop music faster than any other black entertainer, ever, despite this being a genre created by their own kin.This is something W.E.B. Du Bois referred to as the ""wages of whiteness"" in his seminal work, Black Reconstruction. The inherent worth and sublime value of white skin privilege (in part) captures that ""something more"" that Usher articulated in reference to Bieber during his 2010 interview with the LA Times. With his unearned privilege, Bieber was able to emulate his black contemporaries and generate massive profits beyond their reach. As his early appearance was that of a clean-cut ""boy-next-door"" from Canada with good looks (and luscious locks) singing pop, he has since morphed his image into the pants-sagging, tattooed ""bad boy,"" suffusing his music with an urban contemporary vibe. This is an attempt at acting cool, and his public ""persona"" is imbedded within popular perceptions of black manhood. Black men and boys are ""onstage"" every day. Their audience, both outside whites as well as other blacks in or outside their communities, can be caught looking in on them, observing how they walk, talk, dress and adapt to their social environments. For whites, these patterns are frequently seen in widespread media portrayals that represent the ""thug life"" and gang banging most often associated with black males. But for blacks, this posing of ""coolness"" becomes a symbol of acceptance among peers. Cool masculinity or ""cool pose,"" according to Majors and Billson, is a way of being for many black males, a performance born out of the stark realities of centuries-old white supremacy and ongoing oppression. Black bodies become the instrument used to hold at bay the anxiety-related troubles brought on by daily insults from members of the dominant group and the institutions they control. This form of ritualized masculinity is typically seen in the sporting world, the hip-hop scene and other spaces where black males congregate. Cool pose is about self-presentation of style -- the art of aloofness and emotional detachment, postulating toughness and strength as acceptable forms of male behavior. But in reality, these narratives revolve around the struggle for self-determination and the validation of manhood.Because blacks have little to no control over their social condition in life, cool pose then is a source of empowerment. It was erected deep within the psychology of black men and boys to assuage the pain and legacy of restricted opportunities from mainstream sources of success to include material wealth and comfort, components of the ""American Dream."" When viewed and labeled by the white world as deviant, deficient, promiscuous, criminal and incompetent, cool provides the smokescreen to hide the torment and anger deep within the soul. This process of self-preservation is accomplished with a distinct style of coping through surface acting, an exhibition of physical actions intended to ward off the harmful effects of white racism and cynicism that can lead to feelings of self-doubt and interpersonal angst. Cool enhances the ego and sense of pride while concealing deep scars of black male group marginalization. Not always done under conscious impulses, but instead involves unconscious thought and actions, it allows some black males to present a hard exterior by showing little or no fear in situations that dictate a dynamic interaction. Cool pose is about the maintenance of rough and tumble masculinity through the demands of living in a black body, enabling black males to develop thick skin through interpersonal strivings to enhance their self-esteem. Cool, then, is a projection of confidence in the midst of insecurity, and being cool brings some semblance of order to life for black males that they might not otherwise have. People are stereotypically drawn to cool black males because they represent vitality, making them instantly marketable. The way black males are casted in the media highlights the aesthetics of cool, rendering it a commodity to be bought and sold by the sports/entertainment industrial complex. But cool came about as a way to survive the harsh brutality and environmental morass of slavery and its lingering effects up until the present day. In a racist society where stigmatized males of color are locked out of virtually every major institution and denied access to jobs, high quality education and decent and affordable health care, all that is left to defend is one's pride, something that many black men lose their lives over daily in some form as a consequence of being cool. Even still, whites have a long history of appropriating coolness, not caring to know its pathogenic origins, particularly in music. Because many whites feel that US society is now ""post racial,"" enabling them to ""get their black on"" without a physical presence in the black community, white label executives package black culture and style through white artists without the burdens of racial disadvantage. Manufacturing coolness for white consumption through the use of black memes is a burgeoning industry, it always has been. This is an important finding when cultivating a white blue-eyed mainstream soul performer touched by African American musical expression and inspiration that lends to their own blending of unique panache. Elvis was one of the original white artists to gain worldwide fame by performing iterations of black music and black ""moves."" In more recent years, Memphis's other native son, Justin Timberlake as well as Eminem, Macklemore and Robin Thicke have all been celebrated for capturing in song or sound the spirit of black music, and they have all made a killing in record sales and digital downloads. But none more than Justin Bieber who's net worth is a reported 200 million dollars. Bieber's most recent release, Journals, is his commitment to that tradition which features a more grown up and urban sound from his syrupy ""Baby"" pop tunes days. But when Bieber is not in the studio laying down tracks for his next project, he has been working his constructed persona, displaying cool pose in the media. Bieber's appeal, couched in his public image of coolness and swagger (i.e., hats, clothing, gold chains, tats, etc.), makes him very marketable indeed. But it is well known that he had little interaction with black folk prior to his musical success (as seen in images of him with his group of all white friends from Canada). Thus, to maximize his believability as an R&B crooner with crossover appeal, Bieber was assigned a ""swagger coach"" to learn the tools of the trade. Ryan Good was hired to refine his image in ways acceptable to white audiences while optimizing coolness. The message -- be cool, but not too black. Representation of blackness as exotic and base, closer to nature and animal-like are racial frames lodged deep in the minds of most white Americans. Because racism is foundational to the American experience, all things associated with blackness has been deemed different, deficient and outside the confines of white normativity. The process works differently, however, when white males perform (musically and physically) black music. These young, white artists are regaled by their fans, earning a legion of global followers and the spoils of fame. The Scooter Brauns of the music industry (the man credited with discovering Bieber) are on the constant lookout for the next white, ""cool"" soul artist to fill the coffers. The intersection of white, male-gendered privilege and their superior position atop of the US racial hierarchy makes these border crossings into black music seamless. When white artists adopt hip-hop or R&B as their preferred art form, they do so from a perspective that is out of context. Hence, another generation of new comers like Austin Mahone, the incarnation of Bieber, can enjoy the benefits of ""acting black"" without shouldering the racial burden of being black."

All you need to do is perform these five exercises when you start to feel sluggish. You will begin to notice a boost in your productivity, improved energy levels and an overall happier mood. Perform each exercise as fast as possible for one minute. If you have 10 minutes, repeat the entire routine. SquatsBenefit: Strengthens and tones quads, glutes and core.1. Stand with feet hip-width apart. Deeply bend both knees and shift hips back until thighs are parallel with the ground. Make sure knees are behind toes and never round your back. Hips will go back like you are sitting in a chair.2. Drive through entire foot to come back to standing. Keep chest up and core tight the entire time. Immediately, switch direction and squat back down to your lowest point. Continue the movement for one minute. Mini-HopsBenefit: Increases heart rate and circulation and helps boost endorphins. 1. Stand with feet hip-width and parallel. Bring both arms out to a 90-degree angle like you are holding a jump rope. Keep arms out as you begin to hop off the balls of your feet. 2.

Continue to alternate, performing standing oblique crunches for one minute.Arm Raises Benefit: Strengthens the shoulders and improves posture. 1. Stand tall with abdominal muscles engaged, shoulder blades drawn together and chest up. Lift arms directly above head, palms facing forward. Bend elbows and draw arms down by your sides.
