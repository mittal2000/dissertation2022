0,POLITICS,House Republicans Air Grievances In Wake Of Boehner's Resignation,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-conference-grievances_us_560bfbefe4b07681270004f4,"GOP members held a ""therapy session"" as the party's leadership remains in question.",2015-09-30,House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (left) and other Republicans met Tuesday to discuss the path forward for the House Republican Conference.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560bfc521900002f00fdec66.jpeg?cache=PqFXvt145z&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- House Republicans took part in a therapy session Tuesday night to vent deep-seated grievances that ultimately led to Speaker John Boehner's departure.The Ohio Republican's decision to resign effective Oct. 30 from the top House post and from his seat in Congress was a clear signal of the widening rift in the Republican Party. Anger among conservative members has fully bloomed as the party heads into an election year in which Republicans will try to gain control of the White House.During the rare evening meeting, Republicans talked for almost two hours in what was described by multiple members afterward as a ""family discussion"" and a ""healing"" process.Coming out of the meeting, Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) said it ""was a good therapy session for our conference"" in which 40 to 50 people spoke. Boehner did not attend.Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), who called for the special conference meeting, added that it was a positive ""high-road discussion.""Still, conservatives and others in the conference have voiced a number of demands in regard to the coming leadership shuffle. Boehner said Wednesday that the leadership elections, including the vote to replace him, would be held behind closed doors on Oct. 8. Later on, the full House will vote on the next speaker. That date has yet to be announced.Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), who is running for the majority whip post, said the meeting was an important step and allowed members to ""hear things from and about each other.""Primary concerns moving forward include how the leadership races will be handled and which procedural tactics Republicans will use when fighting for their core issues. Specifically, Sessions said, a number of members think those who are already in leadership and are running for a different party position should be required to vacate their current post even if they lose the race for the new position.""I think that's fair because I think they will be held accountable that way,"" Sessions said. Conservatives also want House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who is running to replace Boehner as speaker, to offer them more top committee posts and to promise that they will be given more input on bills before they reach the House floor.""I hear that we ought to find a common set of core principles,"" Sessions said, referring to changes members said they want to see. ""I think it's about procedural things that lend themselves to members getting a chance to do what they came up here to do.""Sessions added that members want a return to regular order, meaning bills would go through the specific committees that hold jurisdiction over the given policy and then proceed to the Rules Committee before reaching the floor. Under Boehner's reign, leadership has been known to craft or change legislation behind closed doors and send it immediately to the Rules Committee before putting it on the floor.Exiting the meeting, it was clear that members know the road ahead remains long and that the next speaker and leadership team will first need to find a way to fix the chasm in the conference.""It is intuitively obvious to the most casual observer that this is the biggest problem that we have,"" Sessions said. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post said Rep. Peter Roskam had offered a resolution before the August recess to oust House Speaker John Boehner. The resolution was brought by Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.).Related on HuffPost:"
1,SPORTS,Here's D-Rose's Version Of Events Regarding His Alleged Sexual Assault,Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/derrick-rose-court-document-sexual-assault_us_560be0f5e4b0dd850309e74b,Rose's legal team insists that all acts were consensual.,2015-09-30,Chicago Bull point guard Derrick Rose has been accused of sexually assaulting his ex-girlfriend in August 2013.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560be2351900002f00fdebf6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Court documents released on Tuesday reveal that Derrick Rose and his legal team are attempting to refute accusations that the Chicago Bulls guard drugged and gang-raped his ex-girlfriend two years ago. The defense claims that the allegations were born out of the plaintiff's monetary interests and her anger over Rose's later unresponsiveness.First reported by TMZ, the documents (viewable below) admit that Rose engaged in ""group activities"" with the accuser and his two co-defendants in August 2013, but ask that the case be dismissed on the grounds that the sexual acts in question were consensual. The documents contend that “Jane Doe” only became upset “weeks or months” after the event, when Rose “wasn’t responsive enough to her texts"" and she wasn’t reimbursed for “one of the sex toys she purchased and used [the] day and night"" of the alleged incident. The defense also claims the plaintiff invited Rose and his co-defendants into her apartment, “welcome[ing] them” before agreeing to “additional group activities later that evening.” The accuser's legal team has previously alleged that Rose and his co-defendants entered her home without permission.In an attempt to provide further proof that these events were above board, the court filing explicitly links what Rose's legal team sees as the consensual, non-injurious nature of the acts to the fact that the plaintiff “had coffee with her roommate the next morning before heading to work for a full work shift.”The arguments presented essentially attempt to shift the case to one based on a question of monetary exchange rather than one of sexual assault. Rose's lawyer Lisa Cohen has previously responded to accusations by stating that ""the plaintiff’s allegations are completely false and without any factual basis ... The plaintiff expressed no complaints about Mr. Rose until various lawyers began to surface and demand that the plaintiff be paid millions of dollars.""The documents end with a demand for trial by jury. According to the AP, a scheduling conference for the case will take place on Nov. 9. Also on HuffPost:"
2,POLITICS,"Americans Love 'Death Panels.' Sorry, Sarah Palin!",Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americans-love-death-panels_us_560aa886e4b0768126ff24a5,Pretty much everybody thinks doctors should get paid to talk to you about your end-of-life options.,2015-09-30,"Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) famously equated an end-of-life planning proposal to a ""death panel"" in 2009.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560aad4b1b00002f00dfdc89.jpeg?cache=yFC3njqkkj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Despite the best efforts of politicians like former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R), more than 8 in 10 Americans think it's just fine for Medicare and private health insurance companies to pay doctors for end-of-life counseling, a new poll shows.According to survey results published Wednesday by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 81 percent of respondents believe Medicare should pay for these discussions, and 83 percent think health insurance companies should do so. Doctors' groups including the American Medical Association, seniors' groups like the AARP, and patient organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association have long endorsed end-of-life counseling sessions between patients and their physicians, and they support Medicare and insurance coverage of these consultations.Discussing treatment options in advance with a physician can help patients declare their wishes while they're still healthy -- such as whether they want intensive medical care at the end of their lives -- and helps ensure their families don't have to make those decisions without their input. When Congress was writing the Affordable Care Act in 2009, Palin infamously equated an end-of-life counseling proposal to a government ""death panel"" that would decide how long elderly and sick people would be allowed to live, leading to its removal from the legislation. PolitiFact later deemed Palin's statement the ""Lie of the Year,"" although this didn't stop her from reviving the charge in July, when the federal government brought back the plan in a proposed regulation. Enabling Medicare to pay doctors for their time is ""bribing"" them, Palin wrote on Facebook.Under the pending federal rule, physicians who treat Medicare patients would be allowed to bill the program when they discuss end-of-life planning, which ranges from helping a person decide if they wish to receive intensive medical treatments near the end of their life to spelling out what limitations they prefer. Currently, a doctor only gets paid if she and a patient talk about end-of-life planning during the patient's initial physical upon enrolling in Medicare. However, just paying doctors probably won't be enough to get more people to plan for the ends of their lives, the Kaiser Family Foundation survey's other findings suggest. Even though 89 percent of respondents said doctors should have this conversation with patients -- and just 9 percent said they shouldn't -- only 17 percent of people reported having done so. And 4 in 10 of those who haven't yet had the discussion said they didn't want to. That's despite the survey also showing that 84 percent of people would be comfortable talking to their doctors about the topic."
3,POLITICS,Ted Kennedy Thought Harry Reid Didn't Do Enough On Immigration Reform In 2007,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-kennedy-interview-immigration_us_560c40fbe4b076812700744e,"A just-released interview shows that he wasn't impressed by other senators, either.",2015-09-30,"Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) right, and Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) center, look on as then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) addresses immigration reform on May 9, 2007. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) largely blamed Senate Democrats for the failure of immigration reform in 2007, according to an interview released on Wednesday.In the October 2007 interview, given to the Miller Center at the University of Virginia for an oral history of his career, Kennedy painted a bleak picture of the Senate's lackluster efforts to pass immigration reform, one of his main legislative priorities before his death in 2009. He even predicted it would ""take another 45 years for someone else to get this thing passed"" after his immigration bill died in 2007. Kennedy criticized Republican opposition as well as a ""constantly tentative"" response from Democratic leadership, reserving particularly harsh words for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). ""[Reid] was never really interested in it until the very end, and at the very end it was too late,"" Kennedy said, according to a transcript posted by the Miller Center. The center on Wednesday released a series of interviews with Kennedy that took place between 2005 and 2008, in partnership with the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the Senate in Boston.Kennedy accused Reid, then the majority leader, along with top Senate Democrats Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and ""to some extent"" Dick Durbin (Ill.), of focusing on the wrong things, such as whether they could avoid being ""snookered"" with a bad bill and whether blaming Republicans for the failure to pass reform would help Democrats win Latino votes.""We want to do this enough so that we can get the Hispanic votes, but not enough so that we get our people caught in it,"" Kennedy said, describing the thinking of Democratic leadership. Kennedy's criticisms of the reform effort weren't limited to Reid, Schumer and Durbin. He said that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), then the minority leader, had ""absolutely no intention of doing anything but sinking the bill."" A spokesman for McConnell did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the interview, Kennedy also described then-Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), who worked with him on the bill, as ""knowledgeable"" and ""forceful,"" but said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) was ""very troublesome"" in meetings. He accused many others of being absent from the process, including then-Sen. Barack Obama, who Kennedy said was ""somewhat interested"" in an earlier effort to pass reform in 2006, but ""not around the second time because he was also running for president.""Overall, Kennedy said, immigration, civil rights and gay rights brought out ""the worst in terms of the functions of the Senate.""""Immigration starts out as reasonably sanitized, and then -- as we have seen recently, in 2006 and 2007 -- basically deteriorates into racist amendments and racism on the floor of the Senate,"" the Massachusetts senator lamented.""It’s been dressed a different way, but I’ve said that it’s the same music we heard in the early ’60s with different words,"" he added.Kennedy wasn't around for something that might have redeemed many of the senators he criticized: the comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013. That bill was championed by Reid and drafted by the so-called gang of eight: Durbin and Schumer along with Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) Before the bill passed, Reid gave a floor speech saying he knew Kennedy ""is looking at us proudly and loudly."" The bill never got a vote in the House of Representatives, as a spokeswoman for Reid noted to The New York Times when reached for comment about Kennedy's remarks. Reid is retiring at the end of his term as a champion of the immigration reform community, in spite of the tensions that followed the 2007 effort. Reid's office did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment. However, Schumer spokesman Matt House similarly defended the Democratic leadership's commitment to immigration reform. “As Senator Kennedy said, Republicans had 'absolutely no intention of doing anything but sinking the bill,'"" he told HuffPost, referencing what Kennedy said about McConnell in the interview. ""Still, Democrats put their full weight behind trying to get a bill passed in 2007, and eventually Senator Schumer helped lead the gang of eight to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate six years later."""
4,MEDIA,Vatican Watcher Scooped National Media On Pope Francis Meeting Kim Davis,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-davis-pope-francis-meeting_us_560be61ae4b0af3706dea690,"""There was no desire on the part of the Vatican to cause her to be part of a media circus.""",2015-09-30,"Pope Francis met with controversial Kentucky clerk Kim Davis during his visit to the U.S., Inside the Vatican first reported.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560bedc41900002f00fdec1d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Several thousand journalists recently covered Pope Francis' historic visit to the United States -- and yet, his meeting with controversial Kentucky clerk Kim Davis remained a secret until two days after the pontiff left the country. Robert Moynihan, who first reported the news Tuesday night for Inside the Vatican, a magazine he launched in 1993, met Davis in her Washington hotel room shortly after her Sept. 24 meeting with Francis, but sat on the scoop for days as the pope's trip made headlines. Indeed, Moynihan, who earned his Ph.D. in medieval studies from Yale, has reported on the Vatican since the late 1980s, and lives part-time in Rome. He's served as a TV commentator on Vatican issues and wrote a 2013 book on Francis. In an interview, he told The Huffington Post he had no qualms about holding the news. ""I think it was respectful of Kim, who’s been through a lot,"" Moynihan said of Davis, whose refusal to adhere to the law and sign marriage certificates for same-sex couples has made her a polarizing figure in America. ""There was no desire on the part of the Vatican to cause her to be part of a media circus during the middle of the pope’s trip."" The Vatican, he said, wanted the meeting with Davis to be ""personal,"" rather than ""polemical or ideological."" Moynihan declined to discuss exactly how he ended up speaking to Davis or speculate as to why she chose him to speak to first. In Tuesday night's report, Moynihan wrote that the Francis-Davis exchange ""was, arguably, the most significant meeting, symbolically, of the entire trip."" For that reason, he wrote, ""it should, therefore, be brought to the attention of the public, both in the Church, and in the secular world."" Moynihan wrote that Davis told him about her meeting with Francis shortly after it occurred, though he did not specify where or when she gave the account:“The Pope spoke in English,” she told me. “There was no interpreter. ‘Thank you for your courage,’ Pope Francis said to me. I said, ‘Thank you, Holy Father.’ I had asked a monsignor earlier what was the proper way to greet the Pope, and whether it would be appropriate for me to embrace him, and I had been told it would be okay to hug him. So I hugged him, and he hugged me back. It was an extraordinary moment. ‘Stay strong,’ he said to me. Then he gave me a rosary as a gift, and he gave one also to my husband, Joe. I broke into tears. I was deeply moved.""Liberty Counsel, a legal organization representing Davis, sent out a release Tuesday night that linked to Moynihan's report. Several news outlets also linked to Inside the Vatican's site, causing it to crash several times. The Vatican confirmed Wednesday that a meeting took place, but did not elaborate on the details. Mat Staver, a Liberty Counsel lawyer, told Time magazine that he, Davis and Vatican Embassy officials began discussing a possible meeting on Sept. 14. The Sept. 24 meeting lasted about 15 minutes, prior to the pope flying from Washington to New York. Through Liberty Counsel spokeswoman Charla Bansley, Staver told HuffPost that Liberty Counsel was involved in setting up the meeting between Davis and Moynihan.Davis presumably could've chosen any major media outlet to tell her story to, and spoke to ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday. When asked why she spoke to Moynihan, Staver said it was because ""Inside the Vatican covers the Vatican.""Staver declined to offer additional details. ""No more comment on the details of how or who,"" he said in response to a follow-up email from HuffPost. ""What is important is that the meeting did occur.""Though news of the meeting didn't break until Tuesday night, Francis appeared to offer support for Davis' actions on Sunday night without mentioning her by name. ABC News' Terry Moran asked Francis if he would support individuals, including government officials, who refuse to carry out duties such as issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples if they believe doing so violates their religious liberty.Francis said that ""conscientious objection is a right that is a part of every human right."" When Moran asked if his response includes government officials, Francis responded that, indeed, ""it is a human right.""Moynihan said he believed ""the pope has a profound, almost limitless respect for the conscience of others, because it’s the most intimate and deliberate part of a person’s personhood.""""To oppose and constrain a person’s conscience,"" he added, ""is an act of violence against a person's personhood or a person’s soul."""

The Wristly survey suggests some investors may have underestimated the timepiece's profitability, founder Bernard Desarnauts said.""There is quite a positive uplift,"" he said.A spokesman for Apple declined to comment on the survey.Since launching in March, shortly before the Apple Watch hit stores, Wristly has invited people who buy the gadget to participate in a regular survey about their experiences.The average selling price was calculated by combining survey results on the model, size and number of bands respondents purchased.Extra weight was given to the responses of women, who are underrepresented in Wristly's panel, and the firm excluded responses from buyers of the watch in its first eight weeks on the market, finding they spent more than later shoppers.The survey revealed men spend $30 more on the watch than women, who opt for the less expensive smaller size. Accessories can add considerably to the bill, with 40 percent of customers springing for a spare band as of August.Wristly's research comes with a few caveats: The results only reflect buyers in North America, Europe and Oceania, and the panel skews to the wealthy.But the company's findings track closely with figures Apple has disclosed about how much owners wear the watch. And Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has publicly cited the firm's findings about the Apple Watch's high rates of customer satisfaction.Investors have grappled with a lack of information about the Apple Watch since its debut. Apple lumped sales of the watch in with figures for products such as the iPod and Beats headphones.While most analysts initially expected the watch to reach an average selling price of more than $500, many lowered their figures to about $450 after Apple's opaque reporting in July.Analyst Daniel Ives of FBR Capital Markets said Wristly's findings reinforce his view that the Apple Watch will one day make a meaningful contribution to Apple's bottom line.""At this point it's not moving the needle, but it could have a slightly positive impact in fiscal year 2016 as sales start to ramp up,"" he said.(Reporting by Julia Love in San Francisco; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)  Also on HuffPost:"

I don’t find it offensive. Native American tribes generally don’t find it offensive.”The former Florida governor cited an NCAA decision allowing Florida State University to retain their nickname, the Seminoles, to explain his reasoning.“We had a similar kind of flap with FSU, if you recall, the Seminoles. And the Seminole tribe itself kind of came to the defense of the university and it subsided,” he said. “It’s a sport, for crying out loud. It’s a football team. Washington has a huge fan base -- I’m missing something here, I guess.”The ""Seminoles"" is the name of an actual tribe -- which endorsed the nickname in 2005, according to The New York Times. But the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma passed a resolution in 2013 condemning ""the use of all American Indian sports team mascots in the public school system, by college and university level and by professional teams,” The Nation reported.President Barack Obama and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) last year called on Washington's NFL team to change its name. A federal judge also ordered the cancellation of its federal trademark registrations, calling the name offensive to Native Americans.While a majority of Americans agrees with Bush that the team should keep its name, young people are significantly more likely to find the moniker disparaging to Native Americans.Bush's statement that Native American tribes ""generally don't find it offensive"" has also been called into question. The team's owner, Dan Snyder, frequently cites an Associated Press survey from 2004 to make the same point. But other studies have since found that Native Americans do indeed find the name offensive."

I don't think that's going to be Donald Trump,"" he said.The governor reflected on his failed 2012 presidential bid, lamenting that he and his party weren't able to effectively communicate the conservative message to minorities.""Darn it, I wish I could do that properly,"" he said.

11,BUSINESS,Gender Equality Won't Just Change Women's Lives -- It'll Change Everyone's,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gender-equality-wont-just-change-womens-lives_us_560a8ea2e4b0dd850309180b,"""We should think of this not as a women's problem, but as a care problem.""",2015-09-30,"Anne-Marie Slaughter, president and chief executive officer of the New America Foundation, speaks during the Aspen Ideas Festival in Aspen, Colorado, U.S., on Tuesday, July 1, 2014. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560aa76f1b00003000dfdc7c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What would the world be like if we achieved true equality for women? The global economy might be stronger, for one thing. But such a shift would need to come with trade-offs -- adjusting traditional gender roles and modifying public policies to support a balanced family life.A recent report from McKinsey & Company estimated that if women were to achieve economic parity with men across the world -- meaning they worked the same hours and made the same amount of money in total -- the resulting economic output would add $28 trillion in global gross domestic product per year.What the report doesn't mention, however, is who would take over the vast amount of unpaid labor that women around the world do for their households and families on a daily basis. True, women aren't the only ones who raise children, care for aging parents and sick relatives or do the cooking and cleaning; but globally, women are still the default caregivers in many places. If more women choose to pursue careers and professional leadership roles, more men also need to step into the role of caregiver. On top of that, governments and employers must recognize the importance of caregiving and provide benefits that encourage it. This is the point of foreign policy expert Anne Marie Slaughter's new book, Unfinished Business , a follow-up to her seminal 2012 Atlantic piece, ""Why Women Still Can’t Have It All."" At a book launch event Monday night hosted by the New America Foundation, where Slaughter serves as CEO, the author spoke to former New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn about what Slaughter calls the ""infrastructure of care."" In the U.S., this infrastructure barely exists. It used to be maintained largely by the women who stayed home. As women have gone into the workforce, families have had to patch together a way to take care of young children and ageing parents -- with less and less time to spare.""We need an equal infrastructure of care: a set of arrangements and institutions that allows citizens to flourish not only in the pursuit of their individual goals but also in their relationships to one another,"" Slaughter wrote in her book.We build and maintain roads as a society because we recognize that most people will need to use them. Why, she asked, do we not provide ""high-quality paid care"" for those who need it: the young, the sick and the elderly? Both women and men, she argued on Monday, must manage to balance their work and their families in a world where the workday is never really over, paid family leave is not a guarantee and childcare often costs more than rent. ""We should think of this not as a women's problem, but as a care problem,"" Slaughter said at the event.She added that while men need to step into larger family roles if there is going to be more equality at work, reworking society is a policy problem that goes far beyond the struggles of ambition in wealthy families. People across the class spectrum need more support than they currently get for caregiving.Slaughter mentions in her book that one of the most progressive organizations when it comes to subsidizing care is, ironically, the Pentagon. The Department of Defense provides on-site day care for children of the men and women who work there. They also pay the day care employees just as well as other employes. ""[T]he part of the U.S. government most directly responsible for upholding national security recognizes the need to pay wages that can attract and retain college- and graduate-school-educated workers to provide care and early learning to the children of all employees from birth onward,"" she wrote.Indeed, Slaughter said in both the book and at Monday's talk that she believes the care of young children is important enough to rise to the level of a national security issue.""Children's brains are shaped most in the first five years of their lives, so it's not an exaggeration to say that the care and education of our children from birth to age five is a national security issue,"" she wrote in her book.

""Let us remember that we live in a loving community, and let us not be discouraged by such things,"" it said. ""As Saint Serra said, 'Always look forward, never back.'""The Franciscan missionary is remembered by admirers as the ""Apostle of California,"" but he is accused by Native Americans of helping to eradicate their culture. Serra arrived in what is now San Diego in 1769 and founded nine of the 21 Spanish missions that grew into modern-day California. Many streets and buildings in the most populous U.S. state bear his name.Critics say Serra essentially imprisoned Native Americans in closed communities, where he suppressed their cultures and had them beaten as he tried to indoctrinate them in Roman Catholic beliefs and customs. Supporters acknowledge corporal punishment was used but contend it was common practice at the time.His canonization by the pope at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception last Wednesday was the first canonization ceremony carried out on U.S. soil.Francis, who was born in Argentina, said on a summer visit to Latin America that ""many grave sins"" had been committed against Native American people in God's name, but insisted last week that Serra had stood up for his missions' residents.Also On HuffPost:"
13,ENTERTAINMENT,Aaron Sorkin Slams Sony Hack As 'Terrorism',Joe Satran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aaron-sorkin-sony-hack_us_560ad83ce4b0dd85030965f4,"The screenwriter says the press became ""an eager accomplice to terrorism"" by publishing hacked emails.",2015-09-29,"Columbia Pictures World Premiere of ""The Interview""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560aea431800002a008313c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Aaron Sorkin is still mad about the Sony hack.Almost a year has passed since a group of hackers tied to the North Korean government infiltrated Sony Pictures' servers to steal thousands of confidential emails, which they then released to the press. Sorkin -- the prolific screenwriter behind such modern classics as ""The West Wing"" and ""The Social Network"" -- was an early, aggressive critic of the hack and the response to it in the media and in Hollywood. And his feelings about the matter apparently haven't softened with time.This week, while promoting his upcoming biopic ""Steve Jobs"" in London, Sorkin tore into the hackers, and the journalists who published their loot, yet again. ""The worst part was seeing the American press as a willing accomplice, an eager accomplice to terrorism. I don’t know how these reporters who printed the stuff can look at themselves in the morning,"" Sorkin said in a roundtable discussion hosted by The Hollywood Reporter. Sorkin has been scornful of the state of U.S. media -- his HBO series ""The Newsroom"" was essentially a three-season-long critique of journalism today. But he also had harsh words for Sony's fellow movie studios, whose response to the hack was notably tepid. ""It was a sad moment for Hollywood, it really was, a terrible, terrible moment,"" Sorkin said. The Sony hack was initially thought of -- both inside and outside the company -- as little more than a nuisance, albeit a particularly embarrassing one for some of the biggest names in Hollywood. (Including Sorkin.)But the affair escalated to an international incident in mid-December, when a group calling themselves Guardians of Peace took credit for the hack, saying that it had been motivated by the upcoming release of Sony Pictures' North Korea satire ""The Interview."" They threatened mass violence if the movie made it to theaters, specifically mentioning Sept. 11, and many screenings were canceled. So Sorkin is by no means exaggerating when he describes it as terrorism -- though it's also the case that when the hack first emerged, and the press began writing about it, the extent of the menace was not yet clear.
